northern and central portion of australium and as these journal have hitherto only be partially publish in a fragmentary form and be now out of print it have be deem desirable to collect the material into one volume for convenience of reference and to place on permanent record some of the earlier attempt to penetrate the terra incognita which then constitute so vast a portion of the australian continent although during the twenty-two year which have elapse since the last of these expedition be undertake the geographical knowledge of australium have so far advance as to fill in most of the detail of its physical feature and set at rest the speculative opinion and theory of early explorer it have not be deem desirable to alter or amend the impression or view record at the time but simply

1846 early condition of west australium the colony of western australium be establish in 1829 but its isolation from the older settlement of new south wale render it necessary to import all the horse cattle and sheep by sailing vessel from tasmanium or other remote source while the heavy loss and difficulty attend long sea voyage prevent any large importation of stock -- so that though there be a fair rate of increase the flock and herd of the settler have find sufficient pasturage for the first ten year on the bank of the swan river and its upper valley the avon together with the coast district southward to the vasse inlet but after 1840 the stock-owner begin to feel that all prospect of material increase must be relinquish unless additional pasture could be discover several public as well as private expedition be undertake for the purpose of ascertain whether in the interior or along the coast on either side of the settlement there exist any available country but they have only encounter dense scrub of acacia and eucalyptus with salt marsh and scarcity of fresh water in the interior the coast to the east have be traverse from adelaide to king george 's sound by mr eyre and find to be altogether unfit for settlement while to the north the coast present a series of sandy plain for more than 200 mile it may now appear extraordinary that the earlier explorer in australium be so frequently unsuccessful in they endeavor to penetrate the interior but the scarcity of suitable horse the unsuitable character of the saddlery cumbersome camp equipment and deficiency of knowledge regard the season in the interior all combine to defeat the first explorer in district which have since be traverse with comparative facility in 1846 the known country have become so nearly stock to the full extent of its capability that the lead question of interest with the settler be where new run could be discover and among many other the messr gregory propose to attempt the further exploration of the interior messr ac and ft gregory who be attach to the department of the surveyor-general apply for three month ' leave of absence for the purpose but it be eventually arrange that the expedition should be under the auspices of the government which provide four horse and vote 5 pound for the purchase of equipment the remainder be supply at private expense the party consist of ac

's ride bring we to bolgart spring after a absence of forty-seven day during which we have travel 953 mile traverse three degree of latitude and nearly four and a half of longitude the discovery of coal and country available for settlement on the coast to the north of swan river be deem to be of such importance that the government dispatch lieutenant helpman in the colonial schooner champion to procure a sufficient quantity of the coal to admit of its be practically test as to quality and also to ascertain what facility exist for its conveyance to a port for shipment a volunteer party consist of lieutenant irby dr meekleham messr gregory and hazlewood accompany lieutenant helpman to champion bay now the site of geraldton and thence by land to the coal-seam on the irwin river a distance of ninety mile and bring down about half a ton of coal to the vessel this coal though of fair quality and suitable for steam purpose prove however to be so remote from any suitable port for shipment that it have hitherto not be available for commercial purpose the primary object of the voyage have be attain it be consider desirable to avail of the opportunity to examine the country to the northward and ascertain its capability for settlement for though captain now sir george gray have see some good country on he journey along the coast from gantheaume bay to swan river in 1839 captain stoke who land from the beagle subsequently and ascend wizard peak about twelve mile inland have distinctly negatived the existence of any country capable of occupation though as a illustration of the difficulty of ascertain the real capability of country by partial and hurry inspection it may be observe that this have since become one of the most prosperous district of western australium in regard to its pastoral agricultural and mining industry for the purpose of make this examination of the country messr ac gregory hc gregory and lieutenant irby take three horse and three day ' provision leave champion bay on the 20th December the follow be a copy of the journal : -- 20th December 1846 at 620 be leave the bivouac and follow the shore of champion bay about a mile northerly then steer 87 degree over a scrubby country at 720 cross the chapman river and at 80 be a quarter of a mile north from mount fairfax alter the course to 66 degree the country be thinly cover with wattle scrub and some grass at 845 cross a large branch of the chapman with several small pool of water in the bed the country beyond be more scrubby and the soil gravelly at 90 change the course to 18 degree and at 920 again cross the chapman river just below a pool of apparently permanent water at 950 cross a granite ridge beyond which the country improve with many large patch of grass to the eastward at 1020 ascend a high flat-topped hill of red sandstone rest on granite which prove to be the eastern point of moresby 's flat-topped range from this hill mount fairfax and wizard hill be visible to the east grassy hill rise gradually from the chapman river for seven or eight mile steer 10 degree over grassy country the soil be compose of detritus of granite and trap rock at 110 come on a large party of native some of whom accompany we for about a mile point out place where we should find water at noon turn to the north-east and enter a extensive valley with some patch of grass but not generally of a good character at 1230 pm cross a small watercourse trend west follow it about half a mile and then steer north-west over scrubby flat till 10 when we strike a small stream-bed with small pool of water and halt till 120 and then follow up the stream to the north till 30 when we bivouac 21st December at 635 be steer north over a hilly country with scrub grass york-gum and wattle -- the prevail rock red sandstone quartz and granite at 830 cross a stream-bed with pool of brackish water trend east and at 850 enter a good grassy country which appear to extend ten to twelve mile to the east and north -- clump of york-gum jam-wattle and sandalwood be observe on some of the hill after cross several small watercourse at 945 ascend a elevated sandy tableland cover with coarse scrub and at 1035 not see any prospect of better country change the course to west and follow down a deep gully at 117 come to a small pool of salt water follow the watercourse south-south-west at 1125 come to a small hole dig by the native in which the water be fresh though the pool above and below be salt halt till nearly 10 pm resume a westerly course cross several deep grassy valley trend south at 135 steer 211 degree over a hilly quartz and granite country with very good grass at 230 again come on the stream-bed the country improve and well-grassed with scattered jam and black wattle tree as far as the country be visible at 350 the stream be join by a branch from the east and follow it to the west-north-west till 50 bivouac in the bed of the stream water be obtain by digging in the sand 22nd December at 635 be steer 220 degree over a fine grassy country at 70 ascend a small ironstone hill from which we observe a deep valley trend to the south-west to the north and west the country be open and grassy for twelve mile present at one view fifty or sixty thousand acre of fine sheep pasture continue a south-west course over granite country with some good grass but not equal to that see the previous day at 80 cross a small stream-bed which we assume to be the bowe river of captain gray we ascend steep limestone hill on the west bank and from the summit observe the large white sand patch on point moore bear 170 degree turn south three-quarter of a mile cross the bowe river at its mouth which be choke up with sand we then steer south-east with the intention of follow captain gray 's route to champion bay but after traverse sandy downs with limestone rock for four mile one of the horse become so footsore that we descend a deep ravine to the sea-beach which be follow southerly and after cross the dry mouth of the buller and chapman river reach the landing place in champion bay at 110 pm on the 23rd the party and horse be ship on board the champion and reach fremantle on the 28th \*\*\* the settler ' expedition to the northward from perth under mr assistant-surveyor ac gregory 1848 as the stock belong to the settler on the swan river have increase to the full extent of the pastoral capability of the known available country it become of press importance to push forward the exploration of the colony of west australium and accordingly in 1848 the surveyor-general captain roe conduct a expedition to the south-east of swan river while the settler organise one to proceed to the north and make application to the government to grant the service of mr assistant-surveyor ac gregory as the leader of the party the settler ' expedition to the northward from perth under mr assistant-surveyor ac gregory we could not do justice to the enterprise and exertion of the gentleman who discover the new tract of good land to the northward in any other way than by give mr augustus gregory 's journal entire : -- instruction to leader of the expedition and its object colonial secretary 's office perth August 28 1848 sir i be direct by the governor to inform you that you have be appoint to direct the explore expedition about to proceed northwards on account of the zeal energy and enterprising spirit that have be exhibit by you on other occasion and call into action with credit to yourself and advantage to the public interest the party under you direction it be intend should proceed northward as high as the gascoyne river -lrb- the gascoyne river flow into shark bay in latitude 24 degree 52 minute south -rrb- it be advisable to approach that river from the eastward about 100 mile from the coast after proceed in a north-easterly and northerly direction from the country abreast of champion bay it be desirable that part of you route which lie farthest in the interior country should be first accomplish in order to avail yourself of the best chance of finding water you will examine that river as far as it may be practicable to do with the view of trace its course of ascertain if possible the nature of the bar at the mouth of it and the question of its be practicable for boat to what distance from the bar and the nature of the soil in the vicinity of either bank after have examine thus the gascoyne river you will proceed in a southerly direction and examine the river as yet unnamed about forty mile farther south that flow into shark 's bay the mouth of which be see by captain gray and be place by he at point long should you proceed along the sea-shore for any distance you will pay as much attention as you limited means will allow you to do to the peculiarity of the coast and of any estuary creek or roadstead that may present themselves you will bear in mind that the primary object of this expedition be the examination of a new tract of unknown country for practical purpose by practical man -- that in fact the discovery of new land of a available kind for pasture have become a thing to be desire of paramount importance and a object in the attainment of which the interest and perhaps the fate of this colony depend you will thus conduct you expedition with the view of promote this principal object to the best of you ability but it be hardly needful to observe to you that this chief object may be promote and attain without neglect to observe the geographical geological and mineralogical feature of the country you pass through its production -- animal and vegetable and the character dialect and custom to some extent of the aboriginal tribe you may fall in with you have be so frequently employ in explore expedition though of minor importance perhaps to the present that you must be well aware it be no less impolitic than cruel to come into actual collision wantonly unadvisedly and maliciously with the native and on the contrary that it be no less humane than politic to leave no angry recollection of white people where the footstep of traveller however few and far between must be expect to follow yours should you route either in proceed on the expedition or return be in the direction of that part of the irwin river where for the discovery of coal the colony be indebted to yourself and brother it would be desirable that you should devote a short time to the examination of the locality where it be first find to excavation to some moderate extent in the vicinity of the vein of coal of most promise and above all to the ascertainment of the fact if coal crop out or if there be in the soil any indication of it between the place where the mine be discover by you in 1846 and the seashore in that intervene space of about thirty-eight or forty mile or to the northward of it in the direction of shark 's bay where dr von somner think the coal-seam of the irwin might again make its appearance in the event of accident occasion loss of provision and beast of burden and a necessity arise for a prompt return to the settle district you will bear in mind the cause of impediment on the march which prove so disastrous to captain gray 's party on its return from gantheaume bay the want of vigilance at night manifest in another expedition in the murder of lieutenant eyre 's european companion and the want of caution forgetfulness of the nature of barbarian and the facility for ambush afford by a wilderness of tree and jungle that have lead to injury fatal to life as in the case of mr cunningham in sir thoma mitchell 's expedition and of two of he companion at another time and in some instance as in those of captain stoke and captain gray that have lead to result all but fatal to the explorer and they expedition injury suddenly and unexpectedly inflict on individual straggle from the main body of they party or venture considerable distance in advance of it you be to bear in mind that it might be of some advantage throughout you expedition to keep a register of the depths at which water have be find by you and of those depths to which you have penetrate in vain for it it will be requisite that you should ascertain the course of river of any magnitude and direction of chain of high land that you may meet with and follow the same to some extent -- at least wherever appearance may lead you to expect improvement of soil a richer country or one indicate mineral production in the event of occurrence of unexpected disaster impediment and unavoidable accident arise from loss of provision or of horse or of any injury to the health or strength of the party render it utterly impracticable for the expedition to proceed as high northward as gascoyne river you discretion then supply whatever you may be unprovided for in you instruction you will explore as far as it be possible for you to do on you return the country north of the settle district of york and toodyay so that something of utility may be accomplish and the great object for which this expedition be prepare may not be wholly frustrated i be further to add that he excellency 's best wish accompany you party and that the success of the expedition and the return of all engage in it in health and safety will be hail by he with very lively satisfaction i have the honor to be sir you obedient servant rr madden colonial secretary to ac gregory esquire perth general report of journey perth November 20 1848 sir i have the honor to transmit for the information of he excellency the governor the follow outline of the proceedings of the explore party to the northward which he excellency have be please to place under my direction i regret that we have not succeed in reach the gascoyne river which you instruction for my guidance point out as the ultimate object of the expedition but i trust that we attempt to render the expedition serviceable to the colony have not prove unsuccessful especially as the result have be the discovery of several fine portion of good grassy land near champion bay which with the more minute examination of the country in the vicinity which have be previously discover will render available a tract of pasturage sufficiently extensive to relieve the present overstocked district the estimate quantity of land suitable for depasture sheep be about 225000 acre exclusive of 100000 acre on the irwin the greater portion of which however be better suit to agricultural purpose the observation i have have the opportunity of make during this journey have confirm my previous opinion that could the party have start in July instead of September the chief obstacle to we progress -- the want of water -- might have be avoid and although there would have be many minor difficulty to encounter i feel assure that the same zeal and energy which enable my party to contend so long with the obstacle which oppose they advance to the gascoyne river would have ensure they success in a more favourable season the gentleman who form my party have my sincere thanks for they prompt and energetic co-operation on all occasion nor can i omit to mention the cheerful and trustworthy conduct of private w king of the 96th regiment for minute detail i beg to refer my journal and the plan of my route which i be plot i have the honor to be sir you obedient servant ac gregory assistant-surveyor the honorable the colonial secretary etc journal leave the settle district stampede of horse 2nd September 1848 start for toodyay with mr cf gregory and five horse for the expedition to shark 's bay bivouac at worrilloo 3rd September proceed to toodyay where messr l burge j walcott and a bedart join on the 4th bring six horse with they have have the horse shoe at ferguson 's we continue we journey to mr lefroy 's station near bebano which we reach on the 7th the follow day the cart with we provision etc arrive accompany by private w king have obtain another horse from mr lefroy on the 9th we leave welb with ten pack and two ride horse carry three month ' provision etc steer north by west for the first twenty mile generally grassy we enter the extensive sandy plain which occupy almost the whole country between the moore and irwin river the rainy season have scarcely end we find both water and grass for we horse every night and not meeting with any serious impediment we reach the upper part of the arrowsmith brook on the 13th here the country improve and the valley in which the stream take its rise be estimate to contain about 10000 acre of tolerable sheep pasture early the ensue day we enter the irwin plain cross the eastern branch of the river we encamp on the 15th on the northern branch three-quarter of a mile below the spot where the coal be first discover the irwin plain present a beautiful aspect be cover with rich grass and vegetation the soil be generally good but most of the grass be of the annual species would not afford good pasturage in the summer and in consequence they be better suit for agriculture while the open character of the country would render clearing for the plough a matter of little expense while dinner be prepare the horse be herd suddenly start off at full speed in consequence of a large stone roll down by one of the party in ascend the hill two of the remain horse be immediately saddle and mr burge and myself start to catch they in about a mile we come up with they at the foot of a almost perpendicular cliff on see we they start off and scramble up the rock like goat leave we far behind we do not overtake they for several mile when with some difficulty we capture one but have the mortification of lose one of the saddle horse in exchange leave the capture horse in charge of mr burge i follow the rest catch another after a smart ride of three mile but it be not till i reach the east irwin that i could again overtake the rest when favor by the steep bank of the stream i succeed in secure we truant steed it be now dark and be unable to manage nine horse by myself i tethered several of the wildest and start with two of the best for the encampment ten mile distant which owe to the nature of the country i do not reach till midnight mr burge have arrive about a hour previous with the horse first catch light shower in the morning 16th September messr bedart c gregory and j walcott start to bring in the horse the rest of the party be employ in repair damages of the harness and at 30 pm the party return with the horse slight shower in the morning 17th September -lrb- Sunday -rrb- light cloud from the south-west thunder rain in the evening read prayer 18th September leave the bivouac at 815 be and follow upward the main branch of the irwin to the north-north-east through a steep and rocky valley the sandstone hill in some part approach the river so as to render it necessary to cross frequently with the pack-horse the very level character of the summit of these hill give the country the appearance of have be once a plain through which the valley of the stream have since be worn by the action of water the upper stratum be a hard red sandstone rest on a softer rock of a sandy or clayey character beneath which the shale and rock belong to the coal formation show themselves lie in unconformable bed and often at a very high angle at 925 the stream divide into two branch that to the east be the most considerable at this spot the sandstone cease and we commence ascend the granite range the direction of which be about north-north-west the soil be poor and stony produce a little feed for stock but it could scarcely be make available as the country be completely cover with thicket of acacia of small growth at 4 pm bivouac on a small watercourse run through a level grassy flat bound on both side by thicket of wattle scrubby country north from the irwin river 19th September at 815 be steer a nearly north course through a country of the same description as yesterday cross several small gully trend west in some of which a little water still remain at 420 pm halted for the night at a brackish pool in a small gully trend west 20th September start at 80 be continue a northerly course over a similar description of country as during the past two day cross three large gully come from the eastward but apparently near they source at 345 halt on a large stream-bed with a few brackish or rather salt pool in its sandy channel which be in some place nearly 100 yard wide from we encampment we observe a very remarkable peaked hill distant about twenty mile and from its outline conjecture it to be compose of the same vein of trap-rock as that which form similar range further to the eastward 21st September the scarcity of water and the very level appearance of the country to the northward of we bivouac add to the general denseness of the thicket of acacia and cypress render a continuance of a north course unadvisable we steer north-west from 830 be till noon when we ascend a scrubby sand ridge from which we have a extensive view neither hill nor valley could be discover to the north east or west -- nothing but one immense sea of dense thicket of acacia and cypress be visible in these direction the course be therefore change to west and continue it without much alteration over a succession of low ridge of drift sand the valley be fill with dense thicket until 620 pm when the approach of night compel we to bivouac in a small patch of gum forest which also afford a few scattered tuft of grass for we horse although this be the lowest spot pass in a distance of more than ten mile it be so completely dry up and parch that a search for water be fruitless even by digging the scanty allowance of very brackish water in we keg be therefore much relish by the party 22nd September the night have be cloudy and a strong breeze prevent any dew we horse be not much refresh we however start at 745 be and steer nearly west till 315 pm through a succession of dense thicket high scrub and thorny bush we enter open sandy downs and change the course to south-west with the intention of make the hutt river should we not find any water nearer when almost hopeless of procure this essential element before the next day we unexpectedly come to a native well in the center of the sandy plain here we bivouac at 540 but from the loose sandy soil in which the well be dig we could not obtain more than about two and a half gallon of water for each horse the side of the well continually fall in strong breeze from the north-west and several light shower in the evening and night 23rd September have complete water the horse we leave the well at 930 be and steer about north-west over undulating sandy downs cover with coarse scrub and patch of dense thicket at 215 pm enter a small gully trend north-west the country improve but be so thickly clothe with wattle as to render travel difficult a few patch of grass be see in some small watercourse in which a little water remain at 440 bivouac on a large gully trend northwards with several small pool of water in a rocky bed of gneiss contain numerous small garnet strong breeze from the north-west and slight shower 24th September -lrb- Sunday -rrb- although the feed for the horse be not very abundant yet the long march they have encounter the last few day make it expedient to give they a day 's rest to recruit they weary limb read prayer strong breeze from the north-west and slight shower during the day enter the valley of the murchison river 25th September start at 827 be pass over poor stony hill of granite formation and produce a little grass in tuft -- the wattle grow so close together as to render travel difficult and tedious at 1045 come on a large stream-bed which have scarcely cease to run the channel be fifty yard wide the bed steep and rocky and where cross run over a dyke of trap-rock the water slightly brackish and in long shallow pool with samphire on the bank this stream must be the murchison river as no other be pass for 30 mile to the northward the effect of violent flood be visible but it do not bear the character of a stream rise at any great distance inland nor do the nature of the gravel and sand bring down by it indicate a rich soil on its upper portion as i do not see anything besides fragment of siliceous rock and garnet sand the valley through which it run appear to be five or six mile wide extend twenty mile to the eastward back by sandy plain on both side a few patch of grass appear in the lower part of the valley westward it seem to contract and turn to the south-west flank by steep flat-topped hill of sandstone rest on granite rock continue north-north-east up a small valley we pass through wattle thicket till 140 pm when we again ascend the level sandy tableland or plain and change the course to the north the scrub increase in density as we proceed at 425 halted for the night in a patch of good grass where the thicket have be burn off by the native fire the sandy nature of the soil render the search for water unsuccessful we therefore contend ourselves with the allowance of one pint each 26th September leave the bivouac at 715 be course north the country more open 925 come on a large native well of good water in a slight hollow trend westward have water the horse and fill the keg continue we journey over sandy plain cover with short coarse scrub many hummock of loose sand cover partially with scrub lay on each side of we track at noon pass the last sandy ridge before we lay a immense plain cover with thicket and not a hill or valley could be observe -- the country seem to settle into one vast level of dense and almost impenetrable scrub or thicket at 1 pm enter it and continue we route through it although the bush-fire which have burn some large patch greatly assist we 415 not find any grass we steer west but at 515 be compel to halt for the night in a dense thicket without a single blade of grass or even scrub of any kind which could afford food for the horse water it be hopeless to look for and after a supper of raw bacon damper and a pint of water each we retire to rest waterless country and dense scrub north of murchison river 27th September at 70 be set out on a north course at 85 find the thicket almost impassable i ascend a cypress-tree where a most cheerless view meet my sight to the north east and west not a break be visible -- nothing but thicket in all direction with scarcely a undulation of any kind the view to the north-west be most extensive -- nearly twenty mile of thicket could be see with a surface as level as the sea not consider it prudent to proceed onward the thicket be too dense to advance without the greatest difficulty the saddle-bag be almost tear to piece and the horse quite wear out with continual exertion in drag they pack through the thicket we be compel to return to the well pass yesterday morning the country see to the northward be of too flat and sandy a character to give any hope of finding water or grass -- and without these requisite it would be incur great risk of lose the horse and of course defeat the object of the expedition therefore take advantage of the partially clear tract of yesterday we reach the watering place at 430 pm 28th September this day we employ ourselves in repair we pack-saddle which it be find necessary to restuff as they have be pad with coarse rush the saddle-bag have be tear to piece and the repair of these require more time than could be afford in a evening 's bivouac 29th September start at 835 be pursue a general course of 310 degree gradually ascend the sandy downs on the north side of the valley for three mile it then turn to the north of west and we again descend and find the bottom occupy by a narrow samphire flat 50 to 100 yard wide over which the water run during heavy rain but it be now dry and in some part cover with a thin crust of salt 1126 pass a native well of slightly brackish water amongst loose block of red sandstone a small well be pass at 1150 the samphire flat then change to a small sandy channel among large block of sandstone belong to the coal-formation : in one place the slate also crop out abundance of brackish water lay in small pool along the course of the stream-bed which at 10 pm change its direction nearly west we follow it through a scrubby valley with high hill on both side till 445 when we bivouac just below the junction of a small gully from the northwards with a very remarkable sandstone hill about three-quarter of a mile south below this spot the valley trend to the south-west and be bound on the north-west by flat-tapped sandstone hill 30th September not be more than ten to fifteen mile from the sea i steer north 330 degree east magnetic start at 85 and have ascend the high land pass through a thick line of wattle and dwarf gum grow on the eastern face of the limestone range which form the high barren range along this part of the coast the country be cover with thick scrub and some patch of gum and wattle thicket about noon it be more open and ascend a elevated sandy ridge see apparently a high range of hill extend north-north-west as far as shark bay and terminate by a very abrupt and detach hill but the excessive refraction cause by the heated and nearly level plain which intervene more than double they real height we descend gradually over a succession of sandy hill or ridge till 20 pm when the lowest part of the plain be reach we find it occupy by a small patch of spear-wood the soil be hard dry clay but on proceed a little farther we find a patch of moist ground encircle by a ridge of sand at one foot deep we find water but in such small quantity that we could only obtain sufficient for ourselves and should have have to wait at least two hour to have give each horse only one gallon proceeding onward in hope of find a more plentiful supply we find the country become drier and full of circular hollow fill with fine clump of green wattle and a little grass in one of these we bivouac at 50 and dig six foot for water in red sand but without any appearance of obtain it even at double that depth repulse for want of water 1st October this morning start at 755 be and steer north-west in hope of finding water at 840 come on dense thicket of wattle which extend at least seven or eight mile farther north we therefore turn west to avoid they at 930 change the course to 300 degree magnetic and with great difficulty force we way for two mile to a narrow strip of open ground 1240 pm arrive at the foot of the range of hill see yesterday find they to consist of limestone and sand cover with thick scrub between the hill be many nearly circular hollow fill with thicket of wattle although the bottom of the hollow be at least fifty foot below the lowest part of the ridge around they they be quite dry and afford no hope of water even by digging the country northward appear even less likely to afford a supply so much require as it seem to consist wholly of limestone and loose sand without swamp or watercourse the nearest spot at which we could hope to find it in this direction be the south part of freycinet harbor distant accord to the chart about thirty mile and great doubt exist of the accuracy of it in this position -lrb- error have be find in some other part of the coast-line -rrb- nor be it certain that we could find water on the coast in which case the loss of we horse would be almost a necessary consequence several of they show extreme fatigue the circumstance of the case require a prompt decision i therefore order a immediate return towards the last spot where we have see water the whole party feel convinced of the necessity of return though with the greatest reluctance to do so as it seem to put a end to almost every hope of reach the gascoyne river we follow we route back and halt at 530 in a wattle thicket a horse find water 2nd October leave we uncomfortable bivouac at 730 be steer south-east find the horse scarcely able to travel from want of water i take the strongest and ride over to the spot where we have obtain a little on the 30th September to dig well and have a supply ready if it could be obtain in sufficient quantity at 110 arrive and find the well we have dig nearly dry by open several trench down to the rock which lay about one and a half foot below the surface the water ooze in and when the party come up at 120 there be about a gallon for each horse take off the pack we commence watering : four horse have receive they small allowance when it come to my horse bob 's turn after drink he share he march off at a smart pace which somewhat surprise we as he start in the direction of what we have suppose to be nothing but a tea-tree scrub on follow he we find the horse drinking at a small shallow pool of water in a hollow in the clay this be a very fortunate discovery as the trench fill with water so slowly that a full supply could not have be obtain that night and the horse have be sixty-five hour without water sand plain and scrub return to the murchison river 3rd October this morning mr burge and myself start at 730 be in a north-easterly course to ascertain the practicability of proceeding in that direction take two of the strongest horse after ride four hour over a open scrubby sand-plain with circular valley we again fall in with thicket of wattle so dense that although burnt by the native fire about four year previous they would have be impassable for the pack-horse but favor by this circumstance we penetrate the thicket in a north-north-west direction for about twelve mile from one small sandy ridge we have a extensive view but of a most discouraging nature the whole country be one vast plain cover with dense thicket and scrub as far as the eye could reach except to the west-north-west where rise a high and barren ridge which would not have be visible but for excessive refraction as it must have be more than twenty-five mile distant the plain be still dot over with the remarkable circular hollow or valley which by they extreme dryness indicate a great depth of sandy soil incapable of retain water on the surface even for a short time or any probability of we obtain it by digging we turn in disappointment towards the encampment scarcely extricate ourselves from the thicket before it become dark have gain the sand-plain we continue we return for several hour steer by the star hope by a night march to avoid the scorching effect of the sun which at this season render travel over a extensive sandy plain very fatiguing have be more than eleven hour in the saddle we halt for the night 4th October start with the dawn and push we tired and hungry horse over the plain as fast as circumstance would admit arrive at the encampment before the heat of the day become excessive during we absence two more waterhole have be excavate and sufficient water obtain for the horse but from the great evaporation it do not seem likely to last longer than three or four day : the hardness of the sandstone preclude we sink the well more than one and a half foot the extreme aridity of the country -- the absence of water in consequence of the sandy nature of the soil which render it impossible that watercourse should exist -- the dense and almost impassable nature of the thicket of acacia and melaleuca of small growth and the heat of the climate -- all tend to prove the fallacy of attempt to explore this part of the colony excepting during the wettest of the winter month under the exist circumstance i consider it my duty not to lead the party into a position from which it would most probably be impracticable to extricate ourselves without at least lose some of we horse and even difficulty of a more serious nature might arise which would prevent the more complete examination of the imperfectly known country to the southward of we present position more especially as a successful advance to the northward seem impossible 5th October leave the encampment at 810 be steer north 135 degree east magnetic over sandy country cover with coarse scrub at noon pass a narrow strip of wooded grassy land the soil be limestone and red loam the country again become scrubby and descend a open valley come on a small watercourse at 15 pm trend south follow it south-south-west at 215 pass we bivouac of the 29th September and turn south-west along the stream-bed at 40 come on the right bank of the murchison river run through wide grassy flat the stream form large pool some of they more than a mile in length but with the exception of the flat on each side of the bank the country be poor and scrubby destitute of tree and the hill high and rocky consist of red sandstone those to the west cap with limestone 6th October the horse be much fatigued and nearly starve have subsist chiefly on scrub for the last two day we determine to rest they for a few day while we examine the river towards its mouth i start with mr bedart and trace the stream downward to the south-west reach the sea after a ride of six hour except the flat and a narrow strip of land on each side the country be very indifferent the hill be compose of sandstone and sand cover with coarse scrub and a gigantic species of grass the leaf of which instead of afford food for stock be a source of great annoyance to we horse be arm with sharp thorny point and be somewhat appropriately call bayonet grass by the party the tide flow about five mile up the river when it be obstruct by some slight rapid although it seem shallow and full of rock and island i think it be navigable for small boat above the rapid the river be a succession of long reach of water about 100 yard wide and wide flat cover with reed the root of which seem to form a important article of food with the native many spring be see on the left bank but few on the right the water of which be of excellent quality after make observation of the bar which appear to be practicable for whaleboat in moderate weather if the wind be south of west we return along the south shore of the estuary which be about one and a half mile long and half a mile wide it do not appear to be of any great depth my horse be quite knock up it be dark before we could reach a spot where we could obtain water and grass have come to a convenient place we bivouac under a large overhang rock as it promise to be a wet night 7th October at 60 be we be in we saddle but owe to the rocky nature of the country do not arrive at the encampment till 1230 pm during we absence the party have be successful in fishing and shoot a savoury mess of cockatoo swan and duck with fried fish prove a welcome change to we after live so many week on salt meat and damper 8th October -lrb- Sunday -rrb- 9th October the valley of the river be rocky and impassable above the camp we cross to the left bank and ascend the sandy tableland steer about south-east from 745 be to 110 when we come on the stream in a deep valley form by almost perpendicular red sandstone cliff from 50 to 200 foot in height break at short interval by enormous fissure -lrb- they general direction west-north-west and nearly at right angle with the river -rrb- which time with the action of water have worn into impassable ravine frequently extend more than half a mile back from the river and render travel very tedious and unsafe as it be requisite to avoid the thick scrub cover the higher land the course of the river now change to nearly south and preserve the same rocky and unapproachable character till 50 pm when a break in the cliff enable we to descend into the valley although with some difficulty and danger to the horse which have to slide down the steep rock at the risk of break they neck which would have be the almost certain result of a single false step but the descent be accomplish they be reward by a abundant supply of grass and water the latter from a large spring at the foot of the cliff 10th October while breakfast be prepare mr burge and myself examine the right bank of the river and after a short search find a practicable ascent to the top of the cliff and have clear a way through the thicket of melaleuca on the bank of the river return to breakfast at 750 be commence ascend and at 830 reach the summit of the rocky hill and steer about south-east through a succession of thicket rock yawn chasm sand-hill and scrub we attain to a fine grassy flat at 1230 pm the bed of the river here quite change its character the sandstone give place to granite gneiss with dark trap dyke intersect it in a northerly and southerly direction the dip of the stratum be to the west at a very high angle at time almost perpendicular a depot camp explore the upper murchison 11th October as this appear to be a good spot for the formation of a depot while we examine the upper portion of the murchison i proceed up the river in company with mr burge leave the rest of the party to guard the camp and attend to the horse after one hour 's ride we come on we track where we cross the river on the 25th September the general course of the stream-bed be east-north-east its channel average 100 yard in width full of rock small tree and sandbank with many shallow brackish pool of water with the exception of one which be both wide and deep where we halt for two hour to rest the horse few of the pool seem likely to last through the heat of summer at 10 pm we come on a party of native five of whom come up to we follow we for some distance as they seem to prefer mimic we attempt to speak the york dialect to use they own we could not obtain much information they carry kyly and dowak but have leave they spear and shield with the rest of they party who do not make they appearance at 30 pass several ridge of red sandstone rock the stratum dip to the east-north-east at a angle of from 20 to 60 degree the granite rock entirely disappear the country become quite level and cover with one universal thicket of acacia and cypress except the very slight depression which form a shallow valley about three mile wide through which the river run in a deep channel from 80 to 100 yard wide in ordinary season but when in flood must exceed 300 yard and the rise of the water judge from the rubbish drift up in former year must exceed thirty foot the valley do not seem to be more than 100 foot below the general surface of the country -lrb- which be quite level -rrb- fill with a dense thicket of wattle a narrow strip of large gum-tree grow in grassy flat close to the river mark the course of the stream at 50 we halt for the night by a small pool of fresh water in one of the back channel of the river the pool in the main bed be all brackish 12th October start at 635 be follow the river the general course be north-north-east no change be observe in its character at 1120 halt to rest the horse and again start at 140 pm at 340 come on a large party of native at a fresh water pool five follow we some mile and be not to be satisfy until we have make a exchange of part of a handkerchief for a quantity of noolban some dowak and dabba some of which we accept as a token of we friendly intention the stream-bed turn east and we follow it until 60 when we be halt for the night have the good fortune to find a little fresh water by digging in the sand in the bed of the river the pool be all brackish return to depot camp 13th October at 615 be we be again in we saddle and continue journey up the river -- the general course north-north-east in vain we look for some rise ground or hill from which we might obtain a view of the country but the same sandy level cover with dense thicket of wattle still meet the eye till 110 when we observe a low sandstone cliff form the eastern side of the valley in this direction we steer and after push through thicket of wattle grow on stony ground with small patch of salsolaceous plant we arrive at the foot of the cliff which be about sixty foot in height of white sandstone full of rounded quartz pebble the top be nearly on a level with the general plane of the country which be of a most cheerless aspect the valley of the river trend to the north-north-east for eight or ten mile then to the east the width appear about five mile and one dense thicket of wattle seem to fill the entire space the rest of the country be without the slightest exception level in the extreme cover with one universal thicket of acacia and cypress the latter indicate the sandy nature of the soil as no appearance of change in the character of the country within twenty or thirty mile be visible and we have only two day ' provision leave -lrb- not have expect the stream to extend so far -rrb- and the camp at sixty mile distant we be oblige to leave the farther examination of the river to some future explorer but we regret it the less as from the nature of the gravel and sand bring down by the stream there seem great probability that it take its rise in large salt marsh similar to those know to exist 100 mile east of the irwin if it do not actually drain they as the general trend of the most northerly marsh see be in the direction of the upper part of the murchison under these circumstance we return to we bivouac of last night reach it at 540 pm 14th October start at 625 be and retrace we route down the river come to we bivouac of the 11th at 55 pm without any incident worthy of notice but surprising three or four native asleep in the bed of the stream they be of the party see on we route up the river 15th October -lrb- Sunday -rrb- resume we journey pass two party of native a few of they follow we some distance and have overcome they first surprise commence talk in they own language which as far as we could understand it have great affinity to that speak by the native in the york and toodyay district after a smart ride of seven hour we arrive at the encampment find the rest of the party all well and the horse much improve by they few day ' rest the geraldine lead mine discover the hutt river 16th October the two horse we have ride up the river require a day 's rest which be also acceptable to mr burge and myself we remain at the camp and make preparation to move on to the hutt river the next day mr walcott bring in some specimen of galena which on farther observation prove to be abundant 17th October leave we encampment at 910 be we steer a southerly course pass over a succession of low granite hill thickly cover with acacia to the exclusion of almost every other kind of vegetation save a few scattered tuft of grass at noon enter the sand-plain which occupy the high land in this district observe a patch of grassy land bear south-west proceeding in that direction at 10 pm come on it but find it to be a very small spot of grassy granite country encircle by sand-plain and scrub continue we course at 25 strike a small stream-bed trend west-south-west the valley in which it run be bound on both side by sandy hill cover with scrub some patch of grass and wattle occupy the lower ground wherever the granite rock show itself trace the stream-bed downward we find many brackish pool at 345 cross the left bank -- find it run but brackish and at 420 we bivouac at its junction with the hutt river which be here about ten yard wide with narrow grassy flat on both bank the hill be of sandstone and sand produce little besides scrub 18th October start at 750 be steer north 140 degree east magnetic up the valley of the hutt which gradually widen and improve the hill be grassy for a average distance of two mile back from the stream of granite formation and thinly sprinkle with wattle behind the grassy land the country rise into sandy plain cover with short scrub at 920 cross to the left bank the river trend to the eastward at 1110 sight king 's table hill bearing south magnetic we then descend into the rich and grassy valley of the bowe river this we traverse till 40 pm when we bivouac in a small stream tributary to the bowe as the country pass over this day have not be previously examine we be much pleased to find it equal to the best land on the southern branch of the bowe visit by the surveyor-general and myself on former occasion fine pastoral country 19th October messr burges bedart and myself ride down the bowe to examine the country and find it generally of good grassy character suitable for sheep the bed of the stream be fill with broad-leaved reed seem to indicate a abundant supply of water in the dry season but the pool be very small and the water all brackish not even except the run stream the hill be of gneiss with garnet and trap-rock the latter produce excellent grass of various kind the most conspicuous of which be a species of kangaroo-grass but of a less woody character of seed-stalk than that find in other part of the colony the extent of land fit for sheep-feeding on this stream -lrb- it can scarcely be call a river -rrb- i should estimate at 100000 acre and mr burge consider it capable of feed about 17000 sheep the existence of garnet iron pyrites and a mineral resemble in many of its property plumbago specimen of which be find in the gneiss of this district seem to indicate a metalliferous formation and i have little doubt a further search might develop many of the present hidden source of wealth near the coast we fall in with some native -lrb- four man and five woman -rrb- who be very friendly but from they peculiar nature we be unable to accept of they civility 20th October start with messr burge and walcott to examine the upper part of the buller river after pass over the country examine by lieutenant irby and myself in December 1846 we cross the granite ridge which divide the valley of the buller into two nearly equal portion we find the land on the left bank of the eastern branch of very good and grassy description consist of a range of granite hill about ten mile north and south and two mile in width to the east of which the high sandy and level plain commence in a abrupt line of sandstone slope and hill halt for the night in the east branch of the buller with water in small pool and abundance of grass for we horse 21st October continue the examination of the buller valley down to the spot where i bivouacked on the river in December 1846 then follow up the stream for seven mile where we dine and then steer west-north-west arrive at the camp at 630 pm we estimate the valley of the buller to contain about 10000 acre of good grassy land and 30000 acre of inferior feed country the good land be much break into patch by that which be of indifferent quality timber be here and also on the bowe very scarce and the little that exist be very indifferent and small 22nd October -lrb- Sunday -rrb- messr bedart and cf gregory walk to the hill which lie three-quarter of a mile west of king 's table hill the rock of which it be form appear to belong to the coal formation as thin seam of black shale be see in the rock of which the lower stratum of the hill be compose but the native make they appearance it be not consider prudent to remain geologizing among the cliff return towards the camp the native follow for some distance and on descend a cliff the woman commence pelt the party with stone apparently in revenge for the refusal of certain courteous invitation which perhaps be the greatest mark of politeness which they think it possible to offer to stranger chapman river 23rd October leave we encampment at 85 be and steer 150 degree magnetic over granite hill produce wattle and good grass at 940 cross the south branch of the bowe after which the country be not so well grassed except in the valley the lower hill be of granite the higher red sandstone of tabular form at 110 the country become more sandy and cover with short scrub gradually rise to the south at noon we attain the high tableland cross two scrubby valley bound by sandstone hill in the first of which the black shale peculiar to the coal formation show itself with a slight dip to the south at 150 pm cross the buller in a rocky channel with reedy pool apparently of permanent character the land improve and become grassy and ascend the hill on the left bank pass peak hill at 250 : this be the highest part of the range between the buller and chapman from this we steer south down a small grassy valley the hill with granite basis and sandstone table summit with excellent grass and thinly wood with acacia and a few york gum at 315 bivouac in a patch of excellent grass with water in small quantity 24th October a violent thunderstorm during the night be follow by a rainy and misty morning the weather clear up we walk down to the chapman river which be run in a sandy channel with small shallow pool the land on the bank of the stream be very indifferent and sandy for about a mile when it rise into granite and sandstone hill cover with excellent grass effect of refraction greenough river 25th October accompany by messr burge and walcott i proceed to examine the country to the eastward of we camp start at 720 be steer east over grassy hill with granite basis and table summit of red sandstone the latter rock form but a poor soil with scanty feed and scrub cross several small gully run into the chapman at 100 pass a large sandy hill cover with short scrub and halt at 110 in a grassy gully in the bottom of a wide scrubby valley at 1245 pm again resume we journey and ascend the sandy downs at 115 gain the highest ridge before we lay the valley of the greenough river the white and red sandstone cliff which bind the valley on the south-east be distort by excessive refraction which as we cross each sandy ridge change they appearance sometimes assume the appearance of island with high rocky shore then like reef with heavy breaker follow by high cliff and grassy hill but as we approach they assume they true character of low rocky hill and cliff scarce exceed 200 foot in height and generally cover with dense thicket of acacia grow on a otherwise barren stony soil at 330 come on the right bank of the greenough river the bed be quite dry and have no appearance of have run since the winter of 1847 follow up the stream-bed to the north-east pass some shallow pool of salt water and at 445 observe the black coal shale at the bottom of a deep cliff which form the left bank of the river at 50 halted for the night obtain fresh water by scrape in the sand by the side of a pool of salt water we also find sufficient grass for we horse on the bank of the river 26th October at 710 be leave we bivouac steer north 120 degree east magnetic towards a high sandstone cliff which after a ride of three-quarter of a hour through thicket of acacia we ascend but the view be not satisfactory as thicket and scrub extend over the whole of the country we therefore return to the river and follow it downward to the south-west by south at 1130 find some fresh water in a small waterhole in the bed of the river halt till 150 pm to refresh the horse the river turn south and at 227 be join by a small gully from the west and come from a grassy valley as it have run during the last winter it quite alter the character of the river for quarter of a mile fill the pool with water and give the grass and tree a freshness which form a most striking contrast with the brown and parched appearance of the rest of the valley at 355 alter the course to 210 degree magnetic the country improve many patch of grassy land appear in the valley and the country become more rocky at 530 cross to the left bank and find the river run with many large pool of water some more than a half a mile long and 80 to 100 yard wide the water be slightly brackish be this year supply principally by spring take they rise in the new red sandstone formation we then follow the wind course of the river south-west amongst high hill of sandstone many of which be cover with excellent grass though the country be not generally good at 620 halted for the night on the right bank of the stream in a narrow but rich grassy flat heavy rain in the night wizard peak champion bay mount fairfax 27th October start at 70 be and steer a average course of west by north ascend the high land on the north bank of the greenough for the first hour the hill be of red sandstone very steep and rocky produce little but coarse scrub some of the valley and lower hill be well grass the country then improve the hill be of the coal formation and the limestone form very rich and grassy hill at 940 the granite and gneiss form a basis of the high sandstone-topped hill which rise about 500 foot on each side of the valley at 1015 cross to the left bank of the river and re-crossed to the right at 1110 the lower part of the valley be not so rich or well grass as the hill but would afford excellent summer feed for sheep have dine and give we horse a hour 's feed on the rich grass which grow in the bed of the river -lrb- which here turn to the south -rrb- we continue we route after a hour 's ride over rich grassy hill reach the foot of wizard 's peak here we leave we horse and ascend the hill arrive at the summit to we great surprise instead of the scrubby and sterile country describe by captain stoke of the beagle beautiful grassy hill stretch from north to south-east meet we view to the extent of about 20000 acre have it not be certain from bearing to mount fairfax and other hill that we be on wizard peak i should have suspect its identity leave wizard peak at 230 pm steer north along the western foot of the grassy range the country to the east consist of grassy hill of limestone rich in fossil remains of wood and shell with a occasional granite hill produce coarse grass or short scrub to the west the country be more level but less grassy and in many part scrubby we fall in with some of the native who appear friendly disposed cross the chapman at 65 and arrive at the camp at 715 28th October leave the camp at 740 be steer north-west make the stream previously call the buller at 90 follow it downward to the south-south-west till 110 when it become evident that instead of be the buller it be the north branch of the chapman the land on its bank be not generally good although some fine patch of grass be see leave the stream we ascend moresby 's range the valley and side of the hill be cover with fine grass and the sandstone rock be rich with fossil remains of shell and wood with some difficulty we descend the western face of the hill after which a hour 's ride over a scrubby plain bring we to the mouth of the chapman river run strongly over a ledge of limestone rock into the sea we cross the river and over to the usual landing-place in champion bay we then return to the chapman and halted for the night 29th October two of the horse have break from they tether during the night we be oblige to put the three saddle on the remain horse and proceed to track the stray horse after track they about two mile we find they on they way back to the camp we then ride along the western foot of moresby 's range and ascend mount fairfax after take sketch and bearing we steer for the encampment and reach it about 20 pm 30th October messr burges walcott and bedart ride out this morning to examine the grassy hill on the south side of the chapman river and on they return report the country to be of a generally good grassy character native steal frying-pan 31st October leave the encampment at 80 be and steer 200 degree magnetic over alternately grassy and scrubby hill of granite sandstone cross the chapman at 940 we course then lay nearly parallel to the river till noon the land on the river be indifferent and thinly grass but rise into good grassy hill about a mile from the river we then enter a level scrubby plain extend from the victorium range to the sea at 1230 pm alter the course to 175 degree magnetic and at 15 to 139 degree magnetic at 115 the plain become grassy and the soil good -lrb- with the exception of a few patch of york gum the only tree be wattle -rrb- and by a rough estimate contain about 8000 acre of good grassy land on the north bank of the greenough river which we reach at 315 the channel be about seventy yard wide but dry and sandy nor do we observe any sign of its have run during the past winter a little below where we strike the river it turn to the south-east follow it in that direction till 345 we bivouac obtain a scanty supply of water by digging in the sand shortly after halt a party of about thirty native come up and appear friendly they tell we that there be a fine spring at some distance to the westward but we could not obtain any other useful information as they dialect differ considerably from that speak in the settle district although some few word be the same they encamp a short distance from we and in the night steal we frying-pan to dig a well but return it next morning before the theft be discover the irwin river 1st November at 710 be resume we course south-east along the eastern side of the grassy plain the scrubby hill gradually approach on each side at 930 the good land terminate the estimate be 2000 acre on the south bank of the greenough river the country then become sandy produce little besides scrub and a few banksium tree at 100 pass about one mile west of mount hill pass a small pool of water in a watercourse trend south-west at 1250 pm alter the course to 170 degree magnetic at 30 enter a thick forest of york gum at 325 change the course to 130 degree magnetic and enter a grassy flat extend to the irwin river which we reach at 355 and follow it upward till 415 bivouac on the left bank in a large flat shortly before reach the river a large party of native come up with we after track the horse for some distance seventy or eighty man come to the bivouac and with the exception of one man who ship a spear make a demonstration of throw it at we they evince a desire for the more peaceable amusement of eat damper and fat bacon a few of the native speak a little english have be for a short time in the settle district at sunset they retire to the other side of the river and all appear quiet when my watch commence at 1030 but at midnight i detect a native crawl up amongst the thick grass about ten yard from the back of the tent he lay quiet till i almost turn he out of he hiding-place with the muzzle of my gun when he take to he heel but i do not consider it prudent either to fire at or capture he 2nd November the native be too numerous to allow any of the party leave the camp to examine the country around without incur greater risk than seem prudent we leave we bivouac at 745 be and steer north 170 degree east magnetic over sandy hill cover with short scrub after two hour the country become nearly level with small patch of swampy ground which would be very wet in the rainy season but be at present quite dry the rise grounds be sand cover with short scrub with a few scattered banksium tree at 540 pm strike the left bank of the stream which have be consider to be the arrowsmith river of captain gray though i have now some reason to doubt its identity the bank of the stream be sandstone and sand and the channel scarcely three yard wide with a strip of grassy thicket twenty yard in width along the stream which be the only feed near the river as the plain through which it run produce nothing but scrub and banksium with a few grass-tree we bivouac a short distance below the spot where we first strike the stream which be still run 3rd November we horse have but a very scanty feed at this place we move down the stream to obtain better grass for they before cross the sand-plain which lay to the south after follow the stream west for two hour encamp in a small grassy flat below which the stream cease to run the water be wholly absorb by the sandy soil which have a substratum of limestone of recent formation seventy mile of sand plain 4th November accompany by mr bedart ride to the westward pass over sandy plain and ridge for four hour come to the beach which we follow northwards for three hour hope to meet with the mouth of the stream on which we camp be place not perceive any sign of it we turn to the east and after a hour 's struggle through a thick jungle we come on a wet grassy flat on which the stream seem to be lose steer a general course of south-south-east we arrive at 910 pm at the camp after a ride of thirteen and a quarter hour and the country traverse almost wholly worthless sand and scrub 5th November -lrb- Sunday -rrb- remain at we encampment to rest the horse read prayer 6th November leave we encampment at 710 be we steer north 170 degree east magnetic along the limit of the low scrubby limestone hill which extend along this part of the coast to the east the level sandy plain extend from eight to ten mile and then rise into high sandstone hill cover with scrub and destitute of tree but at the junction of the limestone and sandstone formation along which lay we route be several small lagoon and swamp of fresh water with grassy margin at 100 alter the course to southward the line of swamp trend to south-south-west we enter the level sandy plain at noon pass a shallow pool of rainwater in a slight depression of the plain and shortly after cross two small watercourse trend west a little brackish water remain in the deeper portion of they channel the effect of refraction on this level country when heat by the midday sun be so great as to cause many of the low sandy ridge to appear like large lake and inlet of the sea as in some instance the more distant hill be obscure by its effect at 245 pm we reach the sandstone range and at 35 halt in a small patch of grass around a native well of good water which have the appearance of retain water throughout the summer while here we obtain several addition to we small collection of bird mount peron and lesueur 7th November at 720 be resume we journey southwards over a high and somewhat rugged range of sandstone hill pass a short distance to the east of mount peron and lesueur the valley be wood with red and white-gum of large growth but the hill produce little besides coarse scrub at 220 pm pass a large mound spring at 245 cross the hill river of captain gray the land on its bank with the exception of a few grassy hill on the northern side be very scrubby and indifferent ascend the high sandstone country on the south side of the river we halt at 535 in a sandy valley trend north-west in which we find a small patch of grass around a native well but we be not much in want of water be completely drench by a heavy shower of rain just after we halt 8th November resume we journey at 80 be steer north 105 degree east magnetic over a range of high scrubby sandstone hill at 115 pm cross a small stream-bed trend westwards in a wide scrubby valley at 35 have ascend the hill to the south of the valley observe a remarkable sandstone hill which i pass on a previous excursion from mr lefroy 's station at welb alter the course to 170 degree magnetic we pass the hill at 545 halt in a fine grassy flat on the bank of a small brook-course trend west in which we find abundance of water in small pool as we be only forty mile west of mr lefroy 's station at welbing and the country in that direction already examine i instruct mr cf gregory to proceed with the

of the party at the bivouac at 950 be in company with mr bedart we steer a general course of south by east magnetic over hill of sandy loam produce a little grass and thickly timbered with red-gum pass several extensive grassy valley with many fine patch of rich limestone land on they slope at 20 pm the grass be replace by scrub and at 330 enter the wide scrubby valley of the moore river which we reach at 420 after some delay in cross the river in consequence of one of the horse fall down in the mud from which we have some trouble to extricate he we bivouac about one mile below the spot where we first make the river 10th November leave the moore river we steer south by west and after traverse a nearly level sandy plain produce banksium and scrub with many lagoon and swamp in eight hour ' ride reach the norcott or gingin brook the bank be low and swampy after a short search find a suitable place for cross and have swim the horse across we halt for the night on the left bank 11th November start at 70 be steer east by south magnetic ascend the western wilbinga hill at 90 and traverse a rough limestone country with several reedy swamp reach lake nowergup at 250 pm and at 40 halt on the western side of the wanaginup swamp 12th November -lrb- Sunday -rrb- once more in the saddle and follow the road past wonneroo arrive in perth at 230 pm mr cf gregory have accompany the party to the victorium plain proceed with private w king by the bindoon road to perth where he arrive on the 17th the total distance travel in this expedition be in round number 1500 mile and the extreme point reach in latitude 27 degree south 350 mile from perth in a direct line and the period we be engage in the expedition be ten week \*\*\* he excellency governor charle fitzgerald 's expedition to the geraldine lead mine 1848 champion bay to murchison river 1st December sail from fremantle in the champion for champion bay where we arrive on the 3rd swam the pony on shore and encamp at the mouth of the chapman river 4th December he excellency the governor come on shore when the party consist of the governor mr bland and myself with three soldier of the 96th regiment and the governor 's servant start at 715 be steer north-east cross moresby 's flat-topped range at 90 make the north chapman at 100 follow the stream upward till 1150 the general course north-east by north one native man and two woman come up and then retire to the other side of the river watch we proceedings have dine we start again at 225 pm steer a general north course over a indifferent scrubby country till 440 when we halt for twenty minute to examine the black shale-like soil which be see on a former occasion but on digging it prove to be only alluvial soil rest on sand from this spot we steer north 330 degree magnetic over high sandy hill cover with scrub the country gradually improve and at 70 we halt for the night in a small grassy gully trend north-west obtain water in a native well 5th December start at 640 be continue the same course as yesterday evening over a succession of grassy hill of granitic formation till 1110 when we halt on the eastern branch of the bowe river several native shortly come to the encampment and have eat some biscuit and pork which we offer to they retire in the evening to the opposite side of the stream-bed keep a close watch on we from behind some large rock a strict watch be therefore maintain by we during the night 6th December this morning the native commence by throw stone at the man who go down for the water but we do not see any method of resent it except by express we disapprobation in word and at 535 be we start on a north-north-west course the native follow for about a mile and continue throw stone at the party the country pass over be generally grassy granite hill till 90 when we ascend the high tableland between the valley of the bowe and hutt river which last we reach at 1025 and halt during the heat of the day on a pool of brackish water at 320 pm again start and follow the river downward in a general course 310 degree magnetic at 610 bivouac at the spot where we have before halt on the 17th October the water in the pool brackish but by digging near a moist bank obtain abundance of fresh water the geraldine lead mine 7th December leave we bivouac at 550 be and steer north-east over high sandy downs cover with coarse scrub at 1030 enter the valley of the murchison river at noon halted at we bivouac of the 24th September obtain some brackish water by digging in the sand of the small stream-bed have dine we resume we journey at 230 pm and bivouac about 50 on the left bank of the murchison 500 yard below the large lead vein obtain good water in the sandy bed of the river by digging a few inch the pool be all salt while the man be prepare the tent etc the governor proceed to examine the vein of lead which we trace to a greater distance than on the former occasion of its discovery the water have sink two foot expose many portion of the vein which be before cover 8th December examine the lead vein trace it 320 yard in a direction north 30 degree east magnetic along the bed of the murchison river which be nearly dry clear the sand and loose stone from the surface find it to vary from eight to twenty-four inch in width the general average be twelve inch the dip to the west-north-west at a angle of about 80 degree from the horizon throughout the whole length the lead vein appear to be one solid mass of galena the northern end either terminate or alter its direction close to a vein of schistose rock which intersect the adjacent rock to the south the lode be cover by several foot of sand which prevent its be trace further as we have not time to remove it the whole of the vein which be trace be include within the bank of the river and the greater portion be cover by shallow water one specimen of galena show trace of copper the rock which prevail on each side of the vein be a hard compact gneiss abound with garnet some of which be of good color but mostly full of flaw the stratification of the gneiss be somewhat confused but it generally dip at a high angle -lrb- sometimes nearly perpendicular -rrb- to the westward the strike be north and south the facility which the position of the lode offer for mining be not very great as it occupy the lowest part of the valley and steam power would be requisite to free the mine from water and at the same time unless the small boat-harbour near the mouth of the hutt river or gantheaume bay -lrb- both within thirty mile -rrb- be find suitable for the purpose champion bay distant sixty-two mile in a direct line to the south be the nearest port where the ore could be ship in the evening the governor examine the spot where mr walcott have discover the small piece of lead ore about two and a half mile below the lode but as most of the piece have be pick up on that occasion we could only find a few fragment of it 9th December leave the encampment at 440 be and steer about south-west make we former bivouac on the hutt river about 10 pm and halted for the rest of the day 10th December start at 450 be steer 160 degree magnetic over sandy country pass a small grassy valley at 80 halt on the north branch of the bowe at 1010 on a small pool of brackish water dine and resume we route at 240 pm steer south over a grassy country till 610 when we halt for the night on a tributary stream to the bowe obtain fresh water by digging the pool be very small and brackish conflict with native governor spear 11th December leave the bivouac at 515 be steer 175 degree magnetic over a indifferent country till 640 when we cross the south branch of the bowe the country improve here we see several native who at first hide themselves but find that we see they come after we at first they do not exceed eight or ten in number but be join by several other party gradually increase till they exceed fifty when they altogether change they friendly manner and begin to bring up they spear at 615 we pass to the west of king 's table hill and as the country be cover with dense wattle thicket the native take advantage of the ground and have completely surround the party commence first to threaten to throw they spear then to throw stone and finally one man catch hold of mr bland by the arm threaten to strike he with a dowak another native throw a spear at myself though without effect but before i could fire at he the governor perceive that unless some severe example be make the whole party would be cut off fire at one of the most forward of we assailant and kill he two other shot be fire by the soldier but the thickness of the bush prevent we see with what effect a shower of spear stone kyly and dowak follow and although we move to a more open spot the native be only keep off by firing at any that expose themselves at this moment a spear strike the governor in the leg just above the knee with such force as to cause it to protrude two foot on the other side which be so far fortunate as it enable I to break off the barb and withdraw the shaft the governor notwithstanding he wound continue to direct the party and although the native make many attempt to approach close enough to reach we with they spear we be enable by keep on the most open ground and check they by a occasional shot to avoid they attack in cross the gully they follow we closely for seven mile after which they be only see occasionally follow in we track have reach the beach we be enable to travel more rapidly and although one of the pony knock up we reach champion bay at 330 pm and get the party and horse on board the champion by 50 where we be gladly welcome by lieutenant helpman about sunset the native come down to the beach conceal themselves behind the bush whilst a single unarmed native stand on the beach and call to we to come on shore no doubt in the hope of make a sudden attack on the boat should we venture to do so ac gregory assistant surveyor \*\*\* the murchison river 1857 the upper murchison river in the month of march 1857 mr surveyor ft gregory while engage on the survey of the lower part of the murchison observe that the river come down in flood though there have be no rain for several month near the coast and take advantage of such a favourable opportunity of extend the exploration of the country beyond the point at which previous explorer have be drive back for want of water and grass he proceed up the murchison accompany by he assistant mr s trigg follow the course of the river for 180 mile for the last fifty mile the condition of the vegetation show that there have be heavy rain which have cause the flood in the lower part of the river the follow be a abstract of mr gregory 's report to the surveyor-general as publish at the time in the perth gazette : -- we last week intimate that a exploratory trip have lately be make into the interior eastward of the geraldine mine we have now the pleasure and satisfaction of lay before we reader some detail of one of the most unassuming exploration yet important in its result which have ever be undertake in this colony in the latter end of march last mr assistant surveyor f gregory and mr s trigg start from the geraldine mine with two horse and sixteen pound of flour to trace the murchison to its source and return after thirteen day ' absence mr gregory have make a short report of he journey to the surveyor-general from which we have be kindly furnish with the follow extract : -- while at the geraldine mine i availed myself of the circumstance of the murchison be in flood to ascend that river and complete the sketch of the unexamined portion as also to gain any additional information that might facilitate the exploration of the country between this and the gascoyne river the fact that the native describe a considerable tract of grassy country extend northward from the head of the murchison plentifully supply with water be a additional incentive to ascertain from whence the inundation come tropical rainy season good pastoral country accompany by mr s trigg i proceed up the river about 180 mile at which point it cease to run we then ascend a hill in the vicinity of 600 or 700 foot elevation above the plain which i have since find to be beyond a doubt mount murchison of austin unfortunately i be unable to procure a copy of he map or journal and be thus prevent from lay out my route to the greatest advantage by push more to the northward and go over more new ground as it be the only information i have be able to gain beyond complete the plan of the river be that the principal fall of rain have be eastward of the 116th degree of longitude and that the tract of country between the great south bend and mount murchison which prove barely capable of support mr austin 's small party of horse in November 1854 be now yield a pasture nearly equal to the average of the champion bay district and in some part most luxuriant the grass have scarcely arrive at maturity be perfectly green this remarkable change in the character of the country be i be incline to think not entirely confine to this year in particular but that from meteorological cause this district have not unfrequently the benefit of tropical rain fall during the month of January and February although not always in sufficient quantity to cause the river to flow as low as the settle district it have already be observe by many person that during the summer month the prevailing sea breeze divide the northerly current of vapor about 100 mile inland from the west coast prevent the rain from fall throughout the same parallel of latitude as near the eastern limit of my route the murchison throw off two branch nearly equal in magnitude to the main stream i be induce to imagine that its extreme source do not lie more than sixty or seventy mile beyond that point and have it not be that i do not feel justified in abstract so large a portion of time from the regular survey of this district there be no doubt but that i could with every facility have complete the exploration of the country as far as the gascoyne in two or three week on compare the trace of the murchison which i now enclose with mr austin 's route it will be observe that there be a difference of seventeen mile in latitude and something more in longitude throughout the eastern portion a discrepancy which i be at a loss to account for as my dead-reckoning to both the outward and inward track agree well with my cross-bearing my latitudes be however take only with a pocket sextant with a treacle horizon and might therefore not be implicitly rely on i have however prefer plot my route exactly as book in the field leave the exist error to be clear up at some future period from mr trigg who arrive on Wednesday by the preston from champion bay we have gather the follow additional particulars : -- the outward route be on the south bank of the river murchison the first sixty mile be but indifferent but there be many spot of grass sufficient to maintain travel herd or flock afterwards the soil on the bank of the river improve and be continuously grassy the general width be about half a mile about latitude 26 degree 50 minute longitude 116 degree east two large branch almost if not quite equal to the main stream join the murchison from the eastward about mr austin 's mount welcome the grass be find very luxuriant -- from two to three foot high and between there and mount murchison the country be describe by mr trigg to be very beautiful and the soil superior to any he have previously see in the colony and equal to the best land in victorium mount murchison itself be a immense mass of quartz with granite round the base this differ from mr austin 's description but that gentleman do not appear to have ascend the hill from the summit three high land be observable one a isolate peak fifty mile east the other to the north and north-east apparently more distant so far as could be see the country to the east and north-east appear scrubby and indifferent the return be on the north side of the murchison and here a large extent of good grassy land be find not on the bank but a mile and a half from the river and reach four or five mile in width to the base of some hill and reach westward to the large northerly bend of the river in longitude 115 degree 30 minute about forty mile from the geraldine mine the good land in all case be very flat the soil a red loam which when dry be very open the whole country be singularly infested with white ant of which every tree living or dead appear to have its colony mr trigg regard the country around mount murchison as auriferous the striking difference there be between this account of the country on the murchison and that give by mr austin may be account for in several way : first mr austin do not appear to have cross but skirt the country intervene between mount welcome and mount murchison but he describe the land about the latter as improve and find water while it be the feed and water at mount welcome which in all probability save he party from perish the land on the north side speak of so favourably by mr trigg be not see by mr austin and also he party be so exhaust that it be out of he power to diverge from a direct line in order to examine the nature of the country on either side whereas messr gregory and trigg make such a examination whenever any favourable appearance present itself and thus determine the quantity of valuable land for a distance of six or seven mile on each side of the river and have thus be the means of confer on the colony one of the greatest benefit it have receive since the northern district be first open by mr a gregory \*\*\* gascoyne river 1858 perth to champion bay in consequence of the very satisfactory result of the exploration of the upper murchison river by messr gregory and trigg in 1857 a number of settler in the northern district subscribe horse and equipment for a explore party to examine the country still further to the east and north and with the sanction of the government the expedition be place under the command of mr ft gregory the result be the discovery of a considerable area of available country on the gascoyne and lyon river as describe in mr gregory 's journal of which the follow be a copy : -- mr f gregory 's report western australium perth July 26 1858 sir in accordance with the instruction convey in you letter of the 15th march authorise I to take command of the expedition to shark 's bay in course of organization by the northern settler i have the honor to furnish the follow report of we proceedings while in that service for the information of he excellency the governor the preliminary arrangement have be complete and the heavy portion of the store forward by sea to champion bay i leave perth on the 26th march accompany by mr jame roe as second in command chainer fairburn have start the previous day with the team and light equipment of the expedition proceeding by way of toodyay to the irwin river the party be join by mr w moore with three horse pass on by way of champion bay we arrive a koobijawanna the point of general rendezvous by the 10th of April on the 12th the remainder of the store arrive from champion bay the party be augment to six person by the addition of mr c nairn and dugel a aboriginal policeman this day and the follow be occupy in weigh and pack store shoe horse etc 14th April the equipment of the expedition be complete -lrb- with the exception of one horse to be procure at the geraldine mine -rrb- we move on to yanganooka pass the geraldine mine on the 16th and bivouac on the murchison river six mile above the mine have obtain the additional horse make in all six saddle and six pack horse we supplies consist of sixty day ' ration on a scale of one and a half pound of flour eight ounce of pork four ounce of sugar and half a ounce of tea per diem the party be all well armed and furnished with ammunition the mean of we observation with the aneroid barometer give 575 foot for the elevation of this part of the river above the sea ascend the murchison river 17th April to the 25th April be occupy in ascend the murchison river by easy stage to the junction of the impey the highest point attain by I last year the only observation worthy of remark be that the inundation have not be so great as that which occur the previous summer the grass up to this point not be by any means so abundant as i have find it on my former visit the volume of water now run in the bed of the river be however at this time about the same although none of the tributary include the roderick and impey have be in flood little or no rain have fall to the west of the 117th degree of longitude except to the north of latitude 26 degree i availed myself of the opportunity afford to make several addition and correction to the map of this part of the country verify the correction make by I last year in the latitude of mount murchison and adjacent hill by a improve series of triangulation and a carefully observe set of lunar distance i be incline to place mount murchison in about longitude 116 degree 30 minute east which make it more nearly approximate to the longitude formerly give by mr austin the variation of the compass i find by several amplitude to be 2 degree 30 minute west the bed of the murchison river be here about 1077 foot above the sea in addition to the fish and game formerly observe on this part of the river we meet with large flock of the gallinule which have for so many year excite the curiosity of the colonist as to they habitat from subsequent observation it be evident they come from much further to the north-eastward but one party of native have as yet be see consist of eight or ten who chase we native dugel to the camp while out shooting but it be difficult to ascertain whether with hostile intention from this time to we return we regularly mount sentry during the night and no one be allow to quit the party any distance alone -- a precautionary measure the necessity of which be fully bear out by the sequel 26th April from we camp which be situate about eight mile west of mount murchison we fairly commence the exploration of unknown country follow the river nearly north-north-east for fourteen mile it turn abruptly to the east we however hold we course which at four mile further bring we to the foot of mount narryer which we ascend and procure a valuable round of angle from its summit this hill have a altitude of 1688 foot above the sea and be form by the eruption of a coarse dark-coloured crystalline trap through a base of amorphous sandstone the direction of the range of which it form a part be nearly north and south skirt round the north end of this range we strike east over a stony plain thinly grass amongst open wattle and at five mile again come upon the murchison some time after dark the pool here be somewhat larger than for many mile below be from sixty to eighty yard wide and half a mile in length the water in they become decidedly brackish samphire atriplex and other salsolaceous plant be abundant on the bank 27th April we only advance nine mile owe to mr moore and dugel have to return for one of the water-beaker which have be tear off the pack-saddle the previous night in a thicket towards we bivouac which be in latitude 26 degree 23 minute 38 seconds the country near the river improve much the channel of the river become very shallow the water have spread over the flat for more than half a mile on either side large flooded-gum tree grow abundantly with a fine sward of grass beneath the soil be a rich brown clay loam gallinule and cockatoo be in large flock feed on the grass seed which be now nearly ripe 28th April to latitude 28 degree 7 minute the river continue to come from north by east through a extensive plain bound on the west by a low range of trap and granite hill at a average distance of six or seven mile while to the eastward only a few distant peak be visible flooded-gum grow plentifully for more than a mile back from the river on flat of tolerably good pasture recede somewhat further from the river the country open out into extensive plain yield but little grass atriplex bush and thinly scatter stunt acacia and melaleuca tree form almost the entire vegetation 29th April a few mile nearly north bring we to where a considerable tributary join the murchison from the north the river trend first north-east then east and finally towards the afternoon it come from the southward of east we bivouac be only seven mile north of the previous night while we have make nearly eighteen mile of east the bed of the river have gradually become more rocky as we ascend gneiss with quartz dyke pass through it and yield a large quantity of salt render the run water of the river scarcely drinkable the only fresh water be find in the back channel fill by the late inundation the range which run parallel to the river to the westward terminate some mile to the north of the bend another range apparently granitic and break up into detach peak commence a little to the eastward of its termination run east for about twenty mile at the distance of six or seven mile from the north bank of the river to the eastward a elevated range with two conspicuous summit which be respectively name mount matthew and mount hale terminate the view in that direction while to the south only a few detach peak be visible to-day we first observe a very beautiful convolvulus which we afterwards find to bear root like a sweet potato some of they more than a pound weight and well flavored form a very important article of food to the native the flower be numerous and measure from two to three inch in diameter they outer edge of a dark lilac deepen to a rich purple at the center with a pale green convolute ribbing on the outside the stem and leaf of the plant resemble the kennedya mr drummond to whom i have describe it consider it a important discovery as by cultivation it might become a valuable addition to we australian esculent a small species of rock-melon be also find in great abundance about the size of a pigeon 's egg somewhat bitter to the taste but they be not ripe in other respects it much resemble the cultivate variety the bed of the river at this night 's bivouac have attain a elevation of 1240 foot above the sea leave the murchison for the gascoyne river 30th April finding that the murchison be lead we too much to the eastward the object of the expedition be to reach the gascoyne with as little delay as possible we quit the river on a north-north-east course for about eight mile over a tolerably grassy plain in some part open with atriplex and samphire and in other rather thickly stud with acacia and melaleuca ascend a granite hill of 150 foot elevation the plain be observe to the eastward to extend to the horizon only break by one remarkable bold trap hill at the distance of twenty mile which be eventually name mount gould the main murchison flow round its southern base while a considerable tributary from the north-east pass close under it to the north-west to the north of we position the country rise into a succession of stony ridge thinly grass and nearly destitute of tree in the valley the kangaroo grass be tolerably plentiful and quite green -- a sufficient evidence that we have now arrive within the influence of the rain that have produce the recent inundation which give we every hope of be able to push across the country intervene between this and the gascoyne we accordingly alter we course to north-west for the remainder of this and the follow day cross several tributary to the murchison in which we find plenty of water and on they bank a abundant supply of grass for we horse the stream be generally divide from each other by low stony ridge or plain of red sandy loam yield a rather scanty supply of grass 3rd may have rest the party the previous day it be Sunday in latitude 25 degree 33 minute 48 seconds at a fine pool of fresh water in a stream run south and apparently tributary to the murchison we resume we course for three or four mile up a branch of the stream upon which we have be encamp which terminate at a gentle stony ascent another mile bring we to its summit which prove to be the watershed between the gascoyne and murchison its elevation be find to be 1500 foot above the sea from this ridge a short descent northward lead we to the head of a watercourse which we follow in the same direction for seventeen mile augment by several small tributary turn to the westward it form a junction with another river come from the eastward in latitude 25 degree 14 minute 23 seconds at a elevation of 1144 foot above the sea stony plain the country through which we have pass be a nearly level and barren plain evenly and closely pave with small stone amongst which a few stunt acacia find a precarious existence to this portion of country we give the characteristic name of macadam plain gascoyne river 4th may the river we have encamp upon the precede night have a level sandy channel thirty-five yard wide with several shallow pool in its bed a narrow belt of flooded-gum line either bank which also produce abundance of excellent feed several of the grass be new to we yield a large quantity of seed further back the pasture be more scanty and of a inferior variety of grass the tree consist almost entirely of small hakea or acacia the feature of the country be generally very tame with the exception of a prominent hill of considerable altitude nearly twenty mile to the northward to which we give the name of mount gascoyne the summit of another range of less elevation a little to the northward of west distant fifteen mile be call mount puckford have decide upon follow the left bank of the river with the view of ascertain what tributary might joint from the southward we this morning take we course for mount puckford touching frequently upon the bend of the river which soon find a junction with a large channel come from the eastward which ultimately prove to be the main gascoyne it be still run in a small stream in the bottom of a sandy bed eighty yard wide trace of recent heavy flood be plentiful at ten mile the river have break through a ridge of opaline rock in irregular mass resemble flint lie north-east and south-west and a few mile further come in contact with the south-east foot of mount puckford it double back round its north-east base and there take a general north-west course to latitude 24 degree 36 minute and longitude 116 degree east which we reach by noon of the 7th a considerable tributary join at this point from the northward a compact sandstone range rest on a granite base -lrb- which be name the lockier range after mr lockier burgess one of the principal promoter of the expedition -rrb- here divert the course of the river to the left which by sundown we find be run nearly south the country for the last fifty mile vary but little in character extensive open plain alternate with low granite ridge the bank of the river which here have acquire a width of 100 yard with a depth of forty-six foot be in many place stony and cut down by deep muddy creek render travel both slow and laborious several tributary join from the north and south all of which have very recently cease to run to the north and east be several prominent peak and range of trap hill clothe with short herbage to the highest of the former a single conical peak with deeply serrated side be give the name of mount jame after my friend and fellow-traveller mr jame roe while two lofty summit far to the northward be call mount samuel and mount phillip the principal feed be find near the bank of the river the back country still yield only a scanty supply of a red-coloured silky grass of little value except when quite fresh a tree resemble the sycamore of the murchison but with the leaf arrange in triplet and the seed pod in the form of a large bean grow near the river and attain to two foot in diameter with a height of forty foot the wood be light and spongy something resemble the nuytsium floribunda but not gummy it be form by the native into shield and near the coast into canoe we also find on some of the rocky hill a tree with fruit and flower resemble a small fig the leaf like a lemon but yield a acrid milky juice several new species of crested quail and dark-brown pigeon be first observe here the beautiful small dove common in the northern district be also see by thousand gallinule and the elegant ochaphap plumafera -lrb- crested pigeon of the marsh -rrb- be also very numerous surprise a native camp 8th may pursue we course down the left bank we cross several stream-bed which drain the large tract of country between this and the murchison the gascoyne here divide into several broad sandy channel sometimes as much as a mile apart towards evening we come upon a native encampment few of the man appear to have return from they day 's hunting but we observe upward of thirty woman and child who run into the bed of the river to hide some of the woman immerse they child completely under water occasionally to prevent they cry of alarm attract we attention although we have before meet with and speak to several native this be the first opportunity we have of examine into they domestic economy around they fire of which there be many be range a number of wooden scoop capable of hold from two to four quart these contain a variety of seed and root the most plentiful be a species of grain like small plump drake gather from a grass much resemble wheat which be very abundant on the alluvial flat and a root resemble a onion not larger than a pistol bullet a few rat which be very numerous in the grassy flat and a small variety of samphire like a hottentot fig form the principal portion of they evening 's repast the few weapon leave by the man consist of heavy spear with from three to eighteen barb cut out of the solid wood the shaft from ten to twelve foot in length large shield resemble those in use by the native at champion bay make from the sycamore and few skin of the red kangaroo form they entire camp equipment a night attack leave everything as we find it we pass on about two mile and encamp for the night on a low sandy island in the bed of the river which be here full of flooded-gum of large growth there be just sufficient grass for we horse immediately around we fire by 9 o'clock we supper have be dispose of and i have just complete my observation for latitude when we hear the shout of a large party of native approach from the direction of they camp leave mr roe with two other to guard the camp i advance with mr moore and dugel to ascertain the object of they visit which we soon find to be evidently hostile as they come on rapidly all well arm to the number of sixty or seventy the woman and child retire to some rocky ground while the man advance light the large stack of drift which be abundant in this part of the river when within about forty yard they halt a moment as we have damp we fire and they could not exactly make out we position mr moore be in the act of remove he horse from the front when a fresh fire enable they to see we upon which ten or twelve of the lead man ship they spear be still desirous if possible of avoid a collision i hesitate to fire upon they but observe a large body of they advance with the evident intention of attack mr roe and he little party in charge of the camp i advance a few step and fire a charge of small shot at the lead man as they be in the act of throw at we the effect be instantaneous and most salutary as they flee with some precipitation some of they be evidently wound we mount extra guard for the remainder of the night but they do not again venture to attack we 9th may be Sunday we only move a few mile lower down the river for more grass and again find ourselves in close proximity to the native in the course of the day several of they make they appearance at the top of the hill overlook the camp but appear afraid to molest we they have with they several large white dog which be evidently of australian breed 10th may the river take a south-west course receive two large tributary from the south-east one of ninety and the other of fifty yard in width the flat be wider and large tree more abundant the recent flood have however be very destructive to the pasture and remove much of the soil for a considerable distance back from the river the trap hill here cease to appear the last remarkable one lay about ten mile south-east of we morning 's camp and have be name mount dalgetty we evening 's bivouac be find to be in latitude 25 degree 14 minute longitude 115 degree 30 minute east by account and its elevation 700 foot above the sea 11th may until noon we course along the river be nearly north-west sandstone begin to crop out on the bank and the country generally be poor and scrubby from we noon halt to sunset we course be nearly west we bivouac be in latitude 25 degree 2 minute the bed of the river have here widen out to 300 yard with a average depth of thirty foot a small stream run through the sand in the bottom in addition to the flooded-gum which grow here abundantly we observe in the bed of the river a melaleuca of large size like a paper-bark tree but have broad leaf resemble the eucalyptus during the night the native be very noisy in the vicinity some of they approach so close as to startle we horse keep we well on the alert the horse on this as on several other occasion appear to have be we principal safeguard against sudden attack friendly interview with native 12th may by the time we have commence load we horse a large body of native have collect and approach to reconnoitre we camp i advance towards they to keep they in check until the load be complete on observe that i come alone three native advance to meet I throw three or four spear at I in a friendly way which i pick up and stick in the ground by my side this token at once establish a good understanding and after a exchange of present they follow we for many mile down the river before quit we towards nightfall several of we friend of the morning again make they appearance with a number of strange native dodge we among the deep muddy ravine which abound at this part of the river they maneuver be equivocal and unsatisfactory we keep well on we guard they however run off at night on my face about on horseback to drive they away we course during the day have be nearly west twenty-two mile one large tributary have join the river from the northward which be afterwards name the lyon in honor of the gallant admiral of that name this accession have increase the breadth of the channel to 400 yard as we draw towards we evening 's bivouac the river enter a gorge form by the river cut through the south end of a flat-topped sandstone range of about 1200 foot elevation above the sea present many bold and picturesque outline and detach summit terminate in abrupt and almost precipitous face to this we give the name of the kennedy range in honor of we present governor to the south a detach mass of broken sandstone hill gradually fall away in the distance apparently into a barren scrub similar to those on the bank of the lower murchison while to the west lay before we a extensive plain unbroken by a single object save a few long ridge of red drift sand clothe with a stunt scrub of melaleuca and acacia the bottom of the gorge we find to be 480 foot above the sea 13th may from this morning to noon of the 15th the country pass over be similar to that first describe the sand ridge run north-west and south-east at about a quarter of a mile apart the river keep a general course of west-north-west its channel deepen to sixty foot and maintain a average width of 400 yard grass be only to be find in small patch along the margin of the river the accumulate water of the late inundation have be confine to one channel have rise to the height of forty-eight foot carry away many of the largest timber tree as also much of the soil from the bank leave a scene of devastation exceed anything of the kind i have hitherto witness a small description of spanish reed be here first observe to grow on the margin of the pool deep muddy creek have only short course be very numerous rendering travel both tedious and intricate from noon of the 15th the country gradually open out to a thinly-grassed plain of light alluvial soil atriplex bush and acacia widely scatter form almost the entire vegetation the ground with the exception of the bed of the river be parch and dry no rain have fall during the summer to the west of the lyon river in longitude 115 degree 30 minute east 16th may be Sunday we only move four mile lower down the river for better feed the channel widen out to 600 yard 17th may early to-day the river begin to throw off numerous channel to the north and south shed when in a flood a considerable amount of water over the adjoining plain clothing the country in the garb of spring the grass grow luxuriantly along the numerous channel atriplex and other low bush generally cover the plain the lowest level of which be extensively cover with field of mud from one to fourteen inch thick the deposit of a single inundation yet scarcely harden by the summer sun reach the coast at shark 's bay at twenty mile we ascend a sandy ridge of about sixty foot in height from which we have we first view of shark 's bay babbage island and the mouth of the gascoyne now only four mile distant behind the ridge upon which we stand and for many mile to the south-east the country be still under water from the recent flood while between we and the sea lay a low flat on which be many patch of acacia thicket alternate with open grassy glade or field of atriplex and samphire terminate to the westward in a broad irregular belt of mangrove rest on the shallow margin of the bay descend to the flat we encamp in a rank patch of grass on the bank of the river about a mile above babbage island the north end of which i find to be in latitude 24 degree 52 minute which be four mile north of the position as give by sir g gray kolaina plain 18th may we find no difficulty in cross the southern mouth on to babbage island the tide be low it be quite dry at the junction have with mr roe walk over the greater part of the island make a rough sketch of its outline and complete the requisite observation while the rest of the party be occupy in a unsuccessful attempt to catch fish we retrace we step and cross the main channel opposite we last night 's bivouac where it be not more than 250 yard wide continue we course north-east for nearly a mile we cross several back channel some trend towards the kolaina flat of sir g gray while other be lose in the deep sandy ravine that extend for some distance to the north of the river while on babbage island several native have wade across the northern mouth of the river to meet we and have return after a friendly interview in which they apparently describe the recent landing of two boat with european we now again fall in with the same native on the north bank near a large encampment of woman and child the latter quickly hide themselves on we approach but the man assume a threatening attitude follow we for some distance with much clamor as they number quickly augment and they appear determine to commence a fight we lead they out on to a open plain where leave the pack-horse in charge of two of the party four of we suddenly face about and charge they at a gallop this harmless maneuver have the desire effect several of they have narrowly escape be trodden under foot by the horse they be very quickly disperse and make no further attempt to molest we we encamp this night about six mile above babbage island 19th may as we object be to explore as far to the northward as circumstance would allow we leave the river on a north-east course but two hour ' ride across a open plain through which several channel run to the north-west bring we to dry barren scrub in which it appear hopeless we should find either feed or water we accordingly alter we course to south-east and make the river again about sundown return up the river 20th to 23rd may be occupy in trace up the north bank of the river in the hope of find a tributary come in from the northward but with the exception of one small stream which drain the western face of the kennedy range not a single tributary be meet with until we arrive at the lyon river a distance of more than ninety mile from babbage island the country on the north bank differ but little from that on the south except that travel be somewhat easier the lyon river alma river 24th may we horse have have a rest the previous day be Sunday we make a early start and by noon halt on the lyon river a short distance above its confluence with the gascoyne its channel here be equal in magnitude and similar in appearance to the main river a small stream be still flow through the wide sandy bed and gradually increase in volume for nearly eighty mile up the river three mile to the north of we midday halt mr roe and myself ascend a deep sandstone peak from which we have a fine view of the kennedy range the nearest part of which lay about six mile to the west extend for nearly thirty mile to the northward the eastern face present a almost unbroken line of nearly perpendicular sandstone of probably 500 or 600 foot elevation to the north a few remarkable peak serve as valuable point to carry on we triangulation which have be continue almost uninterruptedly from mount hope on the murchison to the east be several range of flat-topped hill fill in the space between the lyon and the great southern bend of the gascoyne while to the south with the exception of a few very distant peak it appear as far as the eye could reach to be a uniform plain of open but almost grassless scrub have complete we round of angle we strike south-east to a patch of forest on the bank of the river which we do not reach until sometime after dark 25th may from this point to latitude 23 degree 56 minute the lyon maintain a general course of north-north-east the country pass over during to-day have evidently be tolerably grassy but the flood have be quite as destructive here as on the gascoyne the bed of the river and flat for half a mile on each side be mostly choke up or bury under field of fine white sand which have be bring down by the inundation in several place we observe bed of gypsum and fossil shell with other strong indication of the existence of coal in the vicinity bivouac in latitude 24 degree 41 minute 18 seconds 26th may a few mile along the river bring we to a gorge in the eastern edge of the sandstone to the east of which it open out into extensive plain in some part well grass and in other much wash by the river several trap and granite hill be visible at some distance to the northward and eastward we bivouac be in latitude 24 degree 31 minute 05 seconds about three mile south of a bold trap-range the summit of which be name mount sandiman 27th may the country still maintain its variable character travel near the river be exceedingly heavy on account of the sand the morning have be calm and sultry but towards noon a strong breeze set in from the north bring with it a dense cloud of fine red dust against which it be no easy matter to make head with we horse towards evening the flat begin to improve and we halt for the night amongst fine grass melon and tobacco grow very luxuriantly to-night it rain for about two hour clear the atmosphere of its load of dust 28th may resume we course up the river at four mile we cross a stream-bed forty yard wide come in from the north-north-west and in the course of the day pass over several thin bed of opaque opalline rock rest upon the sandstone at we camp which be in latitude 24 degree 03 minute 08 seconds granite begin to make its appearance in the bed of the river 29th may we pack-horse have now be much lighten of they load we be to-day for the first time able to trot for several hour and as the country still improve several fine grassy valley come in from the eastward we make considerable progress alma river at we noon halt mr moore and myself ascend a hill of red schist of 300 or 400 foot elevation in latitude 23 degree 57 minute 15 seconds which have be name mount thompson from this hill we have a extensive view of the surrounding country close to the northern foot the river divide into two nearly equal part -- one come from the north-north-east we name the alma to the north just rest on the edge of the tropic lay a compact range through which there be apparently but one break and that be on the line of the alma from the southern face of this range which extend nearly forty mile to the eastward numerous stream take they rise and flow southward into the lyon which have alter its course and be now come from the east-south-east we intention have be to keep we course until we have touch upon the tropic but as the alma be not run we decide upon follow the main course of the stream and accordingly adopt a easterly course for the remainder of the day encamp about six mile to the east of mount thompson the river here be much narrower with a rocky bed contain many pool of permanent character overshadow by flooded-gum of large growth much resemble the eucalyptus piperita of the flat of the swan but not possess the same pungent leaf 30th may -lrb- Sunday -rrb- find we latitude to be 23 degree 58 minute 32 seconds and longitude 111 degree east by account 31st may native tobacco we start off at a quick pace clearing sixteen mile by noon over some fine open grassy flat timber for nearly a mile back from the river one tributary 100 yard wide have join from the north and a smaller one from the south leave the party busily occupy catch fish which be abundant in this part of the river and much resemble those find in the murchison but larger some of they be upward of a pound in weight i walk with mr nairn to the summit of a granite hill two mile to the northward from which i have a number of cross-bearing to hill already observe from mount thompson one of considerable elevation bearing north 121 degree 30 minute east distance fifty mile lay directly up the valley of the river and be ultimately name mount augustus after my brother now conduct the expedition in quest of the remains of dr leichhardt push on twelve mile further we halt for the night in latitude 23 degree 59 minute 39 seconds tobacco here grow to sufficient size for manufacture occupy many hundred acre of the best land a plant much resemble stramonium be also abundant on the moist land yield a strongly offensive odour from its leaf 1st June for the first twelve mile along the river the flat much improve and be only occasionally break up by stony ridge good country be see to extend up the tributary several of which come in from the north to the south at two or three mile distant and run parallel to the river for many mile be a even grassy range of moderate elevation nearly destitute of tree or bush the acacia and melaleuca which have hitherto generally cover the plain be evidently fast give way to a open undulating and thinly-grassed country the back land be however still too stony to yield much pasture the summer grass be already parch and dry the flat alone continue moist and verdant at we noon halt the main river have cease to flow but a tributary come from the north-east have a small stream still run in the bottom of a muddy channel down which the recent flood have bring flag and portion of bulrush the only instance throughout the district in which we have observe they the next ten mile pass over between this and sunset be chiefly a alluvial flat much resemble the fertile land near the mouth of the greenough the acacia and several variety of melaleuca amongst which be the callistemon phoeniceus with its beautiful scarlet flower be grow with tropical luxuriance the soil in many place be still saturate with moisture a water-melon be here first observe the fruit not attain to more than two inch in length but not otherwise differ from the cultivate kind we also find a fruit in shape like a pear three inch in length grow on a small creeper the interior of the fruit consist of a number of small flat seed to which be attach a bundle of long silky fiber resemble cotton we bivouac be in latitude 24 degree 7 minute 52 seconds near a fine pool of fresh water with limestone crop out in a thin bed on the bank we have frequently meet with it distribute in small nodule scatter over a large portion of the country on the upper murchison since quit the mouth of the gascoyne we have see native almost daily to-night we again find ourselves in close proximity to a large encampment of they 2nd June we neighbor pay we a early visit this morning some of they evidently bent on mischief but be restrain by other more prudent -- not however before it have nearly cost one of they he life have point a spear at mr moore dugel whose natural instinct be very destructive hastily take aim at he but fortunately pull the wrong trigger which just give he adversary time to lower he weapon on we mount we horse they hastily fall back and join they other companion at they camp which be just in we line of march about thirty of they await we approach with some token of defiance but most of they decamp on we come within spear 's throw mount augustus 3480 foot above sea level direct we course for mount augustus we push on at a rapid pace with the object of ascend it if possible before sundown but after ride twenty mile we find it to be farther off than we anticipate and accordingly altered we course and encamp at a pool in the river about three mile north-east of the mount in latitude 24 degree 20 minute and at a elevation of 1500 foot above the sea we here meet with strong evidence of the cannibalism of the native at a recently occupy encampment we find several of the bone of a full-grown native that have be cook the tooth mark on the edge of a bladebone bearing conclusive evidence as to the purpose to which it have be apply some of the rib be lie by the hut with a portion of the meat still on they nearly the whole of the country pass over this day be a alluvial flat extend on the south-west to the grassy range already describe while to the north and east it extend for many mile branch out into the numerous valley that drain the different range in that direction the grass and vegetation on these flat be not so rank as on that traverse the previous day but more even and the soil better adapt for agriculture the amount of good land on this part of the lyon river be estimate at 150 square mile while on the tributary between mount thompson and mount augustus i have no doubt that there be as much more water at this time be plentiful in the numerous channel that intersect the plain they permanency be the only matter of doubt -- we limited acquaintance with the nature of the season in these latitudes do not enable we to decide with any degree of certainty the pool lower down the river be unquestionably of a permanent character but many of they be already become brackish the quantity of game see in this part of the country be also a favourable indication turkey and a new variety of pigeon have a brown back and slate-coloured breast on the wing resemble a tame pigeon congregate in flight sometimes of a thousand together emu cockatoo quail and parakeet be also very numerous particularly the latter 3rd June a gentle ascent of two and a half mile bring we to the foot of mount augustus where leave we horse in charge of fairburn and dugel we commence the ascent up the only accessible point on this side of the hill it require two hour ' heavy toil to bring we to the summit the barometer gradually fall until it only register 2610 which compare with the simultaneous observation keep at champion bay by mr h gray give a elevation of 3480 foot above the level of the sea the last 500 foot of the summit be clothe in thicket of melaleuca amongst which grow a nondescript variety of red gum-tree the only new thing observe in this locality the air be fortunately very clear enable we to take bearing to almost every remarkable summit within eighty mile and in two instance to hill more than a hundred mile distant from this commanding position i be enable to sketch in the course of the river for more than twenty mile some of they probably take they rise from 60 to 100 mile still further to the eastward to the north-east the country continue to improve in appearance until the view be intercept by bold range of trap and granite -- one of which bearing north 32 degree east magnetic distant nearly 100 mile have a sharp volcanic outline rear its summit above all the rest to the south-east the country be not quite so promising the ridge present naked stony outline upon which be only a little scanty grass or a few bush to the south it be almost a uninterrupted plain extend nearly as far as the murchison river over which lay we homeward course descend the mount we encamp at a spring in some fine feed close at its foot return towards settlement 4th June as we have now be out fifty-one day and we provision be only calculate to last twenty-four day longer although we have reduce we allowance shortly after quit the geraldine mine we be reluctantly compel to turn we step homewards be still 360 mile from the settle district pass therefore over the eastern foot of mount augustus we pursue a south-south-east course for twenty mile over alternate grassy plain and stony ridge and encamp on the river with a sandy bed in which be a few shallow pool its trend bear north-north-west and probably join the gascoyne near the lockier range the feed on this river as well as on those between this and the murchison be principally kangaroo-grass of strong growth the course of the stream be easily traceable from a distance by the flooded-gum tree that invariably line they margin 5th June a south course of ten mile over a poor stony country bring we to the head of a stream which follow in the same direction to latitude 24 degree 51 minute 52 seconds we find plenty of feed on its bank and pool of water in its bed which be here thirty yard wide the principal feature of the adjacent country be low granite ridge intersect by occasional quartz dyke alternate with chlorite schist 6th June -lrb- Sunday -rrb- 7th June follow a south-south-east course at six mile the stream turn to the south-west passing over several mile of stony country in latitude 24 degree 59 minute 32 seconds we cross another stream-bed forty yard wide run to the westward and form a junction with the last at some mile distant towards sundown we come upon a recently inundate plain and a mile further strike a grassy channel thirty yard wide which have barely cease run the soil for some distance on either bank be a strong red loam yield a fair supply of pasture this channel we afterward find to be only one of several which form the main branch of the gascoyne the observe latitude be 25 degree 6 minute 30 seconds and elevation 1740 foot above the sea 8th June a mile farther we come upon the main channel of the river with a wide shallow bed down which a small stream be still run the flat be well grassed and the flooded-gum grow for more than a mile back from the river to the eastward the country continue level and grassy as far as the eye could reach we time be however too limited to admit of we make any further examination of this promising tract a party of twenty or thirty native be encamp here and be apparently live upon the root of the convolvulus which grow in the vicinity in great abundance for fifteen mile to the south-east it continue a level plain of red loam tolerably well grassed and cover with a open wood of acacia the next eight mile be over a poor stony ridge of moderate elevation terminate at a large dry stream-bed in latitude 25 degree 24 minute 16 seconds with some fine kangaroo-grass on its bank 9th June ten mile south over a granite country we strike the head of a watercourse which after wind about for sixteen mile run close to the western foot of mount gould where we encamp at its junction with another small stream come from the northward the country pass over to-day be generally very stony until we come within a few mile of mount gould 10th June take we course direct for mount hale the pasture rapidly improve at ten mile the watercourse we have be follow form a junction with the main murchison come in from the eastward from the appearance of the river at this point it be probable that it take its rise nearly another 100 mile farther to the north-east the next thirteen mile down the river be fair average cattle pasture extend for several mile to the right and leave open flat of atriplex and samphire occur at interval 11th June the river soon divide into several channel shed its water over a fine alluvial flat of considerable extent yield a rich sward of grass under flooded-gum of large growth a little after noon we come upon we outward track and encamp at night near the north-west bend of the murchison down the murchison 12th to 22nd June be occupy in descend the river to the geraldine mine cut off several bend of the river and make such addition to we sketch of the outward route as circumstance would admit return to perth 23rd June we all arrive safe at the hospitable residence of mr w burge on the irwin the follow day be occupy in make up the account connect with the expedition which include the whole of the cash expenditure do not exceed 40 pound which sum have already be subscribe by a few settler interested in the undertaking quit the irwin on the 1st of July and proceed by way of dandaragan and toodyay i arrive with mr roe and chainer fairburn in perth on the 10th instant have accomplish a journey of nearly 2000 mile in 107 day on review the foregoing report i find it necessary to add a few observation on subject that could not well be introduce into the body of the narrative geology of country in the first place view the geographical and geological feature in combination the tract of country contain within the 114th and 118th parallel of longitude and the 24th and 27th degree of south latitude may be consider as a inclined plane the eastern edge of which have a elevation of about 1700 foot above the level of the sea commence from the coast the first 100 mile be almost exclusively of tertiary sandstone formation which the process of denudation have in many instance convert into either stony or sandy tract rarely fertile except when subject to the influence of frequent inundation this region seldom give rise to river or watercourse the flat-topped range which be often find towards the eastern limit of this formation do not generally exceed 500 or 600 foot in altitude and be only those portion of country that have not as yet yield to the waste of time or the constant action of river which rise in the higher land more to the eastward rapidly abrade and in they onward course remove the soft and porous sandstone from they basis in the deeper valley towards the eastern edge of these sandstone thin bed of oolitic limestone contain numerous fossil shell occasionally occur also gypsum and clayey shale with other indication of the probable existence of coal in the vicinity follow the series appear a compact fine-grained amorphous sandstone have a almost flinty fracture this rock in a few mile give place to granite and gneiss frequently break up by the upheaval of whinstone and porphyritic trap hill have a elevation of from 100 to 500 foot above the plain as we proceed eastward the eruptive rock become more numerous chlorite slate vein of quartz chert and variegated jasper frequently form the summit of the most elevated hill while on the general level of the plain be occasionally find thin bed of ancient lava the river unlike most other in western australium have nearly a even fall throughout they entire length amounting on a average to six foot per mile this in a country subject to the sudden fall of almost tropical rain be what give rise to the destructive inundation already describe climate of the climate and season so little be at present know that allow all other difficulty to have be overcome it would be very hazardous to risk flock and herd beyond the head of the murchison until the country have again be visit at a different period of the year as it be probably that it have as yet only be see under the most favourable condition the fluctuation of the temperature be occasionally considerable in the middle of June it some day amount to 46 degree in six hour -- register at 7 be 36 degree and at 1 pm 82 degree ice have be see as far north as latitude 24 degree 30 minute the prevailing wind during the period of inundation appear to have be from the south-east as most of the tree blow down while the soil be in a state of saturation lay with they top to the north-west in may and June the wind range between north-east and south-east of the regularity of the return of the summer rain it be at present difficult to form a decide opinion but as far as observation would admit i be incline to think they can not be rely on with any degree of certainty to the southward of the 25th degree of latitude the period at which they fall be about January and February it be a significant fact that the grass find bury beneath the mud during these month have generally attain only to nearly half they growth area of available country with regard to the quantity and distribution of the available land it will only be necessary to observe that with the exception of 30000 or 40000 acre at the mouth of the gascoyne there be no land worth occupy for many year to come to the west of the lyon river the amount of land on this river have already be estimate at nearly 300 square mile while on the upper gascoyne and its tributary there be probably double that quantity this with the land on the murchison near mount hale would make a total of about a million of acre a very important circumstance in connection with this district be the total absence so far as we be able to observe of any of the variety of gastrolobium or euphorbium which constitute the poisonous plant so fatal to cattle and sheep in other part of the colony the means of access to the upper gascoyne and lyon be another important matter for consideration i be incline to think that this district can not be advantageously settle until the tract of country between it and the north coast have be explore and a port establish somewhere between exmouth gulf and depuch island as should the country in that direction fulfil its promise the intervene space would very quickly be fill up and the land on the gascoyne become available its distance from the north coast be about 200 mile while from port gregory or champion bay would not be less than from 340 to 360 mile -- a difference of some moment in the transport of store or produce from the lay of the country to the northward of the lyon river there do not appear to be any reason to suppose that a river of any magnitude fall into exmouth gulf as there would be hardly room for it between the source of the alma and the river flow to the north coast i can not bring my report to a conclusion without record my acknowledgment to mr jame roe for the able and effective assistance he have render I throughout the expedition the barometrical observation and management of the provision department have be especially under he charge my best thanks be also due to mr wd moore and mr c nairn who on every occasion endeavor to relieve I as much as possible from some of the many arduous duty that usually devolve on the leader of a explore party chainer fairburn and the native dugel also give general satisfaction in the performance of they respective duty i may add that to the ready cooperation and unanimity that prevail throughout the party may in no small degree be ascribe the successful issue of the undertaking i have the honor to be sir etc ft gregory assistant

valuable pastoral country that have be find on the gascoyne river and its tributary attract the attention of a number of english capitalist interested in cotton manufacture which be then in a very depressed condition in consequence of the civil war in america it be propose to establish a new colony on the north-west coast of australium have for its special object the cultivation of cotton advantage be take of the presence of mr f gregory in london to urge on the home government and the royal geographical society the desirability of fitting out a expedition to proceed direct to the north-west coast of australium accompany by a large body of asiatic labourer and all the necessary appliance for the establishment of a colony under the advice of captain roe surveyor-general of western australium and other gentleman well acquaint with the subject the scheme be modify so as to have the country explore as a preliminary to actual settlement and for this purpose a grant of 2000 pound be obtain from the imperial government to be supplement by a equal subsidy by the colonial treasury accordingly mr gregory obtain a suitable outfit for the party in london and early in 1861

it become dark pull about two mile to the south-east it gradually shoal to one foot when we ground and remain there till 11 pm when the tide be at full we pull for the ship but not see she light by 1 be on the 12th and the man be much fatigue we lay on we oar for a hour and then take a stretch for two mile to the south-south-east to get under the shelter of the south-east shore of the bay when have no anchor we lay-to till daylight by which time the boat have drift into heavy roller under the high rocky land at the south-west head of the bay the wind have rise so much that the boat be only keep afloat by keep she head to the sea as we could not observe any spot at which we could land without the risk of swamp the boat and wet we firearm we continue pull towards the ship the ebb tide assist we until 2 pm when just as all hand be become thoroughly tire out a boat be send from the dolphin to we relief with a timely supply of biscuit and brandy which with the assistance of a tow-line enable we to reach the ship by 3 pm very thankful that we have escape what at one time appear likely to have prove a serious disaster landing effect 13th may in the morning it blow so fresh from the eastward that captain dixon do not like to move the vessel until 2 pm when we stand to the south for about four mile and come to anchor in four fathom take the life-boat and cutter both well-manned we pull south to the shore about three mile the water gradually shoal until at half a mile from the shore the boat ground on a sandbank from which we walk through mud shell and coral to a belt of mangrove about fifty yard through behind which rise a sandbank about thirty foot high cover with flower and coarse grass from this to the foot of a range of rugged metamorphic sandstone a distance of half a mile be a open undulating loamy plain cover with grass just arrive at maturity a few small wattle hakea and white-gum tree as the sun have now set we have only just time to ascend a few hundred foot up the rocky ridge from which elevation could be discern a sheet of water about a mile to the eastward which we attempt to reach but it become so dark that it be find better to return to the boat which be now high and dry by 8 pm the tide have rise sufficiently to admit of captain dixon 's return to the dolphin while i remain with a portion of my own party to make further examination in the morning the leaky state of the cutter keep one of we bail through the night 14th may with messr turner brown harding and brockman land at 7 be and walk to the sheet of water observe last night but find it only a tidal inlet terminate in a salt marsh continue on we course for five mile to the south-east across a grassy plain the soil be a light brown loam with occasional patch of quartz and gneiss pebble and bed of limestone in irregular nodule in a hour and a half arrive at a deep stony watercourse contain some small pool of brackish water this stream be follow up to the southward about a mile but find to be dry and do not appear to come from a greater distance than twenty mile this river be name the nickol the country to the south not be very promising we turn to the westward recross the plain more to the south pass several hollow in which the rainwater have very recently rest leave a rich alluvial deposit from which have spring up a splendid sward of grass which be still quite green not meet with water in this direction and the party not be yet in full training we be glad to return to the boat which be reach by 2 pm the tide be now in enable she to come in close to the beach the rise be find to be about sixteen foot by 50 we have return to the ship all tolerably well fatigue with we first day 's march on shore interview with native 15th may not be satisfy to land the horse on a shore devoid of water i determine to attempt a landing in a small sandy cove in the high rocky shore on the west of the bay which we have be afraid to enter during the gale on the 12th leave the ship with two boat and provision for the day we pull for the little cove about four mile distant bear west by north for the first three mile the sounding do not show less than three fathom with a even sandy bottom the last mile shoaling gradually to the beach the landing be easily effect as there now be but little surf the shore be find to be generally very sandy a low flat valley extend from the head of the cove across the isthmus about two mile to mermaid strait where it terminate in a muddy mangrove creek in about half a hour several well be find some contain rather brackish water but one about eight foot deep in a hollow under a steep range of bare volcanic and granite hill not more than 200 yard from the beach be find to contain a abundant supply of good water grass be plentiful and of fine quality in the valley under the hill we principal requirement be now satisfied it only remain to bring the ship in near enough to land the horse on we return to the dolphin we find that she have be visit by two native who have paddle off on log of wood shape like canoe not hollow but very bouyant about seven foot long and one foot thick which they propel with they hand only they leg rest on a little rail make of small stick drive in on each side at first they be afraid to come on board but on friendly sign be make they ascend the ladder that have be put down for they they be both fine-looking man of about forty year of age above the middle stature one measure six foot four inch and the other five foot eight inch they hair straight and black tooth regular and general feature characteristic of the tribe on the west coast they body be rather more spare and have not on they a vestige of clothing the champion bay dialect be quite incomprehensible to they they however know the use of both biscuit and tobacco some of which be give they after remain several hour on board they take they departure for the eastern shore of the bay distant at least six mile promising by sign to repeat they visit the next day it be worthy of remark that neither of these native be circumcise or have lose the front tooth as be common on this coast further to the eastward they fearlessness and confidence in the good faith of european would lead to the impression that this be not they first acquaintance with vessel on the coast it be not far from this place that captain pp king have a visit from native similarly equip more than forty year ago while on shore to-day several new and very beautiful plant and flower be observe amongst they one in particular which without exception be the handsomest shrub i have ever see in australium in form the plant resemble a large chandelier with a series of branch spring from a center stem in set of five each on these be short erect stem a few inch apart carry five beautiful deep crimson dragon flower nearly three inch in length group like lustre produce a very gorgeous effect the leaf of the plant be elegantly form like those of the mountain ash and be of a rich green a purple flowering bean the seed of which be the size of the english horse-bean be here find in abundance and be eat by the native melon similar to those formerly see by I on the gascoyne several variety of brachychiton a small variety of the adansonium three or four different kind of convolvulus -lrb- one of which run along the sand near the beach with arm sometimes as much as forty yard in length -rrb- acacia sterculium and a variety of eucalyptus resemble a stunt red-gum be also find grow among the hill in small quantity accident from careless use of firearm 16th may early this morning the dolphin be move to within three mile of the cove visit yesterday and anchor in two and a half fathom at the lowest water the landing place bearing west by north by 110 be the first pair of horse be hoist out and place in the water under the counter of the cutter two other boat assist in tow we to the shore which occupy about a hour the horse on landing be scarcely able to stand from the length of time they be in the water on reach the beach a serious accident occur to mr hearson the second mate of the vessel result from the negligence of jame the farrier who notwithstanding my repeat caution to all the member of the expedition to keep snapper on the lock of the gun have omit to do so in consequence of which on its be hand out the hammer catch on the gunwale of the boat and discharge a ball through both the hip of the mate cause he to fall in the water which circumstance fortunately tend materially to stop the hemorrhage he be immediately carry to a sheltered spot and a tent pitch over he on examine the wound i find the ball have enter the right posterior pass close below the joint and take a oblique direction through the lower edge of the pelvis make its exit in front of the left thigh between the femoral artery and the principal tendon without injure either this mishap and the freshening of the breeze prevent we landing any more horse to-day the remainder of it be spend in make a camp and attend to the comfort of we wounded companion who occasion I some anxiety as the treatment must entirely devolve upon myself who possess but a very limited amount of experience in matter of this nature 17th may four more horse be safely land this morning and we be return to the vessel for another pair when a party of fourteen native make they appearance at the camp at first they come boldly up but on a gun be discharge as a signal for my recall they appear much alarmed although they would not go away we number be small i determine not to allow they to enter the camp on account of they propensity to thieve and the few that could now be spare to guard the store be insufficient to keep a constant watch on they stealthy movement i therefore try at first to make they understand that we have take possession for the present and do not want they company they be however very indignant at we endeavor to drive they away and very plainly order we off to the ship it be very evident that we forbearance be mistake for weakness and that mischief be prepare i accordingly take hold of one of the most refractory and compel he to march off at double-quick time when they all retire to some rocky hill overlook we camp from which it be necessary to dislodge they take mr brown with I we climb the first hill which make they retreat to the next rest ourselves for a few minute and take a view of the surrounding country we be just on the point of return to the camp when we observe three armed native steal down a ravine to the horse evidently with hostile intention as they ship they spear on get close enough to throw we do not however give they time to accomplish they object as we run down the hill in time to confront they on which they take to the rock see that it be now time to convince they we be not to be trifle with and to put a stop at once to what i saw would otherwise terminate in bloodshed we both take deliberate aim and fire a couple of bullet so close to the principal offender that he could hardly escape feel the effect of the fragment of lead as they split upon the rock within a few foot of he body after dark it set in to rain heavily for a hour when light be observe move in the direction of we horse but the sentry be on the alert no further attempt be make to molest we 18th may two more horse be land this morning but rain setting in from the north-west with a strong easterly wind below a stop be put to land any more to-day 19th may -lrb- Sunday -rrb- it have rain both heavily and continuously during the night but as we tent be good we do not experience much inconvenience from it and it give a fair prospect of find a good supply of water on we contemplated trip into the interior mr hearson 's wound be progress favourably and i be in consequence enable to go off to the ship and procure a few additional comfort on we return two more horse be bring ashore reduce the number on board to one-half 20th may we succeed in landing six more horse during the day the great distance they have to be swam ashore make the process very slow and fatiguing some of the horse be scarcely able to stand for some time after landing this morning i make a rough survey of the cove and surround hill and while so employ observe seventeen native pass across the shoal at low water carry net but no weapon they do not appear to fear we or incline to come up to the camp nor do we offer they any encouragement as in the present exposed state of we camp they would have be very troublesome in the evening mr brown and myself ride across the isthmus to mermaid strait and find it to form a very fine and romantic-looking little harbor surround by a bold rocky coast give it much more the appearance of a inland lake than a open strait i have no doubt but that it would afford a excellent harbor there be however reason to think it be equally difficult of access from the main with the cove upon which we camp be as a wide expanse of marsh land appear to extend all round behind the hill that bind it to the southward 21st may the last four horse be land this morning as also the instrument and remainder of the store require for we first journey the farrier with two assistant be keep busily employ all day shoe horse preparation for journey inland 22nd may the forge be in full employ during the day and great progress make with the shoeing and preparation for we departure accompany by mr brown i ride out to-day to reconnoitre and seek for a pass through the hill that encompass we camp the only practical outlet we find to be through some very rocky ravine to the south-west where at about five mile we find -- what i have for some time suspect to be the case -- that the whole of the isthmus upon which we have land be cut off from the mainland by a extensive salt-water marsh commence at the bottom of nickol bay and run parallel to the general line of coast at least as far as enderby island skirt the northern edge of the marsh for several mile to the westward we find it gradually get wider and deeper we accordingly return to the narrowest part and ride into it for about half a mile the water be very shallow and the bottom sufficiently firm to carry we although with considerable labor to the horse find it be get late we determine to try and return to the camp round by the head of nickol bay and succeed in climb over the rock and boulder that encumber this portion of the coast until we be within a quarter of a mile of the camp when the tide come in upon we so quickly that after have be repeatedly throw down by the surf we be compel to leave the horse jam up in the rock just above high-water mark and proceed on foot to the camp 23rd may at 30 be the tide have fall sufficiently messr brown and harding be enable to bring in the horse leave imprison last night during the day all the arrangement for we departure be complete and in the afternoon mr hearson be remove to the dolphin have be keep on shore since the accident to be constantly under my own attendance he be now rapidly recover although much reduce write instruction for the guidance of captain dixon and mr walcott during the absence of the expedition the latter gentleman be leave in charge of the store and to make such observation as the means at he disposal should admit of 24th may land at daylight intend to make a start as it be the queen 's birthday but owe to some of the horse have ramble we do not succeed in get they all in and saddle up before 20 pm when three or four of the horse that have not be accustom to carry pack commence play up and scatter they load in all direction strain and otherwise injure several of the pack-saddle which detain we until so late in the day that i deem it best to return to camp and as the forge have not be remove to the ship to shorten some of the saddle-iron to render they less liable to injury which be otherwise a great improvement 25th may the re-adjustment have be satisfactorily accomplish we make a fair start this morning by 90 be and arrive on the edge of the marsh by 1130 where have first take a survey of the several channel from the summit of a high granite hill we enter the waste of mud at a point where it do not appear to be more than two mile wide a hour 's struggle carry we fairly through on to terra firma only one horse have to be assist by the removal of he load after rest a hour and a half for dinner we resume we route in a south direction across a extensive low grassy plain of red clayey loam pass over a few rocky ridge at sunset and at 6 pm encamp on a dry creek twenty yard wide water be find in some clay-pan in the adjoining plain camp 2 maitland river 26th may be Sunday the camp be only move a mile further to a fine pool of water in a river eighty yard wide with beautiful grassy bank which i name the maitland it come from the south-east and may probably have a course of sixty mile come through a plain five or six mile wide the greater part of which be occasionally inundate by flood from the interior cockatoo and other game be plentiful sixteen of the former be kill by mr brockman at one shot they be white with orange-tinted feather in the crest similar to those on the murchison and gascoyne river it may be as well here to observe that upon first start a regular routine of duty have be establish in the party the care and loading of five horse be tell off to each two of the party as they could lift on opposite pack simultaneously and they be all number everyone could at once know the load under he charge the night be also divide into eight watch commence at 8 pm and end at 6 be the duty of the first watch be to cook the bread for the follow day and the last to have breakfast ready in the morning by the time it be light enough to see by this arrangement no time be lose and everyone know what be under he particular charge camp 3 sudden flood 27th may have determine in the first instance to strike to the westward with a view to cut any large river come from the interior that might serve to lead we through the rocky hill that hem we in in that quarter we this morning take a south-south-west by south course to 1140 be when we cross a dry stream-bed sixty yard wide come out of the granite range to the southward the country become more barren as we edge upon the spur of the rocky hill at 20 pm we halt on the bank of another stream-bed of the same size as the last when it come on to rain resume we march at 410 steering west to 60 when we encamp on a dry gully with a little feed near it have pitch the tent it continue to rain until 110 pm when a sudden rush of water sweep down the valley fill the watercourse and carry away we fire and before we have time to remove the baggage to higher ground we have a foot of water in the camp fortunately nothing be lose or injure and it only serve as a useful lesson for the future camp 4 28th may the early part of the day be employ dry the store so that we do not make a start until late four and a half hour ' travel over stony country principally cover with triodium but contain several patch of good grass bring we to another river fifty yard wide in which be a few pool this stream be follow up to 5 pm when we leave it and halt on a open plain close to some shallow clay-pan contain rainwater we course for the day have be about south-west eleven mile camp 5 latitude 21 degree 7 minute 29th may by a azimuth of the sun 's center take this morning the magnetic variation be observe to be about 20 minute west steer north 230 degree east magnetic soon bring we out of the hill into a plain extend as far as the eye could reach to the north-west with a few patch of good grass upon it but mostly cover with triodium which be now just ripe yield fine head of seed which the horse be very fond of at thirteen mile strike the channel of a considerable river come from the south as this offer we a fair prospect of work inland and we have already attain nearly to longitude 116 degree or about the meridian of the mouth of the alma the stream be follow up for a hour its average breadth be over 200 yard at 440 encamp at a fine spring on the bank of a deep pool under a cliff of metamorphic sandstone nearly 300 foot high a cane much resemble a spanish red grow in considerable quantity near the water camp 6 latitude 21 degree 18 minute longitude 116 degree 4 minute surprise a camp of native 30th may soon after start this morning we come upon a camp of fifteen or twenty native on the bank of a deep reach of water hem in by steep rocky hill up which they hastily scramble on we approach and on reach the summit try by various gesture to express they disapproval of we visit but would not hold any parley with we at five mile the river turn abruptly to the north-east through a precipitous rocky defile which induce we to make a attempt to cut across and strike the river some mile higher up but after be for some time involve in impracticable ravine we be again oblige to have recourse to the bed of the river although encumber with bed of large stone over which the horse have great difficulty in travel so that by sunset we have not accomplish more than six mile in a direct east by south line from last night 's camp camp 7 latitude 21 degree 19 minute 29 seconds 31st may the general course of the river during the day be very little to the south of east its bank still maintain the same rocky and precipitous character mark of inundation be frequently observe at the height of thirty foot above the present stream which now be only run gently in a channel not more than thirty yard wide but when in flood occupy the whole of the valley which average a quarter of a mile in width the larger pool be line with flag and reed and contain number of small fish resemble trout similar to those find in the lyon and gascoyne river a very handsome tree resemble a ash grow on the margin bear a beautiful white flower four to five inch across have on the inside a delicate tinge of yellow and yield a sweet scent like violet several native be meet in the course of the day but would not come near we in one instance however we come upon one so suddenly that he have only time to jump into a pool to escape be surround by the party after call for some time most lustily for he friend he gradually creep away amongst the cane and disappear only one tributary of any size be observe to join the river in the course of the day 's march and that come in from the southward at 520 pm halt on the bank of a deep pool surround by fine cajeput-tree and flooded-gum grass be plentiful for we horse camp 8 encounter difficult country 1st June there be a decide improvement in the appearance of the valley as we continue to ascend the river the deep pool be more continuous and grass more abundant the high land on either bank still however retain they rugged outline and be clothe with little else but triodium travel along the bed of the river be nevertheless difficult and dangerous for the horse on account of the immense quantity of rounded boulder of water-worn rock that occupy a large portion of the channel and frequently jam the horse into narrow pass where they could not be extricate without meeting with very severe fall which very soon cripple more than one of they they shoe also begin to be wrench off by be catch in the deep cleft of the rock very soon expend all the extra set bring with we just before come to we night 's halt a large stream-bed forty yard wide be observe to come in from the southward camp 9 latitude 21 degree 28 minute 18 seconds longitude 116 degree 31 minute by account 2nd June -lrb- Sunday -rrb- have abundance of feed and water we gladly avail ourselves of it to make it a day of rest it also afford I a opportunity to ascertain the rate of the chronometer which as i have reason to expect have go very irregularly since landing 3rd June make a early start and as the valley of the river be not quite so rugged as that we have pass over during the last two or three day by noon we have accomplish about eight mile the course of the river still be very little from the southward of east we have not therefore make much progress towards the lyon river -lrb- we more immediate destination -rrb- and to quit the valley be out of the question as there be no feed or water out of it within a reasonable distance both the valley and surround country be destitute of tree and bold hill of metamorphic sandstone frequently jut out into the valley and terminate in perpendicular cliff 200 or 300 foot high towards the evening the river have be come from the northward of east camp 10 latitude 21 degree 27 minute 48 seconds 4th June during the forenoon the river become much hem in by steep rocky hill the bed be a succession of rapid over a bare rocky channel but after the noon halt the stream come more from the south-east with wide grassy flat on either side in many part very boggy and produce melaleuca leucodendron with tall straight stem and a variety of eucalyptus resemble eucalyptus piperita white sandstone and shale begin to make they appearance on the bank and the water in the river have a saline taste several of the horse begin to show sign of be much distressed by fall and stick fast in the mud from which they have not strength to extricate themselves even after be relieve of they load duck be plentiful and tolerably tame camp 11 latitude 21 degree 33 minute 55 seconds longitude 117 degree 2 minute by account sandstone cliff 5th June have mark a large double-stemmed gum-tree with na and the date we make a start up the river but at about a mile find the valley narrow in until the channel of the river which be here full of water be wall in on both bank by perpendicular cliff from which we be compel to turn back nearly to we last night 's camp during the last two day we have catch a occasional glimpse of a elevated range of hill extend for many mile parallel to the river and about ten mile to the southward which render it probable that some change would now be find in the character of the back country enable we to travel without be so frequently retard by the rock and bend of the river a suitable spot be accordingly select for ascend out of the valley which be accomplish with some difficulty when the country be observe to be intersect for many mile by deep ravine terminate however to the south in a level plain extend to the base of the range already refer to after four hour ' heavy toiling we at length reach the summit of the plain water have be find in one of the rocky gully by the way for the first half-mile on enter the plain or tableland the ground be stony and cover with stunt acacia but it very quickly change into a rich clayey loam yield a splendid crop of kangaroo and other grass melon and small white convolvulus yield a round black seed the size of a pea which we find scatter over nearly the whole surface of the plain for mile together in the lower part of the flat rainwater appear to have remain in shallow clay-pan until very recently kill much of the grass which be replace by atriplex bush as we approach the foot of the range the ground become stony and cover with triodium good grass be still however to be find in the ravine lead out of the hill and as we object be now to shape a course to the southward we follow up one of the most promising valley in the hope that it might lead we through the range we be however disappoint in find that after push some distance up very steep and rocky pass they all terminate in cliff of horizontal sandstone run in parallel band one above another to the height of 500 or 600 foot and frequently extend without a break for ten or fifteen mile along the face of the range the horse be much fatigue by the climb from the valley of the river we encamp at 310 pm within the hill and without water camp 12 fine grassy plain fortescue river 6th June a light drizzling rain come on early in the morning but not enough to supply the horse who ramble so far during the night in search of it that it be noon before they be all collect quit the range which have be name after one of the most liberal promoter of the expedition hamersley range we take a north-east course cross over twelve or fourteen mile of beautiful open grassy plain in many part the kangaroo-grass reach above the horse ' back the soil being of the richest clay-loam occasionally contain bed of singular fragment of opaline rock resemble ancient lava by 530 pm we reach the river again several mile above the deep glen that have check we course on the 5th the valley have again open out give we easy access to its bank which be here a rich black peat soil contain numerous spring here be first observe a very handsome fan-palm grow in tope some of they attain to the height of forty foot and twenty inch diameter the leaf measure eight to ten foot in length the river have again open into deep reach of water and contain abundance of fish resemble cobbler weigh four and five pound each the whole character of the country be evidently change for the better and as i have no doubt that at no distant period it will become a rich and thriving settlement i name the river the fortescue after the under secretary of state for the colony under whose auspices the expedition take its origin and the large expanse of fertile plain that lie between the river and the hamersley range chichester downs 7th June a quarter of a mile up the river bring we to a fine tributary from the south run strong enough to supply a large mill this have to be trace up for two mile before we could find a ford it be find to take its rise in several deep pool feed by spring issue out of the plain cross yesterday some powerful spring be also observe to flow into the river from the northward through a dense forest of melaleuca with a rank undergrowth of cane flag etc at five mile the river again present a wide reach of water several mile in length after which it all at once break up into numerous channel wander through a forest of white-gum well grass the soil be highly fertile owe to my have be accidentally trodden upon by one of the horse we be oblige to encamp early have only make about twelve mile camp 14 latitude 21 degree 40 minute 42 seconds longitude by account 117 degree 17 minute east 8th June follow up the channel upon which we have encamp in about a hour it be lose in open grassy plain which we continue to traverse until noon when we strike on a well-defined stream-bed which have branch off a mile or two south of last night 's camp grass and water be abundant we halt till 2 when we resume a easterly route to 530 over rather stony plain yield triodium encamp after dark without water or feed tie the horse up short to prevent they rambling have accomplish about twenty mile in a east-south-east direction during the day camp 12 latitude 21 degree 49 minute 40 seconds 9th June -lrb- Sunday -rrb- less than a mile this morning bring we to a grassy channel contain water which be follow up for a short distance when we halt for the remainder of the day to refresh we tired and famished horse camp 16 a native child 10th June the channel of the river be still follow for several mile to the eastward when it again disappear in open plain extend to the base of the hamersley range which still continue to run parallel to the river at about seven mile distance to the southward pool of water be occasionally find in channel scoop out of the alluvial soil of which the plain be compose -- the water of the fortescue during the period of the summer rain spread over the country for mile and leave a rich deposit of alluvial mud add greatly to its fertility in the course of the afternoon we come suddenly on a party of native digging root one woman with a child of about five year of age hide close to we line of march and do not move until she be afraid of be run over by the pack-horse when she run away leave the child gaze upon the monster intruder with a look of passive wonder it be a poor ill-conditioned-looking object suffering from a cutaneous disorder on give it a piece of damper it quickly begin to devour it tear it to fragment with its sharp and attenuate finger with all the keenness of a hawk we leave it stand with a lump of bread in each hand where its mother would no doubt find it when she come to see what have be leave of it by the large dog as the aborigine of this part of australium call we horse travel on till late we encamp in a open grassy plain without water camp 17 latitude 21 degree 55 minute 57 seconds longitude 118 degree 3 minute rocky range 11th June four mile to the south-east we come upon a pool of brackish water surround with bulrush in a channel come from the south of the hamersley range again apparently offer we a chance of get to the southward we accordingly strike for the gorge out of which this stream come and succeed in penetrate for three mile up a very rocky gully fill with some of the harshest triodium we have yet encounter and have to halt for the night in a narrow pass where there be scarcely room to tie up we horse camp 18 latitude 22 degree 12 minute 52 seconds ascend the range 12th June one of the horse have slip he halter during the night messr brown and brockman return down the gully to track it up while we make a attempt to follow up the deep defile in which we be hem but a quarter of a mile bring we to a impassable barrier of cliff retrace we step about a mile we again make a attempt more to the eastward and this time succeed in reach a considerable stream-bed which ultimately prove to be the main channel of the fortescue and lead we through the range rest till noon messr brown and brockman overtake we with the missing horse when we resume we route up the bed of the river to the southward until again bring to a dead stand by the whole bed of the stream be occupy by deep pool of water feed by numerous strong spring as it be get late in the day i leave the party to form a camp while i climb the hill to get a view of the country in advance a laborious ascent of nearly a hour bring I to one of the highest summit of the range at a elevation of about 2700 foot above the sea and 700 above the bed of the river from this hill i have a fine view to the southward and observe that by follow up a small dry ravine to the south-east there would be a fair prospect of reach a large extent of open level plain that come within two or three mile of the camp in that direction to the east and south-east the range be lofty and mountainous while to the south and south-west stretch open grassy plain occasionally interrupt by bold detach hill apparently of the same formation as the hamersley range on descend to the camp i start a fragment of rock of a few ton weight which rush with fearful velocity towards the deep gorge in which the horse be feed after carry all before it for a quarter of a mile it make a clear spring over a cliff 200 foot in depth and plunge into the water below with a sound like thunder induce a belief at the camp that a large portion of cliff have fall fortunately it do not produce a estampede which i have know to have be cause on another occasion by a similar occurrence camp 19 latitude 22 degree 15 minute longitude 118 degree 4 minute 30 seconds 13th June avail ourselves of the observation make yesterday we succeed after a hard scramble of two hour in get through the remain portion of the range we horse have learn to climb like goat or they never would have accomplish the passage the plain appear to have a considerable elevation above those to the northward and be drain by several deep break through the hamersley range resume a south-south-west course to latitude 22 degree 26 minute 32 seconds we pass at first over some very stony land yield little else besides triodium and stunt acacia but for the last six or seven mile be a rich alluvial clay cover with very fair pasture and water be find in abundance in pool in the bed of a watercourse come from the south-east camp 20 latitude 22 degree 26 minute 58 seconds 14th June on we first landing at nickol bay the night have be very mild but we now begin to feel they cold and brace this be partly owe to the increase elevation of the country we be now travel over the south-east wind come off the mountainous country be very keen and almost frosty early in the morning we course this day be at first over tolerably good country which gradually become more and more rocky the ridge increase in elevation until the aneroid barometer fall to 2733 give a altitude of 2400 foot above the sea night overtake we in a deep rocky ravine where we have much difficulty in keep the pack-horse together and be at last compel to unload they amongst rock in the bed of a dry watercourse trend to the westward a little grass be procurable in the vicinity fortunately water have be meet with at noon so that we be not press for want of it camp 21 latitude 22 degree 41 minute 43 seconds 15th June follow the gully upon which we have encamp it lead we to the westward over a rocky line of country until 1 pm when not meet with any water and the horse show great weakness and symptom of distress from the loss of they shoe it be find desirable to quit the main gully and try and find feed and water up a promising tributary come from the north with the view of ultimately fall back on the plain under the hamersley range should we fail to meet with water sooner fortunately however in a hour we come upon a small supply amongst rock surround by some tolerable feed have we fail to find this timely relief it be probable that not more than half the horse would have be able to carry they load to the nearest known waterhole camp 22 16th June -lrb- Sunday -rrb- this day of rest be alike acceptable to man and horse and afford I a opportunity after read prayer to the party to clear a set of lunar distance by which i find that the chronometer would have place we forty mile to the west of we true position i have long since observe that it could not be trust under even ordinary variation of temperature but could procure no other the act surveyor-general have decline to supply I with either of the two chronometer belong to he department that could be rely on and in consequence i now find i should be compel to have recourse entirely to lunar observation and triangulation for the compilation of the map which would add very much to the amount of labor and liability to error several crested pigeon white cockatoo and crested quail or partridge be shoot as they come to drink at the waterhole metamorphic rock 17th June the horse have so far recover after the day 's rest that we be enable to resume a south-west course follow down the bed of the stream to latitude 22 degree 51 minute the country slightly improve towards evening but we again have to encamp without water have however obtain a small quantity in some gravel at noon the hill to the east of we track rise about 1000 foot above the bed of the watercourse and consist of metamorphic sandstone and shale intersect by whinstone dyke they summit be cap with red conglomerate in one place the river have cut through a ridge of altered rock and exhibit a very singular contortion of the stratum the lamina be cripple up into a arch of 100 foot high show a dip on each flank of 45 degree form a cave beneath run for some distance into the hill camp 23 18th June continue to follow the stream-bed south-west for eight or nine mile we come upon a patch of very green grass on which we halt to allow the horse the benefit on account of they not have have any water since noon yesterday in the meanwhile accompany by mr brown i start off and walk to a prominent hill six mile to the south to get a view of the surrounding country from the summit of this hill which we find to have a elevation of 700 or 800 foot we procure a valuable round of bearing and have a distant view of the country to the southward level plain and detach range of moderate elevation appear to be the general character of the country towards the lyon river we return to the party by 30 pm and be glad to find that during we absence water have be find in shallow clay-pan a mile to the westward to which we move over and encamp camp 24 latitude 22 degree 56 minute 23 seconds longitude by account 117 degree 21 minute 19th June we be unable to proceed this day owe to my have eat some of the dwarf mesembryanthemum which i have formerly observe to be use as food by the native on the gascoyne but which have produce with I violent headache and vomit the horse be however enjoy excellent feed and i contrived to work up my map and clear a lunar 20th June start at 725 be with nineteen horse have be oblige to leave behind a horse belong to mr lennard so lame that he could not move follow the stream-bed nearly west for ten mile come upon a pool of permanent water contain flag -- the first we have meet with since quit the hamersley range this be of great value as there be no water that could be depend upon on we return in the last sixty mile push on quickly for twelve mile further the river enter a wide plain in which be some tolerable feed we have again however to halt for the night without water depot camp on the hardey river 21st June although the size of the channel of the river we have be follow down for the last sixty mile have considerably increase both in width and depth yet very little water have be find in it and as it take a decide turn in its course this morning to north-west after two hour ' ride without observe any change and there be every appearance of its keep the same course for the next twenty mile i be convince that it could not be a tributary to either the edmund or lyon which i have at first hope it might prove the barometer also range too high for it to be at a sufficient elevation to admit of it flow into either of those river as the elevation of the lyon at the confluence of the alma be at least of the same altitude above the sea have name the river the hardey we fall back upon the pool pass yesterday where i have decide upon form a depot camp at which to rest the weakest horse while with a lightly equip party i propose to complete the expedition of the country intervene between this and the lyon river camp 26 latitude 22 degree 58 minute 28 seconds longitude 117 degree 10 minute 22nd June in accordance with the plan decide upon yesterday i start this day accompany by messr brown harding and brockman with three pack-horse convey eight day ' provision and fourteen gallon of water twelve mile on the south-south-west course over a very stony country bring we to a deep stream-bed trend in the same direction which we pursue for thirteen mile the country gradually improve until the channel be lose in a open plain of rich soil cover with fine green grass several pool of rainwater of a deep red color but fresh and sweet give we a good camp for the night a set of stellar observation give the latitude 23 degree 19 minute 16 seconds to the south at about six mile distance lay a bold range of hill run nearly east and west with many sharp summit have a average elevation of from 600 to 1000 foot above the plain and extend for twelve or fifteen mile to the eastward while to the west it be lose in numerous broken hill of lesser elevation camp 27 ashburton river capricorn range 23rd June as to pass the eastern end of the range appear likely to take we too much off we course we strike for what appear to be a break in the hill about seven mile to the south-west the first five mile be across a open grassy plain at time subject to inundation which bring we to the bank of a fine river contain permanent reach of fresh water line with cane the channel generally be from 100 to 200 yard wide with a depth of forty foot it be now barely run but it be quite evident that it be too large for either the alma or edmund and its bed must be at least 200 foot below the level of those river we however determine to follow it so long as it run to the south of west which it do until it come in contact with the range observe yesterday when it alter its course to west-north-west and appear to continue that direction for many mile probably until join by the hardey when in all likelihood it continue its course direct to exmouth gulf anxious as i naturally be to continue the examination of this promising river time and the condition of we horse ' foot do not permit we to do so with advantage name it the ashburton after the noble president of the royal geographical society we quit its verdant bank and take a south course up a stony ravine which lead we into the heart of the range where we soon become involved amongst steep rocky ridge of sharp slaty schist which very quickly deprive the horse of many of they remain shoe and retard we progress so much that by nightfall we find ourselves to be in only latitude 23 degree 28 minute 15 seconds hem in on all side by rugged country yield little else but small acacia-tree and triodium a little water and grass be however obtain in the bed of a stream tributary to the ashburton the summit of the hill pass over during the day have be see from the lyon river in 1858 and be now name the capricorn range camp 28 24th June a rather rough ride of four hour to the south-east bring we to a watercourse sixty yard wide trend to the north-north-east in which we find pool of water line with reed and flag this be trace up to the southward till 30 pm when we enter a deep gorge in a sandstone range the bed of the stream become very stony and full of melaleuca-tree it however contain many fine pool and strong run spring with a small supply of grass there be now a fair prospect of we reach the lyon as the range we be now enter must contain the source of the edmund which river have a much more restricted course than be originally suppose camp 29 latitude 23 degree 42 minute 15 seconds 25th June the country continue hilly for about ten mile when we arrive at the summit of a granite and sandstone tableland at the extreme source of the watercourse we have be follow up from this point we have at last the satisfaction of observe the bold outline of mount augustus bearing south-south-east about thirty mile while more to the westward could be discern the summit of mount phillip and samuel and yet more to the right the southern face of the barlee range descend to the south across a open plain we strike for a remarkable gorge in a granite range -lrb- the only one now between we and the lyon -rrb- at which we arrive by sundown on examine this singular gorge it be find to be a almost perpendicular cut through a narrow ridge nearly 300 foot in depth the length of the pass not exceed 200 yard the plain on each side be nearly on the same level from the summit of this pass the course of the stream could be trace across the fertile flat of the lyon until it be lose in the numerous channel of that river and i be able to obtain bearing to many well-remembered object notice on my former visit to this part of the country camp 30 latitude 23 degree 56 minute 45 seconds return to depot 26th June as we have only four day ' ration leave and no further object could be attain by advance further south unless there have be time to examine the present condition of the pasture in the vicinity of mount augustus we mark several tree on the north side of the gorge close to a pool and retrace we step to within a mile of we camp of the 24th have improve upon we outward track by keep rather more to the eastward camp 31 27th June instead of return by the rough route by which we come through the capricorn range we follow the stream to the north-north-east through a good country all the way to the ashburton which river it join in latitude 22 degree 26 minute pass through the end of the range one mile south of the junction in this pass we encamp on a fine deep pool in which we catch a small quantity of fish show the water to be permanent camp 32 28th June make a early start we soon cross the ashburton and ride twelve mile across open plain thinly timbered and yield a large quantity of good pasture principally of kangaroo-grass which here grow to the height of six foot rest for several hour at the waterhole of the 22nd at 430 pm we resume we route have fill we water-keg and push on to within sixteen or seventeen mile of the depot encamp amongst some good grass on we outward route but without any water except what we carry with we camp 33 29th June give we horse rather more than a gallon of water each we make a early start just as it come on to rain which be the first shower we have experience since the 27th may it continue until noon but not heavy enough to leave any surface-water on the parched and thirsty loam keep more to the westward than we outward track we escape much of the stony ground then pass over and arrive at the depot camp by 2 pm 30th June -lrb- Sunday -rrb- remain in camp and read prayer to the party 1st July the horse leave at the depot be much improve by they nine day ' rest and have we be provide with more shoe for they i should have at once return to the ashburton and trace that river up to the eastward as it offer a fine opportunity of penetrate to the south-east probably at least another 100 mile and we provision on a reduce allowance would admit of we remain out forty day longer but the lameness of many of the horse and lacerated condition of they fetlock convince I that should we meet with any more difficulty or rough country before obtain a fresh supply of shoe much valuable time would be lose and we should probably fail to get many of the horse back i therefore deem it more prudent to return at once by a shorter route more to the eastward so soon as we have repass the hamersley range and obtain a refit at the bay to throw all we remain time into the second trip we accordingly to-day return to camp 24 where we find the horse leave there on the 20th June sufficiently recover to accompany the party although incapable of carry a load the remainder of the day be devote to obtain bearing and add to the triangulation of the many remarkable summit visible from this part of the country 2nd July the country generally be very rough except on the bank of the hardey on we outward track we find it desirable to return along it more particularly as there be a better prospect of procure water by so do at about twenty mile we find a little water under a cliff in the bed of the stream and halted for the night camp 34 latitude 22 degree 32 minute 13 seconds mount bruce 3rd July still return on we old track at five mile i stop to ascend a very remarkable hill which have form a important point in the triangulation of this part of the country to which have be give the name of mount samson send the party onward to wait for I at camp 22 i commence the ascent of the mount which prove something more than i have calculate upon as it occupy more than a hour 's sharp toil to arrive at its summit when gain however it amply repay the trouble as from it i could discern almost every prominent hill or peak within sixty or seventy mile and amongst they the mountain which on a former occasion i have procure a bearing to from mount augustus at a distance of 124 geographical mile and which i now name mount bruce after the gallant commander of the troops who have always warmly support I in carry out exploration this part of the country i believe to be the most elevated in north-west australium -- mount samson have a altitude of not less than 1000 foot above the valley of the hardey while mount bruce and the mountainous country to the eastward rise to a considerable height above its summit which by comparison from the aneroid barometer would give not less than 4000 foot for the elevation of those range have complete my observation i descend the hill with somewhat greater speed than it take to climb it and be meet at the foot by messr brown and harding who have wait for I with a horse in less than a hour we overtake the rest of the party at camp 22 when the additional horse at once drink up all the remain water leave in the rock rest therefore less than a hour we move on take a north course over a very rocky but highly fertile country of trap formation the grass just now be much dry up at sundown we halt in a open grassy flat on which no water could be find although it be probable there be plenty in the vicinity as emu and cockatoo be numerous one of the former walk boldly up to the horse and be fire at but without effect camp 35 open grassy plain pass hamersley range 4th July travel at a rapid pace on a average north-east course for upward of twenty mile over plain mostly of rich loam well grass and extend to the southern foot of the hamersley range we come upon a low range of sandstone hill cover with acacia bush and triodium extend for three or four mile when we again emerge on open plain in which be find a deep channel thirty yard wide contain pool of rainwater retain in the clay the amount of fine pasture country pass over during the day could not be less than 200000 acre and although we have not time to go in search for it i have no doubt that abundance of water will be find in the deep gorge of the range skirt the plain this tract of country be i imagine well suit for the growth of either cotton or sugar as it be apparently well-irrigated during the summer month and the soil be remarkably rich and strong while its limit to the westward be at present unknown and most probably continue to skirt the hill for at least thirty or forty mile halt at the waterhole about four mile to the west of the pass through the hamersley range camp 36 5th July two hour bring we to the head of the pass which we enter by a ravine a little more to the northward than on we outward route and by so do save a preliminary ascent of nearly 200 foot and a similar amount of descent make a very successful passage through the range without experience the same difficulty we have formerly meet with and by 3 pm find ourselves once more in the open grassy country that form the chichester downs at 6 pm encamp in a open flat without water camp 37 proceed towards the coast 6th July start at 730 be and in a hour come upon a pool of water in one of the numerous channel into which the fortescue be here divide and at seven mile strike the bulrush spring pass on the 11th June from this the river be follow down for thirteen mile through grassy clay plain thinly timber with white-gum encamp on a pool in latitude 21 degree 53 minute 4 seconds about five mile north of a very remarkable bold projection of the hamersley range camp 38 7th July -lrb- Sunday -rrb- be keep as a day of rest 8th July the horse stray so far back on we track during Sunday night that by the time they be bring in it be too late to make a start with advantage as we be now about to enter a new tract of country by strike for the coast somewhere between breaker inlet and depuch island as a knowledge of this part of the country would greatly assist we in start on the second division of we exploration i availed myself of the delay here to fix by triangulation many of the summit and prominent spur of the hamersley range and take observation for the variation of the needle which i find to be about 1 degree east by the prismatic compass i have in use 9th July we horse again give we some trouble to find they so that we do not start until 1030 be two hour ' sharp travel across the plain bring we to the foot of low hill of trap and sandstone cover with triodium good feed be however plentiful in the valley although now rather dry trace up a small tributary to the fortescue at sunset we halt on a small rocky pool near its source in latitude 21 degree 41 minute 40 seconds several pool supply by spring come from under the superstratum of sandstone be pass during the day camp 39 longitude 117 degree 47 minute 10th July for seven mile the country continue gently to ascend the sandstone give place to trap boulder yield a very rich soil clothe with short green grass and melon the soil be too stony for agricultural purpose although i have see country of a similar appearance in the island of mauritius produce fine crop of sugar some of the melon weigh as much as five or six ounce and be passably good eating although rather bitter at noon the country drop suddenly to the northward and we descend a deep rocky ravine in which we soon find water and grass travel now become difficult and sometimes dangerous to the horse rugged and semi-columnar metamorphic sandstone cliff hem in the ravine on either side while large rounded boulder of trap-rock fill the bed of the stream which in several place be run we have a rather indifferent camp in latitude 21 degree 29 minute 10 seconds the camp at nickol bay bear west-north-west distant seventy-five mile by account camp 40 sherlock river 11th July the stream we be upon continue to take a northerly course for eight or ten mile down a valley from 200 to 300 foot in depth where it be divert to the eastward for about the same distance by a cross range of black volcanic hill of loose ragged rock totally devoid of vegetation the channel receive several tributary here become a succession of fine open pool of water from eighty to 150 yard in width we halt for the night on a wide bed of bare sand and rock the only feed be in the channel of the river to which be now give the name of sherlock camp 41 12th July this morning the river resume a north-north-west course and very soon lead we into a open plain rather sandy in character the channel divide into several branch separate mile apart the stream of water issue from the hill soon be absorb in the sandy bed but a well-defined line of verdant tree serve well to mark the course of the channel through the plain for many mile select the one that appear the most promising it be trace down to latitude 21 degree 6 minute 43 seconds where we encamp on a shallow pool of brackish water -- the only one see during the day several native be find here employ capture partridge by means of net construct out of the leaf of the triodium neatly twist and net in the same way as do by ourselves the mesh vary from one to five inch accord to the purpose to which it be apply it be very singular to observe the mode in which they induce the bird to enter the net or rather cage prepare for they in the first instance they place ragged bush all round the small pool with the exception of a few space five or six foot wide from which opening they stick in a double row of twig arch so as to meet overhead in the center one or two foot from the ground these little avenue lead away for several yard and then terminate with a net throw over a few light stick at the end the bird first alight on the margin of the pool but after drink do not take flight at once but run up the only opening which lead they first under the arch of twig and finally into the net which be then draw to by the hunter lie in wait under a few bush in this way they must capture a large amount of game judge by the quantity of feather around some of the waterhole camp 42 13th July two mile north the river turn west and keep that course for seven or eight mile through a poor sandy and stony tract of country and be then join by a fine channel come from the south near the junction be two reach of water half a mile long each and a rifle-shot across contain a quantity of duck and other water-fowl amongst which we sportsman be very successful along with other game bag the only two swan we have see since land a number of fine fish like cobbler be also catch weigh from 1 to 5 pound a-piece as it be Saturday and we horse be show unmistakable sign of knock up we halt for the rest of the day camp 43 latitude 21 degree 6 minute 5 seconds longitude 117 degree 32 minute 30 seconds volcanic hill 14th July -lrb- Sunday -rrb- after read prayer messr brown harding and myself walk to the summit of the range of black volcanic hill that skirt the western bank of the river at about a mile distant these hill consist of ragged scorium elevated 300 to 400 foot above the plain and be nearly destitute of vegetation at they summit be deep fissure the heat of the eruptive rock from beneath have be sufficient to convert the trap and sandstone rock into a deep bluish-grey scorium have a specific gravity of nearly four but we do not observe any instance of the actual overflow of lava and consequently there be a want of the fertilise property in the soil result from it that usually accompany volcanic formation a native dog have leave a litter of pup under a heap of stone not eighteen inch beneath we foot but such be the sharpness and ponderability of the fragment of rock that it fairly baffle we attempt to unhouse they a valuable round of bearing be procure from this spot depuch island be see bear north 14 degree east distant about twenty-eight mile extensive grassy plain 15th July we resume we course down the sherlock the stony nature of the country tell severely upon we horse ' foot who in other respects be in very tolerable condition we have not proceed more than three or four mile when mr brockman 's horse rocket give in and could not move another step the hoof be fairly wear through leave he close to a pool of water amongst plenty of feed i hope he might possibly recover by the time we return from the bay below this the channel become sandy and dry and we only procure a little water at night in a clay-hole plain extend from the river to the north and eastward as far as the eye could reach only interrupt by occasional detach hill of granite or volcanic trap the feed be generally coarse and the soil poor camp 44 latitude 20 degree 54 minute 45 seconds native fishing with net 16th July leave the valley of the river on a north-west course in half a hour we come upon a open plain of rich clayey loam cover with a fine even sward of good grass on which be feed large flock of pigeon and white cockatoo this change in the character of the soil be ascribable to the occasional overflow of the river leave a deposit of rich mud this plain extend as far as we could see to the north and east a few widely-scattered tope of tree be the only object break the monotony of the sea of grass to the north-west be a strong line of large timber for which we steer at three mile we enter the wood and find it to contain the main channel of the sherlock in which be a few small pool of rainwater cross the bed of the river on the same course we soon come upon another branch come from the south-west which be name the george immediately below the junction of the two stream the river open out into reach of brackish water evidently under the influence of the spring tide from this point the left bank be follow down to within three or four mile of the sea when the country become low and flat the grass coarse and no fresh water procurable we quit the sherlock and strike to the west for six or seven mile cross several salt-water creek until we be compel to turn to the southward to avoid a channel much larger and deeper than the rest at which a party of native be engage draw they net but run away on we approach a little further on the plain become more fertile and we find a small pool of rainwater in the clay at which we encamp there be no doubt but that the sherlock and the creek we be upon discharge they water by the numerous creek show on captain king 's chart fifteen or sixteen mile to the west of depuch island camp 45 latitude 20 degree 52 minute 15 seconds longitude 117 degree 15 minute return to nickol bay 17th July by observation of the sun at rise the variation of the needle be find to be 1 degree 10 minute east we be now about forty mile from nickol bay and as it be very doubtful whether water would be procurable in that distance i become very anxious on account of the horse as should the country prove stony i be quite certain they could not perform the journey in less than three day i therefore determine upon follow up a lead valley towards the maitland river with the intention in the event of not find water or a pass through the heavy mass of hill that back cape lambert of push through the upper branch of that river and by a round of sixty or seventy mile to approach the bay by we outward track fortunately however in the course of the day we fall in with some small pool of rainwater which enable we to advance about eighteen mile over tolerably even plain well grass we night halt be without water camp 46 18th July from we position and the observation i have make of the country on the eastern shore of nickol bay i be satisfy that the breadth of stony range lie between we and we destination do not exceed eight or ten mile which we therefore now determine to venture upon although at great risk to the horse some of which now walk upon stone as they would over red-hot coal enter the range by a small ravine three hour ' scramble over sharp rock bring we out on the head of a small tributary to the nickol river the suffering of the horse in cross the range be quite painful to witness they all however succeed in get through and as a little water be find in the bed of the stream we be enable to push on late and cross the marsh at the head of the bay before it be quite dark the depart ray of the setting sun have first favor we with a glimpse of the dolphin ride at anchor on the deep-blue water of the bay -- a sight which be welcome with no small satisfaction by the little band of weary traveller camp 47 19th July the camp be easily arouse by the morning watch as there be now only six mile between we and the landing-place in hearson cove the horse appear to partake of the general activity so that it be only 100 be when we arrive on we old camping ground which we find occupy by ten or a dozen native engage mend they net come upon they suddenly they would not stop to carry off they gear although not half a hour before they have be employ assist a boat 's crew from the dolphin in load with wood and water a rifle-shot soon recall the boat which be not a mile from the shore when we be glad to learn that mr hearson be fast recover from he wound and that all have be go on well since we departure from mr walcott i ascertain that he have be able to establish a friendly understanding with the native who frequent the western side of the bay and that they have be make useful in fill up the ship 's water and wood for which service they have be reward by a suitable distribution of biscuit in one instance the native on the eastern shore of the bay have show a hostile tendency on the occasion of a boat landing on the reef to gather shell one of the seaman who have wander from the rest be chase into the sea and menace with spear and club until he be up to he neck in water when the boat come to he rescue the officer in charge of she firing a shot over they head to drive they off mr walcott have also be successful in obtain a very useful vocabulary of native word and other interesting particulars from the aborigine as also many botanical specimen shell etc -- amongst the latter some very fine pearl-oyster from which several pearl of good color have be obtain but appear to be principally valuable on account of the size and beauty of the mother-of-pearl which average six inch diameter with more than half a inch in thickness of solid shell party refit for journey to eastward 20th July the forge store and other additional supplies have be land and the party set to work shoe horse repair saddle-bags etc i proceed with mr walcott and mr angel in the boat to make a rough survey of the cove on the western side of the bay with a view to select a suitable spot from which to re-embark the horse on we return from the next trip as it would be too late in the season by that time to venture the trip overland to champion bay i find that a good anchorage exist with three fathom at low water one mile off the little cove from which the ship have be water and be approachable at all time except in strong east or south-east gale when a heavy swell set in across the bay render a landing unsafe the fresh water run down a rocky gully at the north-west corner of the cove at the north end of a small patch of sandy beach and the supply appear tolerably abundant it be however rather difficult of access towards the end of the dry season as the water have then to be carry over the rock in small baraca fifty or sixty yard to the boat but from the setting in of the rain to the end of August it run down strongly at high-water mark i walk back overland to the camp with mr walcott the distance be about four mile head by the way another deep cove the margin of which be line with a broad belt of mangrove 21st to 28th July be fully take up in shoe horse make spare shoe refit and pack store etc ready for we trip to the eastward my own time be principally take up in roughly plot the country already explore so as to secure all the information obtain in the event of any accident occur to my field-book 29th July everything be in readiness for we departure i give captain dixon instruction to wait for we in the bay to the 10th December and in the event of we not then return mr walcott would land one of the ship 's iron tank and bury in it a quantity of store at a spot already agree upon the dolphin would then proceed to fremantle it blow so fresh all the morning that i could not land until 3 pm when we quickly saddle up and proceed three mile to a waterhole up in the volcanic hill as it be probable we should have a very long day 's march tomorrow without water as we have now only nineteen horse and one of these so low in condition as not to be able to carry a load we could only take with we eighty-seven day ' ration at the rate of one pound of flour seven ounce of meat and four ounce of sugar per man per diem we be however well provide with ammunition and thirty spare set of horse-shoe with nail sufficient for at least two remove the horse themselves be shoe at start with extra strong shoe tip with steel we have now only seven saddle-horse so that one of the party be always on foot by turn of a hour each it have be originally intend that the dolphin should proceed to roebuck bay and meet we there but it be now so late in the season that i do not deem it prudent to run the risk of remove she to a unknown anchorage where it be possible we might not be able to reach and thus lay ourselves open to the probability of a very embarrassing uncertainty the result prove we have adopt the right course bivouac difficulty in cross mud flat 30th July this morning we cross the marsh with some difficulty as all the pack-horse but three fall and stick in the mud until we transfer they load to we own back and carry they through half a mile of the softest part the operation detain we so long that we do not make more than eighteen mile when we find a little water leave in the pool see on the 18th camp 48 31st July start at 8 be follow we old track to 330 pm when we turn to the south up a stream-bed cross on the 17th at the gorge where it issue from the granite range we find a fine pool of permanent water and abundance of beautiful green grass this stream be now name the harding and as the pack be heavy we remain here the rest of the afternoon camp 49 a fertile plain 1st August pass under the northern foot of the granite range on a easterly course for sixteen mile we come upon a fine reach of open water in a branch of the creek on which we have encamp on the 16th July this pool be a valuable discovery as it would not only form a useful halt place on we return but from be in the middle of a fertile plain contain at least from 15000 to 20000 acre of arable land equal in quality to the greenough flat the whole could if necessary be easily irrigate from this large natural reservoir the highest part of the plain not be thirty foot above the water-level at the driest period of the year this fine tract of country in connection with the land already see almost adjoining on the eastern bank of the sherlock would in itself support a larger population than be at present contain in the whole of the colony of western australium we have see more kangaroo on these plain than on any other portion of we route one that be shoot resemble the osphranter and be in very good order the fur much thicker and softer than the common kangaroo of the western coast and of a pale mouse color it weigh about forty-five pound camp 50 latitude 21 degree 54 minute 18 seconds 2nd August proceeding eastward over grassy plain and stony ridge at thirteen mile we strike the sherlock only two mile below the pool at which we have leave the horse rocket and hope to find he improve by the rest but on approach the spot the presence of crow and a wild dog give indication of a different fate we find he partly devour within a few yard of where we leave he inflammation of the foot have most probably produce mortification push on till sunset we arrive at we old camping ground -lrb- camp 43 -rrb- at the bend of the sherlock camp 51 ascend the sherlock river 3rd August follow up the leave bank of the sherlock to camp 42 and find a little water still remain in the bird-cage pool where we halt for two hour at 130 pm resume a easterly route across a sandy plain yielding little but hakea and triodium five mile bring we to a large branch of the sherlock come from the south-east in which be several small permanent pool surround by flag at which we halt camp 52 latitude 21 degree 7 minute 4th August -lrb- Sunday -rrb- although the feed here be very indifferent yet as we have again enter unexplored country i be glad to make it a day of rest before enter upon the rather unpromising tract of country that lay in the outward route 5th August make a rather late start on account of the horse have stray very far in search of feed we steer for a bold range bearing east-south-east distant about twenty mile at four mile cross a dry channel come from the south-south-east and continue we course over a poor tract of country cover with triodium and a few acacia large bare red granite rock crop out here and there at one of these be a small waterhole near which a native be hunting mouse although at first alarmed he soon tell we in answer to we inquiry that we should find no water to the east but plenty to the south which we find to be correct as we have to halt after a very long day 's march in a dry ravine in the range for which we have be make camp 53 latitude 21 degree 10 minute 35 seconds reconnoitre the country ahead 6th August have reconnoitr the country for some mile ahead overnight without find water it be no use lead we horse further into the rugged defile where we might get entangled for many hour we accordingly strike to the south-west for four mile when we come on a rocky pool of permanent water in the south-east branch of the sherlock just at the point where it emerge from the hill have water the horse and give they a hour 's rest we follow up the stream to the south-east for seven mile when it divide into numerous small dry ravine in the heart of a elevated range of granite cap with metamorphic sandstone water have only be meet with within the first mile from where we strike it camp 54 7th August the horse require water we fall back upon the pool pass yesterday where i decide upon leave the bulk of the party for the day or two while i explore the country for a pass to the eastward camp 55 latitude 21 degree 14 minute 28 seconds 8th August take with I mr brown and mr harding mount and one pack-horse carry water we strike through the hill to the eastward and at six mile come upon a stream-bed that lead we to the north-east fifteen or sixteen mile when find it contain no water we resume a easterly course over a open sandy and stony plain cover with triodium for twelve mile and encamp in poor feed without water camp 56 latitude 21 degree 4 minute the yule river 9th August a heavy dew have fall during the night we horse be much refresh and we be enable to proceed with the scanty supply of water carry with we in a hour we strike upon the channel of a river with a sandy bed 300 yard wide in which be a few pool of water under a bold sandstone bluff rise abruptly 300 foot from the plain from the summit of this hill the river be observe to trend to the north-north-west for eight or ten mile and to come upon a gap in a granite range four mile to the south-south-east towards which we now turn we step across extensive bed of soft drift-sand bring down by the river cajeput and acacia tree occupy a large portion of the channel and it be not until reach the gorge in the range that grass be meet with in sufficient quantity to supply we want several large pool teem with water-fowl occupy the whole of the valley which here be fully a quarter of a mile wide the remainder of the day i devote to sketch and triangulate the country while the horse be enjoy the benefit of the fine feed camp 57 latitude 21 degree 6 minute 26 seconds 10th August as this river from its magnitude afford a fair chance of work to the south-east i determine to bring forward the rest of the party have name this river the yule we return to the depot party by a somewhat shorter cut make it in about thirty mile which we accomplish by sundown 11th August -lrb- Sunday -rrb- party rest observe a set of lunar which place we in longitude 118 degree 3 minute east the rate of the chronometer be still so irregular as to be almost useless 12th August to-day the whole party proceed twenty-four mile towards the yule find a small pool of water in a rocky ravine by the way which we have miss on we former trip bivouac in a open grassy plain six mile short of the river 13th August move on to we camp of the 9th and halt there for the remainder of the day the latitude by meridian altitude of the sun i find to be 21 degree 6 minute 22 seconds 14th August as travel near the river be find to be very laborious on account of the vast bed of loose drift-sand throw up by the summer flood we steer to the south-south-east for a pass in the range about twenty mile distant through which the river be suppose to come but on reach the hill the river be observe to the westward we accordingly alter we course to south-west and strike it at about six mile the character of the river be still the same the aggregate width of the several channel amount to nearly half a mile water be procure in they by digging a few inch in the sand the country pass over during the day be a open plain of light sandy loam intersperse with bare granite rock crop out at interval of a few mile giant ant-hill of from ten to sixteen foot in height and thirty to forty foot in circumference -lrb- a few of which have already be meet with on we first trip -rrb- be here remarkably conspicuous on account of they size and bright brick-red color a emu be shoot during the day while run at full speed at the range of over 200 yard camp 58 latitude 21 degree 23 minute 23 seconds 15th August one of the horse be miss this morning so we do not start until 10 be when the river be follow up to the south-east through country the same as yesterday halt for the night in latitude 21 degree 32 minute 13 seconds camp 59 16th August we average course to-day be nearly east occasionally cross channel come from the south-east towards evening we find that the main channel which it have be we intention to have follow have escape we observation to the southward and we be only on a comparatively small tributary come from a rugged range of hill to the eastward we object for the present not be to push too far into the interior this tributary be follow until it break up into numerous small valley in one of which water be obtain by digging three foot in the sand amongst tolerable feed the country have much improve in the course of the day camp 60 latitude 21 degree 34 minute rocky range 17th August soon after start this morning we come upon a camp of native but we could not prevail upon any of they to stop and hold parley with we four hour ' travel over rather rocky ground lead we well into the range which we find to consist of granite cap with metamorphic sandstone and break up by dyke of variegated jasper in a deep ravine at the foot of a cliff we find a small pool of beautiful clear spring water which be very acceptable as the sun have now acquire considerable power and the grass be begin to get very dry food for we horse during the halt at this spring mr harding and myself ascend the highest part of the range which be find to be 500 or 600 foot above the plain from this elevation i be enable to select we onward route and obtain bearing to several useful summit for triangulation -- a few hill to the south-south-east be visible at the distance of sixty or seventy mile which no doubt form part of the continuation of the hamersley range resume a east course the culminate point of the range be soon pass when we descend to the eastward down some deep and remarkably picturesque rocky glen in which be find several spring and pool of water lead down to a fine grassy flat in which be grow some fine large flooded-gum tree camp 61 18th August -lrb- Sunday -rrb- find we latitude 21 degree 36 minute 8 seconds longitude 119 degree 13 minute east by account the strelley river 19th August the country be very hilly it be find best to follow down the stream upon which we have encamp although it trend to the north of east in a few mile the valley open out with fine pool of permanent water cover with numerous flight of duck and at eight mile it join a wide valley from the south down which flow a river divide into several channel contain many fine pool from 50 to 200 yard wide which be still run gently from one to another the bank although well grass be very rocky rendering travel excessively fatiguing to we heavily-loaded pack-horse several of they be bruise and strain while jump from rock to rock the cleft be too deep and narrow for they to walk between and the range border the valley be too steep to admit of we leave the river which we be compel to follow down to latitude 21 degree 26 minute 52 seconds camp 62 20th August the river which have be name the strelley continue to hold a northerly course we therefore avail ourselves of a smoother valley come in from the east to resume we old course at nine mile we meet with a stream 100 yard wide come from the south-east evidently tributary to the strelley and take its rise in elevated granite range with black volcanic ridge protrude through they but not to any considerable height above the general level of the country after a few hour ' scramble over these ridge we come upon a small stream trend east contain several spring surround by high grass and flag gradually lead we by sunset into a deep pass wall in by cliff and bluff from 100 to 300 foot high the stream have join several larger one from the southward now occupy nearly the whole width of the valley we encamp in one of the wildest and most romantic-looking spot to be find in this part of australium to which we give the name of glen herr from a fish bear a resemblance to a herr be find in the stream camp 63 latitude 21 degree 20 minute 35 seconds the shaw river norton plain 21st August with some difficulty we wend we way down the intricate winding of the glen for six mile in a north-east direction when it open out into grassy flat turn to the northward leave it at this point a mile east bring we to the bank of a fine open river-bed 200 yard wide down which a little water be still flow the country on its bank become much more promising and grass plentiful this river i name the shaw and some beautiful grassy plain through which it come for twenty or thirty mile to the southward norton plain after the talented secretary of the royal geographical society in the afternoon a large tributary from the south-east be follow up for some mile when turn to the south we quit it to follow a open valley lead east towards a bold granite and schistose range under which we encamp late without find water camp 64 latitude 21 degree 20 minute 22nd August as we do not find water for some distance to the eastward under the foot of the hill we turn to the south-east quickly emerge from the hill upon the norton plain and at two mile come upon the stream quit last evening to which the name of emu creek have be give it have alter its course and be again come from the east and contain several fine spring this creek be follow up for the rest of the day through a rather indifferent country and towards nightfall lead we into a deep rocky ravine in which we encamp a small supply of water be obtain from hole in the rock camp 65 latitude 21 degree 28 minute 23rd August as we advance the ravine divide into many branch come from a elevated tableland to the southward we therefore again resume a easterly course for five or six mile over rugged hill and descend by a gully trend north-east which lead we in a few mile into open plain skirt the northern foot of the range until after dark we encamp on a small watercourse in which we obtain water by digging under some granite rock camp 66 latitude 21 degree 23 minute 30 seconds 24th August the horse have suffer much amongst the rock during the last few day i determine to follow the southern edge of the plain until a stream could be meet with to lead we to the south-east a few mile bring we to a small watercourse run gently from some spring in the plain which contrary to we expectation run into the range to the south-east instead of come out of they as here there be plenty of green grass and water and the horse be not look well we encamp early in the entrance of the gorge camp 67 latitude 21 degree 20 minute 13 seconds 25th August -lrb- Sunday -rrb- longitude by observation 120 degree 17 minute variation 30 minute east 26th August the stream we be upon lead we about five mile south-east through the hill and then join a river come from the southward 100 yard wide which be follow down on a average course of east-north-east to latitude 21 degree 18 minute reed and rank grass line its bank in many part while in other granite boulder and bank of drift-sand offer considerable impediment to travel camp 68 degrey river 27th August the river take we on a northerly course nine or ten mile receive many large tributary several of they still run slightly form altogether a stream of some importance which on account of the large extent of pastoral and agricultural land afterwards find on its bank lower down and its many fine tributary i name the degrey in honor of the noble lord who take a lively interest in promote the object of the expedition as the object at present in view be to push to the south-east we leave this promising river and resume a east-south-east course for five or six mile into a hilly country and encamp in a gully with rather scanty feed a little water be obtain by digging camp 69 28th August we soon become involve in deep ravine which lead up into high tableland the summit of which be no sooner attain than we have again to descend equally precipitous gully to the eastward the horse slide down amongst the loose rock and stone with a velocity that threaten immediate destruction they all however arrive safe at the bottom although in so exhaust a state that two of they have very shortly after to be leave behind while we push on with the rest in search of water and feed which be not meet with until late in the day after a short rest i send messr brown and brockman back for the two beaten horse while i move the party on a mile further to a fine spring in a grassy flat where we encamp camp 70 latitude 21 degree 9 minute 3 seconds extensive grassy plain 29th August the two horse leave yesterday be bring into camp early in the day and as they be too weak to carry they load they be place on we saddle-horse one of the party by turn have to walk as the season be rapidly advance we could not venture to incur any delay much as the horse require rest and accordingly resume a east course late in the day at five mile come upon a sandy stream-bed fifty yard wide trend to the north-east beyond which the country open out into a extensive plain of white wave grass -- to the north uninterrupted by a single elevation while to the east and south at eight or ten mile distant rise range of granite hill cap with horizontal sandstone it be not until some time after dark that we arrive near the opposite edge of the plain when we come upon a river 200 yard wide run to the northward the long drought have reduce it to a few shallow pool run from one to the other through the deep sand in the bed magnificent cajeput-tree line the bank and grass be in abundance camp 71 oakover river 30th August we do not start till late as mr brown have to go back some little distance for he horse which have be again leave behind overnight knock up as it would have be useless in the present condition of we horse to attempt at once to enter the range to the east we determine to follow up the river for a few day to the south-south-east and by so do secure feed and water and give the poor animal a chance of recover they strength we therefore follow the river up for seven or eight mile through fine open forest country and encamp near a deep pool in which be catch ten or twelve dozen of small trout which with cockatoo and duck afford a important addition to we ration of only seven ounce of meat this river be name the oakover camp 72 31st August for nearly ten mile the river continue to lead we to the eastward of south it then divide the main channel come from the south-west we however follow the eastern branch until quite satisfied that it contain no water and then fall back to the westward striking the river near some cliff at the foot of which water be plentiful although only 1 pm i determine to halt for the remainder of the day as it be too late to make a attempt to enter the hill without give the horse the advantage of some hour ' feed and rest it also afford I leisure to make astronomical observation and work up the plan of we route a set of lunar distance very carefully take place the camp in longitude 121 degree 3 minute 30 seconds east while that by account carry on by triangulation and dead-reckoning from the sherlock place we four and a half mile more to the westward the latitude be 21 degree 23 minute 43 seconds camp 73 1st September -lrb- Sunday -rrb- read prayer 2nd September a march of three hour across the plain to the eastward bring we to the foot of the range which we enter by a tolerably easy pass and soon come upon a pool of water in a tributary to the oakover the mouth of which have be pass on we ascent of that river here we halt for two hour and then resume we route through steep and rocky hill contain numerous fine spring it be not until 7 pm that we finally get through the range and emerge upon open sandy plain of vast extent no object be observable from north-north-east round to south-south-east except low ridge of red drift-sand in many part nearly bare of vegetation a large party of native be encamp upon the watercourse down which we descend to the plain not wish to alarm they we pass the waterhole from which they be supply and proceed a mile farther but have in consequence to camp without water although amongst abundance of grass camp 74 latitude 21 degree 21 minute 30 seconds native head-dress enter the sandy desert 3rd September this morning we return to the native encampment for water and find that they have already desert it leave many of they thing behind -- amongst other a very singular head-dress shape like a helmet it consist of a circular band make of twisted grass the size of the head into which be stick ten or twelve upright twig bring together into a point two foot high which be weave like a open basket with yarn make of opossum fur the whole no doubt be consider highly ornamental by the wearer but of not the least service as a article of protection for the head either from the sun or in war have water the horse we enter the sand-plain travel between the ridge which run in straight line parallel to each other at the distance of several hundred yard apart the sand be throw by the south-east gale into acute ridge thirty to sixty foot high they direction be almost invariably north 109 degree east travel to 215 pm we get over about eighteen mile the valley yield little else but triodium with occasional patch of stunt gum forest in which be find a little good grass on which be feed flight of pigeon and a variety of parrot new to we but which i believe to be the golden-backed parakeet -lrb- psephotus chrysopterygius -rrb- of gould as no water could be find and many of the horse give sign of be greatly distressed no change be observable in the country for many mile ahead a few very distant range be the only object visible we be oblige to have recourse to the only safe expedient of fall back and form a depot rest to 510 we commence a retreat until 720 have be oblige to abandon a horse of mr brown 's quite exhaust camp 75 4th September at 630 be resume we retreat and by noon arrive at the waterhole of the 2nd have leave two more horse behind which however mr brown and myself carry out water to in the course of the evening and drive they in during the night 5th September leave the party to rest i walk ten or twelve mile round to the south-south-eastward along the foot of the range in search of water and to ascertain if a better line of country could be find in that direction but it continue to maintain the same arid appearance and i only come on one pool in a gully four mile from the camp depot 6th September leave mr turner and four of the party in depot with instruction to remain there three day and then fall back upon the oakover where there be much better feed i start with messr brown and harding take six of the strongest horse sixteen day ' ration and six gallon of water and steer south-south-east along the range for six or eight mile look for some stream-bed that might lead we through the plain but be disappoint to find that they be all lose in the first mile after leave the hill and as cross the numerous ridge of sand prove very fatiguing to the horse we determine once more to attempt to strike to the eastward between the ridge which we do for fifteen mile when we horse again show sign of fail we which leave we the only alternative of either push on at all hazard to a distant range that be now just visible to the eastward where from the numerous native fire and general depression of the country there be every reason to think a large river would be find to exist or to make for some deep rocky gorge in the granite hill ten mile to the south in which there be every prospect of finding water in the former case the travel would be smoothest but the distance so great that in the event of we fail to obtain water we probably should not succeed in bring back one of we horse while in the latter we should have to climb over the sand ridge which we have already find so fatiguing this course however involve the least amount of risk and we accordingly strike south four mile and halt for the night camp 76 repulse for want of water intense heat 7th September the horse do not look much refresh by the night 's rest we however divide three gallon of water amongst they and start off early in the hope of reach the range by noon but we have not go three mile when one of the pack-horse that be carry less than forty pound weight begin to fail and the load be place upon my saddle-horse it do not however enable he to get on more than a couple of mile further when we be compel to abandon he leave he under the shade of the only tree we could find in the hope that we might bring back water to he relief finding that it would be many hour before the horse could be get on to the hill i start ahead on foot leave messr brown and harding to come on gently while i be to make a signal by fire if successful in find water two hour ' heavy toil through the sand under a broiling sun bring I to the range where i continue to hunt up one ravine after another until 50 pm without success twelve hour ' almost incessant walk on a scanty breakfast and without water with the thermometer over 100 degree of fahrenheit begin to tell upon I rather severely so much so that by the time i have track up my companion -lrb- who have reach the hill by 10 pm and be anxiously wait for I -rrb- it be as much as i could do to carry my rifle and accoutrements the horse be look truly wretched and i be convince that the only chance of save they if water be not find would be by abandon we pack-saddles provision and everything we could possibly spare and try and recover they afterwards if practicable we therefore encamp for the night on the last plot of grass we could find and proceed to make arrangement for a early start in the morning there be still remain a few pint of water in the keg have be very spare in the use of it this enable we to have a little tea and make a small quantity of damper of which we all stand in much need camp 77 8th September at 40 be we be again up have dispose of we equipment and provision except we riding-saddle instrument and firearm by suspend they in the branch of a large tree we divide a pint of water for we breakfast and by the first peep of dawn be drive we famished horse before we at they best speed toward the depot which be now thirty-two mile distant for the first eight mile they go on pretty well but the moment the sun begin to have power they flag greatly and it be not long before we be oblige to relinquish another horse quite unable to proceed by 90 be i find that my previous day 's march and the small allowance of food i have take be begin to have its effect upon I and that it be probable i could not reach the depot until next morning by which time the party leave there be to fall back to the oakover i therefore direct mr brown who be somewhat fresher than myself to push on for the camp and to bring out fresh horse with water while mr harding and myself would do we best to bring on any straggle horse that could not keep up with he by dark we have succeed in reach to within nine mile of the depot finding unmistakable evidence towards evening of the condition to which the horse take on by mr brown be reduce by the saddle gun hobble and even bridle scatter along the line of march which have be take off to enable they to go on a few mile further effect of want of water 9th September at dawn mr harding and myself get up from we bed of sand stiff and giddy but much refresh by the cold night air in four or five mile we meet mr brown with fresh horse and a supply of water have succeed in reach the depot at 8 pm the night before with only one horse we be now enable to proceed with the tracking up of the horse leave overnight which after rest some hour have commence to ramble in search of water mr brown return on we route and recover the saddle and firearm leave the previous evening the store abandon the day before be too far off to attempt they recovery by 830 pm we have all return to the depot have track up the three miss horse the two leave at the furthest point be too distant to carry relief to without incur the risk of further loss i can not omit to remark the singular effect of excessive thirst upon the eye of the horse they absolutely sink into they head until there be a hollow of sufficient depth to entirely bury the thumb in and there be a appearance as though the whole of the head have shrink with they produce a very unpleasant and ghastly expression depot camp 10th September we be only able to move the camp a mile to another waterhole for the sake of a little better feed bivouac commence return journey 11th September on take into consideration the reduce number and strength of we horse it be quite evident that we have but little prospect of be able to cross the tract of dry sandy country that have already occasion we so much loss and trouble yet there be many reason to stimulate we to make the attempt not only have we now attain to within a very few mile of the longitude in which from various geographical datum there be just grounds for believe that a large river may be find to exist drain central australium but the character of the country appear strongly to indicate the vicinity of such a feature add to which the gradual decline in the elevation of the country notwithstanding we increase distance from the coast tend towards the same conclusion nor should we omit the strong evidence that the remarkable ridge of drift-sand which encumber the plain must in the first instance have be bring from the interior by water and then have be blow by the strong prevail south-east wind across the country in a direction at least 50 degree from that which they originally come from this with the clean water-worn appearance of the sand the bold outline of the hill see to the far east and the number of native fire observe in the same direction must all tend to support the hypothesis that the western half of australium be probably drain by a large river in about this meridian i could not therefore help regret more than ever that we should be drive back at such a interesting spot but mature reflection convinced I that any further attempt with we present means at this period of the year be almost certain to be attend with the most disastrous result i therefore decide upon adopt the only other useful course open to we -- that of examine down to the sea the river already discover with this in view we to-day fall back five or six mile across the range to a tributary to the oakover call the davi when one of the horse become so cripple by a strain in the loin that we be oblige to halt to give he a chance of recovery afford I leisure to verify we position by observe another set of lunar distance which i find to agree well with those formerly take ten mile to the westward camp 78 down the oakover river 12th September we commence the descent of the davi have much difficulty in get along the sick horse as it require the united strength of the party to lift he on he leg every time he fall which he at last do so frequently that i order he to be shoot as it be hopeless to attempt to bring he on and if leave he must have die of starvation by 20 pm we reach the junction of the stream we be upon with the oakover and halt two mile south of camp 72 most of the party be now dismount shoe-leather be begin to get very scarce with we camp 79 13th September this day we only travel eight mile down the oakover and encamp near a deep creek in which be catch a good haul of fish camp 80 14th September the feed be so good on this river that we be able to proceed to-day to latitude 20 degree 59 minute 33 seconds the country improve much grassy flat extend for some mile to the northward the channel of the river be augment by the junction of the large tributary cross on we eastward track on the afternoon of the 29th August camp 81 15th September -lrb- Sunday -rrb- remain in camp to rest the horse a few native be see near the camp during the day 16th September after run four or five mile further north the oakover turn to the north-west for fourteen mile have a clear sandy or stony bed from 150 to 200 yard wide water and grass be plentiful and the country generally be open forest with a please appearance camp 82 latitude 20 degree 46 minute 17th September the course of the river be follow for about seventeen mile in a westerly direction the bed widen out to 300 or 400 yard the water be now confine to a sandy channel not above 150 yard in width the depth of the valley through which it run be about forty foot timber of white-gum and cajeput be tolerably plentiful on the bank the soil of which be a red loam of considerable depth many of the pool be line with tall reed camp 83 latitude 20 degree 41 minute 32 seconds reach the degrey river abundance of fish 18th September start at 640 be and in two and a half hour enter a deep and wild-looking gorge at which point it form a junction with the degrey come from the south-south-east through a beautiful level tract of open grassy country a broad belt of flooded-gum tree grow for some distance back on either side pass through the gorge which be a quarter of a mile wide and about a mile long we come upon a camp of native who as usual quickly disperse without give we a opportunity of show they that we intend they no harm the river here contain a fine reach of deep water upon which be a large quantity of whistle duck and other water-fowl two mile lower down we halt on the bank of a deep creek come in from the northward the rest of the day be employ re-stuffing pack-saddle etc while some of the party catch a quantity of fine fish -- amongst they a eel which however be allow to escape be take for a water-snake by one of the party who have never see one before a large kind of bat or vampire be first observe here measure about two foot across the wing camp 84 19th September we continue to follow down the degrey for about eighteen mile in a west-north-west direction through open grassy plain extend for many mile on either bank the channel of the river still maintain the same sandy character and with abundance of water in its bed camp 85 latitude 20 degree 36 minute 30 seconds 20th September there be little or no change in the appearance of the country for the eighteen or twenty mile that the river be trace down during to-day we encamp on the bank of a wide and deep reach of water more than a mile long surround by tall reed fish be catch here in great abundance camp 86 latitude 20 degree 31 minute 48 seconds native camp 21st September shortly after start we cross the bed of a tributary come in from the southward with a shallow sandy channel 200 yard wide which must drain the high range between the degrey and shaw river which we pass over on we outward track in many place we begin to observe patch of triodium in the midst of the alluvial plain through which the river continue to run and distant range be observe both to the north and south towards sundown we surprise a large party of native encamp in a dry channel of the river and approach so near before we be discover that we have separate a young child from the rest of the party which be observe by the mother who remain while the rest of the native make a hasty retreat it be not long however before a aged warrior return to she aid with he spear ship and come forward in a very menacing attitude to recover the child who stand by we with a look of the most perfect unconcern finding we take no notice of he threat he throw down he weapon and walk up to the boy catch he up in he arm and bear he off with a look of triumph to he companion no attempt be make to carry away they supper which be ready prepare in a number of wooden scoop and consist of fish rat bean grass-seed cake and a beverage make with some oily seed pound leave everything undisturbed we push on for another mile so as to prevent they be afraid of return to they evening repast camp 87 latitude 20 degree 25 minute 15 seconds attempt to spear horse 22nd September be Sunday we only move a mile lower down the river to a fine reach of water on the bank of which be a rich sward of green grass for we horse shortly after we have make ourselves comfortable for the day we be startle by six of the horse come into camp at a gallop in they hobble follow by eighteen armed native everyone spring to they arm in a moment which cause the intruder to fall back i try to make they comprehend that we do not approve of the horse be hunt but as they would not go away and they have a strong party conceal in the brushwood i fire at a tree to show they the use of we arm the moment they hear the report of the rifle and see the splinter fly they take to they heel and do not again trouble we we afterwards find a spear sticking in the ground in the track of the horse have evidently be throw while in pursuit camp 88 latitude 20 degree 25 minute longitude 119 degree 21 minute 23rd September the river soon pass round the southern foot of a range of hill of 400 or 500 foot elevation the country to the south again become very fertile and clothe with a rich sward of kangaroo-grass at ten mile we strike the shaw river come from the south-east with a broad deep and well-defined channel in which be many fine pool of water below the confluence of the river the degrey widen out considerably turn rather more to the northward and seven mile further be join by the strelley in latitude 20 degree 16 minute and longitude 119 degree 5 minute east the river be divert to the northward by a rugged range of volcanic hill its course be now direct for breaker inlet which be distant about eighteen mile camp 89 magnetic rock render the compass useless 24th September as it be very important that i should obtain a round of bearing before proceed any further the country have for some day past be too flat to afford many opportunity for triangulation i to-day start with messr harding and brown to ascend the range that lie to the west of the river a scramble of three mile over very rugged rock bring we to the highest point which be find to be not more than 500 foot above the sea we journey however turn out to be fruitless the magnetic attraction of the volcanic rock of which the hill be compose be so great as to reverse the needle which vary so much that i could not even make use of the compass to take angle and i have omit to bring a sextant kangaroo be numerous among these hill but we do not succeed in shoot any they appear to be similar to those see on the plain near the sherlock the view we have of the country be very extensive to the south be a vast gently-undulating plain only occasionally interrupt by detach granite and sandstone peak while narrow green line of tree intersect the plain in various direction indicate the watercourse come from the distant range and wander in wide sandy channel towards the sea the course of the strelley be easily distinguish for many mile to the north the eye could trace the broad sandy bed of the degrey trend towards breaker inlet the position of which be only distinguishable by the margin of deep-blue mangrove that line it and the whole of the extremity of the delta form by the alluvial deposit bring down by the river to the east and west of this be a wide expanse of alluvial flat cover in most part with rich wave grass the sameness of the scenery be relieve by detach patch of open park-like forest of flooded-gum return to the camp by noon the remainder of the day be devote by I to bring up the arrears of map etc and by the party generally in provide a supply of fish and duck which here be find to be very plentiful 25th September by 7 be we be once more trace down the degrey through the flat see yesterday at eight mile the river divide into two channel of nearly equal width the eastern one be follow to latitude 20 degree 5 minute 16 seconds travel be very heavy on account of the numerous rat-hole that completely undermine the bank of the river for more than a quarter of a mile back on either side for the last few mile the water in the river be decidedly brackish and at we camp be evidently influence by the tide we however procure some tolerably good water by sink a well in a sandbank in the dry portion of the channel which here be about 300 yard wide camp 90 sudden rise of tide 26th September this morning we find the water in the well quite salt in consequence of the tide have rise during the night and as we horse require water it be find desirable to fall back upon some of the fresh pool to form a camp while a day or two could be devote to the examination of this fertile and interesting tract of country we accordingly cross the channel and proceed westward for nearly three mile when we come upon the other branch which prove eventually to join again several mile below form a island contain some 8000 or 9000 acre of alluvial flat soil cover with a quantity of mixed grass to this be give the name of ripon island the western channel be find to be over 300 yard wide and to contain several fine reach of open water some fresh and other slightly brackish they be all teem with duck and a great variety of water-fowl have select a suitable spot for a camp i start with messr brown and harding to examine the country towards the inlet at a little more than two mile we cross the river between two pool of salt water subject to the influence of the tide and proceed northward over a open grassy flat for two mile further when the grass give place to samphire and small mangrove bush which gradually thicken to dense mangrove cut up by deep muddy creek which put a stop to proceed further in that direction here we observe several remarkable stack of dead mangrove evidently pile together by the native but for what purpose we could not ascertain unless to escape upon from the tide when fishing have gain firm ground we make a detour more to the eastward and at last succeed in reach the bank of the river close to the head of the inlet the tide be at the ebb i be able to walk over the mud and sand to the mouth of the river and obtain bearing to point larrey and poissonier and observe the character of the entrance from which i form the opinion that the breaker see by captain stoke when survey this portion of the coast and which deter he from enter the inlet be nothing more than the sea-roller meet a strong ebb tide set out of the degrey possibly back up by fresh from the interior which would from a river of this size occasion a considerable commotion where the tide amount to twenty foot at any rate i could not observe any rock and there appear to be a channel with at least five or six foot of water in it at low tide for the first mile the river have a breadth of from 400 to 800 yard and would admit with the tide vessel of twelve or fourteen foot draft of water with perfect safety up as far as ripon island where they could lie completely sheltered in all weather quite close to the shore which here have steep bank twenty to thirty foot high they would however be leave aground at low water as we do not observe any pool in this part of the river i have only just time to complete my observation when the roaring of the incoming tide warn I that no time be to be lose in return to the horse which be nearly a mile higher up the river although i run part of the way the mud creek fill up so rapidly there be some risk of my be cut off from the shore and have to take up a roost on the top of the mangrove until the tide fall i have time however to observe that the head of the tide carry with it thousand of fish of great variety amongst they a very remarkable one from three to six inch in length in form resemble a mullet but with fin like a flying-fish it be amphibious landing on the mud and run with the speed of a lizard and when frighten can jump five or six foot at a bind i do not however succeed in capture one for a specimen swarm of beautiful bright-crimson crab about two inch diameter be to be see issue from they hole to welcome the come flood on which be bear a great number of sea-fowl who it be evident come in for a abundant feast in the general turmoil mount we horse that have stand for the last two hour without touch a mouthful of the rank grass around they for want of water we return to the camp by a different route through open grass flat border the deep reach of water that encompass the north-west side of ripon island scarcity of water near the west 27th September accompany by the same party but with three fresh horse we again start to explore the plain eastward towards mount blaze for several mile after leave the island the country continue of the same fertile character as that pass over yesterday and be at time subject to inundation from the river but as we recede from the influence of the flood the soil become lighter and the grass thinner with patch of triodium and samphire at twelve mile we enter a patch of open grassy forest extend for some mile but as there be no promise of obtain water and the day be calm and sultry we turn to the northward in the hope that water might be procurable under the low sand-hill that line this portion of the coast in this we be however disappoint as the fall of the country terminate in mangrove and salt-water creek between which and the sea be a narrow ridge of low sand-hill amongst they we observe many track of native but do not discover any water the sea here be apparently very shallow for many mile off shore more than half a mile of mud and sandbank be leave dry at low water rest the horse for two hour we return to camp by a more direct route pass for several mile over a plain of rich black mould cover with a short sward of bright-green grass the native fire have sweep off the dry grass a few week previously and although there have be no rain since the heavy dew that fall during the night in these latitudes have be sufficient to produce a rapid growth 28th September as i expect to meet with some difficulty for want of water between this and the yule river i think it best to give the horse the benefit of a little rest before resume we homeward route some of the party be also derive much benefit from the abundance of fresh game as they have be suffer from debility bring on most probably by over-exertion while traverse the heavy country of the interior while here we obtain several addition to we small collection of bird -- amongst they a beautiful wader the size of a large snipe the head be cover by a remarkable membranous hood or sheath of a rich gamboge-yellow resemble the leaf of a flower fall back from the beak and lie close over the feather protect they when the beak be plunge into the sand after food they have also a remarkable sharp horn or claw project forward from the last joint of the wing with which they can fight when attack by bird of prey a very handsome bird be also shoot resemble a flamingo the body be about the size and in plumage like a pelican the head and neck of a deep rich purple and form like the flamingo the leg bright red long and slender it fly extend to its greatest length measure six foot two inch and across the wing seven foot two inch its weight be only 11 pound a white heron with bird-of-paradise feather on its back be occasionally see but only one specimen procure 29th September -lrb- Sunday -rrb- delta of the degrey river 30th September we make a early start up the river and at three mile strike out into the plain to the westward where we find a large extent of open flat yielding grass and atriplex and timbered in many part with flooded-gum at ten mile we come upon a deep reach of water flow to the north-west which must empty itself into the sea four or five mile to the south-west of spit point form a island of a portion of the delta of the degrey contain between 90000 and 100000 acre of alluvial land this channel be follow up and find to come from the river close to the junction of the strelley and must be a very considerable outlet for the water during the summer rain i regret much not have time to trace this branch of the degrey to its mouth as it might be find to be navigable and afford a fine site for a seaport town fresh water be abundant and building stone procurable in any quantity be find in the immediate vicinity on land superior to inundation we remain at the junction the rest of the day camp 92 the strelley river 1st October as the plain be now dry and parched we determine to follow up the strelley to the range before striking west to the yule at first the river spread out into so many wide grassy channel that it be difficult to trace it but at four or five mile collect into one bed about 100 yard wide in which be a few small pool up to this point the country have be fertile the soil be a alluvial clay result from volcanic rock but after get clear of the line of hill the soil become poor and hungry yield little else but triodium and acacia bush water be procure in several place in the course of the day 's march we course have be nearly due south camp 93 latitude 20 degree 32 minute 30 seconds 2nd October the river lead we this morning a little to the eastward of south through a country very similar to yesterday late in the day we cross a considerable tributary come from the south-east which be now quite dry and take its rise in a bold range of granite hill now visible to the southward at the distance of ten or twelve mile and form a part of the main tableland of this part of the coast the plain we have be pass over be only a sea-flat with a few detach range widely scatter over its surface the river now begin to trend to the westward granite rock show themselves on the surface in large mass water be occasionally procurable which be very important as the horse could not travel many hour without it although the heaviest pack be reduce below 100 pound we have now only six saddle-horse so that two of the party have to walk by turn for a hour at a time we halt late in latitude 20 degree 45 minute 17 seconds camp 94 3rd October start at 630 be and in a hour come upon a fine pool in the granite which be very acceptable as we have encamp overnight without any water the channel of the river here deepen considerably be full of rock and contain plenty of water skirt the range for some distance several tributary join from the southward the country although rocky improve much in general appearance grass be abundant and game frequently meet with at night we encamp on a small pool in the bed of the river about five mile from the foot of the range cockatoo and pigeon come in great number to drink at the pool about sundown camp 95 latitude 20 degree 56 minute 33 seconds longitude 119 degree 10 minute by account 4th October make a early start and travel four mile on a south-west course when the river divide into two channel the main one come from a deep gorge to the south-south-east exactly in the direction in which we have leave the strelley on we outward route at a distance of about thirty mile identify the stream with some degree of certainty take the western branch which would lead we towards the yule we follow it up until long past noon into a hilly country without meeting with water we however see a large extent of fine grazing land which would make a excellent summer station when the flat be inundate have rest during the heat of the day which have lately become rather oppressive we resume a westerly course have run out the head watercourse of the western branch of the strelley a few mile bring we to a considerable stream-bed trend to the north-west which be follow down till some time after dark have procure a few gallon of water from a native well in the bed of a creek to-day we have travel for nine hour and accomplish a distance of twenty-two mile the longest day 's march we have make for many week past early in the day we have notice what we take for a great number of native fire spring up in all direction and quickly to die away again we however find it to be a number of whirlwind carry with they huge column of charcoal and dust which traverse the plain sometimes for mile before they break camp 96 latitude 21 degree 4 minute reach the yule river 5th October we computed distance from the yule be now only twenty-one mile and the country promise well for travel but the long march yesterday and the short allowance of water render it very doubtful whether some of the horse would hold out long enough to reach it we therefore have we breakfast before daylight and as soon as we could see resume we route to the westward at five mile we cross a sandy channel 200 yard wide full of cajeput and gum tree but as we do not soon find any water in it push on at a rapid pace and in two mile more cross a similar channel 100 yard wide trend north-west and run parallel to the first beyond this the ground become rocky for a few mile and by the time we have go rather more than twelve mile mr burge ' mare lucy could go no further give she half a-gallon of water out of the little stock carry with we i leave messr brown and harding to bring she on when rest and with the rest of the party continue we route a mile or two further and another horse bob be knock up and left behind have also have some water give he with considerable difficulty we succeed in get the rest of the horse on to the yule by 130 pm make it close to we camp of 13th August have the distance be ten mile further probably not more than three or four of the horse would have ever reach it so much be they reduce in strength on reach the pool several of the horse notwithstanding we effort to prevent they rush headlong into the water with they pack on and drink so much of it that it be with great difficulty we could drag they out again in the course of the afternoon messr brown and harding come in with the horse bob but have not be able to get the mare on more than two or three mile be anxious however not to lose she i send mccourt and jame with two of the strongest horse carry four gallon of water for she after which they succeed in get she into camp by midnight camp 97 6th October -lrb- Sunday -rrb- move a short distance down the river to camp 57 for better feed cross dry country to sherlock river 7th October as the distance from the yule to the last known permanent water on the eastern branch of the sherlock be over twenty-five mile and we means of carry water very limited since abandon we largest pair of keg in the retreat on the 8th September i to-day set to work and solder up a number of preserved-meat tin that have be carefully open and keep for this purpose put a small spout to each eight of these -lrb- 4-pound tin -rrb- we find to contain something over four gallon which add to we water belt and the two remain keg would provide for the conveyance of twelve gallon of water which i hope would prove sufficient to enable we to pass the dry tract of country in safety as it would allow half a gallon to each horse and a ample supply for the party for two day i also succeed in repair the aneroid barometer which have be crush nearly flat by the fall of a horse fortunately however without injury to the vacuum vase 8th October have rearrange the load and lighten they by leave hide amongst the rock a pack-saddle and sixty pound weight of horse-shoe and nail at 345 pm we commence a retreat on we outward track of the 13th August travel to 715 pm when we encamp on a patch of tolerably good grass in the plain at the foot of a volcanic range without any sign of water near we camp 98 9th October we be up before daylight and by 6 be have we breakfast and be again on we march visit a waterhole see on we outward route but now find to be quite dry we push on at the best speed of we horse which be now not much over two mile a hour to 100 when the heat of the day begin to tell on the jaded animal we therefore halt for a hour to give the horse half a gallon of water each after which they travel on much more briskly so that by a little past noon we succeed in reach the large pool in the eastern sherlock near camp 55 some of the horse be however so much exhaust that we have some difficulty in get they to move for the last mile although entirely relieve of they load camp 55a 10th October although the horse be by no means in a fit state to continue the march yet grass be so scarce on account of the native fire have here sweep it off that we find it best to push on for the spring at camp 52 follow down the bank of the stream we find several pool not yet dry up which prove a great help to we horse before noon however the mare lucy again give in and be finally abandon as there be but little chance of she ever reach the bay it be possible she may live to be pick up by some future traveller although too old to last many year by 10 pm we reach the spring at camp 52 and find a ample supply of water but the grass be here also much parch up we however remain for the rest of the day native depredation 11th October this morning we route be resume down the eastern sherlock trace a portion that have not be before examine and which be now find to be well supply with water and grass cockatoo and pigeon be see in large number feed on the bank as we approach the junction of the two branch of the river we meet a party of ten or twelve native who come boldly up to we which be the only time we have know they to do so since quit nickol bay hope to gain some useful information from they they be allow to follow we to we old camp of 2nd August where there be the large fish-pool of which they give we the native name we be not quite so successful in procure game here as on the former visit although as much fish be catch as could be consume while it be good the native keep rather aloof while we be shoot on the river but after dusk eight or ten come to the camp unarmed evidently on a thieving excursion and although narrowly watch manage to carry off a portion of mr hall 's kit which however he recover next morning on pay they a early visit find the article bury under some rush in they camp they set the grass on fire 12th October we be now get so near we destination that although provision be get low we could afford to give the party a whole day 's rest while i be enable roughly to plot out some more of my work and write up the journal which from have my time constantly take up with more press duty have fall sadly into arrears the native again come to see what they could steal but this time be make to sit outside a line draw on the sand some twenty pace from the camp -- a arrangement they appear highly to disapprove of give expression to they dissatisfaction in a manner anything but polite finding however that we be inattentive to they impertinence so long as they confine it to harmless display they watch they opportunity and suddenly set fire to the grass in several place at once around the camp and run off as hard as they could as this be a open act of hostility that it be necessary they should be chastise for although i do not wish seriously to hurt they they be allow to run to a suitable distance when a charge of small shot be fire after they a few of which take effect in the rear of the principal offender induce he on meet some of the party out shoot to make a apology and try to lay the blame of the theft of the previous day on the dog 13th October -lrb- Sunday -rrb- as the distance between the several water place on the homeward route be too much to perform without intermediate halt and the heat of the noon-day sun rather oppressive it be find better to start from the pool late in the day so as to make the halt without water during the cool of the night travel only very late in the evening and early in the morning we accordingly do not start this afternoon until 4 pm and travel on to 845 encamp in a open grassy plain under black hill -- a volcanic eminence the position of which be show on the admiralty chart camp 99 14th October by 6 be we be again on the move and in a hour gain the bank of the george which take its rise in the volcanic hill to the southward in its channel be a abundant supply of water with many fine healthy tree overshadow the pool by 90 we arrive at we old camp -lrb- 50 -rrb- where we rest to 415 pm when we resume and travel on till nearly 80 encamp on the open grassy plain near the harding river camp 100 reach the harding river fly fox 15th October a early start enable we to accomplish the remain six mile to the harding by 830 where we halt for the remainder of the day as it be not unlikely that we might have to travel the remain thirty mile into the bay without find any more water as we have now only four day ' ration leave and it be uncertain in the present low condition of we horse how long it might take we to reach the ship the sportsman of the party make the best use of the halt to procure game while i proceed to convert some more of the empty meat-tin into water-canister increase we means for the transport of water to eighteen gallon with which we have a fair prospect of get in all the horse even though no more should be find on the route we camp be enliven this evening by the continue screech of a number of large bat which keep up a vigorous fight in the tree overhead the greater part of the night notwithstanding we shooting ten or twelve of they they be very fat but emit such a intolerable odour that it would require even a explorer to be hard press before he could make a supper of they either roasted or boil 16th October this morning set in intensely hot by noon the thermometer standing at 107 degree in the shade and at 3 pm when place on a sandbank in the sun rise to 178 of fahrenheit on the setting in of the westerly breeze it however fall at once to 96 degree and by 430 pm we be enable to resume we route without feeling in any way inconvenience by the temperature we do not now attempt to pass through the rocky range so far to the eastward as on we outward route but keep more to the westward along the open grassy valley until opposite the narrowest part of the range when turn sharp to the north we very quickly pass over the rocky portion of the hill only encounter a few mile of extra rampant triodium which be anything but pleasant to walk through especially lead the party after dark follow down a small watercourse for several mile it at length join the nickol river in which we shortly after find a small quantity of water in the bottom of what have be a pool but which towards the close of the dry season sometimes go dry here we halt for a few hour to rest camp 101 last day 's journey 17th October without wait for daylight by 210 be we be again on the move as there be now a fair chance of get all the remain horse into the bay if we do but avoid travel during the heat of the day in a hour the hill be clear and it be now all open plain as far as the marsh at the head of nickol bay by the time the morning break we be in full view of the bay and several island of the archipelago the long black hull of we ocean-home ride at anchor on the now placid water form by no mean the least pleasing feature of the scene to those who have not see a vestige of civilisation for many month after halt for nearly two hour for breakfast and to distribute the water amongst the horse we again move rapidly on cross the marsh with some difficulty owe to the spring-tide have be recently over it and at 1 pm arrive on we old ground at hearson cove where we find a boat and party from the ship wait for we jame have be despatch by a shorter route to signalize we return everything have go on satisfactorily during we absence the vessel 's water-tank have be keep fill up ensure a supply for we horse on the homeward voyage as it would be utterly impossible at this season of the year with the animal in such low condition to attempt the overland route to champion bay amongst other discovery during we absence be a bed of pearl-oyster at the head of the bay from which the crew of the dolphin have procure several ton of very fine mother-of-pearl besides a small number of pearl vary in size from one to four carat 18th October the party be fully occupy in clear out the well and pack up saddle and outfit for shipment it be also find that deepen the well have cause the water to become brackish so much so that we have to bring water by boat from the spring at which the ship have be fill up the horse however still manage to drink the well-water although it produce great thirst i have no doubt but that have we have time to sink a fresh well closer to the foot of the hill we should have obtain fresh water as several ravine terminate there in a beautiful grassy flat where a large proportion of the rainwater bring down from the hill sink into the soil from whence it gradually drain down and supply the well in the salt stratum i be disappoint to find that the cotton plant that have thrive so well on first be sow have be burn in consequence of some of the sailor have thoughtlessly set fire to the adjoining grass have they not be kill by this time they would probably have be in flower as they growth be very rapid eastern part of nickol bay 19th October as it be necessary to give the horse a few day ' rest previous to swim they off to the ship i start this morning in the life-boat accompany by captain dixon and messr brown harding and walcott to examine the eastern shore of the bay for the purpose of ascertain whether a more suitable spot for a landing place and site for a future town could be find in that quarter leave the dolphin at 530 be we run to the eastward with a light south wind pass at six mile two small island in the mouth of the small bay into which the nickol river discharge itself these island have be visit already by mr walcott and i give they the name of pemberton and walcott island continue to run along the shore towards cape lambert the sounding give from two to three fathom with a good bottom of mud and sand but the landing be generally indifferent and rocky until we come to within about nine mile of the cape when a deep opening be pass afford good shelter and landing for small craft two mile further we land in a small rocky cove for breakfast which give I a opportunity of climb a hill and examine the surrounding country which prove very dry and rocky a little further we pass a bold headland against the extremity of which rest a singular fly buttress form half a arch of fifty or sixty foot span and from thirty to forty foot in height turn this headland another opening be observe which we enter with the tide and soon find that it communicate with the first one form a island of some extent and elevation to which be give the name of dixon island we continue to beat down the channel which have a average width of over half a mile until late in the evening when we come to anchor in eleven foot of water 20th October at daylight we find ourselves high and dry only a narrow channel a few yard wide be leave have walk over the mud to dixon island to breakfast the vicinity be examine for water but without success at 6 be the tide come in again so rapidly that it be not without some little difficulty that we gain we boat when the wind set in so strongly from the south-west that after several hour ' almost ineffectual attempt to work to windward we again land not two mile from we last night 's anchorage the character of the country be equally unfavourable for landing as it be cut up by deep mangrove creek run far up the valley into the steep rocky hill form a difficult and unpromising country the breeze have moderate and shift a point more to the westward we again attempt to beat out into the bay but by 9 pm have not make more than three mile when we land for the night leave two of the party in charge of the boat to keep she off the rock when the tide fall 21st October the wind and tide be now in we favor by 330 be we take to we boat and arrive on board the dolphin by 10 when she be very soon get underweigh for the purpose of take she closer in to ship the horse light and variable wind however prevent we work more than a mile nearer the landing cove by sundown when we drop anchor for the night 22nd October with a light west wind the dolphin be work into eleven foot water one and a quarter mile off the point near the cove the vessel draw over ten foot bring the mud up to the surface in we wake eight horse be soon swim off without much difficulty as we all have now some little experience in this sort of work embark for fremantle 23rd October by 2 pm the remain six horse and equipment of the expedition be all safely ship and a conspicuous intimation of we sojourn on the coast have be paint in large white letter on a pile of granite rock near the south corner of the cove we take we final departure get the dolphin underweigh by 4 with a light westerly wind which carry we through the passage between hauy and delambre island by 7 when we haul up and stand to north-north-west 24th October the wind still hold to the west we make but little progress the dolphin be only a good sailer in smooth water or run before the wind latitude 19 degree 12 minute south at noon 25th October by noon observation we be only in latitude 18 degree 42 minute longitude 113 degree 32 minute 26th October the wind veer slightly to the south we be able to make by noon to latitude 18 degree 46 minute 30 seconds longitude 111 degree 47 minute 30 seconds 27th October from this time to the 3rd November the wind continue to blow almost uninterruptedly from the south and eastward which carry we as far west as longitude 101 degree east and latitude 31 degree south where we meet with westerly wind which enable we to run up to within sight of cape naturaliste by the 8th 9th November by 10 be we be off rottnest island when the pilot come on board and take we to the anchorage in gage 's road by noon have give instruction to mr turner for the landing of the horse etc i land with messr brown harding and hall all of whom be at they desire at once release from the duty of the expedition proceed by steamer to perth 10th November have a interview with he excellency the governor and report the safe return of the party and general result of the expedition ft gregory commander north-west australian expedition perth 6th February 1862 appendix adopt the course which i have find most convenient on similar occasion i now proceed to offer a few remark on the general feature production and natural capability etc of the country traverse by the expedition which could not without disadvantage have be introduce into the foregoing narrative these remark have already appear at the conclusion of my report publish on the 18th November 1861 but be equally applicable to the present publication commence with its geographical and geological peculiarity that portion of the country that come under we observation consist of a succession of terrace rise inland for nearly 200 mile more or less break up by volcanic hill towards the coast the first belt average from ten to forty mile in width from the sea and be a nearly level plain slightly ascend to the southward with a elevation of from 40 to 100 foot the soil be generally either light loam or strong clay accord as it be the result of the disintegration of the granite rock that occasionally protrude above its surface or of volcanic rock of black scorium that frequently interrupt the general level hill of this nature also constitute the greater portion of the more elevated island off the coast cape lambert and the promontory that shelter the western side of nickol bay the generality of these rock do not however yield so rich a soil as might be expect from they origin this be owe to the absence of actual lava the eruptive heat have nearly be sufficient to convert the superincumbent primary and tertiary rock into a vitreous scorium have a specific gravity of 32 and be highly indestructible in its texture proceed inland for the next fifty or sixty mile be a granite country that have be originally cap with horizontal sandstone and have a elevation of about 1000 foot this range terminate to the southward in level plain of good soil the produce of the next series of more elevated country while towards the northern edge the granite and sandstone have undergo great change through the action of numerous trap dyke that have greatly disturb its surface produce metamorphic rock some resemble jasper and other highly cellular and scoriaceous in about latitude 22 degree on the meridian of nickol bay we come upon another and more elevated range trend away to the south-east have a altitude of 2500 foot above the sea this unlike the last section have a southern escarpment of 500 or 600 foot and consist of horizontal sandstone and conglomerate which have comparatively undergo little change and have a average breadth of eight or ten mile the southern flank be border by fertile valley of strong loamy clay merge gradually to the southward into stony ridge and hill some have a elevation of nearly 4000 foot the culminate point be attain at mount bruce in latitude 22 degree 30 minute from this point the country gradually fall to the ashburton the bed of which river in the same meridian as the bay be about 1600 foot above the sea and the adjoining range not above 2200 foot or about the same as the country on the gascoyne lyon and upper murchison of mineral i be unable to discover any trace except iron quartz reef occasionally traverse the country in a north-north-east and south-south-west direction or nearly the same as the mineral lode at champion bay but i could not find any instance in which this rock offer much to indicate the probable existence of gold it be far surpass in this respect by the rock on the upper murchison coal do not appear likely to be find within the limit of the country pass over unless towards the easternmost point attain by the expedition with respect to the harbor on the coast i can only speak of nickol bay and the anchorage under rosemary and the adjacent island the former i consider only second to king george 's sound as it can be enter in all weather either from the north or north-east and there be reason to believe that a safe passage exist between legendre and dolphin island lead into mermaid strait where there appear to be a excellent harbor at all season of the year the sounding towards the eastern and western shore of nickol bay take at low water show sufficient depth for vessel of considerable tonnage to lie within a cable 's length of the shore the bottom be fine sand and soft mud towards the head of the bay the water be much shallower not carry more than two fathom two mile from the shore no reef be know to exist in this bay except quite close into land in make the run survey of the western promontory i find that all to the north of sloping head be a island have a boat channel between from half a mile to a mile wide to the outer portion i therefore give the name of dolphin island the tide be tolerably regular and average sixteen foot but at the spring they rise twenty-one foot on which occasion the whole of the western promontory include the high land for several mile to the westward be entirely cut off by the sea the other opening be under enderby island -- a circumstance that greatly detract from the value of these otherwise fine harbor as it would require two mile of causeway to connect the best landing place where water be to be find with the mainland the average declination of the needle throughout this district i find to be 1 degree east the result of many amplitude and azimuth there be however in the vicinity of many of the volcanic hill great local attraction of the climate i can only say that during the five month we remain on the coast we never experience the same inconvenience from it that we frequently have do within the limit of the settle district of the colony the weather be however principally fine and the sky clear during we stay only two shower have occur -- one at the latter end of may and the other in June the meteorological register keep at nickol bay show the following result from observation take at all hour of the day and night : -- column 1 : month in which thermometer reading be record column 2 : maximum column 3 : minimum may : 80 : 65 June : 76 : 63 July : 78 : 56 August : 80 : 54 September : 83 : 65 October : 92 : 70 under the peculiar circumstance of the thermometer be place on a sandbank in the sun during the hot day in October it rise to 178 degree of fahrenheit whilst the lowest it ever fall to be up in the hill in July when it be 2 degree below freezing just before sunrise the wind continue to blow almost uninterruptedly from the east and south-east during the first four month veer to the south-south-east and south and occasionally to the north-east latterly the wind be alternately south-east in the morning and north-west or westerly in the afternoon the sky become frequently overcast and every appearance of the near approach of the rainy season which it have be observe by navigator and explorer to do about the beginning of November and continue to march amongst the natural production i would first briefly refer to the bed of the pearl oyster as they be likely to become of immediate commercial importance considerable number have be gather by the crew of the dolphin at they leisure time the aggregate value of which i be tell be between 500 and 600 pound besides pearl one of which have be value by competent person at 25 pound the limit of the bed be as yet undefined but there be good reason to believe from the position of it that with proper apparatus ship could soon be load with they sandalwood be find in small quantity very highly scented but too widely scatter to become of much importance as a article of export of indigenous fruit etc we observe the adansonium or gouty-stemmed tree of sir g gray -lrb- nearly ally to the baobab or monkey bread-fruit of southern africa -rrb- sweet and water melon similar to those formerly see by I on the lyon river but of much larger size a small gourd a wild fig well-tasted and a sweet plum very palatable be find in tolerable abundance i have already speak of the palm which grow on the bank of the fortescue they be very handsome and grow to the height of forty foot but not have bring in any specimen they have not yet be identify as to they variety tobacco do not grow so luxuriantly here as on the lyon river but the native collect it and after preparation chew it but we do not on any occasion observe they to smoke many beautiful flower be also collect which will be forward to some of the most eminent botanist to be describe and classify it now only remain for I to give a opinion on the capability of the country for colonisation it would be almost impossible to particularise the position or define the limit of country adapt for grazing purpose beyond the reference already make to they the total amount of land available for this purpose within the limit of we route i should estimate at not less than two or three million of acre and of this i may safely say 200000 be suitable for agricultural purpose the greater portion of which lie on the two flank of the hamersley range on the bank of the degrey and its tributary and on the lower sherlock of the fitness of this district for the growth of wool which on account of its be a intertropical country it be generally suppose it would be unsuitable i would remark that its elevation above the sea appear likely to obviate the objection and render it probable that sheep may not degenerate in the same way they be find to do in other tropical country at any rate flock be now be push over on to the same latitude in queensland and we do not hear of the wool-grower complain that such be the case there as to its fitness for the growth of cereal it be quite possible that wheat and barley may not come to the same degree of perfection they do in the more temperate latitudes of australium but there be no reason to doubt its capability of grow sufficient grain for the support of a numerous population what it appear more highly qualify for than anything else be the growth of cotton -- a question which at the present juncture can not be lose sight of from my personal observation of the cultivation of this plant in egypt and the attention i have recently pay to this subject while in europe i feel confident that a very considerable portion of the arable land on the degrey and sherlock be precisely the soil adapt for the production of this valuable commodity as however i purpose to make this the subject of a more lengthy paper at a future period i will not now venture to enlarge upon it as the number and disposition of the aborigine be likely to have some effect on the first settlement of a district i would give it as my opinion that these people will not prove particularly troublesome to the settler if properly and fairly treat they be not numerous and appear very willing to take employ under european and will no doubt soon be make as useful as in the other district in stature they rather exceed the usual standard some of they measure two or three inch over six foot in bring my report to a close i would wish to observe that although the result of the expedition have fall short of my sanguine hope with regard to geographical discovery and will i be afraid in some degree disappoint the anticipation of the eminent geographer who have lend they valuable aid in promote the undertaking yet i can not but hope that the large amount of additional fertile country it have bring to we knowledge will compensate in some degree for the deficiency i be however unable to refrain from again express my opinion that have not so many concurrent circumstance combine to retard the departure of the expedition until so late in the season and it have arrive on the coast at the time originally recommend by the geographical society it would in all probability have result in the full accomplishment of the object they have in view it now devolve upon I to perform the pleasing duty of record my entire satisfaction with the manner in which the whole of the member of the expedition put forward they best energy in the performance of they respective function to mr turner i be indebted for the care bestow on the management of the store department which come under he immediate charge to messr brockman and hall j mccourt and jame be due my acknowledgment for the cheerful alacrity with which they perform the duty allot to they of messr maitland brown and j harding i can not speak too highly accompany I on all the extra service upon which i be engage they have to endure privation of no ordinary description which they meet with a spirit of steady fortitude deserving of the highest praise of the valuable service render to the expedition and to science by mr p walcott i have already have occasion to refer and i sincerely hope that he talent and zeal in the pursuit of botany and natural history may meet a more substantial reward than the thanks which be justly due to he and those gentleman who have give they time and talent gratuitously in the service of they fellow-colonist to captain dixon and the officer and crew of the dolphin every praise be due for the assistance which on all occasion they promptly afford in aid the expedition and for which i gladly avail myself of the present opportunity to return they my best thanks in conclusion permit I to tender you excellency my acknowledgment for the readiness with which you have accede to my various

for explore northern australium and the special object of the imperial government in undertake it be best detail in the follow despatch from he grace the duke of newcastle secretary of state for the colony to captain fitzgerald governor of western australium : -- the honorable the secretary of state for the colony to the governor of western australium down street 31st August 1854 sir you will probably have be render aware by the report of the parliamentary debate of last session and from other source that she majesty 's government have be long consider the project of despatch a explore expedition to lay open if favor with success more of the interior of the great australian continent than the many energetic but partial attempt hitherto make have succeed in develop this scheme originate with the council of the royal geographical society who correspond with the colonial department on the subject of it during last winter but it be ultimately consider by she majesty 's government that the importance of the subject render it more advisable that the expedition should be undertake under they own superintendence and as a matter of public concern and parliament have now place at they disposal a sum of 5000 pound for the purpose and will undoubtedly give further assistance should it be requisite great difficulty have however present themselves as to the necessary arrangement the hostility in which the country be involve have necessarily direct the time and thought not of she majesty 's government only but also of many of those whose professional knowledge and experience might have be of the greatest assistance in another direction of the distinguished australian explorer now in this country some be incapacitate by reason of health and other by the circumstance of they service be require in other direction from take the command it would however be a matter of regret if now that the money have be vote and the preparation partially make the expedition be not able to start at the best period for commence operation next year which on the northern coast of australium seem generally think to be from February to April i enclose copy of certain portion of the correspondence which take place early in the present year between the colonial department and captain stoke and mr sturt who be consult in order to obtain the benefit of they advice and the former of whom i have at one time the hope to secure for the command of the expedition you will collect from these document that the general view of those who have consider the subject appear to be that moreton bay would be a convenient rendezvous for the land portion of the expedition that they might be convey by sea to the mouth of the victorium river on the north-west coast that it would be advantageous if possible that they should act in concert with a government vessel which might be employ in survey operation in the gulf of carpentarium and neighborhood while the land explorer be engage in the interior selection of commander she majesty 's government be however fully aware that such project especially where they involve so much combination can only be submit generally to the leader of such a expedition to whom great latitude must be leave as to the mode of carry he instruction into execution they have now come to the determination of offer the command of the land expedition to mr ac gregory assistant surveyor in western australium they have be induce to take this course both by the very high testimonial which have be give to the ability and fitness of this gentleman for the purpose by such authority as they have be able to consult in england and also by you own report concern he particularly that contain in you despatch of the 6th January 1852 should mr gregory accept the charge which i trust notwithstanding its arduous and responsible nature you will find he ready to do it be the wish of she majesty 's government that without wait for further instruction he should proceed immediately to sydney where he will find such instruction await he and where he party will be organise you be authorise to supply mr gregory with the necessary fund for this purpose which will be repay to the local government from the commissariat chest if you be aware of any person in you government well qualify and willing to serve under mr gregory in subordinate capacity or if he have himself any assistant whom he would be anxious to engage you be at liberty to place they at he disposal but it must be understand that this permission do not apply to person who be to take charge of scientific department of the expedition as there be already gentleman of this class with whom she majesty 's government have be in correspondence any such person who may wish to join the expedition can do so only as a volunteer copy of this despatch have be transmit by the same mail to sir charle fitzroy and likewise to the other australian governor sir charle fitzroy will therefore be fully prepare to receive mr gregory and to render he all assistance in he power and i have every reason to hope for the zealous co-operation of the several local legislature and government in a scheme intend for the development of the vast and unknown resource of they common continent you will on receive this despatch immediately communicate with mr gregory and if he should accept the command of the expedition inform both the secretary of state for the colony and sir charle fitzroy and the other australian government immediately of he have do so and of he intended movement i have etc -lrb- sign -rrb- newcastle journal of the north australian explore expedition by ac gregory the preliminary arrangement for the north australian explore expedition be complete the store equipment and a portion of the party be embark at sydney in the barque monarch and schooner tom tough and sail for moreton bay on the 18th July 1855 and on the 22nd anchor at the bar of the brisbane river the next day the monarch attempt to enter the river but be take by the government pilot half a mile to the east of the channel over the bar ground and be not get off till the 26th when she enter the river the steamer ballarat be engage to tow the monarch up to the town of brisbane but have strike on a rock near ipswich sink and the steamer hawk be engage to tow up the river the hawk however prove to be of insufficient power and it be then decide to embark the horse and sheep which have be collect by mr hc gregory at eagle farm horse embark at moreton bay the horse have be get on board the monarch on the 31st July and the sheep the next day the steamer bremer be employ to tow she over the bar it be evident however that the bremer do not intend to do this for she slack the tow-line and then steam ahead full speed and snap the hawser and go off without any explanation have remove a quantity of store from the monarch to the tom tough so as to reduce the draft of the former on the 8th August warped over the bar and go over to moreton island where about three ton of water be take in from the fresh-water creek near the pilot station on the 12 August weigh and leave moreton bay and this be the last point of communication with the civilised world the expedition might be consider to commence on this date the party consist of eighteen person as follow : commander ac gregory assistant commander hc gregory geologist j wilson artist and storekeeper j baine surgeon and naturalist jr elsey botanist f mueller collector and preserver j flood overseer g phibb stockmen etc c humphry r bowman c dean j melville w dawson w shewell w selby s macdonald h richard j fahey the livestock comprise fifty horse and 200 sheep the provision consist of flour salt pork preserved beef rice pea preserve potato sago sugar tea coffee vinegar limejuice etc calculate to supply the party on full ration for eighteen month on 13th August pass breaksea spit and port curti next morning the weather be fine with south-east wind reach port albany on 26th land on albany island which be principally of sandstone formation rise into hill of moderate elevation the soil generally poor and sandy cover with bush and small tree with a few open grassy patch fresh water be find in a small cove 100 yard north from the landing-place on the sandy beach the supply be so small as to be of little use and the position inconvenient of access the mainland appear to be cover with much dense bush and the rocky sandstone hill do not indicate that the country be of any great value either for agricultural or pastoral purpose port albany be a narrow but deep channel between albany island and the mainland of cape york it be easy of ingress and egress but be neither safe or convenient owe to the great rapidity of the current which set through with the tide some canoe with native come to the vessel they evidently have frequent communication with vessel pass through the strait and be well acquaint with the use and name of tobacco which they smoke in large bamboo pipe they arm consist of spear bow and arrow the canoe form of a single tree rudely hollow out and fit with outrigger 27th August leave port albany and pass through endeavor strait be favor with a light easterly wind as far as port essington which be sight on September 1st and after pass through dunda strait anchor for the night the follow morning pass vernon island with a light breeze at 950 pm the monarch ground on a rocky reef off the entrance of port patterson the master of the vessel not have make due allowance for the indraught of the tide unfortunately this occur at the top of the spring tide and the result be that though every exertion be make to warp the vessel off the tide do not rise sufficiently to float she until the 10th September when by cut off the false keel and level the surface of the rock we succeed in haul she off with comparatively little damage as the weather continue calm during the whole of this anxious period as the vessel lay on she side at low tide the position of the horse be extremely inconvenient and they suffer a greater amount of injury during these eight day than on the whole of the precede voyage and it be to this that the subsequent loss of so large a number of the horse be to be attribute for though only two die on board the vessel the other become so excessively weak that some have not the strength to go through the fatigue of landing and the journey from point pearce to the victorium river and at the same time the supply of forage be so reduce that it become necessary to land the horse immediately on reach point pearce and before the place could be examine for the best landing land at the entrance of victorium river after get off the reef light wind and calm delay the voyage to the victorium river but as the tom tough work along the coast better than the monarch i go on with the schooner to examine the entrance of the river ascend the victorium to blunder bay find that the locality be not suit for landing horse and therefore return to treachery bay near which mr hc gregory have discover abundance of grass and water under providence hill of captain stoke commence land the horse on the 18th but in consequence of the strong tide and extensive mangrove flat great difficulty be encounter the horse have to swim more than two mile from the vessel to the shore and be so exhaust that three be drown one lose in the mud and mangrove and one go mad and rush into the bush and be lose have transfer the store to the tom tough on the 24th the monarch sail for singapore mr wilson be instruct to proceed in the schooner up the victorium river and to establish a camp at the highest convenient position on the bank of the river while i proceed overland with mr h gregory dr mueller and seven of the man hope by easy journey of eight to ten mile per day to give the horse time to partially recover the effect of the voyage macadam range run stream of fresh water 1st October 1855 accompany by mr h gregory i leave the camp to search for a practicable route by which we could cross the macadam range but after proceed about a mile shoot a emu with which we return to camp and again start at 710 be pursue a south-east course cross a stony ridge and at 80 be come on a creek about twenty yard wide with good pool of water and a grassy margin but the country generally barren and stony after several ineffectual attempt we ascend the hill to the south-east of the creek and traverse a very broken country of sandstone formation till 110 be when we reach the head of a creek trend to the southward this be follow down till 10 pm when we halt a hour and again proceed till 430 pm the country be very poor and rise into rocky hill on both bank of the creek we then enter a wide grassy flat destitute of tree extend six mile north to south and fifteen mile east to west on the south side there appear to be a creek or river which we suppose to be the fitzmaurice river this plain be bound on all side by steep rocky hill of sandstone of barren aspect return up the creek till 60 pm and halted for the night the day be hot and sultry though a heavy thundershower somewhat cool the air the macadam range be of sandstone the stratum of which dip about 30 degree to the south in which direction as we advance the rock be more slaty and break into rhomboidal fragment water be abundant in the creek but the grass be scanty and the rough surface of the sandstone and rocky ravine render the country difficult to traverse timber be scarce chiefly small-sized eucalyptus the cotton-tree be observe in a few of the valley 2nd October return to the camp we attempt to follow one of the creek down to the plain on the north-west side of the range but find the ravine too steep and rocky for the horse to pass and be compel to retrace we step and cross several steep and rocky hill reach the camp at 20 pm at which time the thermometer stand at 94 degree in the shade and 114 degree in the sun 3rd October three of the horse have stray and this detain we till 110 be when i start with the party leave mr h gregory and bowman to look for the missing animal proceed in a south-east direction to the cross of the first creek ascend the macadam range and steer east-south-east to the second creek the course be then north-east and east to the head of the creek tributary to the fitzmaurice river and then encamp at 345 pm at the highest point on this day 's route the aneroid stand at 2940 and at the camp 2955 thermometer 88 degree the higher point of the range do not exceed 100 before the highest ridge cross by a meridian altitude of a cygnus the latitude 14 degree 33 minute 26 seconds 4th October at 100 be messr h gregory and bowen reach the camp with one of the miss horse and have obtain some provision return to search for the other two horse at noon start with the party and follow down the creek in a south-south-east direction till 4 pm and encamp at the termination of the hilly country one of the horse madman show symptom of illness a short time before we start and in cross the creek half a mile above where we encamp he fall down and in less than three minute die this be a serious loss as this animal be one of the most serviceable of we horse have stand the voyage without lose he condition the cause of death we be unable to ascertain but the probability be that some poisonous plant exist at the place where we encamp last night by a meridian altitude of a cygnus the latitude of the camp be 14 degree 39 minute 26 seconds thermometer : sunrise 80 degree at 11 be 93 degree wet bulb 80 degree 5th October this morning i start with c dean to examine the country to the east after traverse the plain for two hour come to a run stream ten yard wide but the current very slow the vegetation on its bank be very luxuriant present a striking contrast to the surrounding country follow the creek to the east and south for one and a half mile when it change to a salt creek join the fitzmaurice river we then steer south-east to a detach conical hill which consist of the same hard fine-grained sandstone as the range near the camp steer north-east and east for three mile along a salt creek come to the termination of the salt water where we see four native digging root on observe we they decamp we course be now south-east to a range of rocky hill which we could not ascend with we horse from they steep and rocky character we therefore steer north-west to a green patch of bush in the plain and at two mile come to a small lagoon 200 yard long and 30 yard wide on which be numerous duck and other water-fowl here we halt for one and a half hour and then by a north-west and west course pass through grassy plain and patch of forest reach the camp at 830 pm thermometer 78 degree to 104 degree 6th October start at 810 be with the whole party and steer east to the run creek cross it at the head of the salt water and proceed up the stream three-quarter of a mile encamp near the creek we see a native man and two woman who be much alarm at the sudden appearance of the party and retreat across the plain by a meridian altitude of a cygnus the latitude be 14 degree 40 minute 4 seconds at this camp 7th October at 80 be steer a easterly course cross the grassy plain beyond which we pass a low stony ridge thinly wood with small tree at 940 cross a deep watercourse with waterhole and grassy flat and at 1015 pm come to a second creek which be follow up to the east-north-east till 1120 when we halt at a small patch of grass at 1 pm i ride to the north and east to seek a more suitable spot for a encampment and have find a grassy flat and pool of good water one and a half mile higher up the creek the party move on to it at 4 pm 8th October take dean with I i proceed to the south of the camp to ascertain the most convenient ascent of the rocky hill which bound the plain follow a small valley into the hill after two hour ' ride come to a creek trend to the south the valley of which afford a practicable line of route we therefore return to the camp at noon at 30 pm start with the party and move the camp to the creek find in the morning thermometer 114 degree at 1 pm 9th October start at 80 be accompany by dean and follow the creek through a rocky valley between sandstone range the stratum of which dip to the west at a high angle -- 30 degree to 40 degree at 1015 be come to the tide water of the creek and after cross several stony ridge which come close to the bank of the creek at 1130 be reach a small run stream with a patch of good grass here we halt for two hour and then return to camp which we reach at 50 pm and find that mr h gregory and bowman have arrive with the two stray horse have find they about ten mile to the north-west of the camp at the reedy swamp from which they stray thermometer 6 be 77 degree noon 114 degree 6 pm 92 degree encounter steep rocky range 10th October at 750 be start with the whole party and proceed down the creek to the head of the salt water and then by a detour among the rocky hill reach the run creek visit yesterday and encamp at 110 be i then start with mr h gregory in a southerly direction and after a hour 's ride come to the fitzmaurice river which vary from 100 to 300 yard in width the general course nearly east and west the channel be full of rock and bank which be dry at low water the rise of the tide nearly twenty foot the hill which bound the valley of the creek we have descend terminate in a abrupt rocky ridge which leave no passage between it and the river we therefore return about half a mile to the north and after a toilsome ascent of nearly a hour cross the ridge and halt at a small spring on its eastern side till 20 pm when we proceed up the river cross two small dry creek after a fruitless search for a suitable spot to which the camp could be move there be no fresh water in the creek we turn towards the camp but could not cross the range as we everywhere encounter steep rock and ravine and be glad to extricate ourselves from the hill at 90 pm when we bivouac in a grassy flat 11th October at 430 be resume the attempt to cross the range and at length find a practicable route for the pack-horse pass a small spring of water at 70 be and reach the camp at 8 be during we absence one of we best pack animal have die apparently from poison at 20 pm the party start to cross the range but the horse drummer be so weak that he fall several time and we be at length compel to abandon he have cross the hill to the fitzmaurice river we proceed up the valley and halt at a salt creek seven or eight yard wide there be a little green grass on its bank latitude by observation b pegasus and a andromedae 14 degree 47 minute 18 seconds horse bite by alligator cross the fitzmaurice river 12th October during the night the horse be several time disturbed but it be not till morning that the cause be ascertain when we find that they have be attack by the alligator and three be severely bite and scratch at 80 be start to follow up the river but the rocky hill approach so close to its bank as to leave no passage and we have to ascend the range which be not a easy task after three hour of severe toil under a scorching sun we reach a more practicable country and at 330 pm encamp on the bank of the river above the influence of the tide fifty yard wide two of the horse have be leave about a mile from the camp quite exhaust but at sunset they be bring in to the camp latitude by observation a cygnus 14 degree 51 minute 37 seconds 13th October at 70 be cross to the left bank of the river at a stony bar where the water form a rapid twenty yard wide and two foot deep we then follow the river up for half a hour and alter the course to south-south-east along a run creek ten to twenty yard wide at 85 be cross a run stream from the west at 1030 be two of the horse be completely exhaust but have rest they at a pool of water one revive but be compel to leave the other we then proceed but be oblige to return to the creek about a mile higher up as several of the horse begin to fail and though we rest till 30 pm the second horse be unable to proceed and be therefore abandon since these horse be land they have not have strength to rise without assistance and it have be necessary to even watch they while feed to lift they up when they fall down from exhaustion continue we route the valley be about two mile wide with flat-topped hill bound it on the east and west there be a few pool of water in the creek but the country be poor and stony with a few patch of grass at 50 pm encamped latitude by meridian altitude of a cygnus 15 degree 1 minute 10 seconds 14th October start at 630 be and pursue a south course till 80 be when we cross the ridge at the source of the creek and ascend some stony gully to the south-west at 1040 be halt at a small waterhole in a small creek re-commenced we journey at 30 pm and follow a valley to the south-east but find the country in that direction unsuited for we object turn to the west and reach the creek again at 515 pm follow it till 60 pm to the south-west and encamped there be abundance of water in the creek and the rank growth of the grass on its immediate bank prove a great impediment to the horse the back country however be very rough and stony thinly timbered with white-gum eucalyptus of small size and nearly destitute of leaf and though the whole country be grassy it be so much parch by the intense heat that it present a very sterile aspect at 430 pm there be a heavy thundershower 15th October as the creek below the camp trend to the west and enter a deep rocky gorge in the sandstone range we steer south at 70 be cross several stony ridge with small gully and creek trend west at 1020 be cross the highest ridge and observe a succession of low stony ridge occupy the space between we and the sea range descend we reach a creek on the bank of which we halt at 1130 be here we catch several small fish in a deep pool in the creek 15th October resume we route down the creek at 230 pm the average course be south-west till 530 when we be encamp at a large deep pool or reach of water three-quarter of a mile long and fifty yard wide supply by a small stream great number of large bat be see hang in the tree on the margin of the creek some of which we shoot the flesh be white and be eat but it have a unpleasant flavor the country during this day 's journey have not be so hilly as yesterday and near the camp the tree have retain a few leave the soil however show no improvement be universally stony and though well-grassed the country be useless for any purpose than feed stock the gouty-stemmed tree -lrb- adansonium -rrb- be more frequent on the bank of the creek pandanus and fig tree prevail near the water and eucalyptus on the hill latitude 15 degree 17 minute 50 seconds the valley of the victorium river 16th October resume we journey down the creek at 70 be the general course south-south-west the country become so steep and rocky that at 80 we leave the valley and steer south cross several stony hill with rocky ravine which be so rugged that they be scarcely passable at 110 sight the victorium river about six mile below kangaroo point but on attempt to descend the range be intercept by a deep valley bound by sandstone cliff 50 to 100 foot high follow the valley to the east and north-east in search of a break by which we could descend but without success at 30 pm one of the horse be so completely exhaust that he could proceed no farther i therefore halt the party and be examine the cliff to ascertain the best place for lower one of the party by a rope into the valley for the purpose of procure water from the pool which be visible 300 foot below we when i find a small spring on the top of the cliff at which we encamp as soon as the horse be unsaddled mr h gregory and myself proceed to examine the valley to the east but have not go more than a mile when we observe a column of smoke rise from the camp follow by a sheet of flame which extend in a few seconds to the side of the adjacent hill we therefore return to the camp to subdue the fire and if possible save some of the grass for the horse which with great difficulty we succeed in do but though check the fire have extend many mile over the country and keep we busy all night this fire originate for want of due precaution in clear the grass around the fire at the camp though the cook have be caution on the subject 17th October at 50 be leave the camp with mr h gregory and recommence the search for a practicable descent into the valley and about two mile from the camp find a break in the cliff the hill be however so steep and rocky that it be necessary to form a path for the horse and while mr h gregory return and be bring up the party from the camp i employ myself in fill up chasm with stone and remove rock from the path the steepness of the declivity greatly facilitate they removal as it require but little force to hurl rock of several ton weight into the valley below fortunately we accomplish the descent without any accident and reach the base of the hill at 1130 be descend the creek which occupy the lower part of the valley for about two mile encamp at a small pool of water i then ride down the bank of the victorium river and ascertain that we be about six mile below kangaroo point return to the camp procure fresh horse and accompany by mr h gregory proceed to kangaroo point reach the spot appoint for leave a notice of the movement of the party in the schooner just as it fall dark and though we find a small tree notch with a axe there be nothing to guide we in any further search and we therefore bivouac 18th October at daylight recommence we search for some memorandum for we guidance to the camp or vessel but only find five or six small tree cut with a iron axe and the remains of a large fire but if any memorandum have be leave there be no mark leave for we guidance in the search for it and i feel disappointed that my instruction have be so inefficiently carry into effect as it be doubtful whether the vessel have proceed up the river i decide on continue we route to some convenient spot for a camp near steep head and accordingly return to the party the southern face of sea range be very abrupt and surmount by a cliff of red sandstone 50 to 100 foot high the whole height of the hill about 500 foot the range be the edge of a elevated tableland the upper stratum be hard sandstone in horizontal bed which rest on soft shale which appear to be somewhat inclined but its surface be so cover by fragment of the upper rock that no satisfactory datum be obtain the soil of the level land between the victorium and the sea range be very poor and either sandy or cover with fragment of rock there be no water and the grass be very coarse and blady many flight of cockatoo come to drink at the pool near the camp and about fifty be shoot during the day ascend the victorium river 19th October start at 70 be and follow the river up to kangaroo point and then by a easterly course ascend the salt-water creek which join the victorium at this point at 40 pm we reach the termination of the salt water beyond which it divide into several small dry channel in one of which we find a small pool of fresh water at which we encamp at 415 the result of we shooting this day be one turkey one hawk and thirty-nine cockatoo the country near the creek be brown loam but as the hill be approach the soil be very stony but well cover with grass and very thinly wood with small eucalyptus which be nearly destitute of foliage to the south of the creek the country appear to be of somewhat better character the tom tough wreck 20th October at 70 be steer north 160 degree east till 100 over a level grassy plain wood with small eucalyptus and melaleuca etc the soil vary from a brown loam to a strong clay alter the course to 190 degree we pass some low stony ridge and at 1130 halt in a dry gully to rest the horse during the heat of the day at 30 pm again start and steer to the south-west for half a hour when we camp at a sandy creek in which there be a shallow waterhole at 40 i leave the camp with mr h gregory and proceed west-south-west to the river which we reach at 545 and then follow it up for half a hour when we observe a tent and boat on the opposite side of the river have hobble the horse we cross over to the camp which be establish at a small spring and find mr elsey and two of the man in charge mr elsey inform I that the schooner have ground on the bank below mosquito flat and have receive considerable damage fourteen of the sheep have be bring up to the camp and the boat be expect up that evening with another lot of sheep i now ascertain that a bottle have be bury near the marked tree at kangaroo point and a pencil-mark make on one of the tree indicate its position but this mark have escape we observation in the evening messr baine and flood and one of the man arrive at the camp in the long-boat bring twelve sheep have lose several on the passage up the river in consequence of detention on the shoal near the dome the whole stock of provision at the camp consist of ten pound flour ten pound pork six pound sugar and twelve pound beef i be unable to send the require supplies to the party in charge of the horse and the sheep be too poor to be fit for food the tom tough reach entrance island on the 25th September and the next day anchor off rugged ridge on the 27th be proceed up the river and ground on a ledge of rock on the south side of the river about six mile below mosquito flat and from that date be never sufficiently afloat to be under control but gradually drift up to about two and a half mile below curiosity peak from the time of get on the rock she have leak considerably and a large quantity of store have be destroy or damage there be at one time four foot of water in the hold but by nail batten and tar blanket over the open seam the leak have be greatly reduce the stock of water on board the schooner have be exhaust during she detention mr wilson have send the boat up to palm island to bring down a supply but have greatly miscalculate the time requisite for this expedition up the river the distance be sixty mile the sheep have be keep several day without a sufficient supply of water and a great number have die 21st October proceed down the river with messr baine and flood in the long-boat the tide be unfavourable we only reach kangaroo point 22nd October start at 20 be and reach the schooner at 110 be have be delay by the flood tide the vessel have not move during the last four tide and the leak have in some degree stop she be so deeply bed in the sand that though the bank be dry at three-quarter ebb i could not examine she bottom the deck beam however be strain and break and it be evident that the vessel have be much damage by rest on she center when the current have work deep hole at the head and stern only fifty-five sheep remain on board and those in a miserable condition at 50 pm despatch mr flood in the gig with one month 's provision for the party at the camp 80 pm the tide rise to five foot on the bank but the vessel only just float in the hollow in which she lay 23rd October at 80 be the tide rise to six foot on the bank and the schooner be move she own length towards the channel in shore at 100 be the tide ebb and she settle on a even keel mr baine have inform I that overseer humphry have refuse to assist in pump the schooner on the 9th he have therefore put he off duty till mr wilson return on the 14th when he be put on duty again i therefore fine he one week 's pay the night tide do not rise so high as in the morning land to search for fresh water and find a small spring on the bank of the river at the upper end of the stony beach three and a half mile below curiosity peak this spring be below high-water mark but at half tide boat can approach close to it there be deep water close to the bank 24th October land at 2 be to procure water have open a well at the spring fill two cask and return to the vessel at 7 at 930 the schooner float and we move she to about a mile above curiosity peak where she again ground on a bank while afloat the pump have to be keep constantly at work with the night tide we float over the bank but the breeze fail she be sweep against the shore two and a half mile above curiosity peak and before the kedge could be lay out the tide fall 25th October the morning tide do not rise sufficiently to allow we to cross the bank but the schooner be warped into a better position in the channel about one mile higher up the river land the sheep and drive such as could walk to the waterhole at we camping place one mile north of the dome and leave a party in charge consist of dr mueller mr wilson overseer humphry and w selby fifty sheep be land but only forty-four reach the waterhole and of these one die during the night the night tide rise eight foot and we move the schooner to the right bank of the river off broken hill and anchor in the channel before the full moon the tide have be higher during the day but as the time of full moon approach the higher tide be at night 26th October at 100 be weigh and run up the river with the flood to the commencement of the reach below kangaroo point when the schooner ground on a bank proceed with mr baine in the gig to the sheep camp with the intention of move the sheep across the river and then drive they to the upper camp but find they so weak that this arrangement be not practicable return to the vessel 27th October at 3 be the vessel float and she be move about a mile above kangaroo point when we anchor in three and a half fathom at noon weigh and with a light breeze from the west and north till a thunder-squall from the south-east compel we to come to anchor one mile below sandy island a change of wind enable we to move on to sandy island 28th October at 2 be weigh and tow the schooner to the upper end of the spit off sandy island when she ground but be warped off at 4 the wind and tide be now adverse and we therefore anchor in two fathom there be two fathom in the channel past sandy island but a reef of rock extend from the left bank of the river which render it necessary to keep close to the edge of the shoal off the island tom tough reach depot camp 29th October at 2 be weigh with the flood and tow the schooner up the river about four mile at 630 a light northerly breeze enable we to stem the ebb tide and at 940 the schooner be moor at the camp in two fathom close to the bank have obtain a supply of water i despatched mr baine with phibb shewell and dawson in the gig to bring up the sheep the long-boat also go down the river with a crew from the vessel to bring up the kedge anchor and warp from alligator island and also to assist in bring up the sheep in the evening there be a fine breeze from the east and the thermometer fall to 65 degree during the night a few day before we arrival one of the kangaroo dog have be seize by a alligator and instantly drown the horse have be bring to the camp by the ford at steep head and be look well 30th October commence the erection of a shed to protect the store as it be necessary to land the cargo of the schooner to effect repair the keelson be break seven foot before the mainmast three of the deck beam be break in the center and the knee be strain and the bolt draw there be also reason to think that the floor timber be fracture and some of the timber break in she bend 31st October messr wilson baine and mueller with the party in charge of the sheep arrive at 7 be bring the remainder of the sheep twenty-six in number eleven have be drown from want of proper care in bail the boat which consequently sink during the night such of the party as be not otherwise engage be employ in the erection of the store shed be desirous to examine the river above steep head commence fitting the portable boat but find that the heat of the climate have destroy the seam of three of the air cell and the boat be therefore unserviceable the general character of the material of which inflate boat be construct preclude any effectual repair as the intense heat of the sun decompose the varnish with which the canvas be cover it first become soft and adhesive and then change to a substance like tar which do not consolidate with a lower temperature adjust the aneroid barometer 1st November s macdonald be report for be asleep on he watch during last night reprimand he for this neglect of duty several of the sheep escape from the fold last night some have be find but eight be miss commence thatch the store land maize bran and other store from the schooner though the thermometer stand at 100 degree in the shade yet a westerly breeze render it cool enough to work mr baine employ repair the portable boat richard clear a plot of ground near the spring for a garden damage to provision 2nd November continue to discharge the cargo of the schooner at the request of the master of the tom tough examine sixteen small and four large cask of bread which have be damage by salt-water the whole of this bread be find to be quite destroy and unfit for use although the large cask have be carefully cooper in sydney yet the hot climate have open the joint and as there be three to five foot of water in the vessel when aground in the lower part of the river the bread be completely saturate the leakage of the schooner have be much reduce and now only require pump every six hour the dryness of the air have increase from 10 to 20 degree of evaporation and the heat be not so oppressive though the mean temperature exceed 85 degree heavy thunder-cloud be visible on the horizon and the lightning be frequent in the early part of the night especially to the east since the spring tide the river have gradually fall and be now four foot lower than low water at the full and change and it do not vary more than one and a half foot in the twenty-four hour a small spring of water have be find below high-water mark close to the landing place 3rd November complete thatch the store continue landing store from the schooner cooper the flour-barrel towards evening there be a strong breeze from the north which suddenly veer to the west with thunder and a little rain the sheep be visibly gain flesh and the horse have improve but they be still unfit for work as the grass be very dry and not in a state to fatten animal 4th November -lrb- Sunday -rrb- the sky be overcast in the afternoon with a strong north-west breeze and every indication of approach rain 5th November landing store from the schooner general duty light shower at 3 pm evening cloudy by observe altitude on the meridian the latitude of the camp 15 degree 34 minute 30 seconds 6th November messr h gregory elsey and mueller with two man and the master of the schooner proceed up the river in the gig to ascertain the most convenient spot for procure timber for the repair of the vessel the man variously employ cooper cask fence garden etc towards evening the sky be overcast and a slight shower fall at 4 pm the thermometer vary from 85 degree 100 degree 90 degree mosquito be very numerous in the evening receive from mr wilson a copy of he diary while in charge of the party on board the schooner ascend the victorium river in go down to the well richard fall down among the reed and a splinter enter he wrist pass under the skin for one and a half inch but no material injury have occur though the wound will disable he for a few day 7th November man employ cooper the flour-casks fencing the garden complete the store and general camp duty the party which go up the river yesterday in search of timber for the repair of the vessel return in the evening have find some suitable melaleuca-tree on the bank of the creek below steep head the afternoon be again cloudy with much lightning in the evening 8th November man employ clear away the grass and bush around the camp landing cargo from the schooner plot map of route from point pearce to the victorium river 9th November party employ as before 10th November party employ as before on unpack the rice and pea find that 720 pound of rice and half a bushel of pea be destroy by salt-water and much more damaged much of the sugar be damage but as it be not prudent to open cask the quantity lose can not be ascertain write to the master of the tom tough request information with reference to a complaint by mr wilson that on the 30th September he signal for a boat to bring he to the schooner have be disregard 11th November -lrb- Sunday -rrb- timber for repair of vessel 12th November mr h gregory with shewell and dawson accompany captain gourlay to steep head to cut timber for the repair of the schooner erect a forge and continue the preparation of the garden etc last night one of the sheep be strangle by get entangled in the net which form the sheep-pen receive from the master of the tom tough a letter reply to my query of the 10th instant it appear that on the 30th September while the schooner be aground in the lower part of the victorium mr wilson land to search for fresh water at mosquito flat have make some indefinite arrangement with mr elsey to signalize for a boat should he require it to return to the vessel but he omit to acquaint either the master of the schooner or mr baine who be next in command to mr wilson the result be that when the signal be make there be some uncertainty whether they be fire light by mr wilson as signal for a boat and some delay ensue in prepare the boat when it be find that the tide have fall so much that there be not sufficient water to float the boat over the intervene sand-bank and at low water mr wilson wade across the deeper channel and walk over the dry bank to the vessel as the affair appear to be complicate with some private misunderstanding between the party and mr wilson have neglect to make proper arrangement with the master of the vessel i deem it desirable that the investigation should not proceed any farther 13th November mr baine have succeed in repair the portable boat i make preparation for a excursion up the river as the horse be still unfit for the work of exploration and i hope to be able to cross the shallows which have obstruct captain stoke richard ' arm do not progress in a favourable manner and it be therefore necessary that mr elsey should remain at the camp to attend to he case the party proceeding with the boat will therefore consist of mr wilson mr baine mr flood and myself man employ as before and the general duty of the camp 14th November party employ as before at 330 pm i leave the camp and proceed to the creek where the timber party be at work reach they bivouac at 730 six log have be cut twenty to twenty-five foot long and twelve to fourteen inch square the timber be a melaleuca with a broad leaf -lrb- melaleuca leucodendron -rrb- the gum timber be generally unsound and worthless 15th November return to the principal camp with mr h gregory at 110 be and at 2 pm start in the indiarubber boat with messr wilson baine and flood at 80 pm reach the creek near steep head and remain at the camp of the timber party for the night 16th November start at 630 be and cross the shallows at steep head without much difficulty -- as the tide be high the water be six to eight inch deep three mile above steep head we observe three native watch we but they do not approach at 100 be reach palm island which be only a bank of shingle with a few pandanus and melaleuca tree grow on it without a single palm-tree of any kind one of the boat have be injure haul she up for repair mr baine shoot three whistle duck on the island they be very good eating while at we dinner a native approach the bank of the river and come to we and a parley commence which be rather unintelligible and when he find that he could not make himself understand by word resort to the language of sign and express he contempt of we in a unmistakable manner have repair the leak in the boat we again move up the river but at one and a half mile come to a dry bar of rock over which the boat be carry and we pass a shallow pool of brackish water half a mile long to a second bar of greater breadth and then enter a deep reach but the day be so far advance that we take advantage of a level rocky ledge and bivouac indiarubber boat fail 17th November proceed up the river about a mile and come to a dry bank of shingle and rock which extend for at least a mile and over which it be not practicable to carry the boat which have be much injure in cross the rocky bar yesterday the heat have destroy the texture of the waterproof canvas i therefore decide not to expend any more time on this excursion but return to the camp we observe some black watch we from some thick scrub but they do not approach near enough to hold any communication at 20 pm commence the return down the river and reach palm island after dark and bivouacked 18th November at 30 be there be a slight shower and at 60 be proceed down the river have drag the boat over the shingle bank at steep head where there be scarcely one inch of water halted at the creek where the timber have be cut to procure water for breakfast and then sail down the river and encounter a heavy squall with thunder and lightning just as we approach the camp the rain continue nearly throughout the night captain gourlay inform I that on the 16th three black have visit he party while cut timber and that in the evening some noise be hear and be take for the voice of the black they have take to the boat with great precipitation and return to the schooner the mosquito have nearly disappear 19th November send a party consist of phibb humphry shewell selby and dawson to assist the master of the schooner in bring the timber down the river richard ' arm be somewhat better but not progress favourably fahey be on the sick list the rain have moisten the grass the horse do not come in for water to-day the weather continue very hot generally 90 degree at sunrise and 105 degree at noon in the shade 20th November commence shoe the horse and make preparation for a journey up the victorium to reconnoitre the country previous to start for the interior 21st November fahey be convalescent be employ as cook mr h gregory mr flood bowman and melville shoeing horse dean make charcoal for the forge in the afternoon there be a heavy thundershower the fly be very troublesome and annoy the horse so much that they will not stand quiet to be shod and some of the horse be nearly blind in consequence of the fly crawl into they eye 22nd November shoe horse fitting saddle etc the schooner leak about seven inch per hour and as the master be absent with the greater part of the crew procure timber i have afford assistance from the party at the camp to assist in keep the vessel dry explore the upper victorium 23rd November prepare equipment for the party proceed to explore the victorium river towards the upper part of its course the grass have become quite green and fresh water be also abundant which have cause some of the horse to stray beyond the usual feeding ground on the whirlwind plain 24th November mr h gregory and mr flood bring in the stray horse have find they beyond sandy island the timber party return to the camp with four log of timber which be intend to strengthen the keelson while at work at the creek where the timber be procure the party have be twice visit by the black these intrusion be neither decidedly friendly or hostile but they steal some small article which have be imprudently leave lie near one of the log of timber while the party be employ elsewhere about 100 be the black set fire to the grass about 200 yard from the camp and then retire at 20 pm leave the camp accompany by messr h gregory wilson and mueller with seven horse and twenty day ' provision the object be to examine the country through which the explore party will have to travel on the route to the interior at 6 be bivouac at timber creek in the principal channel of the creek there be many small pool of water and the grass be fresh and green on the flat except on the bank of the river and creek the country be very poor and stony the geological structure of the country be the same as at sea range -- the same band of sandstone cliff rest on soft shale the stratum be horizontal but beneath the shale chert and coarse siliceous limestone be expose and fragment of jasper be frequent the principal timber be white-gum of small size and the cotton-tree -lrb- cochlospermum -rrb- which sometimes attain the thickness of nine to twelve inch though grass be abundant on every description of soil yet the greater part be of inferior description and dry up completely at this season latitude by altitude of achernar 15 degree 39 minute 43 seconds 25th November start at 545 be and follow the creek to the south-south-east it rapidly decrease in size branch into small gully so that we have some difficulty in finding water for a midday halt the flat on the bank of the creek be in some part nearly a mile wide well grassed and openly timber the hill be of sandstone but chert and coarse limestone be frequently see on the lower ridge at noon halted at a small pool of rainwater the day be cloudy and cool the thermometer only 90 degree at 2 pm at 30 resume we route up the creek which soon terminate in small gully rise in stony ridge as there be no appearance of water to the south the course be change to south-east and east in which direction we follow down a gully and at 720 halted at a small waterhole 26th November start at 615 be steer first north 70 degree east and then 60 degree till 3 pm traverse a level grassy box-flat extend along the northern side of a rocky sandstone range at 30 pm reach the south-west end of the fitzroy range which be a narrow ridge of sandstone hill ten mile long and one to two mile broad at the north end of the range we find a small pool of rainwater and have water the horse push on towards the victorium river at the base of bynoe range but although the country be level we be so much retard by the soft nature of the soil that the river be not reach till sunset and the bank of the river be so steep that the water be not accessible for the horse and we therefore encamp at a small hole of muddy rainwater we camp be about four mile above the furthest point attain by captain stoke and consequently in beagle valley which we have traverse for more than thirty mile the greater part of which be well grassed and openly wood with box bauhinium and acacia the fitzroy range be almost isolate and there be a level plain five or six mile wide to the south-east beyond which there be a high sandstone range surmount by a almost unbroken cliff of sandstone near the summit and which appear to be quite impassable 27th November steer east-south-east through grassy flat for one hour and a half find that the river have turn to the northward round a steep hill but continue we course cross a low stony ridge and again approach the river the bank of which be so steep that the horse could not get to the water and therefore follow it two mile and encamp on a stony bar where the water be easy of access the valley of the river be much contract by the steep sandstone hill which come close on both bank in the bed of the river several fragment of jasper and black shale be find the latter appear to belong to the coal formation a slight shower in the afternoon cool the air and the temperature be only 92 degree at sunset and the wet bulb 79 degree latitude by achernar 15 degree 36 minute 29 seconds deep gorge in tableland 28th November start at 615 be and follow the river which first come from the east then south-east and south-west till 1040 when we cross to the right bank and halt the valley of the river be much narrower and do not exceed half a mile and be bound by cliff of sandstone vary from 50 to 300 foot high the water of the river occasionally rise 100 foot as the mark of the flood extend to the base of the cliff the regular channel of the river be about 200 foot wide the water form deep reach often more than a mile long and separate by dry stony bar of shingle and rock the sandstone be thicker here than towards steep head but there be no change in the geological character except that the chert-bed be not expose the track of several native be observe but they be not see by we at 20 pm resume the journey up the river in a generally south direction and at 430 encamped but have great difficulty in force we way through the reed to procure water latitude by meridian altitude of a perseus 15 degree 41 minute 54 seconds 29th November leave the camp at 6 be and continue the route up the river to the south till 1010 when we halt till 215 pm and then proceed on till 445 and encamp at a small pool of rainwater the bank of the river be so steep and cover with high reed that the water be scarcely accessible the valley of the river be still bound by sandstone cliff but as the stratum be horizontal and the bed of the river rise the shale be not much expose and the alluvial bank reach to the base of the cliff which be so continuous that i have not yet see a spot where we could have ascend the tableland in which the valley be excavate several tributary gully have pass but none worthy of special notice fragment of trap-rock be frequent in the bed of the river and one specimen contain trace of carbonate of copper at 60 thermometer 92 degree aneroid 2980 at the camp -- sixty foot above the river latitude by meridian altitude of achernar 15 degree 50 minute 30 seconds valley suddenly widen 30th November resume we route up the river at 540 be the general course south there be no change in the character of the country till 100 when the hill recede and the cliff cease at 1030 halted at a small pool in a back channel of the river at noon the thermometer stand at 100 degree in the shade and the aneroid 2975 -- forty foot above the river start again at 20 pm soon enter a extensive plain extend to the east south and west follow a large creek to the south-west till 615 and encamped latitude by meridian altitude of achernar 16 degree 2 minute 30 seconds 1st December at 540 be cross the creek and steer east to the foot of a rocky hill but not see the principal branch of the victorium return to the creek and then steer south-south-west till 100 be when we cross two small creek in the second of which we find a pool of water surround by reed -lrb- typha -rrb- and halt during the heat of the day the country traverse be first a stony ridge on which several small stone hut have be erect but scarcely of sufficient size for a man to enter and the roof be only form by a few piece of wood and a little grass they consist of a wall three foot high in the form of a horseshoe about three foot in diameter inside the entrance of some have be close with stone and afterwards partially open and i can only conjecture that as the practice of carry the bone of they deceased relative prevail in this part of australium it be probable that these erection be use as temporary sepulchre after cross this stony ridge enter a level plain of clay much fissure by the sun and in some part cover with fragment of jasper and sandstone as the creek be approach limestone prevail but the expose portion seem to be form by a rearrangement of the broken fragment of older rock which be visible in the gully the water at which we halt appear to be supply by a spring and not to be the retention of rainwater at 315 pm proceed in a westerly direction in search of the principal branch of the creek which we reach at 40 pm but find it much reduce in size not exceed fifteen yard in width follow it up for a hour and camp at a small but deep pool of water which be evidently supply by a spring in the limestone rock which form the bank of the creek latitude by meridian altitude of achernar 16 degree 10 minute jasper range 2nd December have fill we water-bag we leave the camp at 640 be and steer a course of north 200 degree east towards a range of hill compose of jasper rock the highest point of which we reach at 100 the aneroid stand at 2915 thermometer 94 degree three mile to the south-west of this range the country rise into a elevated tableland higher than the jasper range towards this we continue we route follow a small watercourse which gradually turn to the east find the country very dry and rocky and no prospect of find a spot where the tableland could be ascend we return to the waterhole at which we camp last night 3rd December at 60 be be again in the saddle and steer north till 720 ascend a isolate hill of trap-rock rise abruptly in the center of the open plain about 200 foot have take bearing of the surround range steer north 30 degree east till 1030 across a level grassy plain to the creek which though much larger than at the camp be destitute of water but follow its course downward at 1050 halted at a small pool judge from the height that drift-wood be lodge in the branch of the tree the flood rise about fifty foot the regular channel be thirty yard wide on the bank red green and white shale be expose but the bed of the creek be generally sandy a large tributary appear to join this creek from the west in which direction a large valley extend fifteen mile at 3 pm steer east and pass to the south of a remarkable sandstone hill which we name mount sandiman and at 530 reach the bank of the victorium come from the south-south-east follow it up for one mile and encamp where a ledge of rock give easy access to the water in the evening there be a slight shower and a heavy thunderstorm pass to the north 4th December about 545 resume we journey up the river pass through wide grassy flat and over a sandstone ridge which be cover with triodium from this ridge there be a extensive view of the country to the south and east but no hill of greater elevation than the sandstone tableland be visible and for twenty mile the valley of the river expand into a wide plain thinly timbered with box-tree continue a south-south-east course through a fine grassy country till 100 halt in a patch of green grass the elevation of this part of the valley of the victorium be not great as the barometer stand at 2977 forty foot above the river thermometer 101 degree the soil on the bank of the river be good and well-grassed but the inundation during the rainy season extend on each side of the river several mile the stratum of the sandstone where expose dip to the north but there be no alteration in the character of the rock abundance of portulaca grow near we halt place and furnish we with a agreeable vegetable this plant be afterwards find over the whole of northern australium and prove a very valuable article of food at 320 continue we route and at 530 bivouac at a small pool of rainwater in one of the back channel of the river the bank of which be inconveniently cover with high reed during the night there be continuous light rain till 40 be abundance of fish 5th December continue we route up the river to the south-south-west from 545 be till 1045 pass through open grassy box flat a low grassy range approach the right bank and again recede to the west a range of broken hill rise to 500 foot parallel to we course and five mile distant halt in the bed of the river which form fine reach of water with dry sand-bar between catch several catfish and perch mussel be abundant the form of the shell much longer than i have before see in the other part of the river at noon : barometer 2980 thermometer 104 degree at 30 pm : barometer 2965 thermometer 93 degree at 330 steer south from the right bank of the river which turn to the westward cross some fine grassy country thinly timbered with box and at 450 come to the southern branch of the river this branch trend to the north-east and consequently join at a point lower down than where we cross the junction not have be observe these two branch of the victorium be so nearly equal in apparent size that it will remain for future examination to determine which be to be consider the tributary cross to the right bank we follow it upwards along the foot of the high land for half a hour and encamp in the bed of the river latitude by meridian altitude of achernar 16 degree 26 minute return down the victorium 6th December the day commence with a heavy thundershower which continue for several hour but the rain not be quite so heavy at 6 be we start and proceed along the bank of the river to a hill about one and a half mile south-west of the bivouac on ascend the hill we find that though the elevation and position accommodate a fine view in fine weather yet the rain at the present time obscure all distant object but the country to the south and west consist of flat-topped sandstone hill with large open valley between to the east the view be obstruct by rise ground while to the north lay the vast grassy plain which we have traverse during the last two day the western branch of the river turn to the west-south-west along the foot of the sandstone range its course be mark by a line of green tree which contrast strongly with the white grass on the open plain on its bank the south branch of the river appear to come from a valley trend south-south-east but the thick mist obscure that part of the country as we have now examine the country sufficiently to enable the main party to advance a whole degree of latitude without any great impediment and ascertain the general character of the country and the nature of the obstacle to be encounter and on which the equipment of the party would in some measure depend we turn we step towards the principal camp cross the western branch of the river at 950 and reach we camp of the 4th at 320 pm the rain this morning cool the air to 74 degree at 9 be and 85 degree at sunset 7th December resume we journey down the river follow the outward track from 540 be till 110 when we halt till 325 pm thermometer at noon 102 degree with a cool southerly breeze wet bulb 78 degree resume we route cross to the right bank of the river and bivouac at the termination of the plain 8th December at 545 be proceed down the right bank of the river which be very rocky and steep we therefore cross to the left bank and at 110 halt one mile above the bivouac of the 29 ultimo between 20 and 30 pm there be a heavy thunderstorm when half a inch of rain fall at 345 resume we journey and encamp about four mile lower down the river 9th December follow the left bank of the river from 60 to 110 be find the travel less stony and intersect by gully than the right bank at 350 pm resume we route and at 630 encamped 10th December travel down the river from 545 till 100 be when we halt a quarter of a mile above the camp of the 27th November at 20 pm a heavy thundershower cool the atmosphere from 100 degree to 77 degree resume we journey at 30 and at 630 camp in the level plain at the foot of the fitzroy range on the east side water be abundant in every hollow and since we pass up the river there have be heavy rain in this part of the country and several of the gully have be run eight foot deep shoot a turkey and three black ibis the fitzroy range extend about two mile north of a line from the gorge of the river to bynoe range the victorium wind round the north end of the range and some tributary creek appear to join from the north as a valley extend several mile in that direction the rain do not appear to have be general over the country as it often occur that after travel over two or three mile of green grass where the gully show sign of recent flood that this beautiful verdure suddenly cease and we again encounter a dry and parched country which exhibit all the sign of a australian summer 11th December leave we camp at 545 be and steer west cross the low ridge of the fitzroy range and have take bearing of the feature of the country steer north 260 degree east through the level plain which occupy the space between wickham height and the fitzroy range and which be name beagle valley by captain stoke the soil of this plain be a brown clay which in the dry weather crumble into small piece so that the horse sink deeply into it but in the wet season the whole be deep mud it however appear to be very fertile and produce a abundance of grass the tree consist of bauhinium acacia and some eucalyptus halt from 100 be till 40 pm change course to north 245 degree east and after traverse a grassy box flat for two hour camp at a small watercourse with pool of rainwater in a rocky limestone channel beagle valley 12th December start at 530 be and steer north 245 degree east for one and a half hour when we pass the high bluff of the range and change the course north 330 degree east keep three-quarter of a mile east of the remarkable hill call the tower by captain stoke from a remarkable rock on the summit the country be very rough and stony though the ridge we pass over be not more than 200 or 300 foot above the river continue a north-north-west course at 945 reach the bank of the victorium which be follow on a course of 200 degree till 1010 when a large creek join the river this creek drain nearly the whole of beagle valley and take its rise in the north-west slope of stoke ' range the course be then westerly till 1215 pm when we encamp in a grassy flat one-third of a mile from the river mark a large adansonium tree 12 on its south side 13th December leave we bivouac at 530 be follow the valley of the river pass the ridge at back of steep head at 100 and halt at timber creek at 110 the heavy rain which occur in beagle valley do not appear to have extend to this part of the country and the grass be still dry and wither at 230 pm resume we route and reach the principal camp at 630 and find the party all well except richard who be still suffer severely from the injury to he wrist mr baine be absent have start on Wednesday in search of two horse which have stray to the westward baine ' river 14th December messr baine and bowman return with the stray horse have find they on the bank of a small river fifteen mile to the west of the camp this river which i name the baine river have considerable pool of fresh water in its bed which come from the south-west and flow into the large salt-water creek above curiosity peak on one occasion messr baine and bowman have halt to rest during the heat of the day when they observe some black creep towards they in the high grass but on find they be observe retire and soon return openly with augmented number and approach with they spear ship but mr baine and he companion have mount they horse gallop sharply towards they and the black retreat with great precipitation mr h gregory bring in the greater part of the horse but as they have scatter very much in search of green grass many of the horse be ten mile from the camp man employ cut and carry timber for the repair of the schooner which work be progress satisfactorily compute astronomical observation 15th December party employ as before one of the mare be report to have foal a fine filly thundershower be frequent and the country near the camp be clothe with verdure ride out with mr h gregory and mr baine to bring in some horse which have stray and which after several hour ' tracking we find and bring to the camp the horse be now much improve and with the exception of three which be still very weak be now in a serviceable condition though few be capable of carry heavy load or perform long journey but as grass and water be now abundant for the first 100 mile of the route towards the interior i hope that by travel easy stage the horse will improve and preparation be be make for commence the journey early in January the country be impracticable for dray and as the sheep can not be drive with advantage owe to the high grass and reed it be necessary to constitute the party so that the whole equipment can be convey by pack-horse to accomplish which the party proceed to the interior must not exceed nine in number for which the horse be capable of convey five month ' provision and equipment the remain half of the party will have full employment in the repair of the schooner and care of the store -- point of vital importance to the expedition it be therefore propose to make the follow division of the party which under exist circumstance appear to I the most eligible preparation for expedition 16th December the explore party to consist of the following : commander a gregory assistant commander h gregory artist t baine botanist f mueller collector j flood overseer g phibb farrier r bowman harness-maker c dean stockman j fahey the party remain in charge of the principal camp : geologist j wilson surgeon jr elsey overseer c humphry stockmen dawson shewell selby macdonald richard melville 17th December prepare a map of the late journey up the victorium shoe horse and other preparation for the expedition into the interior 18th December party employ as before 19th December remove the bone from the salt pork which be to form part of the provision of the explore party the reduction in weight be 17 per cent packing flour in double canvas bag contain forty or fifty pound each in the center of each bag of flour one pound of gunpowder be place as the most secure from accident shoe horse etc as before at 10 o'clock last night it commence rain and continue till daybreak the day have be cool and cloudy 20th December party employ as before kill one of the sheep which weigh thirty-eight pound during last night it rain for four hour and there have be shower to-day 21st December prepare for exploration as before the river commence run but be still brackish the weather be cloudy with frequent shower the country be become very soft and boggy 22nd December frequent heavy shower especially at night mr wilson dr mueller and selby go down the river to examine sea range and procure specimen of rock and plant the repair of the schooner require some broad iron i have the ironwork of one of the dray appropriate to the purpose as there be no iron of a suitable size on board the vessel party employ shoe horse fitting saddle and general preparation of equipment for the explore party 23rd December two of the horse have again stray to the westward and mr h gregory and bowman be employ nearly the whole day in track they and succeed in bring they in at night the river be quite fresh and run with a current from one to two mile per hour since the commencement of the rainy weather the general health of the party have improve but this perhaps be due to the reduction of temperature combine with greater regularity of habit and diet richard ' arm be however in a very unsatisfactory state though this be more the result of general ill-health than the original extent of actual injury 24th December prepare equipment etc as before dr mueller and mr wilson return in the boat from sea range they report the river to be fresh at sandy island frequent heavy shower which render the ground so soft that the horse can not be hobble without danger of they get bog and it be scarcely possible to ride after they to herd they 25th December christmas day frequent heavy shower throughout the day and night kill a sheep the weight 381\/2 pound 26th December prepare equipment fitting spare shoe for the horse etc frequent shower 27th December packing store fitting saddle etc this have be the first fine day during the past week have have only a single shower during the twenty-four hour flood in the river 28th December party employ as before the schooner be move into the stream as the drift-wood collect in large quantity and could not be easily clear away from the bow when moor near the bank the water of the river be very muddy and have rise about six foot above the ordinary high-water mark the current be about two mile per hour in wind chronometer 2139 the chain which be much corroded break and the force of the recoil of the spring snap it in so many place that i have to splice six of the link 29th December as before -- prepare equipment etc 30th December -lrb- Sunday -rrb- 31st December prepare tracing of map etc complete the preparation for the exploration of the interior a stampede 1st January 1856 write to mr wilson enclose instruction for the guidance of the officer in charge of the camp on the victorium write to the master of the tom tough instruction relative to the movement and repair of the tom tough etc receive from mr wilson a letter request to be inform why he have be select to take charge of the party at the principal camp write to mr wilson in reply to he letter of this day 's date have complete the preparation for the journey into the interior the horse be saddle and the party be on the point of start when a gun be fire on board the schooner and the horse take fright and rush wildly into the bush and it be only after a hard gallop of two mile that they could be turn and drive back to the camp many of the saddle and load be tear off by the horse have run against tree and as they have scatter very much it take some time to collect the bag which have fall from the horse and four bag of provision could not be find a few of the strap of the colonial-made pack-saddle have give way but there be no other damage do to they but the english-made saddle be shake to piece the party be occupy in the evening repair damages 2nd January complete the repair of the saddlery etc break yesterday two of the miss bag be find but a heavy shower have obliterate the track of the horse two bag of sugar and sago be lose 3rd January all arrangement be complete the party commence they journey at 11 be and proceed up the river to timber creek encamp there at 30 pm the follow be a memorandum of the arrangement and equipment of the party : the party : commander ac gregory assistant-commander hc gregory artist t baine botanist f mueller collector j flood overseer g phibb farrier r bowman

horse each person have a state number of horse in he special charge and be responsible for the proper care of the load and equipment the saddle and load be all mark with number a watch be constantly keep through the night each person be on sentry for two hour in regular rotation except myself as i have to make astronomical observation at uncertain hour the cook be on watch from 20 till 40 be and have prepare breakfast the party conclude this meal at daybreak and thus the most valuable part of the day be not lose 4th January start at 7 be and follow up the creek but dr mueller have wander away into the rocky hill and lose himself i halt at the first convenient spot have despatch several of the party to search for he but it be not till 4 pm that the doctor reach the camp at noon there be a shower of rain which reduce the temperature to 92 degree ascend tableland 5th January the day break with a heavy shower which continue till 730 be when it be follow by a cool breeze from the west at 830 steer north 150 degree east magnetic up the valley of the creek till 110 when cross a low rocky ridge we descend into beagle valley and steering 160 degree till 210 pm halt at a small creek the country be now cover with fine grass and water be abundant though the smaller watercourse have cease to flow in the evening walk to a hill about a mile from the camp it be only 150 foot high but give a fine view of the distant range 6th January it rain continuously during the night with thunder and lightning at 80 be steer 160 degree and soon come on a small creek with water-pandanus on its bank follow it to the south-south-east at 110 cross it and change the course to south-east and at 1130 encamp in a small gully i then go with mr h gregory to look for a practicable ascent of stoke ' range have be successful in the search we return to the camp at 6 pm there be few spot where this range can be ascend as a line of cliff run along the brow of the hill vary from 10 to 100 foot in height while on the hill we see a few black but they do not approach the day be cloudy and cool clearing after sunset latitude by canopus and capellum 15 degree 59 minute 57 seconds 7th January the day again commence with heavy shower which last till 7 be at 730 start on a course of 120 degree reach the foot of the sandstone range at 850 and the summit at 930 the tableland on the top of the range be intersect by deep ravine trend to the south-west we steer east till 1140 when we come to a deep valley trend east-south-east have make the necessary observation for elevation commence the descent of the hill which be practicable in few place as the valley be walled-in by steep hill crown by sandstone cliff 20 to 100 foot in height with only a occasional break at 10 pm reach the base of the hill and encamp at a small gully the summit of the range be nearly a level tableland the undulation not exceed 100 foot but be intersect by deep ravine with perpendicular side which vary from 100 to 600 foot in depth the upper rock be sandstone and the soil on it very poor and sandy produce small eucalyptus hakea grevillium and a sharp spiny grass -lrb- triodium -rrb- this be the spinifex of captain sturt and other australian explorer the character of the country be similar to that of the interior of some part of the western coast latitude by capellum 15 degree 59 minute 32 seconds jasper creek grassy country 8th January heavy rain till 70 be at 715 start and follow down the valley of the creek to south-south-east and south till 90 when it join a larger valley trend east in which a large creek in high flood obstruct we course as the water be too deep to ford we fix a rope to a branch of a tree and pass the pack over the stream this be accomplish at 30 pm and the water have also sink a foot the horse cross over and we encamp on the south side of the creek the valley be well grassed and vary from a quarter to three-quarter of a mile in width the hill rise steeply from the base to near the summit where they be crown by a sandstone cliff 20 to 150 foot high the summit be level or nearly so as the valley be only deep ravine excavate in the tableland the valley of the larger creek appear to expand about five mile to the west of the camp and the hill all round in they outline 9th January a light shower at night be follow by a cool cloudy morning at 650 be follow down the creek to the east and cross to the left bank to avoid a rocky hill on attempt to cross lower down one of the pack-horse be carry down the stream some distance by the force of the current and the saddle-bag be recover a quarter of a mile below the valley contract as we proceed and at length the steep cliff leave no passage on the left bank and we have to return one and a half mile up the creek and cross to the right bank when we course be again obstruct by a large tributary which be cross with some difficulty and we pass through the rough rocky gorge of the creek where the cliff approach the bank of the stream so closely that there be scarcely space for a horse to pass at 1210 pm camp on the bank of the creek at the termination of the hilly country and ascend a rocky elevation obtain a view of the valley of the victorium and ascertain that we be on one of the branch of jasper creek the afternoon and night be showery 10th January start at 630 be and steer south-east leave the creek to the north the country soon change to a level plain well-grassed but owe to the late rain very soft and muddy at 1020 pass to the north end of jasper range and come to a creek fifteen yard wide trend north-east have ford the creek camp on the right bank the soil of the country traverse this day be a good brown loam on the plain but rough and stony on the hill the tree be of a small size

sulphuret of copper and iron latitude by aldebaran and capellum 116 degree 6 minute 54 seconds variation of compass 3 degree 6 minute east 11th January one of the mare have foal in the night she be not fit for a day 's journey we therefore remain at the camp and employ the day in repair and adjust the saddle and other work of indispensable nature mark a large gum-tree na 11 jan 1856 12th January the night be fine with a heavy dew and a light breeze from the south at 615 be steer north 150 degree east over the level country which extend along the east side of jasper range the soil be stony but well grassed and the fine weather have allow the surface to become firm so that the horse be not often bog at 1225 pm camp on a small creek between the fitzgerald and jasper range mark a gum-tree at camp number 9 the general character of this part of the country be good and well suit for stock though not equal to the basaltic country to the eastward on the victorium hard sandstone jasper and coarse limestone be the prevail rock latitude by aldebaran saturn and a orioni 16 degree 16 minute 22 seconds fine plain 13th January the night cool and clear thermometer 62 degree at sunrise with

be twenty foot higher latitude by aldebaran and capellum 16 degree 25 minute 12 seconds 14th January follow the river to the west-south-west cross two large tributary creek from the north-west approach the sandstone range on the western side of the plain the soil do not improve but become very sandy the country be thinly wood with box-tree and bauhinium of small size grass be abundant and good at noon one of the pack-horses sam knock up and he load be transfer to one of the riding-horse he be leave to rest while we seek a suitable spot for a camp and at 1215 pm halt at a small gully as the bank of the river be unsafe for the horse be very boggy send back for the horse sam and bring he to camp ascend the hill to the north-west of the camp to take bearing but no important feature of the country be visible in ascend the hill the aneroid -lrb- b -rrb- fall from 2962 to 2855 degree and on descend only rise to 2880 degree the estimate height be 300 foot as this indicate a change in form of the metal of the instrument i re-adjust it to the aneroid -lrb- a -rrb- 2945 degree the continuance of fine weather and forward state of the grass lead to the supposition that the wet season have already terminate though only two month have elapse since the first rain it be probable that the wet season be much shorter in the interior than on the coast and at no great distance inland the tropical wet season will cease altogether as captain sturt in latitude 26 degree only observe a fall of rain in the month of August but this might be exceptional as in the case of dr leichhardt who never encounter a rainy season during the journey to port essington latitude by aldebaran and capellum 16 degree 27 minute 20 seconds 15th January start at 645 be and follow the river to the west-south-west the hill come close to the bank for some mile cause the journey to be slow and difficult cross two large creek come from the west-north-west the second seventy yard wide at 1035 encamp in a fine grassy flat the course of the river be now more from the south and the valley expand into a plain several mile wide 16th January as several of the horse require a day 's rest at 60 be i start with mr h gregory to examine the country to the southward and follow the river through a fine grassy plain till 100 when it enter the sandstone range and the valley contract to half a mile the hill be steep but the level ground in the valley except where intersect by gully be good travel and well grass the river be much reduce in size and the water be confine to the smaller channel of the principal bed the water be clear and have not that muddy appearance which characterise it lower down the geological character of the rock be unchanged but the bed of the river be less deeply excavate the lower bed of limestone and jasper be not so largely develop the summit of the hill be not quite as level and large block of sandstone the remains of a upper stratum give the country a very rugged appearance return to the camp at 630 pm in the evening there be a heavy thunder-squall from the north but the weather clear at midnight lose a horse 17th January start at 75 be and steer a south-west course till 1030 be pass over a level grassy flat the whole distance but the soil become more sandy as we proceed up the river there be very little wood of any description the few tree that exist be white-stem eucalyptus and a few acacia with pinnate leave the horse sam be very weak and two other horse be lame and can scarcely travel since the 3rd of January the distance travel have not exceed ten mile per diem water and grass everywhere abundant and the load not heavy yet the greater part of the horse appear to be unable to perform a greater amount of work latitude by aldebaran 16 degree 36 minute 43 seconds 18th January some of the horse have stray towards we last camp we be detain till 810 be and then steer south for three mile the sandstone hill here close in on each side of the river scarcely leave a passage at the base of the steep rock here the horse sam fall into a pool of water and when extricate could not stand this have cause considerable delay we encamp in a grassy flat half a mile farther on in the evening send bowman and dean to bring the horse to the camp but they find he dead mark a tree near camp 14 19th January the night be fine with heavy dew the temperature 73 degree at sunrise have collect the horse and saddle at 645 be leave the camp and follow the valley of the river on a average south-west course cross a large creek from the north-west the valley of the river expand to three mile and then narrow to one mile and the course of the river be nearly west till 1050 be when we encamp the soil of the valley be a brown loam produce abundance of grass but the hill though less rocky be more barren than lower down the river the character of the channel of the river have alter and have the appearance of a stream which continue to run late into the dry season as the channel be narrow and fringed with pandanus melaleuca and other tree which grow near permanent water the bank be of less height and the timber on they grow to a greater size than lower down the valley at 10 pm the thermometer 100 degree and the wet bulb 76 degree indicate 24 degree of evaporation cross the wickham river 20th January leave the camp at 655 be and follow the river in a west-north-west direction till 85 when we cross at a ledge of rock which cause a fall of about one foot the water be twenty yard wide and one to two foot deep but above and below the rapid the river form fine reach seventy yard wide the course be now west-south-west till 90 be when the river turn west and at 1050 come to a large stony creek from the south-west at which we encamp the country on the bank of the river rise gradually as it recede and except within the influence of the flood be poor and stony produce little besides a sharp grass -lrb- triodium -rrb- -- this be the spinifex of some australian explorer -- a few small gum-tree and bush as we progress towards the interior the wet season appear to have be of less duration and the fall of rain less yet the great heat have force the vegetation towards maturity and many of the grass have already ripened they seed while there be many other indication of the dry season have fairly set in the wind be steadily from the south and south-east and be very dry the sky be clear and bright and the creek have cease to run the almost total absence of bird or animal show that we be approach the limit of the dry summer season of the southern interior in the afternoon ride out with mr h gregory to examine the country and find that the river come through a gorge in the sandstone range this gorge be two mile long a quarter of a mile wide and 400 foot deep with nearly perpendicular side the winter channel of the river occupy nearly the whole breadth and intersect the otherwise flat bottom of the valley with dry sandy channel and long pool of water beyond the gorge the valley open but the view be intercept by hill a horse kill 21st January resume we journey at 710 be and follow the right bank of the river nearly west through the gorge at 90 enter a open valley through which the river come from the south-west but at 100 we enter a second defile which from the inclined stratum of sandstone be almost impassable for the horse in cross some soft ground between the rock one of the horse fall on a sharp stump and be deeply wound in the belly the wound be sew up but the injury be so severe that the horse die in the night have extricate ourselves from this ravine we encamp at the foot of a sandstone hill the stratum of which dip 60 degree to the south-west ascend the hill which be about 300 foot high the country appear more level to the south rise into sandstone range at ten mile distance the course of the river be from west-south-west the channel be bound by sandstone cliff 100 to 200 foot high the general aspect of the country be wretched in the extreme as little besides a few small gum-tree and triodium clothe the rugged surface of the red sandstone the weather continue fine with only a occasional cloud or flash of lightning in the early part of the night the temperature be increase be 104 degree at 10 pm some catfish and a small tortoise be catch in the river 22nd January at 70 be continue we route up the river but to avoid the deep ravine on its bank make a sweep to the south and at noon encamp in a grassy flat on the bank of the river the country traverse be very barren and rocky and the horse have great difficulty in cross the deep ravine many of they shoe be tear from they foot during the day 's journey the highest ridge cross be 500 foot above the bed of the river the height of which be approximately 500 foot above the sea-level and thus the general level of the tableland may be consider to be 1000 foot above the sea the general course of the river be from the west it appear advisable to reconnoitre the country to the south latitude by capellum 16 degree 47 minute 58 seconds reconnoitre to the south 23rd January leave the camp in charge of dr mueller at 630 be start in a southerly direction accompany by messr h gregory and baine take with we four horse and six day ' ration etc after clear the deep rocky gully near the river we pass over a more level country with some fine open plain cover with fine grass but the intervene ridge be very stony at 945 be reach the highest part of the range and the country decline to the south-east and intersect by deep rocky ravine trend towards a large valley which be probably drain by the southern branch of the victorium the course be now south-east descend to the valley of a creek through a very barren and rugged sandstone country produce little besides stunt eucalyptus acacia and triodium at 1115 be halt at the creek and resume we route at 30 pm and follow the valley to the south-east till 440 pm when it turn east through a rocky gorge between cliff 150 foot high but notwithstanding the dense bush of pandanus fall rock and deep muddy channel of the creek we succeed in force we way through the gorge of the creek and bivouac in the open valley below at 530 pm there be a fine patch of grass in the flat though the surrounding country be rocky and barren the sandstone rock show a great disturbance and dip at all angle and direction so that no general angle or strike could be determine the upper rock however show a new feature in a coarse conglomerate of fragment of the lower sandstone and a few fragment of basalt some of the enclosed piece of rock be nearly a foot in diameter and be mostly angular though occasionally round this rock form a horizontal bed of 100 foot in thickness towards evening the sky be cloud with lightning to the east but no rain basaltic plain 24th January at 60 be cross the creek and steer south-east over broken sandstone ridge till 80 when we enter a plain of basaltic formation cover with good grass and where the ground be not entirely compose of fragment of rock the soil be a rich black loam cross the large creek trend north at 100 be halt on the second these creek appear to rise in a steep range of sandstone hill which bind the basaltic plain to the west about two mile from we track at 30 pm resume we route and traverse the trap plain for one and a half hour and bivouac in a small gully the country on both side of we track seem to be of trap formation for several mile and then rise into sandstone hill with flat top the basaltic rock of this plain be not of great thickness as the sandstone rise in a few spot above its surface and form small island cover with coarse vegetation surround by the open grassy plain the basalt seem to have be pour out into the valley after it have be excavate in the sandstone and not to have be much disturbed subsequently the surface of the plain be very stony and the horse ' foot be much injure by the roughness of the rock stone spear head 25th January the night be cloudy and it be not till after daybreak that i could get observation for latitude by altitude of venus and b centaurus at 65 be be again in the saddle and steer south-east to a rocky hill which we reach at 70 the hill be sandstone rise about 150 foot above the trap plain from the summit the view be extensive but from the broken nature of the country to the east nothing could be trace of either the course of creek or river to the south the trap plain rise to a greater elevation than the summit of the hill we be on and be surmount by table hill of sandstone at ten mile distance to the east and north-east the country appear to consist of plain of basaltic formation well grass and very thinly wooded leave this hill at 80 follow a dry rocky creek to the east and north-east through basaltic plain with sandstone hill and ridge till 1030 and halt during the heat of the day at this place the bed of the creek have be cut through the basalt into the sandstone expose a fine section of the junction of the two rock the sandstone be much alter at the line of contact and have be deeply crack the basalt have fill the fissure of the older rock this altered sandstone and also a white quartz-like rock be much use by the native for the head of they spear and during this day 's journey great quantity of broken stone and imperfect spear head be notice on the bank of the creek at 345 pm recommence we journey and proceed down the creek to the north-east till 630 and bivouac latitude by capellum saturn and canopus 17 degree 24 seconds roe 's downs 26th January have ascertain that the party could be move across the range to the basalt plain with advantage commence we return to the camp by a westerly route across the plain which rise gently for ten mile and be well grassed but thinly wood the soil be stony with fragment of altered sandstone and basalt on the higher part of the plain there be several hill of trap-rock form flat-topped ridge trend north and south the highest of these we name mount sanford and the plain roe 's downs the country now generally slope to the bank of the creek near the western limit of the plain at which after six hour ' ride we halt at 1135 the bank of the creek be of trap-rock but the sandstone be expose in the bed the pool of water be deep and apparently permanent at 40 resume we route and pass over about one mile of sandstone and then two mile of basalt and bivouac at a small gully at the western limit of the valley 27th January at 530 be steer north-north-west over several ridge of sandstone till we strike we outward track which we follow with some deviation to the camp which be reach at 20 pm the evening be cloudy with a smart thunder-shower dr mueller inform I that he have trace the river about six mile to the west-south-west but that beyond that point it appear to come from the north-west in which direction there be a low range of hill 28th January have collect the horse at 715 be steer south to the rocky creek and follow it down to the rocky gorge and encamp as the valley be completely wall in by steep rock it appear to be a suitable spot for a depot camp as it would prevent the horse from stray and from the rapidity with which the water in the creek be dry up it become desirable that no time should be lose in push to the head of the victorium while it be practicable to cross the range in which it be suppose to rise but as many of the horse be quite unfit for the journey it become necessary to leave they in some convenient spot while a small party push on with a light equipment form a depot camp 29th January prepare equipment for the party proceed to the interior and make arrangement for the formation of the depot camp the party to consist of myself mr h gregory dr mueller and c dean mr baine remain at the depot in charge select eleven of the strongest horse and have they re-shod fit four with ride and seven with pack saddle the following provision be pack for the journey : 150 pound pork 300 pound flour 50 pound rice 10 pound sago 8 pound tea 6 pound coffee 48 pound sugar 30th January leave the camp at 730 be and steer a average course south-south-east till 1020 over stony ground at the junction of the sandstone and trap formation and camp at a fine run creek which come from a rocky gorge in the sandstone range to the west of we course messr baine and bowman who have accompany we thus far return to the camp which i have instruct he to move to this creek as better for the horse as one of they have show symptom of poison and i fear to leave they in that locality a severe attack of the fever from which i have be suffer since the beginning of the month preclude we proceeding farther this day as i have at first intend at 5 pm it commence rain and continue till midnight with incessant thunder and lightning 31st January be able to mount my horse at 8 be leave the camp and steer a course south-east by south along the foot of the sandstone range -- the basalt plain extend to the north-east at 1245 pm camp on a shallow watercourse trend to the south-south-west the whole of the country to the east of we track except some isolate hill appear to be cover with excellent grass the evening be rain with continuous thunder 1st February steer north 160 degree east from 625 be till 70 across the basaltic plain then cross a large creek trend east in which there be some large pool of water we then enter the sandstone country and cross several rocky ridge at 910 we have a good view from one of the ridge to the north and east fine grassy plain extend almost to the horizon to the south the country consist of sandstone range and to the south-east large grassy plain and rocky ridge appear to alternate with each other change the course to south-east traverse a fine plain cover with grass beyond which be a rocky ridge and then a second plain in which we halt at 1110 as i be unable to keep on my horse owe to a attack of fever at 2 pm again proceed and after cross some rugged country with deep rocky ravine at length reach a large creek at which we encamp though there be nothing but reed and triodium for the horse to eat 2nd February leave the camp at 6 be and follow the creek up for three-quarter of a hour before we could find a cross place the course be then south-south-east over very broken sandstone country at 950 halt in a grassy valley to feed the horse and at 230 pm resume we route south-east cross a sandstone ridge and descend into a wide valley the center of which be occupy by a basaltic plain at the edge of which we encamp at 355 pm crest pigeon 3rd February at 60 be ascend the trap plain and steer north 190 degree east at 645 be come to a large creek from the west which join the victorium three-quarter of a mile to the east but the deep and rocky character of the valley or rather ravine in which it run preclude we approach it and we have to turn to the west and descend from the basalt to the sandstone before the creek could be pass continue a average south course at 1010 be come to the victorium river the whole channel do not exceed 150 yard in breadth of which only twenty to fifty be now occupy by water and the rest by dry rock and gravel overgrown by bush with great difficulty we follow the river upward and be compel to follow up a tributary creek for about a mile and then encamp near this camp i see the crested pigeon of western australium for the first time in this part of australium latitude by leoni 17 degree 41 minute 4th February leave the camp at 555 be and steer nearly south for six hour and then encamp on the bank of the victorium river at the end of a fine deep pool seventy yard wide but at the lower end the water be contract into a shallow rapid ten yard wide the country traverse be of basaltic formation in the valley but the hill be of sandstone and rise on each side from 200 to 300 foot and the whole appearance of the country show that there have be little change in the form of the surface since the basalt be pour into the valley on the bank of a small creek we see a flock of tribonyx -- a bird which have create some speculation as to its proper habitat as it often make its appearance in large number at the swan river on the western coast latitude by canopus 17 degree 52 minute 19 seconds thunderstorm and squall 5th February start at 555 be and steer south-west keep parallel to the river at about a mile from it as the creek cut so deeply into the rock near the river that they be impassable at 920 be cross to the right bank of the river and continue a south-west course but find the country exceedingly rough and rocky and therefore turn to the north-west to the river and at 1130 be camp at a fine pool of water in the afternoon we be visit by a sudden thunder-squall fortunately the tent have not be set up or they must have be blow to piece the valley of the river have contract to about fifteen mile and turn to the west but a branch seem to come from the south and a second from the north-west the country be however nearly level and it be difficult to ascertain the limit of the valley as many portion of the original tableland exist as detach hill and ridge though the horse be well shod they be become lame and footsore from continually travel over rough and stony country as more than half of the last 100 mile have be so completely cover with fragment of rock that the soil if any exist have be wholly conceal 6th February leave the camp at 620 be steer south up the valley of a large creek at first the ground be very rough and rocky but as we proceed it become more level and sandy -- the bed of the creek be worn in the basalt and the hill of sandstone conglomerate rise 100 to 200 foot except on the bank of the creek there be no grass the hill be cover with triodium encamp in a grassy flat at 1130 be latitude by pollux 18 degree 48 seconds cross watershed to interior hooker 's creek 7th February at 630 resume we journey to the south-south-west and reach the head of the creek at 80 be ascend the tableland by a abrupt slope of 100 foot we course be south one mile when the southern slope be reach and a large shallow valley extend across we course beyond which a vast and slightly undulate plain extend to the horizon with scarcely a rise ground to relieve its extreme monotony descend by a very gentle slope into the valley at 940 be cross a small watercourse trend south-east and then pass through a plain densely cover with kangaroo-grass seven to nine foot high and at 1040 be encounter the level sandy country beyond which be cover with triodium and small acacia and gum tree or rather bush see little prospects of either water or grass to the southward turn east to the creek at which we encamp at 1230 pm the bed of the creek be dry except a few shallow pool of rainwater and there have be so little rain this season that no water have flow down the channel a level grassy flat extend nearly a mile on each side of the creek which indicate the extent of occasional inundation beyond which the country be very sandy and cover with small gum-tree acacia and triodium latitude by pollux 18 degree 3 seconds 8th February the country to the south be so level and barren that we could not expect to find either water or grass in that direction at 60 be steer north 110 degree east along the course of the creek which turn somewhat to the north of we track for a few mile but at 80 again come on its bank the country be very barren and sandy with small tree of silver-leafed ironbark and triodium except on the inundate flat of the creek which be well grassed and thinly wood with box-tree the course of the creek be now nearly south-east but the channel decrease in size and be quite dry till 100 be when we reach a fine pool which have be fill by a tributary gully here we halt and shoot several duck at 245 pm resume we route and at 320 come to a level grassy flat on which the channel of the creek be completely lose cross the flat to the east the country be quite level and sandy therefore turn to the north where there seem to be a slight depression and at 450 come to a shallow pool of rainwater at which we encamp frequent shower during the night the desert interior 9th February on wind the chronometer this morning find the chain of 2139 by arnold be break take advantage of the cool cloudy morning we steer south at 65 be to ascertain if the water of the creek after spread on the grassy flat collect again and find a outlet to the southward but find the ground rise in that direction observe a slight hollow to the west for which we steer but find it terminate on the sandy plain and the country become a perfect desert of red sand with scatter tuft of triodium and a few bush of eucalyptus and acacia at noon finding it hopeless to proceed further into the desert we turn we step to the north-north-east and return to we camp of last night in return to the camp we ascend a slight elevation from which there be a uninterrupted view of the desert from east to south-west the horizon be unbroken all appear one slightly undulating plain with just sufficient triodium and bush grow on it to hide the red sand when view at a distance the day be remarkably cool and cloudy the temperature at noon 86 degree though the rain at the camp have be abundant during the previous night it have not extend more than five mile into the desert which be more remarkable as the cloud be move to the south turn to the west 10th February as the horse require a day 's rest we remain at we camp which enable we to repair we saddle and perform other necessary work repair the chronometer and one of the aneroid barometer which have be break by the motion of one of the pack-horse as there be no practicable route to the south and the sandstone hill to the north seem to diminish in elevation to the east i decide on follow the northern limit of the desert to the west till some line of practicable country be find by which to penetrate the country to the south in select a westerly route i be also influence by the greater elevation of the country on the western side of the victorium and the fact that all the larger tributary join from that side of the valley it be also probable that should the water of the interior not be lose in the sandy desert they will follow the southern limit of the elevated tract of sandstone which occupy north-west australium from roebuck bay to the gulf of carpentarium both of which point be nearly in the same latitude as we present position from which it may be assume that the line of greatest elevation be between the 17th and 18th parallel none of the river cross by leichhardt be of sufficient magnitude to drain the country beyond the coast range and therefore any stream descend from the tableland to the south will either be absorb in the sandy desert or follow the southern limit of the sandstone and flow into the sea to the south-west of roebuck bay there be however reason to expect that as the interior of north-west australium be partly within the influence of the tropical and partly the extra-tropical climate it do not enjoy a regular rainy season and though heavy rain doubtless fall at time it be neither sufficiently general or regular to form river of sufficient magnitude to force they way through the flat sandy country to the coast latitude by capellum 18 degree 20 minute 49 seconds 11th February at 630 be proceed up the creek and at 1230 pm camp at a shallow pool of rainwater on the flat the channel of the creek be dry on the northern bank of the creek we pass a small lagoon with a great number of duck and other water-fowl on it the afternoon be cloudy with a fresh breeze from south-east latitude by pollux 18 degree 15 minute 26 seconds 12th February three of the horse have stray some distance we do not start till 70 be when we steer a average course of north 300 degree east till 1145 be when we camp at a small pool of water in the bed of the creek which be reduce to a small gully for the first four mile we traverse the grassy flat of the creek after which we pass over a level sandy country produce nothing but triodium stunt eucalyptus and acacia till we again approach the creek where the grassy flat be nearly half a mile wide but of inferior character latitude by b taurus 18 degree 9 minute 44 seconds 13th February at 650 be follow the valley of the creek to the west pass some fine flat with high grass but the country generally very poor and thinly wood with white-gum and silver-leafed ironbark at 1040 halted at a small waterhole at the foot of a low granite ridge at 30 pm ascend the granite hill which rise abruptly 100 to 150 foot above the plain and extend about five mile to the south and east to the west the sandstone cover the granite and form a level tableland or plain to the north a valley trend to the west on the northern side of which the hill appear to be granitic return to the camp examine a deep rocky ravine and find some small pool of water which might last for nearly another month latitude by castor and pollux 18 degree 11 minute 20 seconds pigeon and sea-gull 14th February leave the camp at 60 be steer a average course of north 300 degree east cross the granite ridge we enter a level sandy country with much scrub which be traverse till 840 when we enter a wide grassy plain extend to the north-west in which direction we steer till 210 pm when we halt at a small muddy puddle two inch deep and three yard wide then ride on with mr h gregory to search for a larger supply of water and find a shallow pool about a mile distant to which the party move and encamp although this pool be not 100 yard long and six inch deep a large flock of duck snipe and small gull be congregate at it several thousand pigeon of species new to we come to drink these pigeon keep in flock of from ten to more than a thousand feeding on the seed of the grass on the open plain as they never alight on tree they be somewhat larger than the common bronze-wing the head be black with a little white at the base of the beak and behind the eye back pale brown breast blue throat mark with white wing with white tip to the feather and a small patch of bronze tail short tip white foot dull red the evening and night be cloudy wild rice 15th February at 65 be follow a line of small tree and bush which grow on the lower part of the grassy plain and indicate the course of the water in the wet season and at 90 come to the head of a small creek trend north-west water be now abundant and form large pool and at 1115 camp on the right bank of the creek at a pool a quarter of a mile long and fifty yard wide this spot seem to be much frequent by the native and large quantity of mussel-shell lay around they fire the plain traverse this morning be well grass the soil a stiff clay loam this plain extended three to six mile on each side of the track and be bound by a low-wooded country which in some part rise nearly 100 foot above the plain in the lower part of the plain we observe the salt-bush -lrb- atriplex -rrb- and a species of rice but as it be only just in ear we could not judge of the quality of the grain in the afternoon there be a fine breeze from the east which last till 80 pm the sky be cloudy latitude by canopus and pollux 17 degree 53 minute 50 seconds 16th February at 625 be resume we journey down the creek which turn first west and then south-west and at 1220 pm encamp at a small pool on the right

pollux 17 degree 59 minute 40 seconds 17th February -lrb- Sunday -rrb- as the water and grass be abundant on this camp we be not compel to move on in search of these requisite and be enable to observe it as a day of rest 18th February resume we journey at 630 be and steer a average south-west course till 1110 and then south till 1225 pm and again camp on the creek the country consist of wide grassy plain on the bank of the creek without tree and well grass beyond the plain at one to six mile distance low-wooded ridge be visible but the general aspect of the whole be extremely level a great number of duck and a few goose be see on some of the pool in the creek latitude by canopus 18 degree 4 minute 40 seconds sturt 's creek 19th February commence we day 's journey at 60 be follow the bank of the creek till 815 thence south-south-west till noon when the course be alter to south-south-east to close in with the creek but find that the channel be completely lose on the level grassy plain and at 140 pm encamp at a small puddle of muddy water as thick as cream before the creek be lose in the level plain it spread into some large though shallow pool which swarm with duck of several species but principally the whistle duck the grassy plain gradually extend to a greater breadth and the back country be so nearly level that it scarcely rise above the grassy horizon while to the south the country be so level that the clump of bush appear like island and the grassy plain extend to the horizon near one of the waterhole in the creek we surprise a native who be sit at he fire with a couple of woman who decamp with all possible despatch several smoke have be observe to the south and south-west which show that water must exist in that direction though it may not be in sufficient quantity to supply we horse the morning be cloudy and at midnight there be a heavy shower of rain judge from the general appearance of the country the water of the creek after spread over the plain must escape to the westward as the grass have be bent in that direction by the current last year but there have be so little rain this season that the channel of the creek have not be fill 20th February as it appear that the water of the creek trend to the west in the wet season at 65 be we steer north 250 degree east through a level forest of box-tree with abundance of good grass the soil brown loam with fragment of limestone the shower last night have leave many shallow pool of water on the surface at 840 be pass a small swampy salt flat cover with salicornium at 910 come on the grassy plain which we skirt on a west course but as it turn to the north-west again change the course to 320 degree the plain be now reduce to about a mile in width and we therefore cross it in search of a definite channel but without success though there be some slight indication that during inundation the water flow to the north-west at 1150 we camp at a shallow puddle of rainwater on the north side of the plain from the camp till 80 be the grass though very backward show that there have be sufficient rain to cause it to spring but as we proceed it be perfectly dry and parch up as at the end of the dry season show that little or no rain have fall for many month in this part of the country the day be cloudy with thunder and be follow by a heavy shower at night which prevent my ascertain the latitude by observation enter western australium 21st February as we be now three day ' journey from the last water which could be depend on for more than a few day and the channel of the creek have be so completely lose on the plain that it be uncertain whether the mark of inundation near this camp have be cause by the creek flow to the west or by some tributary flow to the east i determine to attempt a south-west course in the hope that should the country prove rocky the heavy shower might have collect a sufficient quantity of water to enable we to continue a southerly route and accordingly select the most prominent point of the rise ground to the south of we position and at 65 be start north 235 degree east after leave the open plain we enter a grassy box forest which continue to the foot of the hill which we reach at 80 the slope of the hill prove very scrubby with small eucalyptus and acacia the soil red sand and ironstone gravel at 90 reach the highest part of the hill for many mile round to the south the country be slightly depress for ten or fifteen mile and then rise into a even ridge or plain the whole country appear to be cover with acacia and eucalyptus scrub to the west and north the view be more extend the low ridge of sandstone hill extend to the west-north-west on the northern side of the grassy flat for thirty mile and only break by a large valley from the north throughout its whole extent this range appear to rise to 150 or 200 foot above the plain and have the appearance of be the edge of a level tableland south of the grassy plain the western limit of which be not see the country rise gradually to eighty or 100 foot and present a extremely level and unvaried appearance it be evident that we only chance of farther progress be to follow the grassy plain to the west till some change in the country render a southerly course practicable it be probable that some creek from the north might join the grassy plain and that the channel which have be lose might be reform at 930 steer north-west and at 1230 pm clear the acacia scrub and at 130 reach the bank of the creek which have form a channel twenty yard wide with pool of water which be brackish but we be too glad to find any water which we could use without detriment to object to it because it be not agreeable in taste and therefore encamp we have thus be a second time compel to make a retrograde movement to the north after reach the same latitude as in the first attempt to penetrate the desert but i do not feel justified in incur the extreme risk which would have attend any other course though follow the creek be by no means free from danger as very few of the waterhole which have supply we on the outward track will retain any water till the time of we return the weather be calm and hot in the early part of the day and in the afternoon it cloud over and there be a slight shower of rain accord to we longitude by account we have this day pass the boundary of western australium which be in the 129th meridian latitude by canopus and procyon 18 degree 26 minute sturt 's creek 22nd February leave the camp at 540 be follow the creek to the west-south-west and cross a small gully from the south at 1130 be camp at a fine pool of water in a small creek from the south close to its junction with the principal creek which we name after captain sturt whose research in australium be too well know to need comment the grassy plain extend from three to ten mile on each side of the creek which have a more definite channel than higher up there be some pool of sufficient size to retain water throughout the year the plain be bound on the north by sandstone hill 100 to 200 foot high and there be also a mass of hilly country to the south the highest point of which be name mount wittenoon about noon a thunder-shower pass to the east and up the creek on which we be encamp and though the channel be then dry between the pool at 40 pm it be run two foot deep the grass be much greener near this camp and there have evidently be more rain here than in any part of the country south of victorium yet visit a fresh southerly breeze in the morning thunderstorm at noon night cloudy with heavy dew 23rd February at 550 be resume we journey down the creek the general course first south-west and change to the south-south-west the channel be gradually lose on the broad swampy flat which be overgrow with polygonum and atriplex etc and have a breadth of half a mile to a mile be depress about ten foot below the grassy plain the grassy plain also extend to about fifteen mile wide the hill decrease in height and the whole country be so level that little be to be see but the distant horizon scarcely in any part rise above the vast expanse of wave grass at 1050 be camp at a shallow puddle of muddy water just sufficient to supply the horse i walk about a mile into the polygonum flat but could not find any water though the ground be soft and muddy in a few spot mr hc gregory when round up the horse in the evening see eight black watch we we therefore go out to communicate with they but they hide themselves in the high bush and grass

to the right bank of the creek there be many shallow muddy channel and one with run water four yard wide and one foot deep the largest channel be near the right bank but except a large shallow pool it be dry as we advance the country show effect of long-continued drought and though the creek contain some large shallow pool the channel be dry between the dry soil absorb the whole of the water which be run in the channel above at 1150 camp at what appear to be the termination of the pool of water as the channel be again lose in a perfectly level flat great number of duck cockatoo crane and crow frequent the bank of the creek above the camp and appear to feed on the wild rice which be grow in considerable quantity in the moist hollow as also a species of panicum to the south-east of the creek there be a level box-flat which extend two to three mile back to the foot of some low sandy ridge cover with triodium and a few small eucalyptus to the north-west and west the grassy plain extend to the horizon with scarcely even a bush to intercept the even surface of the wave grass latitude by canopus and pollux 18 degree 45 minute 45 seconds 25th February the small number of water-fowl which pass up or down the creek during the night indicate that water be not abundant below we present position and we be therefore prepare for a dry country in which we be not disappoint for leave the camp at 615 be we traverse a level box-flat cover with long dry grass at 910 be again enter the usual channel of the creek which be now a wide flat of deeply crack mud with a great quantity of atriplex grow on it but which have lose all the leaf from the long continuance of the dry weather the flat be traverse by numerous small channel from one to two foot deep but they be all perfectly dry and have not contain water for more than a year there be however mark of inundation in previous year when the country must have exhibit a very different appearance and have it be then visit by a explorer the account of a fine river nearly a mile wide flow through splendid plain of high grass could be scarcely reconcile with the fact i have to record of a mud flat deeply fissured by the scorching ray of a tropical sun the absence of water and even scarcity of grass the creek now turn to the south and we follow the shallow channel till 1230 pm when we fortunately come to a small pool which have be fill by a pass thunder-shower and here we encamp during the day a fresh breeze at time blow from the south-east and south and the air be exceedingly warm thermometer 106 degree at noon but be very dry be not very oppressive latitude by canopus castor and pollux 18 degree 55 minute 45 seconds level country 26th February as the course of the creek be uncertain we steer south at 545 be across the atriplex plain and at 635 reach the ordinary right bank of the creek which be low and gravelly cover with triodium and small bush we then pass a patch of white-gum forest and at 8 enter a grassy plain which have be favor by a pass shower green grass be abundant and even some small puddle of water still remain in the hollow of the clay soil at 1050 come on the creek which have collect into a single channel and form pool some of which appear to be permanent as they contain small fish at one of these pool we encamp at 1110 the channel of the creek be about fifteen foot below the level of the plain and be mark by a line of small flooded-gum tree the atriplex flat have cease and the soil be a hard white clay produce salsolum and a little grass the morning clear with a moderate easterly breeze afternoon cloudy with a few drop of rain at night latitude by canopus and pollux 19 degree 7 minute 30 seconds 27th February resume we journey down the creek at 65 be when it turn to the west and form a fine lake-like reach 200 yard wide with rocky bank and sandstone ridge on both side of the creek at 110 camp at the lower end of a fine reach trend south : the general character of these reach of water be that they be very shallow and be separate by wide span of dry channel the water be ten foot below the run level the country be very inferior and the grassy flat be reduce to very narrow limit and the hill be red sandstone produce nothing but small tree and triodium latitude by canopus and pollux 19 degree 12 minute 20 seconds 28th February at 60 be we be again in the saddle follow a creek which have a average west-south-west course but the channel be soon lose in a wide grassy flat with polygonum and atriplex in this flat be some large detach pool of water 50 to 100 yard wide and a quarter to half a mile long although the dry season have reduce they to much narrower limit than usual as they be now eight to ten foot below the level of the plain at 1145 camp at a large sheet of water just above a remarkable ridge of sandstone rock on the right bank of the creek duck pelican spoonbill etc be very numerous but so wild that they could scarcely be approach within range of we gun until the present time it have be doubtful whether the creek turn towards cambridge gulf the interior or to the coast westward of the fitzroy but the first point be now 220 nautic mile to the north and the general course of sturt 's creek south-west such a course be not probable and it therefore only remain to determine whether it be lose in the level plain of the interior or find a outlet on the north-west coast the careful and minute survey of the coast from the victorium river to roebuck bay show that no river exist of such magnitude as the sturt would attain in pass through the range to the coast nor do the general abrupt character of the coast-line favor the supposition that any interior water would find a outlet in this space that the elevation of this part of the creek be sufficient to enable it to form a channel to the north-west coast be show by the barometric measurement : the divide ridge between the head of the victorium and hooker 's creek be about 1200 foot at the head of sturt 's creek 1370 foot and we present camp 1100 foot thus the average fall of sturt 's creek have be 270 foot in 180 mile or one and a half foot per mile now the distance to desault bay -lrb- which appear the most probable outlet -rrb- be 370 mile and allow a increase of 500 for deviation there would be more than two foot descent per mile which would be sufficient for the maintenance of a channel should the creek turn to the south and enter the sandy desert country the water would soon be absorb especially as the wet season at the upper part of the creek occur when the dry season be prevail in the lower part of its course that it do lose itself in a barren sandy country be i fear the most probable termination of the creek and that a level country exist for many mile on each side of we route be show by the small number and size of the tributary watercourse latitude by canopus castor and pollux 19 degree 18 minute 10 seconds 29th February leave the camp at 540 be trace the creek to the south-west for about three mile it form fine reach of water fifty to 100 yard wide but the channel terminate suddenly in a level flat cover with polygonum atriplex and grass in this flat we pass some large shallow pool of water at 730 the creek turn to the west round the north end of a rocky sandstone hill and be join by a tributary gully from the north below which point the channel be a well-defined sandy bed with long parallel waterhole on each side but very little water remain at this time at 915 the course of the creek change to south by west and pass through a level flat timbered with flooded-gum tree it be about one mile wide and well grassed but completely dry up for want of rain the back country be thinly wood with white-gum and gently rise as it recede form sandstone hill about 100 foot high of extremely barren appearance at 1145 camp at a small muddy pool which would last only for a few day a strong breeze from the west commence early in the day and

stray farther than usual in search of better grass we be delay till 620 be when we steer a south by west course down the valley of the creek immediately below the camp the country beyond the effect of inundation change to a nearly level plain of red sand produce nothing but triodium and stunt bush the level of this desert country be only break by low ridge of drift sand they be parallel and perfectly straight with a direction nearly east and west at 1150 camp at a fine pool of water three to five foot deep and twenty yard wide that we have actually enter the desert be apparent and the increase of temperature during the past three day be easily explain but whether this desert be part of that visit by captain sturt or a isolate patch have yet to be ascertain and the only hope be that the creek will enable we to continue we course as the nature of the country render a advance quite impracticable unless by follow watercourse latitude by canopus castor and pollux 19 degree 40 minute

low sandstone hill to the south-east the highest of which i name mount mueller as the doctor have see they the previous evening while collect plant on one of the sandy ridge near the camp at 1015 again make the creek which have scarcely any channel to mark its course the wide clay flat bearing mark of former inundation be the only indication visible at 1235 pm camp at a small muddy pool the grass very scanty and dry trace of native be frequent large flight of pigeon feed on the plain on the seed of grass a flock of cockatoo be also see latitude by canopus and pollux 19 degree 51 seconds 12 minute 3rd march at 530 be start and follow the creek on a general course south-west there be a very irregular channel sometimes ten yard wide and very shallow and then expand into pool fifty yard wide the sandy plain encroach much on the grassy flat and reduce the winter course of the creek to half a mile in breadth at 80 the course be change to south and at 1015 camp at a swamp which be nearly dry and cover with beautiful grass the country differ in character from that see yesterday there be a few scattered white-gum tree and patch of tall acacia salsolum and salicornium be also very abundant and show the saline nature of the soil latitude by canopus and pollux 20 degree 2 minute 10 seconds salt lake 4th march leave the camp at 550 be and steer south-west over a very level country with shallow hollow fill with a dense growth of acacia and at 730 strike the creek with a sandy channel and narrow flat cover with salsolum and salicornium the pool be very shallow and gradually become salt and at 1015 it spread into the dry bed of a salt lake more than a mile in diameter this be connect by a broad channel with a pool of salt-water in it with a second dry salt lake eight mile in diameter as there be little prospect of water ahead and the day far advance we return to one of the brackish pool and encamp the country pass be of a worthless character and so much impregnate with salt that the surface of the ground be often cover with a thin crust of salt latitude by e argus 20 degree 10 minute 40 seconds 5th march start from the camp at 545 be and steer south-south-east through the acacia wood to the lake and then south by east across the dry bed of the lake towards a break in the tree on the southern side here we find a creek join the lake from the south-west in which there be some shallow pool we then steer east to intersect any channel by which the water of the lake might flow to the south or south-east and pass through a wood of acacia enter the sandy desert as some low rocky hill be visible to the east we steer for they at 210 halt half a mile from the hill and then ascend they on foot they be very barren and rocky scarcely eighty foot above the plain form of sandstone the stratum horizontal from the summit of the hill nothing be visible but one unbounded waste of sandy ridge and low rocky hillock which lay to the south-east of the hill all be one impenetrable desert as the flat and sandy surface which could absorb the water of the creek be not likely to originate watercourse descend the hill which i name mount wilson after the geologist attach to the expedition we return towards the creek at the south end of the lake reach it at 930 6th march as the day be extremely hot and the horse require rest and food we remain at the camp duck be numerous in some of the pool but so wild that only two be shoot the early part of the day be clear with a hot strong breeze vary from west to south-east at 1 pm there be a heavy thunder-squall from the south-east which sweep a cloud of salt and sand from the dry surface of the lake the squall be follow by a slight shower latitude by canopus 20 degree 16 minute 22 seconds dry bed of salt lake 7th march as i have frequently observe that in the dry channel of creek traverse very level country a heavy shower in the lower part of its course often cause a strong current of water to rush up the stream-bed and leave flood mark which would mislead a person examine they in the dry season it seem probable that this must be the case with the creek enter the salt lake at its south-west angle as it might be the outlet of the lake when fill by sturt 's creek flow into it though in ordinary season the flow of water would be into the lake accordingly i decide on follow the creek and ascertain its actual course leave the camp at 550 be steer nearly south-west along the general course of the creek till 730 when it turn to the north and enter the dry bed of a lake as the bed of the two lake be lower than the channel between they the water during the last heavy rain have flood both way from the central part of the channel have skirt the lake on the west to intercept any watercourse which might enter or leave the lake on that side we come to a large shallow channel with pool of water -- some fresh and other salt -- with broad margin of salicornium grow on the bank at 110 camp at a small pool of fresh water the soil of the country on the bank of the creek be loose white sand with concretion of lime cover with a dense growth of tall acacia with salsolum and a little grass in the open space termination of sturt 's creek 8th march start at 65 be and trace the creek into a salt lake to the west but this be also dry after some search we find a creek join on the northern side and communicate with a large mud plain partly overgrown with salicornium and with large shallow pool of muddy water two to three inch deep on the northern side the plain narrow into a sandy creek with shallow pool the flow of the water be decidedly from the northward at 1215 pm camp at a shallow pool near which there be a little grass the country generally be sandy and only produce triodium and acacia thus after have follow sturt 's creek for nearly 300 mile we have be disappoint in we hope that it would lead to some important outlet to the water of the australian interior it have however enable we to penetrate far into the level tract of country which may be term the great australian desert latitude by pollux and e argus 20 degree 4 minute 5 seconds 9th march leave we camp at 635 be and follow the creek up for half a hour and then steer east to sturt 's creek which we reach at 95 the country be level sandy and cover with triodium and acacia in small patch we then steer a southerly course down the creek till 110 and camp at the large brackish pool commence return to depot hot wind 10th march we have observe that a creek appear to join the salt lake to the north-east angle there yet remain a possibility that the water of the lake might find a outlet to the east and pass north of mount wilson we therefore steer east from the camp at 645 be and pass close to the south of a small salt lake -lrb- dry -rrb- three-quarter of a mile in diameter and then traverse a level sandy country thickly wood with acacia and a few white-gum tree at 815 strike a small grassy watercourse with broad shallow pool this we follow down to the south-south-west to the large salt lake close to which it be join by a small sandy creek come from the east have reach the bank of the lake at 100 steer south along its shore till 1115 when its shore trend to the west-south-west and there be a small well-defined bank without any break to the point which have be the limit of we examination from the southern part of the lake and thus determine that there be no outlet for the water to the eastward as the whole country to the south be one vast sandy desert destitute of any indication of the existence of water it be clear that no useful result could arise from any attempt to penetrate this inhospitable region especially as the loss of any of the horse might deprive the expedition of the means for carry out the exploration towards the gulf of carpentarium i therefore determine on commence we retreat to the victorium river while it be practicable as the rapid evaporation and increase saltness of the water in this arid and inhospitable region warn we that each day we delay increase the difficulty of the return and it be possible that we be cut off from any communication with the party at the depot by a impassable tract of dry country and might be compel to maintain ourselves on the lower part of the creek till the ensue rainy season return to the creek at the north-east angle of the lake and encamp the morning be cloudy with a strong hot wind from the east and south-east the night calm and misty 11th march at 610 be leave the camp and follow the creek to the north-north-east but it soon spread into a number of small gully which drain a patch of clay land at 70 steer north through a wood of acacia grow on loose sandy soil enter the open sandy plain at 815 a few small white-gum tree be scatter over this part of the plain which be quite level the loose sand be cover with triodium which partially conceal the glaring red color of the ground observe a low abrupt hill a little to the east of we course deviate towards it and ascend it at 100 it be less than 100 foot above the plain and compose of the same sandstone which prevail over the whole of the country south of the victorium the view be cheerless in the extreme from north 26 degree east to north 166 degree east the country be a level plain with small isolate or group hill of red sandstone but not form any definite range the even height and peculiar table summit appear to indicate that they be only small remain portion of a sandstone tableland or plain nearly the whole of which have be remove the stratum however have a dip to the east of one or two degree the vegetation on this part of the country be reduce to a few stunt gum-tree hakea bush and triodium the whole extremely barren in appearance the remain portion of the horizon be one even straight line not a hill or break of any kind be visible and except the narrow line of the creek be barren and worthless in the extreme the red soil of the level portion of the surface be partially clothe with triodium and a few small tree or rather bush render the long straight ridge of fiery-red drift sand more conspicuous the wind be strong we observe the smoke of several fire along the course of sturt 's creek and also one near mount mueller to the north-east indicate the existence of native in that direction and doubtless of water in that locality as it be a day 's journey from the creek we course be now north 340 degree east and on approach the creek pass through a patch of casuarina forest which be remarkable as they be the only tree of this genus we have see on the coast since landing at the victorium though abundant in all other part of australium at 135 pm reach sturt 's creek and halt at we camp of the 2nd march there be a strong hot wind from the east during the day 12th march resume we route at 550 be and steer north 20 degree east till 80 then 40 degree and 60 degree till 10 pm when we encamp at a shallow pool of water near the creek and about three mile above camp 48 as the route only traverse the level flat near the creek nothing worthy of further notice be see the channel be split into small hollow some of which retain a little water the grass be much dry up and limit to the flat near the creek the more remote portion be cover with triodium the day be hot and nearly calm but at noon we be benefit by a few pass cloud and at 60 pm a dry thunderstorm cool the air from 100 degree to 93 degree but the temperature rise at 80 to 96 degree 13th march at 550 steer north 10 degree east cross the creek several time and at 100 turn to the north-north-east and north-east cross the sandstone hill round which the creek turn at a right angle and at 1210 pm camp on the creek near we track of the 29th February nearly all the pool of water have dry up and the water at the camp have become brackish some of the pool however must be permanent as there be small fish in they a great party of native appear to be travel up the creek as fresh fire be constantly see to the north-east along its course a cool breeze from the west to north-east moderate the heat the temperature at 2 pm 103 degree pass cloud from the east in the afternoon follow up sturt 's creek 14th march resume we route and follow the creek upward from 550 be till 150 pm when we camp about three mile south-west of camp 45 at the first pool before the atriplex flat a short distance above the camp we cross a large sandy creek which prove to be the cause of the change in the character of sturt 's creek below that point as we route be at a greater distance from the creek than in trace it down it give a better opportunity of ascertain the nature of the country beyond the influence of inundation to the north-west a vast plain traverse by low ridge of gravel and drift sand clothe with a scanty growth of triodium and a few hakea bush rise gradually from the creek but on the south-east a more abrupt sandstone slope terminate in a similar plain of somewhat greater elevation and show that we be still within the bound of the desert moderate breeze from the north-west change to north-east pass cloud a slight shower at 110 pm 15th march resume we route at 550 be steer north 40 degree east one hour into the triodium plain then north 60 degree east till 920 be when we reach the first large pool in the creek and round the bend camp at one of the narrow pool above the sandstone ridge the water in the larger pool have sink from six inch to a foot since we have pass downward and almost all the pool be now dry the morning clear and cool with cloud and light shower in the afternoon accompany by thunder 16th march as there be no water in the creek for the next thirty-three mile we fill the water-bag and prepare for a early start but unfortunately the horse have stray farther than usual which delay we till 70 be when follow nearly the outward route pass close to camp 43 the waterhole at which be dry and at 10 pm halt under the shade of a few acacia-tree during the heat of the day and resume we journey at 30 pm follow the south-east side of the plain through which the creek flow the ground be stony and bad travel but as the moon be clear and bright we succeed in reach the first pool of water at 830 pm this be one mile above camp 42 the water at which have dry up though four foot deep on the 24th February the pool at which we now camp appear to be permanent it be 100 yard wide and 300 long the water three foot deep close to the bank duck be numerous and i shoot four in the morning a easterly breeze continue through the day and as usual there be a few cloud towards sunset unfortunately the dry weather have warped the scale of the thermometer to such a extent that it break the tube denison plain water dry up 17th march we be again delay by trifling circumstance and do not leave the camp until 740 be but have nearly clear the desert the weather be comparatively cool steer a average course north-east traverse the wide grassy plain on the right bank of sturt 's creek to which the name of denison 's plain be give at 20 pm camp at a small pool in the polygonum flat which be all that remain of the water which have cover the flat to the extent of three-quarter of a mile in breadth and be run when we pass down last month we course this day show the great extent of the grassy plain to the north-west as we do not see the limit at any point in that direction cool breeze from east with thin cloud all day 18th march leave the camp at daylight and proceed to camp 40 on the outward route and halted for the remainder of the day to rest the horse as a heavy stage lay before we across the dry country large flock of cockatoo come to the pool at this camp and we shoot thirty-three which be a very welcome addition to we provision strong easterly wind pass cloud 19th march steer north 60 degree east at 635 be and follow up the course of the creek cross the right bank at 90 when there be nothing but the polygonum flat to mark its course at 1030 alter the course to nearly east pass a large sheet of brackish water which appear deep and permanent at the lower end but shallow at the upper part at 1120 encamp at a small pool of fresh water in a back channel the creek be brackish and we be anxious to procure a supply of good water before proceed further as the next three stage of the outward track be now destitute of water strong easterly breeze light cloud 20th march at 555 be steer 110 degree at 620 strike a small creek with steep bank alter the course to 90 degree cross two small watercourse from the north with a little water in the deeper portion of they bed the general character of the country box flat and open grassy plain near the creek at 725 enter a large grassy plain extend north and east for ten mile and at 915 halted at a small watercourse which retain a little water in a grassy hollow we object in halt thus early be to enable we to start fresh in the afternoon and should the country continue open to push on through the night by which the water could be reach before the heat of the sun be too great for travel at 35 resume we march and traverse level grassy plain extend one to five mile on each side of we route at 70 observe a native fire about two mile to the north from which we conclude that water exist at no great distance and at 715 be fortunate in find a pool of rainwater in a slight depression of the plain and encamp we could not find sufficient wood near the camp to boil we tea but be satisfy with the discovery of a sufficient supply of water 21st march we be again in the saddle at 515 be and continue we course north 73 degree east reach the limit of the open plain which turn to the south-east and extend to the horizon at 640 enter the wooded country which bound the plain and the soil change from a rich clay-loam to sandy and gravelly soil with fragment of sandstone the vegetation consist of small white-gum tree shrubby acacia and triodium with a few patch of grass the country gradually rise till 925 when we come to a abrupt descent into the valley of sturt 's creek but the country do not improve in character till 1020 when we come to the grassy flat at 1050 camp at a large open pool of water in the bed of the creek on the pool there be large flight of whistle duck but so wild that they could not be approach within range of we gun moderate breeze from east with light cloud from south-east during the day the weather have for the past ten day be so misty that i have not be able to get a good set of lunar distance and it be useless to observe unless under circumstance favourable for accuracy 22nd march 535 be find we again travel up the creek on a northerly course at 720 change the course north-east by north and at 1130 camp about a mile below camp 35 the hill at the bend of the creek prove to be basaltic with a stratum of ironstone conglomerate rest on it the pool of water in the bed of the creek be much reduce and all the smaller one dry up 23rd march -lrb- Sunday -rrb- the feed and water not be in sufficient quantity to permit of we rest at this camp we follow up the creek nearly on the outward course a few mile above the creek a party of black come out of the creek and commence a distant parley but on one of the party approach they they pick up they spear they have secrete in the grass and run away into the bed of the creek after six and a half hour ' journey camp at the lower end of the pool where we have halt on the 15th February near the northern bend of the creek we pass a fine deep pool which appear to retain water through the dry season all the smaller pool have dry up and the larger one have sink two foot since we be here in February 24th march as the horse have not have a day 's rest for some time past we remain at the camp to refresh they before attempt to cross the dry country which divide the southern water from those flow to the north-west coast as the nearest water which we know to exist be now fifty mile to the east and the country in that direction very bad travel we be now however eighty mile in a direct line from the depot camp and as that course would take we over new and unexplored country i determine to attempt a direct route 1700 foot above sea level 25th march at 620 be steer north 40 degree east and leave sturt 's creek traverse open grassy plain till 95 when we enter a wooded country with white-gum tree and underwood acacia triodium and patch of grass the soil a poor sandy red loam at 110 pass to the south of a extensive grassy plain trend to the north-west at 1230 pm halt to ease the horse ' back from they load and resume we route at 140 and at 20 cross a ridge of stony country which the aneroid show to be about 1700 foot above the sea level and be the highest spot yet visit by the expedition at 220 alter the course to east and follow a slight depression till 40 when we come to a dry watercourse trend north-west this be trace down in search of water till 630 when we halt for the night without find any water the day be very calm and hot the horse be very much distressed for want of water but as there be a little green grass on the bank of the creek they be able to feed for a few hour during the night latitude by leoni 17 degree 35 minute 6 seconds 26th march proceed down the creek and at 720 be come to a small pool of water which the horse consume in the space of a few minute but farther on come to a more abundant supply and some of the pool appear to be permanent have a belt of water-pandanus and reed round they below this the channel be perfectly dry and sandy but be much enlarged by numerous tributary gully at 1250 pm come to a shallow pool at which we camp the country through which this creek pass be poor and stony low hill of sandstone schist and limestone rise immediately behind the narrow strip of grassy land which be fertilise by the overflow of the creek in the rainy season the vegetable production of the country seem to be limit to a few small gum-tree shrubby acacia and triodium with a occasional patch of grass at the camp the bed of the creek be about forty yard wide with bank fifteen foot high the general course appear to be north-west a direction which render it probable that it flow into cambridge gulf latitude by pollux 17 degree 25 minute 31 seconds sixty mile without water 27th march at 60 be leave the camp and steer a course north 60 degree east gradually ascend among hill of schist and sandstone till 820 when we reach the level tableland the principal tree be white-gum and silver-leafed ironbark the soil a red loam of vary character well grass but with patch of triodium which affect a poor gravelly soil or deep sand the country be now so nearly level that scarcely any rise or fall be discoverable though the aneroid show some slight undulation at 115 pm halted for a hour and at 60 camp in a patch of green grass which enable the horse to feed though they have no water the weather be clear and hot during the day with a light easterly breeze the night cloudy and very warm depot camp 28th march at 510 be resume we course north 60 degree east through a grassy forest of ironbark and bloodwood with patch of small acacia and triodium at 745 enter a series of open plain cover with high grass the plain continue till 100 when we pass through a open gum forest and the country decline to the east and at 1115 come on a small watercourse which be dry and sandy this we follow down to the north-east till 1140 when it pass through a rocky gorge in a sandstone ridge which rise at a angle of 30 degree to the south-west and 40 degree to the north-east the latter be the dip of the stratum in this rocky gorge we could see some pool of water but they be quite inaccessible from that side of the ridge and we have to make a considerable detour to the south before we could descend to the plain below and find a fine pool of water at the termination of the gorge at which we halt and water we thirsty horse as we be now only two hour ' ride from the depot camp we after a short rest start again at 310 pm and at 515 reach the depot camp where we be welcome by mr baine and he party and i be glad to find they all enjoy good health and that the horse be in excellent condition they have be however somewhat annoy by the black who have make frequent attempt to burn the camp and also the horse by set fire to the grass and on some occasion have come to actual hostility though by judicious management none of the party have be injure nor be it certain that any of the black have be wound though it have be necessary to resort to the use of firearm in self-defence and for the protection of the horse 29th march return we surplus provision into store when we find that the piece of pork originally four pound weight each be reduce to one-fifth of the original weight as the long continuance of heat have melt the whole of the fat we ration have therefore be one pound flour one-fifth pound salt pork and two ounce sugar per diem mr h gregory and bowman ride out to round in the horse latitude by regulus and e argus 17

that he have be compel to make a entry regard mr flood who have refuse to attend to he order to carry arm while on watch at night on the 18th march i therefore call on mr flood for any statement he have to make in extenuation of he conduct he reply be however extremely unsatisfactory and only attempt to excuse the act on account of some private misunderstanding with mr baine some month previous and that the order to wear he pistol be give before he have time to put on he clothes there have however be a distinct refusal to obey the order of the officer in charge of the party and those order be neither vexatious or unreasonable as they be simply in enforcement of well-established regulation i therefore caution mr flood that unless he future conduct be more satisfactory than it have hitherto be i should remove he name from the list of officer take command in the expedition accord to the general order of the 27th August 1855 the weather continue cloudy and calm and though the temperature be not extreme it be very oppressive 31st march examine and pack store in readiness for the exploration of the valley of the victorium to the east of the depot find the store in good condition though the bag have be much injure by the rat and white ant although in some respects it would be more convenient to move the party at once to the bank of the victorium before examine the country beyond yet as the horse be now accustom to the run near the depot and the hut and stockyard render the station a more safe and convenient spot than any we could elsewhere select i therefore decide on leave the party here until i have explore the country to the east and then move the whole party down the right bank of the river by which the number and magnitude of the tributary from the east would be ascertain as this be a important point with reference to the contemplated journey to the gulf of carpentarium 1st April prepare equipment for a light party to explore the country to the east of the camp shod six horse and packed eighteen day ' provision for four person the weather continue cloudy with light variable wind explore east of the depot 2nd April at 645 be start from the depot with messr h gregory baine and john fahey take four ride and two pack horse carry eighteen day ' ration etc steer east over a undulating grassy country of basaltic formation with occasional sandstone ridge the soil be generally good but very stony i have already traverse this country and as the day be very misty with much rain nothing worthy of further record be observe at 130 pm alter the course to east-south-east and at 315 camp on a large creek trend north-east in the bed of which be large pool of a permanent character the hill be basaltic but the creek have cut through the rock and excavate the sandstone the valley be not of such a fertile character as the plain and ridge timber be wholly absent and only a few small tree be see at interval on the hill the morning be cloudy with light rain but it clear towards sunset latitude by e argus 17 degree 4 minute 6 seconds 3rd April resume we route at 630 and steer east-south-east to a basaltic hill which we reach at 740 from the summit a great extent of country be visible but there be no marked feature as the broken range and isolate hill be nearly similar to each other the whole country appear to be a nearly level basaltic plain with mass of sandstone rise 100 to 200 foot above its surface while the valley of the creek be excavate to the depth of 100 foot the country be well grassed but very stony but this though very inconvenient to the traveller do not render it less valuable for pasture as stony land always stand feed better than any other at 820 alter the course to nearly east towards a low ridge of hill the plain be well grassed till 1250 pm when the sandstone prevail on the surface and triodium prevail in the valley at 150 follow down a rocky ravine and at 215 encamp the victorium river 4th April at 65 be leave the camp and follow the gully to the east-south-east at 70 cross a sandstone ridge and beyond it a large creek from the south-west in the bed of which there be some fine pool of

fog this morning and when we leave the camp at 550 be we could not see 100 yard and we traverse the basaltic plain in a east course till 70 when the fog clear away and we find ourselves at the foot of some low rocky hill of basalt over which we travel north 70 degree east these hill be very rough and stony but cover with excellent grass we then enter a basaltic plain richly grassed and less stony than usual at 930 cross a basaltic ridge and enter a large valley trend to the north and east at 1010 ascend a rocky hill about 150 foot high and get bearing of the range etc the country appear to consist of grassy hill and plain extend twenty to thirty mile to the north and east to the south a range of basalt and sandstone hill intercept the view steer east from the hill and traverse a

April as the creek appear to come from the south and not to have a long course but to rise in the low sandstone range which be visible in that direction it be useless to follow it farther we therefore steer northwards to intercept any stream which might join the victorium river lower down its course and after travel over open grassy ridge of basalt for six hour at 1225 pm camp at a small gully in which there be some small pool which appear to be supply by spring the country for five to ten mile to the east of we track appear open and grassy basalt be the prevail rock run water fine pastoral

which have be lay on the shingle bank near the dome to complete repair i be glad to learn that all the man belong to the expedition be in good health except richard whose hand be still in a very unsatisfactory state though better than when we leave in January the crew of the schooner have not be so fortunate as the carpenter john finlay have die and three of the man be so ill that they have be leave at the camp to be under the immediate care of the medical officer this great amount of sickness be owe to the combined effect of previous disease and the inferior quality of the provision with which the vessel be supply it appear that through damage by salt water and want of good management the provision which should have be sufficient for two year be now reduce to salt beef of inferior quality and tea the expedition have have to furnish flour rice sugar pea and pork as also medical store for the sick man in consequence of the reduce number of the crew of the tom tough mr wilson have find it necessary to furnish man to assist in work the schooner as well as to effect repair 10th may much of the grass near the camp have be burnt i send the horse to the creek three mile

position below curiosity peak all the leak have be secure and she now only make about half a inch of water per hour the crew of the vessel have be so much reduce by sickness that it will be necessary to send man on board to assist in refit the vessel and procure a supply of wood and water as it be necessary to replace the store destroy or damage by salt-water it appear desirable that the tom tough should proceed to the gulf of carpentarium via coupang in the island of timor where a supply of rice and sugar can be procure for the expedition and the vessel will be enable to complete she store it appear desirable that the land party should refit with all possible despatch for the journey to the gulf of carpentarium in order to take advantage of the cool season and there be reason to expect that the horse will be sufficiently recruit in strength towards the end of June i be therefore in hope that the party will be able to leave the victorium before the expiration of the ensue month a small party of native come to the camp in the morning and barter a few trifle and then retire 15th may continue preparation of map party employ in preparation for the journey to the gulf of

high grass the back country level stringybark forest with good grass at 225 pm the channel of the creek again collect and we find a small waterhole twenty yard long and four foot deep at which we camp here we observe the fire of a party of black who have camp at the waterhole the previous day small heap of mussel-shell lay at interval along the bank of the creek though the channel be perfectly dry but it appear that during the last wet season less rain have fall than usual and the soil have not be fully saturate and consequently the waterhole have dry up sooner than in average year although from the level character and geological feature of the country we be now on the tableland which divide the water flow to the north-west coast from those which fall into the gulf of carpentarium the elevation of the country do not exceed 800 foot above the sea latitude by centaurus and arcturus 15 degree 18 minute 33 seconds 3rd July start at 730 be follow the creek to the north-east by east till

be frequent and render the surface of the country very rough and frequent depression of the surface appear to result from the falling-in of the roof of cavern beneath which be farther indicate by deep cleft and hole in the rock into which the surface water flow during the rain at 110 be turn north and at noon again strike the creek which gradually turn to the north-north-east limestone form the bank and only one small pool be see till 450 pm when we find a little water in the sandy bed of a tributary creek from the south-south-east at which we encamp on the bank of the creek we this day first observe the casuarina which be so frequent on the bank of the creek trend towards the gulf of carpentarium latitude by arcturus and a coronae boreali 14 degree 54 minute 2 seconds 5th July as the course of the creek be to the north-west and we have already be drive further north than be desirable we leave the creek and follow up the tributary to the east-south-east leave the camp at 75 be the channel be soon lose on the wide grassy flat in one of which be a fine waterhole cover with nympha near which a party of black be encamp on we approach most of the woman decamp with they bag and net contain they valuable while the man stand spear in hand gaze on the strange sight as we pass they continue up the creek the course of which be only marked for some distance by the nature of the vegetation which indicate occasional inundation it again form a shallow irregular channel in the center of a open box flat and at 130 pm camp at a small waterhole in the channel latitude by meridian altitude of the sun 14 degree 55 minute 15 seconds tableland 6th July the small size of the creek afford little prospect of water nearer to its source and as mr h gregory be suffer from a severe

ridge cover with acacia scrub and again descend into the valley of the creek pass some fine grassy plain and at 110 ascend the level tableland the edge of which be cover with acacia scrub beyond which we pass a level flat acacia scrub and small tree and at noon enter a stringybark forest with occasional patch of bloodwood leguminous ironbark and sterculia the soil vary from a brown loam to ironstone gravel and in a few spot ferruginous conglomerate be visible on the loamy soil the grass be good and abundant but the gravel be cover with spiny treraphi this tableland be so level that no declivity could be detect during the continuance of we day 's journey which last till 530 when we bivouac without water by take the precaution of let the horse feed on the outward track and secrete ourselves after dark in the high grass we pass the night without the necessity of keep watch after midnight 7th July we horse have stray back on the track we carry we saddle and track they about two mile and then mount we horse steer north for some mile but all be level forest without any sign of the existence of water except a few cockatoo i then turn to the south-west cross the outward track and at length come on a shallow watercourse trend west a ridge of rock have confine the channel to a narrow space three small waterhole be discover in which a little water remain below this the creek turn south-south-east and i again turn towards the camp but night overtake we in the stringybark forest we pass to the south of the camp without observe its position 8th July have ascertain that we have pass the position of the camp turn to the north-east and reach the camp at 1120 mr h gregory be somewhat recover but very weak from a violent attack of fever during my absence a small party of black have visit the camp and have bivouac a short distance up the creek 9th July move the camp to the waterhole twelve mile south-east and in the afternoon ride down the creek with mr elsey the creek turn to the south-south-east for a mile and a half and be lose on a level flat from which a channel trend to the west which be again lose in a level flat extend to the west several mile heavy shower

which i examine be thirty yard in diameter and fifteen foot deep in the center be a deep cleft of fifteen foot more which extend to the east and west under the surface with a width of three foot at 30 strike a small creek trend east-north-east with a few small pool of water in the channel in follow down the creek in search of a sufficient supply of water for the horse we pass some black sit at a fire near the creek at 330 come to a pool sufficient for the supply of the whole party below which the channel be dry return to the pool we meet the black follow we track but observe we they run away and on be follow hide themselves have unsaddled we commence we dinner and soon see the black watch we from they hiding place and after some time spend in make sign they be induce to approach the oldest of the party feign to weep bitterly till they get close to we when we commence a attempt at conversation and they appear to recognize some few word of the language of the victorium river they spear be form of reed with large head of white sandstone and also with three wooden point for fishing they be circumcise and have they front tooth remain at 50 steer to the west-north-west for one

a2 centaurus 15 degree 2 minute 49 seconds absence of watercourse 12th July the grass near the camp have be burn off the horse have scatter very much and could not be collect and saddle before 100 be when we follow we track of yesterday and reach the pool of water at sunset the country be so level although we be cross the watershed between the north-west coast and the gulf of carpentarium that the aneroid only vary from 2955 to 2962 and even of this change the greater part be cause by alteration of the temperature the geological character of this portion of the country differ slightly from that of the victorium river the upper stratum be a bed of ironstone conglomerate about twenty foot thick this rest on sandstone the upper part of which be highly ferruginous then pass away into a variegated sandstone imperfectly stratify change into a hard siliceous sandstone which be white and break with a conchoidal fracture this rest on a hard cherty sandstone similar to that of the victorium river in this rock many depression occur which be apparently cause by the roof of cavern fall in and there be usually deep fissure in the rock at the bottom of these hollow in which all the water that drain into they be absorb in some place the sandstone rest on the limestone have sink many foot below the general level with area vary from one to ten acre sometimes slope towards a center ten to thirty foot below the plain and in other spot with abrupt rocky bank five to eight foot high and a perfectly level bottom the level character of the country be unfavourable for investigation of this nature and the thickness of the several stratum not easily determine but i think that the collective thickness of the several stratum above the limestone do not exceed 100 foot the porous nature of the lower rock preclude the existence of permanent surface water by drain the whole of the upper part of the tableland while it form strong spring in the lower ground towards the bank of the roper river where the limestone be expose on the surface latitude by a coronae boreali 15 degree 14 minute 31 seconds white man 's camp 13th July -lrb- Sunday -rrb- leave the camp at 830 be proceed down the creek mistake a tributary for the main creek follow it south for two hour when it spread into small gully and we have to return to the creek which have now a northerly course and at 425 camp about three mile from we start point in the morning the country pass over be of a very poor character stiff clay flat with melaleuca scrub in the valley while low but steep ridge of sandstone rise to the east and be timber with stringybark and bloodwood etc to the south the country seem to rise slightly but be very poor and sandy the smoke of bush fire be visible to the south east and north and several tree cut with iron axis be notice near the camp there be also the remains of a hut and the ash of a large fire indicate that there have be a party encamp there for several week several tree from six to eight inch diameter have be cut down with iron axis in fair condition and the hut build by cut notch in stand tree and rest a large pole therein for a ridge this hut have be burnt apparently by the subsequent bush fire and only some piece of the thickest timber remain unconsumed search be make for marked tree but none find nor be there any fragment of iron leather or other material of the equipment of a explore party or of any bone of animal other than those common to australia have a explore party be destroy here there would most likely have be some indication and it may therefore be infer that the party have proceed on its journey it could not have be a camp of leichhardt 's in 1845 as it be 100 mile south-west of he route to port essington and it be only six or seven year old judge by the growth of the tree have subsequently see some of leichhardt 's camp on the burdekin mackenzie and barcoo river a great similarity be observe in regard to the mode of build the hut and its relative position in regard to the fire and water supply and the position in regard to the great feature of the country be exactly where a party go westward would first receive a check from the waterless tableland between the roper and victorium river and would probably camp and reconnoitre ahead before attempt to cross to the north-west coast this creek be name elsey creek on the map elsey creek 14th July resume we journey at 810 be steer north-east down the valley of the creek which i name elsey creek after the surgeon of the expedition its course be generally to the north-east but spread into lagoon and swampy flat become very tortuous and irregular it then change to a very wind reach of water fifty to sixty yard wide with low bank cover with reed and tall melaleuca-tree beyond which be a belt of pandanus grow on the drier ground many small spring rise in the limestone rock and run into the creek on the bank of which large quantity of mussel-shell show the frequent camp of the black the bank of the creek and spring be so soft and boggy that we horse could not approach the water and we follow its bank in search of a spot where they could drink in safety till 40 without success and have camp have to water the horse with we leather bucket latitude by a2 centaurus and a coronae boreali 15 degree 5 minute 35 seconds roper river 15th July leave we

camp at the junction of elsey creek and the river which appear to be the roper of dr leichhardt the fan-palm be frequently see on the bank of elsey creek where it obtain a height of fifty to eighty foot and have a thicker stem and produce a more palatable vegetable than the species grow on the bank of the victorium river kill a emu 16th July at 75 be recommence we journey follow down the roper river east and north-east about a mile below the camp the limestone rock form a bar over which the river run with a rapid current ten yard wide and two foot deep the bank become lower and the surface of the country extremely level the overflow of the river have form shallow lagoon in which the nelumbium or gigantic water-lily be first see a ridge of low sandstone hill come close to the left bank and on the right a vast level plain cover with high grass and reed extend two or three mile back this plain be evidently inundate during the wet season though the soil be now dry and full of deep crack the river divide into several small shallow channel full of reed and each with a small stream of water the deep green of the vegetation along the course of the run water contrasting strongly with the parched vegetation of the other portion of the plain clump of melaleuca occur at interval and at a distance appear like low hill at 20 pm camp at the end of a low basaltic ridge which approach the bank of the river from the south a range of flat-topped hill extend to the north-east from the river about eight mile distant to the north-west of the camp they appear wooded and 200 to

east about eight mile reach a creek trend north-east its channel be dry and sandy but after some search find a small pool of water in a side channel casuarina and flooded-gum tree grow on the bank of the creek and there be some good grass on the flat which be limit by sandstone hill densely wood with acacia of the same species as that see on the lower part of sturt 's creek after a hour 's halt at the pool of water we return to camp silent native 19th July the horse have scatter much during the night it be 8 be before they be collect and saddle we then follow we track of yesterday to the pool in the creek eight mile south-east reach it at 1145 the sandstone here show a decide dip to the west at angle vary from 5 degree to 30 degree and the trap-rock only extend five mile from the previous camp in the afternoon five native be observe watch the camp and finding they be observe by we come up to the party but could not be induce to speak a single word they soon after retire they have no spear and be follow by a small dog they tooth be entire but they be all circumcise at 80 pm the black be detect steal into the camp and though we call upon they to retire only hide themselves in the grass but as it be absolutely necessary for we own safety to dislodge they from they position i cause a gun to be fire in the air hope that they would retire but they commence to ship they spear and i therefore order a charge of shot to be fire at they which have the desire effect of compelling they to retreat what they object be in thus approach the camp at night unless for hostile purpose we have

one of the side channel about three mile before we reach the camp dr mueller have fall some distance behind the party but as this be a frequent occurrence in collect botanical specimen it be not observe till we reach the creek when he be out of sight after unsaddle the pack-horse i be prepare to send in search of he when he come up to the camp the cause of delay have be that he horse have knock up this be unfortunate as the load of one of the pack-horse have to be distribute among the other in order to remount the doctor who require stronger horse than any other person in the party have knock up four since January while not one of the other riding-horse have fail though carry heavier weight latitude by a trianguli australi 16 degree 7 minute 50 seconds 30th July there be abundance of good grass at this camp we remain this day to shoe some of the horse and repair harness etc and rest the horse nor be i sorry to get a day of comparative rest as i have be in the saddle every day since leave the victorium on the 21st June eleven of the horse be re-shod a spring of good water 31st July leave the camp at 740 be pursue a south-east course soon leave the grassy flat of

forest which consist of paper-bark gum the prevailing rock be ironstone conglomerate and hard white sandstone sometimes appear after 100 the country decline to the south and we pass through a belt of cypress scrub at 115 pm alter the course to east-south-east cross a rough sandstone ridge and come on a deep valley with sandstone cliff on each side with some difficulty descend the rock and reach a small watercourse which be quite dry but observe some very green tree about a mile to the north-west at the foot of the rock turn towards they and find a fine spring of water flow from the face of the cliff select a suitable spot encamp at 230 near this spring be several hut construct in the rudest manner by heap branch together from the summit of the hill the view extend thirty mile to the

through which mass of white sandstone protrude this limestone country be well grassed and thinly timbered with eucalyptus of small growth at 120 pm alter the course to north-east and follow down a gully in search of water but though it gradually enlarged to a considerable creek and we continue we search till 70 we be compel to encamp without water i then walk down the creek two mile but only find one moist spot in which by digging a few pint of water be obtain 2nd August at 65 be resume we search for water and follow the creek north-east for two hour reach a small muddy pool of rainwater

level and well grassed but distant rocky hill be visible in almost every direction in approach the gulf of carpentarium heavy dew and fog have become more frequent in the morning when it be usually calm about 100 be a breeze usually set in from the eastward vary from north to south-east at sunset it fall calm but commence again at 80 pm and blow moderately from the eastward for one or two hour very thin misty cloud be frequent and render the heat oppressive when they prevail accord to my reckoning we be now only fifty mile from the sea-coast and therefore much nearer dr leichhardt 's track than i could wish to traverse the country but however desirable a more inland route might be it be evident from the small size of the watercourse hitherto cross that we have be skirt a tableland which be doubtless a continuation of the desert into which we follow sturt 's creek and the small altitude of the country in which the watercourse trend towards the gulf take they rise preclude the

melaleuca and eucalypti along its bank the channel be dry and sandy about twenty yard wide but show the mark of high flood follow the creek down for three-quarter of a hour find a small pool just sufficient for the supply of the party just below we camp a creek fifteen yard wide join the principal one from the south and from the general lay of the country it be evident that we be now on the mcarthur river of leichhardt but though from the steepness of the bank the flood frequently rise thirty to forty foot the creek do not bear the character of one which would take its rise at any great distance inland of we track the country pass over be very thinly wood with eucalyptus of small growth seldom more than one and a half foot in diameter and fifty foot high a few leguminous ironbark and

narrow-leafed melaleuca shortly after reach the creek the horse monkey knock up though only carry a pack-saddle since the 30th July i therefore leave the saddle have remove all such portion of the fitting which might hereafter be useful a few yard from we camp we find some spear and water vessel which have be hide under some sheet of bark by the black who evidently be out hunting as we hear they call to each other in the afternoon though they be not see these water vessel be form by hollow out a block of wood in the shape of a canoe and have a capacity of three gallon and it be evident

pool of water in a small creek at 125 several tree near this pool of water have be mark by the black the bark have be remove the wood be paint yellow with brown spot at regular interval and vertical wave line in black it be evident from the outline of the hill that we be travel on the edge of the tableland of northern australium and this account for the small size of the watercourse while the abrupt and broken nature of the hill have cause the rock to form channel of sufficient size to retain water throughout the year while the same disruption of the stratum have expose the limestone and trap-rock have cause fertile patch of country and thus enable we to traverse a country which be otherwise barren and inhospitable in the extreme we chief difficulty be the rocky character of the country which can only be traverse with well-shod horse it be possible that some small tract of available country may exist between we track and the shore of the gulf of carpentarium but to the south

several marked tree : chumlut + arrow point up ore rch to 1856 but be disappoint in we hope that the vessel have reach the albert as these mark consist of several name of seaman who appear to have form the crew of a boat send up the river by hm steamer torch search be make for direction for find any memorandum which might have be conceal as i first think it probable that the object of the visit might have be to communicate with the expedition but the nature of the inscription and the absence of anything which lead to even a surmise of what be the object of the visit cause we to come to the conclusion that it have no reference to the north australian expedition from the state of the ash of the fire and branch of the tree which have be cut and break it appear that several week have elapse and consequently the torch be not likely to still be in or near the river in accordance with arrangement make with mr baine i mark a tree thus : nae aug 30 dig1yd to e in order to apprise he of we have reach the albert and of we prospective movement return to the camp write a memorandum of the visit of the expedition and a note to mr baine inform he that we intend leave other mark and memorandum at the junction of the salt-water arm of the river and then continue without delay we route towards moreton bay these memorandum be enclose in a powder-canister and messr elsey and bowman

suppose to be the albert -- a mistake which have cause considerable error in the map of he route as it be not name i call it the leichhardt the character of the country be inferior as the grass which cover the plain be principally aristidium and andropogon anthisterium or kangaroo grass only in small patch the soil be a good brown loam latitude by vega 18 degree 11 minute 50 seconds attack by the native 5th September at daybreak we hear the black make a great noise up the river and while the horse be be bring in nineteen black come to the camp all arm with club and spear they do not make any hostile demonstration and the approach of the horse appear to keep they in check and a person unacquainted with the treacherous character of the australian might have think they friendly when we start at 650 be they follow the party to the bank of the river and begin to ship they spear and when we be cross a deep ravine make a rush on we with they spear poise ready to throw they at we hope to take advantage of we position but just as they leader be in the act of throw he spear he receive a charge of small shot this check they and we charge they on horseback and with a few shot from we revolver put they to flight except one man who climb a tree where we leave he as we object be only to procure we own safety and that with as little injury to the black as possible we do not pursue we advantage by follow the fugitive proceed down the river a short distance at 740 cross to the right bank on a ledge of flat rock it be here about 100 yard wide with shallow reach of water the bank rise steep -- thirty to forty foot very little vegetation grow on the bank which appear to result from salt water occasionally reach this part at very high tide we now steer east over level grassy plain with patch of box and terminalium pass a small but deep waterhole near which be two black gin who do not appear to notice we at 100 the country be cover with a open scrub of terminalium with silvery leaf and triodium replace the grass at noon pass a small rocky gully with a waterhole which we horse quite empty of its contents alter the course to north-east the country be cover with melaleuca scrub with silver-leafed ironbark triodium and a little grass but we soon re-enter the open plain which extend to the north and follow a watercourse at 35 pm camp at a small muddy waterhole on the bank of which

a belt of terminalium and at 10 reach a small watercourse and camp at a fine waterhole fifty yard wide and 100 yard long apparently deep and permanent water with open grassy bank this waterhole would render a great extent of the fine grassy country around available for pasturage in pass through the box forest we observe several sleep place which have be construct by the black during the wet season

course change to south-south-east and alter we course more to the southward at noon come again on the creek much reduce in size melaleuca scrub and triodium grow close to its bank and only a few shallow pool of water nearly dry up and very little grass at 1225 pm camp at a small pool on the bank of the lagoon pass in the morning large heap of mussel-shell show the spot where from the vast

water very scarce in its bed it do not appear that we have yet reach the stream rise in the high land at the head of the burdekin and lynd river it therefore appear expedient to steer a east-north-east course till some stream-bed of sufficient size to retain water at this season can be find and then to follow it up to the range where alone water can be expect to be find to enable we to steer to the south-east at a earlier season of the year when water be abundant it would be more desirable to ascend the flinder and cross from its upper branch to the head of the clark but under present circumstance this course would be highly imprudent and no experimental deviation from the most direct course would be justifiable the grass be scanty the horse have scatter much and we do not leave the camp till 1020 be when we steer east-north-east a short mile from we camp pass four black at a pool of water they do not observe we till we have pass though only 100 yard distant and the

expedition in search of dr leichhardt minute number 57-44 he excellency the governor-general at the instance of the honorable the colonial secretary bring under the consideration of the council a proposal which have be make to organise another expedition to ascertain if possible beyond doubt the fate of dr leichhardt who leave sydney some nine year ago with the intention of explore the north-western interior of australium this proposal have its origin in a public meeting hold in sydney on the 11th instant at which resolution be pass invoke the assistance of the government and it be recommend to favourable consideration at the present moment by the circumstance that mr gregory who recently return from a successful exploration in the same direction have intimate he willingness to undertake the conduct of the propose expedition 2 the council express themselves desirous of seize so favourable a opportunity of pursue this inquiry and they therefore advise that mr gregory should be at once invite to submit for approval a definite proposal have for its object : 1st to ascertain the fate of the late dr leichhardt and 2nd to connect the explore survey of mitchell and kennedy with he own such proposal to be accompany by a estimate of the probable expense which it will be necessary to incur edward c merewether clerk of the council executive council office sydney 22 September 1857 ac gregory esquire to the colonial secretary sydney 15 September 1857 sir adverting to you verbal communication of yesterday with reference to the propose expedition in search of trace of dr leichhardt i have the honor to furnish a memorandum of the arrangement i would suggest for the organization and conduct of a party calculate to effect the object in view together with a estimate of the probable cost these document i have submit to such of the gentleman compose the committee of the leichhardt association as i have have the opportunity of consulting and i have avail myself of they experience of the district in which the expedition would be organise although i have allow extreme rate for many of the item of expenditure yet as in all undertaking of this description unavoidable and unforeseen contingency be certain to arise i should scarcely feel justified in name the gross amount which should be available though not necessarily expend at a less sum than 4500 pound i have etc ac gregory the honorable the colonial secretary memorandum for the organization of a explore expedition for the purpose of search for trace of dr leichhardt 's party the object of the propose expedition would be primarily to search for trace of dr leichhardt and he party who start from the settle district of new south wale in April 1848 with the intention of proceed to western australium and if possible to ascertain the fate of that unfortunate explorer secondly the examination of the country both in the intervene space between the track of previous explorer and also beyond the limit of that hitherto explore with a view of develop its resource especially with reference to its capability for settlement the party despatch by the colonial government under mr hely in 1851-2 trace dr leichhardt to a spot near the head of the warrego river beyond this spot dr leichhardt have express he intention of proceed down the victorium river to its northern bend and then shape he course along the interior slope of the range which he suppose exist at the source of the stream flow to the northern coast the propose route of the search expedition would therefore be to reach leichhardt 's last known camp and then to examine the bank of the victorium river to the junction of the alice river at the northern bend where especial search would be make as dr leichhardt intend to leave letter there and would probably encamp for several day to recruit before finally enter the unknown country and the non-existence of mark at this point would be almost conclusive evidence that the party have perish nearer to the settlement in the search for trace of the miss party beyond this point -lrb- as it could only be at the camping place that any trace would remain after so long a interval -rrb- it would be necessary to follow such natural feature as would probably have influence the party in the selection of its route assume that the general course would be north-west the investigation have be carry to the fullest extent that time and circumstance would admit the search party would adopt such a route on its return as would intersect the greatest extent of unexamined country to effect these object it be propose to organise a party at one of the outer station say at surat on the lower condamine river from which leichhardt 's last known camp be 230 mile and the junction of the alice with the victorium river 370 mile not allow for deviation the party to consist of two section which may be term the explore and the auxiliary party the first would comprise eight person equip and provision for 5 month and for the conveyance of which 32 horse would be require as follow : commander assistant overseer etc 4 stockman 1 aboriginal stockman the second section would be compose of six person provision etc for 2 month and for the conveyance of which 13 horse would be require as follow : 1 leader 4 stockman 1 aboriginal black these two section would proceed together to the junction of the alice and victorium river and would be sufficiently strong to detach party to examine point out of the more direct line of route which the main body would follow on reach the spot above refer to the explore party would be fit out in the most efficient manner for continue its operation by select the strongest and most serviceable portion of the horse equipment etc while the auxiliary party would return with the remainder to the settlement thus afford nearly all the advantage of a depot without incur the greater expense or inconvenience attend the otherwise necessary return of the explore party by the same route it be scarcely necessary to advert to the many advantage which would be derive from this arrangement for enable the explore party to reach the extreme

knowledge be of material service -- we make we way through the dense scrub and broken country to the west for about thirty mile to the head of scott 's creek a small tributary of the dawson river 29th march the general course be now west-north-west through a country with rich grassy valley and dense scrub of brigalow acacia on the higher ground green grass be abundant at this time but i fear that in season of drought few of the waterhole be permanent the timber consist of ironbark box and a few other species of eucalyptus -- the brigalow acacia attain the height of thirty foot soft brown sandstone of the coal measure be the prevail rock form hill with table summit 2nd April with some difficulty owe to the dense scrub we cross the basaltic ridge which divide the eastern water flow to the dawson river from those trend to the west into the basin of the maranoa river a tributary of which -- probably the merivale river -- be follow westward the country become more sandy timbered with ironbark cypress etc the whole be however well grassed and suit for grazing if not too heavily stock 5th April reach the maranoa river in about latitude 25 degree 45 minute water be scarcely procurable in the sandy bed and we have to dig well to obtain a supply 7th April to 12th April warn by the fact that messr h gregory and haly have be unable to penetrate the country to the west from scarcity of water even three month earlier in the season we follow up the maranoa to mount owen and have find a sufficient supply of water and grass for a few day ' halt i proceed to reconnoitre the country to the west and at length find a practicable route to the tributary of the warrego river to which the party be advance a heavy shower of rain have fill the gully in this locality and green grass clothe the country form a striking contrast to the dry and waterless valley of the maranoa 15th to 16th April fine openly timbered valley well suit for pasture alternate with ridge of scrub of brigalow acacia till we reach mount playfair a basaltic hill on the sandstone ridge which separate the warrego valley from that of the nive a small branch of which be follow down to its junction with the main channel in latitude 25 degree 6 minute the soil in the valley of the nive be sandy thinly grass and openly timbered with ironbark spot gum etc the back country rise into low sandstone ridge cover with dense scrub of brigalow acacia some pool of permanent water contain small fish be pass on the bank of which the remains of numerous native camp be see 17th April from the nive river a north-north-west course be pursue through a nearly level sandy country cover with a scrub of acacia eucalyptus bottle-tree etc which offer great impediment to we progress till within six mile of the victorium river when we suddenly emerge from the scrub on to open downs of rich clay soil but the drought have be of such a long continuance that the whole of the vegetation have be destroy and sweep away by the wind leave the country to all appearance a absolute desert the bed of the victorium be scarcely ten yard wide and perfectly dry so that it be only after a prolonged search along its course that a small puddle of water be find in a hollow of the clay flat and near it fortunately for we horse a little grass grow in widely scatter tuft the barcoo river 19th April be now on the line of route which dr leichhardt have state he intention of follow the party be divide so that both side of the river be examine in all probable position in which he camp might have be situate but as the high flood appear to have inundate the country for nearly a mile on each bank last year all track of previous explorer be necessarily obliterate and it be only by marked tree or the bone of cattle that we could hope to discover any trace during the first two day ' journey down the river only a few small pool of water be see and these not of a permanent character while the rich vegetation on the open downs which have excite the admiration of sir t mitchell on he discovery of the country in a favourable season have wholly pass away leave little but a bare surface of clay the deep fissure in its surface give evidence of long-continued drought 20th April in latitude 24 degree 37 minute longitude 146 degree 13 minute a small sandy creek of equal size with the victorium join from the east and just below the first permanent pool of water be find there be a slight improvement in the grass but dense scrub prevail in the back country and even approach the river at interval leichhardt 's marked tree 21st April while collect the horse near this pool of water i detect a party of armed native watch one of the stockman evidently from they position in the scrub and general movement incline to hostility and i imagine that it be a knowledge that we be aware of they intention which prevent my be able to establish any communication with they i may here remark that this party which number about eight be the first native see during the journey continue we route along the river -lrb- latitude 24 degree 35 minute longitude 36 degree 6 minute -rrb- we discover a moreton-bay ash -lrb- eucalyptus sp -rrb- about two foot in diameter mark with the letter l on the east side cut through the bark about four foot from the ground and near it the stump of some small tree which have be cut with a sharp axe also a deep notch cut in the side of a sloping tree apparently to support the ridge pole of a tent or some similar purpose all indicate that a camp have be establish here by leichhardt 's party the tree be near the bank of a small reach of water which be note on sir t mitchell 's map this together with its actual and relative position as regard other feature of the country prove it not to have be either one of sir t mitchell 's or mr kennedy 's camp as neither encamp within several mile of the spot besides which the letter could not have be mark by either of they to designate the number of the camp as the former have long pass he fiftieth camp and the latter have not reach that number on the outward route and number he camp from the farthest point attain on he return journey notwithstanding a careful search no trace of stock could be find this be however easily account for as the country have be inundate last season though the current have not be sufficiently strong to remove some emu bone and mussel shell which lay round a native camping place within a few yard of the spot no other indication have be find we continue the search down the river examine every likely spot for marked tree but without success the general aspect of the country be extremely level and even the few distant ridge which be visible have but small elevation above the plain the highest apparently not exceed 200 or 300 foot timber be wholly confine to the bank of the river and though open plain exist acacia scrub be the principal feature water become very scarce in the channel of the river and we be principally dependent on small puddle of rainwater from a recent thunder-shower but as we approach the northern bend some fine reach of water be pass the alice river 6th April to 28th April in latitude 26 degree 2 minute we observe a small dry creek join from the north-east this i trace upward for a few mile but as its relative position with regard to the adjacent country as well as the latitude do not correspond with that of the alice river on the chart we continue we route find however that the general course of the river change to south-west i leave the party at a small lagoon and ride up the river again make a second search more especially at the junction of the small dry creek which prove to be identical with the alice river though more than five mile to the south as the victorium river never reach the parallel of 24 degree we position be now become very critical as a long continuance of drought have not only dry up all the water except in the deepest hollow in the channel of the main river but the smaller vegetation and even the tree on the back country be annihilate render the country almost impracticable from the quantity of fall dead branch and even in the bed of the river where the inundation derive from heavy rain near the source of the river last year have somewhat refresh the grass it be scarcely possible to find subsistence for the horse under exist circumstance it would have be certain destruction to attempt a north-west route from this point and the only course that appear open to we be to follow down the main river to the junction of the thompson river and ascend that watercourse so as to intersect leichhardt 's probable line of route have he penetrate in that direction favor by a better season at the same time it be probable that like ourselves he have be repulse and would then follow down the river and search for a more favourable point from which to commence he north-west course in order to round the desert interior on its northern side and we therefore continue we search down towards the thompson river 29th April to 2nd may the country be perfectly flat on both side of the river and show trace of tremendous flood the soil near the river be often deeply-cracked mud water very scarce and grass seldom see the back country be cover with scrub of dead acacia the soil a red sand or gravel and such be the unpromising appearance that i begin to fear that we horse would soon fail for want of food and water but have camp at a waterhole during Sunday to rest the party heavy rain commence and though the greater portion of the water be absorb by the dry soil some of the channel of the river fill and commence to flow this relieved we from much difficulty as regard the want of water and enable we to seek for grass in position which be otherwise inaccessible 3rd may just as we be leave we camp a party of seven native make they appearance but though they come up to we and talk much i could get no useful information from they as the party move on they follow we and think they be not observe make a attempt to throw a spear at one of the man but mr c gregory wheeling he horse quickly and present a revolver at the intend aggressor they run away and leave we to pursue we journey in peace the thompson river 4th may to 6th may the abundance of water be not without its inconvenience and have the rain continue the party would have be annihilate as we camp be between the deep channel which intersect the plain and in attempt to extricate ourselves from the plain subject to inundation find ourselves so completely entangled among the numerous deep channel and boggy gully in some of which the horse narrowly escape suffocation in the soft mud that after have ford one branch of the river carry the whole equipment across on we own back construct a bridge over a second for the transport of the store and drag the horse through as we best could with rope after three day of severe toil we have scarcely accomplish a direct distance of five mile the dry weather which follow rapidly harden the surface of the clay plain and i attempt to steer due west to the thompson but find the country so destitute of feed and cover with dense acacia scrub that we be compel to return to the plain on the bank of the river 8th may the valley of the river trend west be somewhat contract and do not exceed five or six mile in breadth the plain be firmer salt-bush and grass more abundant and the horse recover slightly from the effect of the barren country keep back from the right bank of the main channel we pass some ridge of drift sand and come on a fine lagoon nearly a mile in length here we surprise a party of native who decamp on we approach leave a net fish etc which we of course leave untouched and camp at a spot lower down the lagoon 9th may the next day be Sunday we remain at we camp and the party of native consist of seven or eight man three or four woman and some child approach we and remain the greater part of the day near the tent they be very anxious to enter the camp but this be not permit by sign they express that they have observe we have not take away any of they property the evening before when they run away and leave they net and be therefore satisfied we intention be friendly but we could not procure any information relative to the object of we journey or the character of the country before we at 4 pm they inform we they be go to sleep at the most distant part of the lagoon and would return next morning at sunrise and then depart after dark however the native be detect attempt to crawl into the camp through the bush and though we call to they in a unmistakable tone to retire they would not withdraw as the position they have take up be such as to command we camp and render it unsafe in the event of a attack it be necessary to dislodge they i therefore fire a pistol over they but be answer by a shout of derision which no doubt would have be soon follow by a shower of spear have we not compel they to retreat by a discharge of small shot direct into the scrub after which we be not further molest 10th may we be now approach the junction of the thompson river but the country become worse as we advance and the last five mile of the plain be absolutely devoid of vegetation we hope be however raise on finding that the late rain have cause the thompson to flow though the current be not strong we have however to travel upward of twelve mile up its course before any grass could be find for the horse 11th may continue we route up the thompson nothing could be more desolate than the aspect of the country except the few tree which grow on the immediate bank of the river there be scarcely a tree leave alive while the plain be quite bare of vegetation except a few salsolaceous bush at the distance of five mile low ridge of red drift sand show the desert character of all around even the lower surface of the cloud assume a lurid tinge from the reflection of the bare surface of red sand 12th to 15th may in latitude 24 degree 40 minute low sandstone hill or rather tableland approach both bank of the river and the gully which intersect they have supply the water lower down as the channel be dry above we however succeed in reach latitude 23 degree 47 minute when the absence of water and grass -- the rain not have extend so far north and the channel of the river separate into small gully and spread on the wide plain -- preclude we progress further to the north or west and the only prospect of save we horse be to return south as quickly as possible this be a most severe disappointment as we have just reach the part of the country through which leichhardt most probably travel if the season be sufficiently wet to render it practicable thus compel to abandon the principal object of the expedition only two course remain open -- either to return to the head of the victorium river and attempt a northern course by the valley of the belyando or to follow down the river and ascertain whether it flow into cooper 's creek or the darling the latter course appear most desirable as it be just possible that leichhardt under similar circumstance have be drive to the south-west in order to ascertain whether any large watercourse come from the west the return route be along the right bank of the thompson but only one small creek and some inconsiderable gully join on that side nor be the country of a better character than on the left bank -- consist of barren plain subject to inundation low rocky ridge cover with dense scrub and sandy ridge produce triodium 22nd to 23rd may we have nearly reach the victorium river when in cross a gully worrell 's horse fall and hurt he so severely that we have to halt for some time before he could be place on he horse again and it be therefore fortunate that a small patch of dry grass be find on the bank of the river which enable we to halt the next day which be Sunday travel down the right bank of the river the principal channel be full of water but the clay plain between be quite dry the rain which have cause the river to flow not have extend so far south nothing could well be more desolate than the unbounded level of these vast plain which destitute of vegetation extend to the horizon we horse be reduce to feed on the decayed weed and even these be so scarce that they eagerly devour the thatch of some old native hut 27th may we have nearly reach the furthest point attain by mr kennedy when the horse show sign of fail strength and the channel on the east side of the plain be dry i conceive it prudent to cross to the western side again the dry mud be so deeply crack that the horse be continually fall and one horse be so completely exhaust that we have to abandon he kennedy 's marked tree 28th may steer a westerly and then a north course we reach the small waterhole at mr kennedy 's second camp on the return route there be just sufficient water to supply the party for one night and a few scattered tuft of grass near it but quite insufficient for the supply of so large a number of horse close to the waterhole we find mr kennedy 's marked tree it be a large box-tree mark on the north side thus : k ii the cut of the axe and chisel be still quite clear though twelve year have elapse but the slow growth and decay of tree in the interior may be attribute to the dryness of the climate 29th may steer north-west after toiling nearly thirty mile across this fearful waste of dry mud we at length reach a small patch of grass on a sandy hummock but only just in time to save the horse as many could scarcely keep on they leg and we have to remove they load to those which be less exhaust 30th may long before the next morning we hungry animal have consume every blade of grass and the small patch round the camp be reduce to the same barren appearance as the surround plain we therefore start in search of food for they and be fortunate in find a second patch of grass about three mile to the south and halted for the remainder of the day which be Sunday thankful that providence have enable we to make it a day of rest plain of dry mud 31st may the run channel of the river be still to the west of we position we steer south-west over barren clay plain to some low ridge of drift sand beyond which we find the channel full of water with a slight current but it terminate in a large reach of water which have not yet fill and the channel lower down be dry low ridge of red drift sand be now frequent on the plain and appear to be the higher point of the former sandy desert the clay plain result from the deposition of mud in the hollow between which have in course of time fill it to one uniform level latitude 26 degree 2 minute 1st June the channel on the western side of the plain be very irregular sometimes completely lose on the level surface and again collect into large hollow with box-tree on the bank in which fine sheet of water still remain some 100 yard wide and more than a mile in length we therefore do not experience so much inconvenience with regard to the supply of this necessary element as from the absence of sufficient grass and the all but impracticable nature of the mud plain 4th June in latitude 27 degree low sandstone tableland approach the west side of the river and we attempt to travel along the slope between it and the mud plain but find it so stony that the horse ' hoof be soon worn to the quick as we have be compel to remove they shoe to enable they to traverse the mud plain have it not be for green bush of salsola and some similar plant which have spring up since the rain this tract of country exactly resemble the stony desert describe by captain sturt as exist 200 mile to the westward these remarkable feature form the declivity of the sandstone tableland through which cooper 's creek force its way and by confine the water to a narrower space during flood cause the fine deep reach of water which characterize it 8th June by follow the western limit of the plain we reach latitude 27 degree 30 minute when the sandstone tableland recede and a boundless expanse of mud plain be before we the line of box-tree which have hitherto mark the channel nearly cease polygonum and atriplex constitute the main feature of the vegetation cooper 's creek 9th June after toiling south-west a day and a half over this level surface to latitude 27 degree 50 minute we approach some low ridge at the foot of which there be a lagoon 100 yard wide exhibit sign of a current during flood to the north-west and as there be a evident westerly trend in all the smaller channel previously cross it be evident they would soon merge in cooper 's creek steer west-north-west the several channel collect together and soon form a deep watercourse with fine reach of water the sandstone tableland close in on both side the soil of the intervene plain be much firmer but show by the vegetation that saline nature which so often attend the development of the upper sandstone in australium grass be abundant and it be surprising with what rapidity the horse recover they strength boundary of south australia 12th June approach the 141st meridian which be the boundary of the province of south australia stony ridge close in on both bank of cooper 's creek form almost a natural division across which we follow a well-beaten native path and here i observe the only instance which have come under my observation where the aborigine have take the trouble to remove natural obstacle from they path the loose stone have be clear from the track and in some place pile in large heap 14th June after pass the stony ridge the valley become wider the hill recede suddenly in longitude 140 degree 30 minute both to the north and south and the whole of the country to the west seem to consist of a succession of low ridge of red sand and level plain of dry mud subject to inundation shortly before reach the branch of cooper 's creek name by captain sturt streletzkus creek we observe the track of two horse one apparently a cart-horse and the other a well-bred animal but as none of they track be within the last month the rain have obliterate they to such a extent that they could not be trace up as they have leave the bank of the creek on the first fall of rain as be the usual habit of horse whose wanderings be uncontrolled there can be little doubt that these horse belong to captain sturt who leave one in a exhaust state near this locality and also lose a second horse whose track be follow many mile in the direction of this part of cooper 's creek 16th June streletzkus creek which separate nearly at a right angle from the main channel appear to convey about one-third of the water of cooper 's creek nearly south and as we afterwards ascertain connect it with lake torren we however continue to follow the channel which trend west for thirty mile but large branch continually break off to the south and west and at length the whole be lose on the wide plain of dry mud between the sand ridge and as there be no prospect of either water or grass to the west i steer south and south-east for fifty mile over a succession of ridge of red drift sand ten to fifty foot high run parallel to each other and in a nearly north and south direction between these ridge we occasionally find shallow puddle of rainwater or rather mud as it be so thick with clay as to be scarcely fluid fortunately a great quantity of green weed have grow up since the rain and the horse improve in condition and do not require much water 21st June to 25th June in latitude 28 degree 24 minute we again come on streletzkus creek and then follow it nearly south-south-west between sandy ridge to latitude 29 degree 25 minute when it turn to the west and enter lake torren no permanent water be see in the bed of the creek though there be many deep hollow which when once fill retain water for several month and this combine with the existence of a fine reach of water in cooper 's creek immediately above the point where streletzkus creek branch off render it far the best line of route into the interior which have yet be discover pass between the eastern point of lake torren and what have hitherto be consider the eastern arm but now ascertain to be a independent lake the space between -lrb- about half a mile -rrb- be level sandy ground cover with salicornium without any apparent connect channel the course be continue south-south-west towards mount hopeless at the northern extreme of the high range of south australium which have be visible across the level country at a distance of sixty mile 26th June as we approach the range of hill track of cattle and horse be observe and eight mile beyond mount hopeless come to a cattle station which have be lately establish by mr baker as the nature of the country we have traverse be such as not to admit of any useful deviation from it if we return to new south wale by land i deem it advisable to proceed forthwith to adelaide and dispose of the horse and equipment return with the party by sea to sydney arrive in adelaide south australia general observation 31st July we therefore proceed by easy stage towards adelaide experience the greatest hospitality at the station on we route while we reception in the city be of the most flattering nature he excellency sir richard macdonald kindly give I the use of a extensive paddock for the horse and provide quarter for the man during the period which necessarily elapse before the sale of the equipment of the expedition be effect i have also to express my acknowledgment of the kind assistance render by the honorable the commissioner of crown land to the surveyor-general and the superintendent of telegraph for valuable datum connect with the construction of the map of the route as well as to many other gentleman whose cordial co-operation greatly facilitate my arrangement it be extremely gratifying to record my appreciation of the untiring zeal and energy which distinguish every individual compose the expedition and it be to the unvarying and cheerful alacrity with which each and all perform they respective duty that under providence the rapidity and success of the journey be to be mainly attribute with reference to the probable fate of dr leichhardt it be evident from the existence of the marked camp nearly eighty mile beyond those see by mr hely that the account give to that gentleman by the native of the murder of the party be untrue and i be incline to think only a revival of the report current during leichhardt 's first journey to port essington nor be it probable that they be destroy until they have leave the victorium as if kill by the native the scatter bone of the horse and cattle would have be observe during we search i be therefore of opinion that they leave the river at the junction of the alice and favor by thunder-shower penetrate the level desert country to the north-west in which case on the cessation of the rain the party would not only be deprive of a supply of water for the onward journey but unable to retreat as the shallow deposit of rainwater would evaporate in a few day and it be not likely that they would commence a retrograde movement until the strength of the party have be severely tax in the attempt to advance the character of the country traverse from the out-station on the dawson river to the head of the warrego river be generally that of a grassy forest with ridge of dense brigalow scrub a great portion be available for pastoral purpose but not well water and the soil be sandy the grass would soon be destroy if too heavily stock as we advance into the interior it become more barren and except along the bank of the larger watercourse destitute of timber and the character of the vegetation indicate excessive drought north of latitude 26 degree dense scrub of acacia prevail on the level country beyond the influence of the inundation but to the southward sandy and stony desert with low shrubby vegetation be the characteristic feature west of longitude 147 degree nearly to the boundary of south australia in 141 degree the country be unfit for occupation for though in favourable season there might in some few locality be abundance of feed for stock the uncertainty of rain and frequent recurrence of drought render it untenable the grass and herbage be principally annual which not only die but be sweep away by the hot summer wind leave the surface of the soil completely bare on cooper 's creek near the boundary there be a small tract of second-rate country which be abundantly supply with water may eventually be occupy the best part be however within the province of south australium between cooper 's creek and lake torren about 120 mile of sandy country intervene this tract be destitute of surface water but as it be probable that it could be obtain by sink well of moderate depth i think it might be occupy to advantage during the cool season and thus relieve the station which be now establish within lake torren though i fear that the summer heat would be too great to admit of permanent occupation the geological character of the country be remarkably uniform carboniferous sandstone and shale contain occasional bed of coal with superincumbent hill and ridge of basalt extend from darling downs to the 146th meridian where these rock be cover by horizontal sandstone with bed of chert and water-worn quartz pebble this latter formation extend as far as mount hopeless where the slate range of south australia rise abruptly from the plain the sandy desert and mud plain be only superficial deposit as the sandstone be often expose where the upper formation be intersect by gully the direction of the parallel ridge of drift sand appear to be the result of the prevail wind and not the action of water it be sufficient to visit they on a windy day to be convince that it be unnecessary to seek for a more remote and obscure cause than that which be in present operation it be perhaps with reference to the physical geography of australium that the result of the expedition be most important as by connect successively the exploration of sir t mitchell mr kennedy captain sturt and mr eyre the water of the tropical interior of the eastern portion of the continent be prove to flow towards spencer 's gulf if not actually into it the barometrical observation show that lake torren the lowest part of the interior be decidedly above the sea-level although only about one-third of the water of cooper 's creek flow into lake torren by the channel of streletzkus creek there be strong evidence that the remain channel after spread they water on the vast plain which occupy the country between they and sturt 's stony desert finally drain to the south augmented probably by the water of eyre 's creek the stony desert and perhaps some other watercourse of a similar character come from the westward this peculiar structure of the interior render it improbable that any considerable inland lake should exist in connection with the known system of water for as lake torren be decidedly only a expand continuation of cooper 's creek and therefore the culminate point of this vast system of drainage if there be sufficient average fall of rain in the interior to balance the effect of evaporation from the surface of a extensive sheet of water the torren basin instead of be occupy by salt marsh in which the existence of anything beyond shallow lagoon of salt-water be yet problematical would be maintain as a permanent lake therefore if the water flow from so large a tract of country be insufficient to meet the evaporation from the surface of lake torren there be even less probability of the water of the western interior form a inland lake of any magnitude even should there be so anomalous a feature as a depression of the surface in which it could be collect especially as we knowledge of its limit indicate a much drier climate and less favourable conformation of surface than in the eastern division of the continent the undulation of the surface of the country be nearly parallel to the meridian gradually decrease in height from the divide range between the eastern and western water till instead of the water of the river be confine to valley they occupy plain form by a slight flattening of the curvature of the sphere thus the side of the plain through which the river run before it turn west to cooper 's creek be 150 foot below the tangential level of the center channel and even the summit of the sandstone tableland which rise beyond be below the visible horizon it be this peculiar conformation which cause the stream-bed to spread so widely when follow the course of the valley from north to south and it be only where they break through the intervene ridge that the water be confine sufficiently to form well-defined channel the existence of these extensive valley trend north and south over so large a tract of country render it by no means unlikely that they continue far beyond the limit of present exploration and it be not unreasonable to infer that the great depression which have be trace nearly five hundred mile north from spencer 's gulf through lake torren to the stony desert of sturt -lrb- or rather the mud plain contiguous to its western limit -rrb- may be continuous for a equal distance beyond to the low land at the head of the gulf of carpentarium a theory also support by the fact that the river flow into the gulf either come from the east or west apparently from higher land in those direction while there be not a single watercourse from the south or any indication of elevated country in that direction captain wickham have name a important river discover by he in hm beagle on the north-west coast the victorium several year prior to sir t mitchell have attach that name to the upper portion of cooper 's creek which have also be previously discover and name by captain sturt i would suggest that the term river cooper be adopt for the whole of the main channel from its source discover by sir t mitchell to its termination in lake torren as while it do not interfere with the rule that the name give by the first discoverer should be retain will prevent the recurrence of the misapprehension and inconvenience of have two important river with the same designation on the map of australium with regard to the number and habit of the aborigine i could collect little information as only a collective number of about 100 man a few woman and child be see in small scatter party but judge from the number of encampment see at least a thousand must visit the bank of the river and it be probable that the whole of the inhabitant for at least 100 mile on each side be dependent on it for water during the dry season neither sex wear any clothing they weapon and utensil be similar to those use on the eastern coast nor be there any characteristic by which they could be observe to differ from the aborigine of other portion of australium fish rat grass seed and a few root constitute they chief food on the upper part of the river they bury they dead pile wood on the grave near the junction of the thompson they suspend the body in net and afterwards remove the bone while on cooper 's creek the grave be mound of earth three to four foot high apparently without any excavation and surmount by a pile of dead wood in the last-named locality the number of burial mound which have be construct about two year ago greatly exceed the proportion of death which could have possibly occur in any ordinary season of mortality even assume the densest population know in any other part of australium and it be not improbable that the season of drought which prove so destructive to the tree vegetation higher up the river may have be equally disastrous in its effect on the aboriginal inhabitant of this portion of the interior ac gregory sydney 27 August 1858 end of the project gutenberg ebook of journal of australian exploration by a c and f t gregory
