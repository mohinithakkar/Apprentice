while far beneath mile after shimmering mile the great pacific with its faery deep smile all day long its silken secret smile son of a race nomadic finding still its home in region furthest from its home range untired the border of the world and rest but to roam loved of he land and make all he boast the birthright of the blood from which he come heir to those light that guard the scottish coast and care only for a filial fame proud if a poet he be scotsman most and bear a scottish name death that long seek we poet find at last death that pursue he over land and sea : not he the flight of fear the heart aghast with stony dread of immortality he flee ` not cowardly ' flee as some captain in whose shape hand lie the momentous fortune of he land shed not vainglorious blood upon the field death why at last he find he treasure isle and he the pirate of its hidden hoard life 'twa the ship he sail to seek it in and death be but the pilot come aboard methink i see he smile a boy 's glad smile on maddened wind and water reef unknown as thunder in the sail the dread typhoon and in the surf the shudder timber groan horror ahead and death beside the wheel : then -- spread stillness of the broad lagoon and lap of water round the rest keel strange isle of voice must we ask in vain in vain beseech and win no answering word save mock echo of we lonely pain from lonely hill and bird island beneath whose unrelenting coast as though it never in the sun have be the whole world 's treasure lieth sink and lose unsunned unseen for either sink beyond the diver 's skill there fathom deep we gold be all arust or in that island it be hoard still yea some have say within thy dreadful wall there be a folk that know not death at all the loved we lose the lose we love be there will no kind voice make answer to we cry give to we ache heart some little trust show how ` tis good to live but best to die some voice that know whither the dead man go : we hear he music from the other side maybe a little tap on the door a something call a something sigh -- no more o for some voice to valiantly declare the best news true then happy island of the happy dead how gladly would we spread impatient sail for you o vanish loveliness of flower and face treasure of hair and great immortal eye be there for these no safe and secret place and be it true that beauty never die soldier and saint haughty and lovely name woman who set the whole wide world in flame poet who sing they passion to the sky and lover wild and wise : fight they and pray for some poor flitting gleam be all they love and worship but a dream be love a lie and fame indeed a breath and be there no sure thing in life -- but death or may it be within that guard shore he meet she now whom i shall meet no more till kind death fold I ` neath he shadowy wing : she whom within my heart i softly tell that he be dead whom once we love so well he the immortal master whom i sing immortal yea dare we the word again if aught remaineth of we mortal day that which be write -- shall it not remain that which be sing be it not build for aye face must fade for all they golden look unless some poet they eternalise make live those golden look in golden book death soon or late will quench the brightest eye -- ` tis only what be write never die yea memory that guard like sacred gold some sainted face they also must grow old pass and forget and think -- or darest thou not -- on all the beauty that be quite forget strange craft of word strange magic of the pen whereby the dead still talk with live man whereby a sentence in its trivial scope may center all we love and all we hope and in a couplet like a rosebud furl lie all the wistful wonder of the world old be the star and yet they still endure old be the flower yet never fail the spring : why be the song that be so old so new know and yet strange each sweet small shape and hue how may a poet thus for ever sing thus build he climb music sweet and sure as build in star and flower the eternal mind ah poet that be yours to seek and find yea yours that magisterial skill whereby god put all heaven in a woman 's eye nature 's own mighty and mysterious art that know to pack the whole within the part : the shell that hum the music of the sea the little word big with eternity the cosmic rhythm in microcosmic thing -- one song the lark and one the planet sing one kind heart beat warm in bird and tree -- to hear it beat who know so well as he virgil of prose far distant be the day when at the mention of you heartfelt name shall shake the head and man oblivious say : ` we know he not this master nor he fame ' not for so swift forgetfulness you work day upon day with rapt fastidious pen turn like precious stone with anxious thought this word and that again and yet again seek to match its meaning with the world nor to the morning star give ear attent that you indeed might ever dare to be with other praise than immortality unworthily content not while a boy still whistle on the earth not while a single human heart beat true not while love last and honor and the brave have earth a grave o well-beloved for you a ode to spring -lrb- to grant and nellie allen -rrb- be it the spring or be the bird all wrong that play on flute and viol a thousand strong in minstrel gallery of the long deep wood epiphany of bloom and bud grave minstrel those of deep responsive chant but see how yonder go dew-drunk with giddy slant yon shelley-lark and hark he on the giddy brink of pearly heaven he fairy anvil clink or watch in fancy how the brimming note fall like a string of pearl from out he heavenly throat or like a fountain in hesperide rain its silver rain in gleam and chime on back of ivory girl -- twice happy rhyme ah none of these may make it plain no image we may seek shall match the magic of he gurgle beak and many a silly thing that hop and cheep and perk he tiny tail and sideway peep and flitter little wing seem in he consequential way to tell of spring the river warble soft and run with fuller curve and sleeker line though on the winter-blackened hedge twig of unbudding iron shine and trample still the river sedge and o the sun i have no friend so generous as this sun that come to meet I with he big warm hand and o the sky there be no maid how true be half so chaste as the pure kiss of greening willow wand against the intense pale blue of this sweet boundless overarching waste and see -- dear heaven but it be the spring -- see yonder yonder by the river there long glitter pearly finger flash upon the warm bright air : why ` tis the heavenly palm the christian tree whose bud be a psalm of natural piety : soft silver notch up the smooth green stem -- ah spring must follow they it be the spring o spirit of spring whose strange instinctive art make the bird sing and bring the bud again o in my heart take up thy heavenly reign and from its deep draw out the hidden flower and where it sleep throughout the winter long o sweet

huge as a minster half in heaven man see thee stand thy rugged girth the waist of fifty eastern girl knot and wart slabbed and armored like the hide of tropic elephant unstormable and steep as some grim fortress with a princess-pearl inside where savage guardian face beard the bastioned keep : so hard a rind old tree shield so soft a heart -- a woman 's heart of tender little nestle leaf nor rind so hard but that a touch so soft can part and spring 's first baby-bud a easy passage cleave i picture thee within with dainty satin side where all the long day through the sleep dryad dream but when the moon bend low and tap thee thrice she glide know the fairy knock to bask within she beam and all the long night through for he with eye and ear she sway within thine arm and sing a fairy tune till startle with the dawn she softly disappear and sleep and dream again until the rise moon but with the peep of day great band of heavenly bird fill all thy branchy chamber with a thousand flute and with the torrid noon stroll up the weary herd to seek thy friendly shade and doze about thy root -- till with the setting sun they turn they once more home and ere the moon dawn for a brief enchanted space weary with million mile the sore-spent star-beam come and moth and bat hold witch ' sabbath in the place and then i picture thee some bloodstained holyrood dread haunt palace of the bat and owl whence steal shroud all day lose murder spirit of the wood and fright young happy nest with homeless hoot and squeal then maybe dangle from thy gloomy gallows bough a human corpse swing mournful rattle bone and chain -- he eighteenth century flesh have fatten nineteenth century cow -- ghastly aeolian harp finger of wind and rain poor rizpah come to reap each newly-fallen bone that once thrill soft a little limb within she womb and mark yon alchemist with zodiac-spangled zone wrenching the mandrake root that fatten in the gloom so round thy day from maiden morn to haunt night from lark and sunlit dream to owl and gibber ghost a catacomb of dark a maze of live light to the wide sea of air a green and welcome coast i seek a god old tree : accept my worship thou all other god have fail I always in my need i hang my votive song beneath thy temple bough unto thy strength i cry -- old monster be my creed give I to clasp this earth with feed root like thine to mount yon heaven with such star-aspiring head fill full with sap and bud this shrunken life of mine and from my bough oh might such stalwart son be shed with loving cheek press close against thy horny breast i hear the roar of sap mount within thy vein tingle with bud thy great hand open towards the west to catch the sweetheart wind that bring the sister rain o wind that blow from out the fruitful mouth of god o

sovereign mad with glee that scamper to the grid perdie and not a year that be take flight to both ` tis just a grim good night but no the imagery say you be wondrous witty -- but not true for the old year that last night go have not be so much lose as spend : you give it in exchange to death for just twelve month of happy breath it be a ticket to admit two happy people close to sit -- a ` season ' ticket one might say at time 's eternal passion play o magic overture of spring o summer like a eastern king o autumn splendid widow queen o winter alabaster tomb where lie the regal twain serene go to they yearly doom but all you buy with that spend year -- ah friend it be as nothing be it nothing at all to hold compare with what you buy with this new year a home ah I you could not buy another half so precious toy with all the other year to come as that grown-up doll 's house -- a home o wine upon its threshold stone and horse-shoe on the lintel of it and happy heart to keep it warm and god himself to love it dear little nest build snug on bough within the world-tree 's mighty arm i would i know a spell that charm eternal safety from the storm to give you always star above and always rose on the bough -- but then the tree 's own root be love love love all love i vow _ new year _ 1893 snatch from tavern to tavern youth pass along with a armful of girl and a heart full of song from flower to flower the butterfly sip o passionate limb and importunate lip from candle to candle the moth love to fly o sweet sweet to burn and still sweeter to die my maiden vote -lrb- to john fraser -rrb- there in my mind 's - eye pure it lay my lodger 's vote 'twa mine to-day it seem a sort of maidenhood my little power for public good -- oh keep it uncorrupted pray and when it must be give away see it be give with a sense of most uncanvassed innocence alas -- but few there be that know ` t -- how grave a thing it be to vote for most man 's vote be give i hear either for rhetoric or -- beer a young man 's vote -- o fair estate of the great tree electorate a living leaf of this great sea a motive wave of empire i on this stupendous wheel -- a fly o maiden vote how pure must be the party that be worthy thee and thereupon my mind begin that perfect government to plan the high millennium of man then in my dream i see arise a england ah so fair and wise a england generously great no selfish island but a state upon the world 's bright forehead wear a mighty star of mighty morn and statesman in that dream become no trickster of the petty aim mere speculator in the rise of program and of party cry expert in all those turn and trick that make this senate-house of ours westminster with its lordly tower the stock-exchange of politics but that ideal parliament do all it say say all it mean and every minister of state be guileless -- as a candidate statesman no more the tinker 's way mend and patch from day to day content with piece part with part but take the mighty problem whole beginning with the human heart : for noble ruler make in vain unselfish law for selfish man and give the whole wide world its vote but who be go to give it soul and then i dream have come to reign true peace within we land again not peace that rot the soul with ease or those ignoble ` rivalry of peace ' more murderous than war but just the simple peasant peace the weary world be wait for with simple food and simple wear go lot of love and little care and joy be save from over-sweet by struggle not too hard to bear so dream i on from dream to dream till slow return to my theme upon my vote i look again -- to whom be i to give it then that uncorrupted maidenhood my little power for public good what party be there that i know that i might dare intrust it to a perfect party fair and square -- my house of common in the air though call by many different name each one profess the noblest aim should all be right 'twa logical that i should give my vote to all and then of party old and new which one if only one be true the divination pass my skill -- my maiden vote be maiden still the animalcule on man a animalcule in my blood rise up against I as i dream he be so tiny as he stand you have not hear he though he scream he cry ` there be no man ' and thump the table with he fist then die -- he day be scarce a span -- that microscopic atheist yet all the while he little soul within what he deny do live -- poor part how could he know the whole and yet he be so positive and all the while he thus blaspheme my -lrb- solar -rrb- system go its round my heart beat on my head still dream -- but my poor atheist be drowned come my celium come my celium let we prove while we may how wise be love -- love grown old and gray with year love whose blood be thin with tear philosophic lover i break my heart its love run dry and i warble passion 's word but to hear they sing like bird when the lightning strike my side love shriek and for ever die leave nought of he behind but these plaything of the mind now the real play be over i can only _ act _ a lover now the mimic play begin with its puppet joy and sin when the heart no longer feel and the blood with caution steal then ah then -- my heart forgive -- then we dare begin to live dip in stygian wave of pain we can never feel again time may hurl he deadliest dart love may practice all he art like some balder lo we stand safe ` mid hurtle spear and brand only death -- ah sweet death throw -- hold the fatal mistletoe let the young unconquered soul love the unit as the whole let the young uncheated eye love the face fore-doomed to die : but my celium not for we pleasure half so hazardous let we set we heart on play ` tis alas the only way -- make of life the jest it be laugh and fool and -lrb- maybe -rrb- kiss never for a moment dear love so well to risk a fear be not this my celium say the only wise -- and weary -- way time 's monotone autumn and winter summer and spring -- have time no other song to sing weary we grow of the changeless tune -- June -- December December -- June time like a bird have but one song one way to build like a bird have he thus have he build so long so long thus have he sing -- ah I time like a spider know be sure one only wile though he seem so wise : death be he web and love he lure and you and i he fly ` love ' he sing in the morning clear ` love love love ' and you never hear how under he breath he whisper ` death death death ' yet time -- ` tis the strangest thing of all -- knoweth not the sense of the word he saith eternity teach he he parrot-call of ` love and death ' year after year doth the old man climb the mountainous knee of eternity but eternity telleth nothing to time -- it may not be cor cordium o golden day o silver night o golden day o silver night that bring my own true love at last ah wilt thou drop from out we sight and drown within the past one wave no more in life 's wide sea one little nameless crest of foam the day that give she all to I and bring we to we home nay rather as the morning grow in flush and gleam and kingly ray while up the heaven the sun-god go so shall ascend we day and when at last the long night near and love grow angel in the gloam nay sweetheart what of fear and tear -- the star shall see we home love 's exchange simple be i i care no whit for pelf or place it be enough for I to sit and watch dulcinea 's face to mark the light and shadow flit across the silver moon of it i have no other merchandise no stock or share no other gold but just what lie in those deep eye of hers and sure if all the world be wise it too would bank within she eye i buy up all she smile all day with all my love and sell they back cost-price or say a kiss or two above it be a speculation fine the profit must be always mine the world have many thing ` tis true to fill its time far more important thing to do than make love and rhyme yet if it ask I to advise i would say -- buy up dulcinea 's eye to a simple housewife who dough shall knead as for god 's sake shall fill it with celestial leaven and every loaf that she shall bake be eat of the blest in heaven love 's wisdom sometimes my idle heart would roam far from its quiet happy nest to seek some other newer home some unaccustomed best : but ere it spread its foolish wing ` heart stay at home be wise ' love 's wisdom sing sometimes my idle heart would sail from out its quiet sheltered bay to tempt a less pacific gale and ocean far away : but ere it shake its foolish wing ` heart stay at home be wise ' love 's wisdom sing sometimes my idle heart would fly mothlike to reach some shine sin it seem so sweet to burn and die that wondrous light within : but ere it burn its foolish wing ` heart stay at home be wise ' love 's wisdom sing home ` we be go home ' i hear two lover say they kiss they friend and bid they bright good-bye i hide the deadly hunger in my eye and lest i might have kill they turn away ah love we too once gambol home as they home from the town with such fair merchandise -- wine and great grape -- the happy lover buy : a little cosy feast to crown the day yes we have once a heaven we call a home its empty room still haunt I like thine eye when the last sunset softly fade there each day i tread each empty haunted room and now and then a little baby cry or laugh a lovely laughter worse to bear love 's landmark the wood we use to walk my love be wood no more but ' villa ' now with sound name -- all name and door the pond where early on in march the yellow cup of water-lily make we glad be now fill up but ah what if they fill or fall each pond each tree what matter it to-day my love to I -- to thee the jerry-builder may consume a greedy moth god 's mantle of the living green i feel no wrath eat up the beauty of the world and gorge he fill on mead and wind country lane and grassy hill i only laugh for now of these i have no care now that to I the fair be foul and foul as fair if after all this life i squander hate the long day that will not bring I either rest or thee this health i hack and ravage as with knife these nerve i fain would shatter and this heart i fain would break -- this heart that traitor-like beat on with foolish and elastic beat : if after all this life i waste and kill should still be thine may still be live for thee and this the dreadful trial of my love this silence and this blank that make I mad that i be man to-day of all the day my one poor hope of meeting thee again -- if death be love and god 's great purpose kind oh love if some day on the heavenly stair a wild ecstatic moment we should stand and i all hungry for you eye and hair should meet instead you great accuse gaze and hear instead of welcome into heaven : ` ah hadst thou but be true but manfully bear the high pang that all high soul must bear nor flee to low nepenthe for you pain hadst say -- be she not here more reason then to live as though still guard by she eye cleaner my thought and purer be my deed true will i be though god himself be false ' oh hadst thou thus be man to-day have we walk on together undivided now -- but now a thousand flaming year must pass and all the trial be go o'er again spirit of sadness she love the autumn i the spring sad all the song she love to sing and in she face be strangely set some great inherit regret some look in all thing make she sigh yea sad to she the morning sky : ` so sad so sad its beauty seem ' -- i hear she say it still in dream but when the day grow gray and old and rise star shine strange and cold then only in she face i
