sic itur ad astra one morning in December the steamer _ tabo _ be laboriously ascend the tortuous course of the pasig carry a large crowd of passenger toward the province of la laguna she be a heavily build steamer almost round like the _ tabú _ from which she derive she name quite dirty in spite of she pretension to whiteness majestic and grave from she leisurely motion altogether she be hold in great affection in that region perhaps from she tagalog name or from the fact that she bear the characteristic impress of thing in the country represent something like a triumph over progress a steamer that be not a steamer at all a organism stolid imperfect yet unimpeachable which when it wish to pose as be rankly progressive proudly contented itself with put on a fresh coat of paint indeed the happy steamer be genuinely filipino if a person be only reasonably considerate she might even have be take for the ship of state construct as she have be under the inspection of _ reverendo _ and _ ilustrísimos _ bath in the sunlight of a morning that make the water of the river sparkle and the breeze rustle in the bend bamboo on its bank there she go with she white silhouette throw out great cloud of smoke -- the ship of state so the joke run also have the vice of smoke the whistle shriek at every moment hoarse and command like a tyrant who would rule by shout so that no one on board can hear he own thought she menace everything she meet : now she look as though she would grind to bit the _ salambaw _ insecure fishing apparatus which in they movement resemble skeleton of giant salute a antediluvian tortoise now she speed straight toward the clump of bamboo or against the amphibian structure _ karihan _ or wayside lunch-stand which amid _ gumamela _ and other flower look like indecisive bather who with they foot already in the water can not bring themselves to make the final plunge at time follow a sort of channel mark out in the river by tree-trunk she move along with a satisfied air except when a sudden shock disturb the passenger and throw they off they balance all the result of a collision with a sand-bar which no one dream be there moreover if the comparison with the ship of state be not yet complete note the arrangement of the passenger on the lower deck appear brown face and black head type of indian -lrb- 1 -rrb- chinese and mestizo wedge in between bale of merchandise and box while there on the upper deck beneath a awning that protect they from the sun be seat in comfortable chair a few passenger dress in the fashion of european friar and government clerk each with he _ puro _ cigar and gaze at the landscape apparently without heed the effort of the captain and the sailor to overcome the obstacle in the river the captain be a man of kindly aspect well along in year a old sailor who in he youth have plunge into far vaster sea but who now in he age have to exercise much greater attention care and vigilance to avoid danger of a trivial character and they be the same for each day : the same sand-bar the same hulk of unwieldy steamer wedge into the same curve like a corpulent dame in a jam throng so at each moment the good man have to stop to back up to go forward at half speed send -- now to port now to starboard -- the five sailor equip with long bamboo pole to give force to the turn the rudder have suggest he be like a veteran who after lead man through hazardous campaign have in he age become the tutor of a capricious disobedient and lazy boy doña victorina the only lady seat in the european group could say whether the _ tabo _ be not lazy disobedient and capricious -- doña victorina who nervous as ever be hurl invective against the casco banka raft of coconut the indian paddle about and even the washerwoman and bather who fret she with they mirth and chatter yes the _ tabo _ would move along very well if there be no indian in the river no indian in the country yes if there be not a single indian in the world -- regardless of the fact that the helmsman be indian the sailor indian indian the engineer indian ninety-nine per cent of the passenger and she herself also a indian if the rouge be scratch off and she pretentious gown remove that morning doña victorina be more irritated than usual because the member of the group take very little notice of she reason for which be not lack for just consider -- there could be find three friar convince that the world would move backwards the very day they should take a single step to the right a indefatigable don custodio who be sleep peacefully satisfy with he project a prolific writer like ben-zayb -lrb- anagram of ibañez -rrb- who believe that the people of manila think because he ben-zayb be a thinker a canon like padre irene who add luster to the clergy with he rubicund face carefully shave from which tower a beautiful jewish nose and he silken cassock of neat cut and small button and a wealthy jeweler like simoun who be repute to be the adviser and inspirer of all the act of he excellency the captain-general -- just consider the presence there of these pillar _ sine quibus non _ of the country seat there in agreeable discourse show little sympathy for a renegade filipina who dye she hair red now be not this enough to exhaust the patience of a female job -- a sobriquet doña victorina always apply to herself when put out with any one the ill-humor of the señora increase every time the captain shout port starboard to the sailor who then hastily seize they pole and thrust they against the bank thus with the strength of they leg and shoulder prevent the steamer from shove its hull ashore at that particular point see under these circumstance the ship of state might be say to have be convert from a tortoise into a crab every time any danger threaten but captain why do not you stupid steersman go in that direction ask the lady with great indignation because it be very shallow in the other señora answer the captain deliberately slowly wink one eye a little habit which he have cultivate as if to say to he word on they way out slowly slowly half speed botheration half speed protest doña victorina disdainfully why not full because we should then be travel over those ricefield señora reply the imperturbable captain purse he lip to indicate the cultivate field and indulge in two circumspect wink this doña victorina be well know in the country for she caprice and extravagance she be often see in society where she be tolerate whenever she appear in the company of she niece paulita gomez a very beautiful and wealthy orphan to whom she be a kind of guardian at a rather advanced age she have marry a poor wretch name don tiburcio de espadaña and at the time we now see she carry upon herself fifteen year of wed life false frizz and a half-european costume -- for she whole ambition have be to europeanize herself with the result that from the ill-omened day of she wedding she have gradually thanks to she criminal attempt succeed in so transform herself that at the present time quatrefage and virchow together could not have tell where to classify she among the known race she husband who have bear all she imposition with the resignation of a fakir through so many year of married life at last on one luckless day have have he bad half-hour and administer to she a superb whack with he crutch the surprise of madam job at such a inconsistency of character make she insensible to the immediate effect and only after she have recover from she astonishment and she husband have flee do she take notice of the pain then remain in bed for several day to the great delight of paulita who be very fond of joke and laugh at she aunt as for she husband horrify at the impiety of what appear to he to be a terrific parricide he take to flight pursue by the matrimonial fury -lrb- two cur and a parrot -rrb- with all the speed he lameness permit climb into the first carriage he encounter jump into the first banka he see on the river and a philippine ulyss begin to wander from town to town from province to province from island to island pursued and persecute by he bespectacled calypso who bore every one that have the misfortune to travel in she company she have receive a report of he be in the province of la laguna conceal in one of the town so thither she be bind to seduce he back with she dye frizz she fellow traveler have take measure of defense by keep up among themselves a lively conversation on any topic whatsoever at that moment the winding and turning of the river lead they to talk about straighten the channel and as a matter of course about the port work ben-zayb the journalist with the countenance of a friar be dispute with a young friar who in turn have the countenance of a artilleryman both be shout gesticulate wave they arm spread out they hand stamp they foot talk of level fish-corral the san mateo river -lrb- 2 -rrb- of casco of indian and so on to the great satisfaction of they listener and the undisguised disgust of a elderly franciscan remarkably thin and withered and a handsome dominican about whose lip flit constantly a scornful smile the thin franciscan understand the dominican 's smile decide to intervene and stop the argument he be undoubtedly respect for with a wave of he hand he cut short the speech of both at the moment when the friar-artilleryman be talk about experience and the journalist-friar about scientist scientist ben-zayb -- do you know what they be ask the franciscan in a hollow voice scarcely stir in he seat and make only a faint gesture with he skinny hand here you have in the province a bridge construct by a brother of ours which be not complete because the scientist rely on they theory condemn it as weak and scarcely safe -- yet look it be the bridge that have withstand all the flood and earthquake -lrb- 3 -rrb- that be it _ puñales _ that very thing that be exactly what i be go to say exclaim the friar-artilleryman thump he fist down on the arm of he bamboo chair that be it that bridge and the scientist that be just what i be go to mention padre salvus -- _ puñales _ ben-zayb remain silent half smile either out of respect or because he really do not know what to reply and yet he be the only thinking head in the philippine padre irene nod he approval as he rub he long nose padre salvi the thin and withered cleric appear to be satisfy with such submissiveness and go on in the midst of the silence : but this do not mean that you may not be as near right as padre camorra -lrb- the friar-artilleryman -rrb- the trouble be in the lake -- the fact be there be not a single decent lake in this country interrupted doña victorina highly indignant and get ready for a return to the assault upon the citadel the besiege gaze at one another in terror but with the promptitude of a general the jeweler simoun rush in to the rescue the remedy be very simple he say in a strange accent a mixture of english and south american and i really do not understand why it have not occur to somebody all turn to give he careful attention even the dominican the jeweler be a tall meager nervous man very dark dress in the english fashion and wear a pith helmet remarkable about he be he long white hair contrast with a sparse black beard indicate a mestizo origin to avoid the glare of the sun he wear constantly a pair of enormous blue goggles which completely hide he eye and a portion of he cheek thus give he the aspect of a blind or weak-sighted person he be stand with he leg apart as if to maintain he balance with he hand thrust into the pocket of he coat the remedy be very simple he repeat and would not cost a cuarto the attention now redouble for it be whisper in manila that this man control the captain-general and all see the remedy in process of execution even don custodio himself turn to listen dig a canal straight from the source to the mouth of the river pass through manila that be make a new river-channel and fill up the old pasig that would save land shorten communication and prevent the formation of sandbar the project leave all he hearer astounded accustom as they be to palliative measure it be a yankee plan observe ben-zayb to ingratiate himself with simoun who have spend a long time in north america all consider the plan wonderful and so indicate by the movement of they head only don custodio the liberal don custodio owe to he independent position and he high office think it he duty to attack a project that do not emanate from himself -- that be a usurpation he cough stroke the end of he mustache and with a voice as important as though he be at a formal session of the ayuntamiento say excuse I señor simoun my respected friend if i should say that i be not of you opinion it would cost a great deal of money and might perhaps destroy some town then destroy they rejoin simoun coldly and the money to pay the laborer do not pay they use the prisoner and convict but there be not enough señor simoun then if there be not enough let all the villager the old man the youth the boy work instead of the fifteen day of obligatory service let they work three four five month for the state with the additional obligation that each one provide he own food and tool the startle don custodio turn he head to see if there be any indian within ear-shot but fortunately those nearby be rustic and the two helmsman seem to be very much occupy with the winding of the river but señor simoun -- do not fool yourself don custodio continue simoun dryly only in this way be great enterprise carry out with small means thus be construct the pyramid lake moeri and the colosseum in rome entire province come in from the desert bring they tuber to feed on old man youth and boy labor in transport stone hew they and carry they on they shoulder under the direction of the official lash and afterwards the survivor return to they home or perish in the sand of the desert then come other province then other succeed one another in the work during year thus the task be finish and now we admire they we travel we go to egypt and to home we extol the pharaoh and the antonine do not fool yourself -- the dead remain dead and might only be consider right by posterity but señor simoun such measure might provoke uprising object don custodio rather uneasy over the turn the affair have take uprising ha ha do the egyptian people ever rebel i wonder do the jewish prisoner rebel against the pious titus man i think you be better inform in history clearly simoun be either very presumptuous or disregard conventionality to say to don custodio 's face that he do not know history it be enough to make any one lose he temper so it seem for don custodio forget himself and retort but the fact be that you be not among egyptian or jew and these people have rebel more than once add the dominican somewhat timidly in the time when they be force to transport heavy timber for the construction of ship if it have not be for the cleric -- those time be far away answer simoun with a laugh even drier than usual these island will never again rebel no matter how much work and tax they have have not you laud to I padre salvus he add turn to the franciscan the house and hospital at lo baños where he excellency be at present padre salvus give a nod and look up evade the question well do not you tell I that both building be construct by force the people to work on they under the whip of a lay-brother perhaps that wonderful bridge be build in the same way now tell I do these people rebel the fact be -- they have rebel before reply the dominican and _ ab actu ad posse valet illatio _ no no nothing of the kind continue simoun start down a hatchway to the cabin what be say be say and you padre sibylum do not talk either latin or nonsense what be you friars good for if the people can rebel take no notice of the reply and protest simoun descend the small companionway that lead below repeat disdainfully bosh bosh padre sibylum turn pale this be the first time that he vice-rector of the university have ever be credit with nonsense don custodio turn green at no meeting in which he have ever find himself have he encounter such a adversary a american mulatto he fume a british indian observe ben-zayb in a low tone a american i tell you and should not i know retort don custodio in ill-humor he excellency have tell I so he be a jeweler whom the latter know in havana and as i suspect the one who get he advancement by lend he money so to repay he he have have he come here to let he have a chance and increase he fortune by sell diamond -- imitation who know and he so ungrateful that after get money from the indian he wish -- huh the sentence be conclude by a significant wave of the hand no one dare to join in this diatribe don custodio could discredit himself with he excellency if he wish but neither ben-zayb nor padre irene nor padre salvus nor the offended padre sibylum have any confidence in the discretion of the other the fact be that this man be a american think no doubt that we be deal with the redskin to talk of these matter on a steamer compel force the people and he be the very person who advise the expedition to the caroline and the campaign in mindanao which be go to bring we to disgraceful ruin he be the one who have offer to superintend the building of the cruiser and i say what do a jeweler no matter how rich and learn he may be know about naval construction all this be speak by don custodio in a guttural tone to he neighbor ben-zayb while he gesticulate shrug he shoulder and from time to time with he look consult the other who be nod they head ambiguously the canon irene indulge in a rather equivocal smile which he half hide with he hand as he rub he nose i tell you ben-zayb continue don custodio slapping the journalist on the arm all the trouble come from not consult the old-timer here a project in fine word and especially with a big appropriation with a appropriation in round number dazzle meet with acceptance at once for this here in further explanation he rub the tip of he thumb against he middle and forefinger -lrb- 4 -rrb- there be something in that there be something in that ben-zayb think it he duty to remark since in he capacity of journalist he have to be inform about everything now look here before the port work i present a project original simple useful economical and practicable for clear away the bar in the lake and it have not be accept because there be not any of that in it he repeat the movement of he finger shrug he shoulder and gaze at the other as though to say have you ever hear of such a misfortune may we know what it be ask several draw nearer and give he they attention the project of don custodio be as renowned as quack ' specifics don custodio be on the point of refuse to explain it from resentment at not have find any supporter in he diatribe against simoun when there be no danger you want I to talk eh and when there be you keep quiet he be go to say but that would cause the loss of a good opportunity and he project now that it could not be carry out might at least be know and admire after blow out two or three puff of smoke cough and spit through a scupper he slap ben-zayb on the thigh and ask you have see duck i rather think so -- we have hunt they on the lake answer the surprised journalist no i be not talk about wild duck i be talk of the domestic one of those that be raise in patero and pasig do you know what they feed on ben-zayb the only thinking head do not know -- he be not engage in that business on snail man on snail exclaim padre camorra one do not have to be a indian to know that it be sufficient to have eye exactly so on snail repeat don custodio flourish he forefinger and do you know where they get they again the think head do not know well if you have be in the country as many year as i have you would know that they fish they out of the bar itself where they abound mixed with the sand then you project well i be come to that my idea be to compel all the town round about near the bar to raise duck and you 'll see how they all by themselves will deepen the channel by fishing for the snail -- no more and no less no more and no less here don custodio extend he arm and gaze triumphantly at the stupefaction of he hearer -- to none of they have occur such a original idea will you allow I to write a article about that ask ben-zayb in this country there be so little thinking do -- but don custodio exclaim doña victorina with smirk and grimace if everybody take to raise duck the _ balot _ -lrb- 5 -rrb- egg will become abundant ugh how nasty rather let the bar close up entirely chapter ii on the lower deck there below other scene be be enact seat on bench or small wooden stool among valise box and basket a few foot from the engine in the heat of the boiler amid the human smell and the pestilential odor of oil be to be see the great majority of the passenger some be silently gaze at the change scene along the bank other be play card or converse in the midst of the scrape of shovel the roar of the engine the hiss of escape steam the swash of disturbed water and the shriek of the whistle in one corner heap up like corpse sleep or try to sleep a number of chinese pedler seasick pale froth through half-opened lip and bath in they copious perspiration only a few youth student for the most part easily recognizable from they white garment and they confident bearing make bold to move about from stern to bow leap over basket and box happy in the prospect of the approach vacation now they comment on the movement of the engine endeavor to recall forget notion of physics now they surround the young schoolgirl or the red-lipped _ buyera _ with she collar of _ sampaguita _ whisper into they ear word that make they smile and cover they face with they fan nevertheless two of they instead of engage in these fleeting gallantry stand in the bow talk with a man advance in year but still vigorous and erect both these youth seem to be well know and respect to judge from the deference show they by they fellow passenger the elder who be dress in complete black be the medical student basilio famous for he successful cure and extraordinary treatment while the other taller and more robust although much younger be isagani one of the poet or at least rimester who that year come from the ateneo -lrb- 6 -rrb- a curious character ordinarily quite taciturn and uncommunicative the man talk with they be the rich capitan basilio who be return from a business trip to manila capitan tiago be get along about the same as usual yes sir say the student basilio shake he head he will not submit to any treatment at the advice of _ a certain person _ he be send I to san diego under the pretext of look after he property but in reality so that he may be leave to smoke he opium with complete liberty when the student say _ a certain person _ he really mean padre irene a great friend and adviser of capitan tiago in he last day opium be one of the plague of modern time reply the capitan with the disdain and indignation of a roman senator the ancient know about it but never abuse it while the addiction to classical study last -- mark this well young man -- opium be use solely as a medicine and besides tell I who smoke it the most -- chinamen chinaman who do not understand a word of latin ah if capitan tiago have only devoted himself to cicero -- here the most classical disgust paint itself on he carefully-shaven epicurean face isaganus regard he with attention : that gentleman be suffer from nostalgia for antiquity but to get back to this academy of castilian capitan basilio continue i assure you gentleman that you will not materialize it yes sir from day to day we be expect the permit reply isagani padre irene whom you may have notice above and to whom we have present a team of bay have promise it to we he be on he way now to confer with the general that do not matter padre sibylum be oppose to it let he oppose it that be why he be here on the steamer in order to -- at lo baños before the general and the student basilio fill out he meaning by go through the pantomime of striking he fist together that be understand observe capitan basilio smile but even though you get the permit where 'll you get the fund we have they sir each student have contribute a real but what about the professor we have they : half filipino and half peninsular -lrb- 7 -rrb- and the house makaraig the wealthy makaraig have offer one of he capitan basilio have to give in these young man have everything arrange for the rest he say with a shrug of he shoulder it be not altogether bad it be not a bad idea and now that you can not know latin at least you may know castilian here you have another instance namesake of how we be go backwards in we time we learn latin because we book be in latin now you study latin a little but have no latin book on the other hand you book be in castilian and that language be not teach -- _ aeta parentum pejor avi tulit no nequiore _ as horace say with this quotation he move away majestically like a roman emperor the youth smile at each other these man of the past remark isaganus find obstacle for everything propose a thing to they and instead of see its advantage they only fix they attention on the difficulty they want everything to come smooth and round as a billiard ball he be right at home with you uncle observe basilio they talk of past time but listen -- speaking of uncle what do yours say about paulita isaganus blush he preach I a sermon about the choosing of a wife i answer he that there be not in manila another like she -- beautiful well-bred a orphan -- very wealthy elegant charming with no defect other than a ridiculous aunt add basilio at which both smile in regard to the aunt do you know that she have charge I to look for she husband doña victorina and you have promise in order to keep you sweetheart naturally but the fact be that she husband be actually hide -- in my uncle 's house both burst into a laugh at this while isaganus continue : that be why my uncle be a conscientious man will not go on the upper deck fearful that doña victorina will ask he about don tiburcio just imagine when doña victorina learn that i be a steerage passenger she gaze at I with a disdain that -- at that moment simoun come down and catch sight of the two young man greet basilio in a patronize tone : hello don basilio you be off for the vacation be the gentleman a townsman of yours basilio introduce isaganus with the remark that he be not a townsman but that they home be not very far apart isagani live on the seashore of the opposite coast simoun examine he with such marked attention that he be annoyed turn squarely around and face the jeweler with a provoke stare well what be the province like the latter ask turn again to basilio why be not you familiar with it how the devil be i to know it when i have never set foot in it i have be tell that it be very poor and do not buy jewel we do not buy jewel because we do not need they rejoin isagani dryly pique in he provincial pride a smile play over simoun 's pallid lip do not be offend young man he reply i have no bad intention but as i have be assure that nearly all the money be in the hand of the native priest i say to myself : the friar be die for curacy and the franciscan be satisfy with the poorest so when they give they up to the native priest the truth must be that the king 's profile be unknown there but enough of that come and have a beer with I and we 'll drink to the prosperity of you province the youth thank he but decline the offer you do wrong simoun say to they visibly take aback beer be a good thing and i hear padre camorra say this morning that the lack of energy noticeable in this country be due to the great amount of water the inhabitant drink isaganus be almost as tall as the jeweler and at this he draw himself up then tell padre camorra basilio hasten to say while he nudge isagani slyly tell he that if he would drink water instead of wine or beer perhaps we might all be the gainer and he would not give rise to so much talk and tell he also add isaganus pay no attention to he friend 's nudge that water be very mild and can be drunk but that it drown out the wine and beer and put out the fire that heat it become steam and that ruffle it be the ocean that it once destroy mankind and make the earth tremble to its foundation -lrb- 8 -rrb- simoun raise he head although he look could not be read through the blue goggles on the rest of he face surprise might be see rather a good answer he say but i fear that he might get facetious and ask I when the water will be convert into steam and when into a ocean padre camorra be rather incredulous and be a great wag when the fire heat it when the rivulet that be now scatter through the steep valley force by fatality rush together in the abyss that man be digging reply isaganus no señor simoun interpose basilio change to a jest tone rather keep in mind the verse of my friend isaganus himself : ` fire you you say and water we then as you wish so let it be but let we live in peace and right nor shall the fire e'er see we fight so join by wisdom 's glowing flame that without anger hate or blame we form the steam the fifth element progress and light life and movement ' utopia utopia respond simoun dryly the engine be about to meet -- in the meantime i 'll drink my beer so without any word of excuse he leave the two friend but what be the matter with you today that you be so quarrelsome ask basilio nothing i do not know why but that man fill I with horror fear almost i be nudge you with my elbow do not you know that he be call the brown cardinal the brown cardinal or black eminence as you wish i do not understand richelieu have a capuchin adviser who be call the gray eminence well that be what this man be to the general really that be what i have hear from _ a certain person _ -- who always speak ill of he behind he back and flatter he to he face do he also visit capitan tiago from the first day after he arrival and i be sure that _ a certain person _ look upon he as a rival -- in the inheritance i believe that he be go to see the general about the question of instruction in castilian at that moment isaganus be call away by a servant to he uncle on one of the bench at the stern huddle in among the other passenger sit a native priest gaze at the landscape that be successively unfold to he view he neighbor make room for he the man on pass take off they hat and the gambler not daring to set they table near where he be he say little but neither smoke nor assume arrogant air nor do he disdain to mingle with the other man return the salute with courtesy and affability as if he feel much honor and very grateful although advance in year with hair almost completely gray he appear to be in vigorous health and even when seat hold he body straight and he head erect but without pride or arrogance he differ from the ordinary native priest few enough indeed who at that period serve merely as coadjutor or administer some curacy temporarily in a certain self-possession and gravity like one who be conscious of he personal dignity and the sacredness of he office a superficial examination of he appearance if not he white hair reveal at once that he belong to another epoch another generation when the better young man be not afraid to risk they dignity by become priest when the native clergy look any friar at all in the face and when they class not yet degrade and vilify call for free man and not slave superior intelligence and not servile will in he sad and serious feature be to be read the serenity of a soul fortify by study and meditation perhaps try out by deep moral suffering this priest be padre florentino isaganus 's uncle and he story be easily tell scion of a wealthy and influential family of manila of agreeable appearance and cheerful disposition suit to shine in the world he have never feel any call to the sacerdotal profession but by reason of some promise or vow he mother after not a few struggle and violent dispute compel he to enter the seminary she be a great friend of the archbishop have a will of iron and be as inexorable as be every devout woman who believe that she be interpret the will of god vainly the young florentine offer resistance vainly he beg vainly he plead he love affair even provoke scandal : priest he have to become at twenty-five year of age and priest he become the archbishop ordain he he first mass be celebrate with great pomp three day be give over to feast and he mother die happy and content leave he all she fortune but in that struggle florentine receive a wound from which he never recover week before he first mass the woman he love in desperation marry a nobody -- a blow the rudest he have ever experience he lose he moral energy life become dull and insupportable if not he virtue and the respect for he office that unfortunate love affair save he from the depths into which the regular order and secular clergyman both fall in the philippine he devote himself to he parishioner as a duty and by inclination to the natural science when the event of seventy-two occur -lrb- 9 -rrb- he fear that the large income he curacy yield he would attract attention to he so desire peace above everything he seek and secure he release live thereafter as a private individual on he patrimonial estate situate on the pacific coast he there adopt he nephew isaganus who be report by the malicious to be he own son by he old sweetheart when she become a widow and by the more serious and better inform the natural child of a cousin a lady in manila the captain of the steamer catch sight of the old priest and insist that he go to the upper deck say if you do not do so the friar will think that you do not want to associate with they padre florentino have no recourse but to accept so he summon he nephew in order to let he know where he be go and to charge he not to come near the upper deck while he be there if the captain notice you he 'll invite you also and we should then be abuse he kindness my uncle 's way think isaganus all so that i will not have any reason for talk with doña victorina chapter iii legend ich weiss nicht be soil e bedeuten dass ich so traurig bin when padre florentino join the group above the bad humor provoke by the previous discussion have entirely disappear perhaps they spirit have be raise by the attractive house of the town of pasig or the glass of sherry they have drunk in preparation for the come meal or the prospect of a good breakfast whatever the cause the fact be that they be all laugh and joke even include the lean franciscan although he make little noise and he smile look like death-grin evil time evil time say padre sibylum with a laugh get out do not say that vice-rector respond the canon irene give the other 's chair a shove in hongkong you be do a fine business put up every building that -- ha ha tut tut be the reply you do not see we expense and the tenant on we estate be begin to complain -- here enough of complaint _ puñales _ else i 'll fall to weep cry padre camorra gleefully we be not complain and we have not either estate or banking-house you know that my indian be begin to haggle over the fee and to flash schedule on I just look how they cite schedule to I now and none other than those of the archbishop basilio sancho -lrb- 10 -rrb- as if from he time up to now price have not rise ha ha ha why should a baptism cost less than a chicken but i play the deaf man collect what i can and never complain we be not avaricious be we padre salvus at that moment simoun 's head appear above the hatchway well where have you be keep yourself don custodio call to he have forget all about they dispute you be miss the prettiest part of the trip pshaw retort simoun as he ascend i have see so many river and landscape that i be only interested in those that call up legend as for legend the pasig have a few observe the captain who do not relish any depreciation of the river where he navigate and earn he livelihood here you have that of _ malapad-na-bato _ a rock sacred before the come of the spaniard as the abode of spirit afterwards when the superstition have be dissipate and the rock profane it be convert into a nest of tulisane since from its crest they easily capture the luckless banka which have to contend against both the current and man later in we time in spite of human interference there be still tell story about wreck banka and if on round it i do not steer with my six sens i would be smash against its side then you have another legend that of doña jeronima 's cave which padre florentino can relate to you everybody know that remark padre sibylum disdainfully but neither simoun nor ben-zayb nor padre irene nor padre camorra know it so they beg for the story some in jest and other from genuine curiosity the priest adopt the tone of burlesque with which some have make they request begin like a old tutor relate a story to child once upon a time there be a student who have make a promise of marriage to a young woman in he country but it seem that he fail to remember she she wait for he faithfully year after year she youth pass she grow into middle age and then one day she hear a report that she old sweetheart be the archbishop of manila disguise herself as a man she come round the cape and present herself before he grace demand the fulfilment of he promise what she ask be of course impossible so the archbishop order the preparation of the cave that you may have notice with its entrance cover and decorate with a curtain of vine there she live and die and there she be bury the legend state that doña jeronima be so fat that she have to turn sidewise to get into it she fame as a enchantress spring from she custom of throw into the river the silver dish which she use in the sumptuous banquet that be attend by crowd of gentleman a net be spread under the water to hold the dish and thus they be clean it have not be twenty year since the river wash the very entrance of the cave but it have gradually be recede just as the memory of she be die out among the people a beautiful legend exclaim ben-zayb i be go to write a article about it it be sentimental doña victorina thought of dwelling in such a cave and be about to say so when simoun take the floor instead but what be you opinion about that padre salvus he ask the franciscan who seem to be absorb in thought do not it seem to you as though he grace instead of give she a cave ought to have place she in a nunnery -- in st clara 's for example what do you say there be a start of surprise on padre sibylum 's part to notice that padre salvus shudder and look askance at simoun because it be not a very gallant act continue simoun quite naturally to give a rocky cliff as a home to one with whose hope we have trifle it be hardly religious to expose she thus to temptation in a cave on the bank of a river -- it smack of nymph and dryad it would have be more gallant more pious more romantic more in keep with the custom of this country to shut she up in st clara 's like a new eloise in order to visit and console she from time to time i neither can nor should pass judgment upon the conduct of archbishop reply the franciscan sourly but you who be the ecclesiastical governor act in the place of we archbishop what would you do if such a case should arise padre salvus shrug he shoulder and calmly respond it be not worth while think about what can not happen but speak of legend do not overlook the most beautiful since it be the truest : that of the miracle of st nichola the ruin of whose church you may have notice i be go to relate it to señor simoun as he probably have not hear it it seem that formerly the river as well as the lake be infested with cayman so huge and voracious that they attack banka and upset they with a slap of the tail we chronicle relate that one day a infidel chinaman who up to that time have refuse to be convert be pass in front of the church when suddenly the devil present himself to he in the form of a cayman and upset the banka in order to devour he and carry he off to hell inspire by god the chinaman at that moment call upon st nichola and instantly the cayman be change into a stone the old people say that in they time the monster could easily be recognize in the piece of stone that be leave and for my part i can assure you that i have clearly make out the head to judge from which the monster must have be enormously large marvelous a marvelous legend exclaim ben-zayb it be good for a article -- the description of the monster the terror of the chinaman the water of the river the bamboo brake also it 'll do for a study of comparative religion because look you a infidel chinaman in great distress invoke exactly the saint that he must know only by hearsay and in whom he do not believe here there be no room for the proverb that ' a known evil be preferable to a unknown good ' if i should find myself in china and get catch in such a difficulty i would invoke the obscurest saint in the calendar before confucius or buddha whether this be due to the manifest superiority of catholicism or to the inconsequential and illogical inconsistency in the brain of the yellow race a profound study of anthropology alone will be able to elucidate ben-zayb have adopt the tone of a lecturer and be describe circle in the air with he forefinger pride himself on he imagination which from the most insignificant fact could deduce so many application and inference but notice that simoun be preoccupy and think that he be ponder over what he ben-zayb have just say he inquire what the jeweler be meditate about about two very important question answer simoun two question that you might add to you article first what may have become of the devil on see himself suddenly confine within a stone do he escape do he stay there be he crush second if the petrified animal that i have see in various european museum may not have be the victim of some antediluvian saint the tone in which the jeweler speak be so serious while he rest he forehead on the tip of he forefinger in a attitude of deep meditation that padre camorra respond very gravely who know who know since we be busy with legend and be now enter the lake remark padre sibylum the captain must know many -- at that moment the steamer cross the bar and the panorama spread out before they eye be so truly magnificent that all be impress in front extend the beautiful lake border by green shore and blue mountain like a huge mirror frame in emerald and sapphire reflect the sky in its glass on the right be spread out the low shore form bay with graceful curve and dim there in the distance the crag of sungay while in the background rise makile impose and majestic crown with fleecy cloud on the left lay talim island with its curious sweep of hill a fresh breeze ripple over the wide plain of water by the way captain say ben-zayb turn around do you know in what part of the lake a certain guevara navarra or ibarra be kill the group look toward the captain with the exception of simoun who have turn away he head as though to look for something on the shore ah yes exclaim doña victorina where captain do he leave any track in the water the good captain wink several time a indication that he be annoyed but read the request in the eye of all take a few step toward the bow and scan the shore look over there he say in a scarcely audible voice after make sure that no stranger be near accord to the officer who conduct the pursuit ibarra upon finding himself surround jump out of he banka there near the kinabutasan -lrb- 11 -rrb- and swimming under water cover all that distance of more than two mile salute by bullet every time that he raise he head to breathe over yonder be where they lose track of he and a little farther on near the shore they discover something like the color of blood and now i think of it it be just thirteen year day for day since this happen so that he corpse -- begin ben-zayb go to join he father 's reply padre sibylum be not he also another filibuster padre salvus that be what might be call cheap funeral padre camorra eh remark ben-zayb i have always say that those who will not pay for expensive funeral be filibuster rejoin the person address with a merry laugh but what be the matter with you señor simoun inquire ben-zayb see that the jeweler be motionless and thoughtful be you seasick -- a old traveler like you on such a drop of water as this i want to tell you break in the captain who have come to hold all those place in great affection that you can not call this a drop of water it be larger than any lake in switzerland and all those in spain put together i have see old sailor who get seasick here chapter iv cabesang tale those who have read the first part of this story will perhaps remember a old wood-cutter who live in the depths of the forest -lrb- 12 -rrb- tandang selo be still alive and though he hair have turn completely white he yet preserve he good health he no longer hunt or cut firewood for he fortune have improve and he work only at make broom he son tale -lrb- abbreviation of telesforo -rrb- have work at first on share on the land of a capitalist but later have become the owner of two carabao and several hundred peso determine to work on he own account aid by he father he wife and he three child so they cut down and clear away some thick wood which be situate on the border of the town and which they believe belong to no one during the labor of cleaning and cultivate the new land the whole family fall ill with malaria and the mother die along with the eldest daughter lucium in the flower of she age this which be the natural consequence of break up new soil infested with various kind of bacterium they attribute to the anger of the woodland spirit so they be resign and go on with they labor believe he pacify but when they begin to harvest they first crop a religious corporation which own land in the neighboring town lay claim to the field allege that they fall within they boundary and to prove it they at once start to set up they mark however the administrator of the religious order leave to they for humanity 's sake the usufruct of the land on condition that they pay a small sum annually -- a mere bagatelle twenty or thirty peso tale as peaceful a man as could be find be as much oppose to lawsuit as any one and more submissive to the friar than most people so in order not to smash a _ palyok _ against a _ kawali _ -lrb- as he say for to he the friar be iron pot and he a clay jar -rrb- he have the weakness to yield to they claim remember that he do not know spanish and have no money to pay lawyer besides tandang selo say to he patience you would spend more in one year of litigation than in ten year of pay what the white padre demand and perhaps they 'll pay you back in mass pretend that those thirty peso have be lose in gambling or have fall into the water and be swallow by a cayman the harvest be abundant and sell well so tale plan to build a wooden house in the barrio of sagpang of the town of tianus which adjoin san diego another year pass bring another good crop and for this reason the friar raise the rent to fifty peso which tale pay in order not to quarrel and because he expect to sell he sugar at a good price patience pretend that the cayman have grow some old selo console he that year he at last see he dream realize : to live in the barrio of sagpang in a wooden house the father and grandfather then think of provide some education for the two child especially the daughter juliana or julus as they call she for she give promise of be accomplish and beautiful a boy who be a friend of the family basilio be study in manila and he be of as lowly origin as they but this dream seem destine not to be realize the first care the community take when they see the family prosper be to appoint as cabeza de barangay its most industrious member which leave only tano the son who be only fourteen year old the father be therefore call _ cabesang _ tale and have to order a sack coat buy a feel hat and prepare to spend he money in order to avoid any quarrel with the curate or the government he settle from he own pocket the shortage in the tax-list pay for those who have die or move away and he lose considerable time in make the collection and on he trip to the capital patience pretend that the cayman 's relative have join he advise tandang selo smile placidly next year you 'll put on a long skirt and go to manila to study like the young lady of the town cabesang tale tell he daughter every time he hear she talking of basilio 's progress but that next year do not come and in its stead there be another increase in the rent cabesang tale become serious and scratch he head the clay jar be give up all its rice to the iron pot when the rent have rise to two hundred peso tale be not content with scratch he head and sigh he murmur and protest the friar-administrator then tell he that if he could not pay some one else would be assign to cultivate that land -- many who desire it have offer themselves he think at first that the friar be joke but the friar be talk seriously and indicate a servant of he to take possession of the land poor tale turn pale he feel a buzz in he ear he see in the red mist that rise before he eye he wife and daughter pallid emaciated die victim of the intermittent fever -- then he see the thick forest convert into productive field he see the stream of sweat water its furrow he see himself plow under the hot sun bruise he foot against the stone and root while this friar have be drive about in he carriage with the wretch who be to get the land follow like a slave behind he master no a thousand time no first let the field sink into the depths of the earth and bury they all who be this intruder that he should have any right to he land have he bring from he own country a single handful of that soil have he crooked a single one of he finger to pull up the root that run through it exasperate by the threat of the friar who try to uphold he authority at any cost in the presence of the other tenant cabesang tale rebel and refuse to pay a single cuarto have ever before himself that red mist say that he would give up he field to the first man who could irrigate it with blood draw from he own vein old selo on look at he son 's face do not dare to mention the cayman but try to calm he by talk of clay jar remind he that the winner in a lawsuit be leave without a shirt to he back we shall all be turn to clay father and without shirt we be bear be the reply so he resolutely refuse to pay or to give up a single span of he land unless the friar should first prove the legality of they claim by exhibit a title-deed of some kind as they have none a lawsuit follow and cabesang tale enter into it confide that some at least if not all be lover of justice and respecter of the law i serve and have be serve the king with my money and my service he say to those who remonstrate with he i be ask for justice and he be oblige to give it to I draw on by fatality and as if he have put into play in the lawsuit the whole future of himself and he child he go on spend he savings to pay lawyer notary and solicitor not to mention the official and clerk who exploit he ignorance and he need he move to and fro between the village and the capital pass he day without eat and he night without sleep while he talk be always about briefs exhibit and appeal there be then see a struggle such as be never before carry on under the sky of the philippine : that of a poor indian ignorant and friendless confide in the justness and righteousness of he cause fight against a powerful corporation before which justice bow she head while the judge let fall the scale and surrender the sword he fight as tenaciously as the ant which bite when it know that it be go to be crush as do the fly which look into space only through a pane of glass yet the clay jar defy the iron pot and smash itself into a thousand piece bad in it something impressive -- it have the sublimeness of desperation on the day when he journey leave he free he patrol he field arm with a shotgun say that the tulisane be hover around and he have need of defend himself in order not to fall into they hand and thus lose he lawsuit as if to improve he marksmanship he shoot at bird and fruit even the butterfly with such accurate aim that the friar-administrator do not dare to go to sagpang without a escort of civil-guard while the friar 's hireling who gaze from afar at the threatening figure of tale wander over the field like a sentinel upon the wall be terror stricken and refuse to take the property away from he but the local judge and those at the capital warn by the experience of one of they number who have be summarily dismiss dare not give he the decision fear they own dismissal yet they be not really bad man those judge they be upright and conscientious good citizen excellent father dutiful son -- and they be able to appreciate poor tale ' situation better than tale himself could many of they be verse in the scientific and historical basis of property they know that the friar by they own statute could not own property but they also know that to come from far across the sea with a appointment secure with great difficulty to undertake the duty of the position with the best intention and now to lose it because a indian fancy that justice have to be do on earth as in heaven -- that surely be a idea they have they family and greater need surely than that indian : one have a mother to provide for and what duty be more sacred than that of care for a mother another have sister all of marriageable age that other there have many little child who expect they daily bread and who like fledgling in a nest would surely die of hunger the day he be out of a job even the very least of they have there far away a wife who would be in distress if the monthly remittance fail all these moral and conscientious judge try everything in they power in the way of counsel advise cabesang tale to pay the rent demand but tale like all simple soul once he have see what be just go straight toward it he demand proof document papers title-deed but the friar have none of these rest they case on he concession in the past cabesang tale ' constant reply be : if every day i give alms to a beggar to escape annoyance who will oblige I to continue my gift if he abuse my generosity from this stand no one could draw he nor be there any threat that could intimidate he in vain governor m -- make a trip expressly to talk to he and frighten he he reply to it all be : you may do what you like mr governor i be ignorant and powerless but i have cultivate those field my wife and daughter die while help I clear they and i will not give they up to any one but he who can do more with they than i have do let he first irrigate they with he blood and bury in they he wife and daughter the upshot of this obstinacy be that the honorable judge give the decision to the friar and everybody laugh at he say that lawsuit be not win by justice but cabesang tale appeal load he shotgun and patrol he field with deliberation during this period he life seem to be a wild dream he son tano a youth as tall as he father and as good as he sister be conscript but he let the boy go rather than purchase a substitute i have to pay the lawyer he tell he weep daughter if i win the case i 'll find a way to get he back and if i lose it i will not have any need for son so the son go away and nothing more be hear of he except that he hair have be crop and that he sleep under a cart six month later it be rumor that he have be see embark for the caroline another report be that he have be see in the uniform of the civil guard tano in the civil guard _ ` susmariosep _ exclaim several clasp they hand tano who be so good and so honest _ requimternam _ the grandfather go many day without speak to the father julus fall sick but cabesang tale do not shed a single tear although for two day he never leave the house as if he fear the look of reproach from the whole village or that he would be call the executioner of he son but on the third day he again sally forth with he shotgun murderous intention be attribute to he and there be well-meaning person who whisper about that he have be hear to threaten that he would bury the friar-administrator in the furrow of he field whereat the friar be frighten at he in earnest as a result of this there come a decree from the captain-general forbid the use of firearm and order that they be take up cabesang tale have to hand over he shotgun but he continue he round arm with a long bolo what be you go to do with that bolo when the tulisane have firearm old selo ask he i must watch my crop be the answer every stalk of cane grow there be one of my wife 's bone the bolo be take up on the pretext that it be too long he then take he father 's old ax and with it on he shoulder continue he sullen round every time he leave the house tandang selo and julus tremble for he life the latter would get up from she loom go to the window pray make vow to the saint and recite novena the grandfather be at time unable to finish the handle of a broom and talk of return to the forest -- life in that house be unbearable at last they fear be realize as the field be some distance from the village cabesang tale in spite of he ax fall into the hand of tulisane who have revolver and rifle they tell he that since he have money to pay judge and lawyer he must have some also for the outcast and the hunt they therefore demand a ransom of five hundred peso through the medium of a rustic with the warning that if anything happen to they messenger the captive would pay for it with he life two day of grace be allow this news throw the poor family into the wildest terror which be augment when they learn that the civil guard be go out in pursuit of the bandit in case of a encounter the first victim would be the captive -- this they all know the old man be paralyze while the pale and frightened daughter try often to talk but could not still another think more terrible a idea more cruel rouse they from they stupor the rustic send by the tulisane say that the band would probably have to move on and if they be slow in send the ransom the two day would elapse and cabesang tale would have he throat cut this drive those two being to madness weak and powerless as they be tandang selo get up sit down go outside come back again know not where to go where to seek aid julus appeal to she image count and recount she money but she two hundred peso do not increase or multiply soon she dress herself gather together all she jewel and ask the advice of she grandfather if she should go to see the gobernadorcillo the judge the notary the lieutenant of the civil guard the old man say yes to everything or when she say no he too say no at length come the neighbor they relative and friend some poorer than other in they simplicity magnify the fear the most active of all be sister balus a great _ panguinguera _ who have be to manila to practice religious exercise in the nunnery of the sodality julus be willing to sell all she jewel except a locket set with diamond and emerald which basilio have give she for this locket have a history : a nun the daughter of capitan tiago have give it to a leper who in return for professional treatment have make a present of it to basilio so she could not sell it without first consult he quickly the shell-comb and earring be sell as well as julus 's rosary to they richest neighbor and thus fifty peso be add but two hundred and fifty be still lack the locket might be pawn but julus shake she head a neighbor suggest that the house be sell and tandang selo approve the idea satisfy to return to the forest and cut firewood as of old but sister balus observe that this could not be do because the owner be not present the judge 's wife once sell I she _ tapi _ for a peso but she husband say that the sale do not hold because it have not receive he approval _ abá _ he take back the _ tapi _ and she have not return the peso yet but i do not pay she when she win at _ panguinguus abá _ in that way i have collect twelve cuarto and for that alone i be go to play with she i can not bear to have people fail to pay what they owe I _ abá _ another neighbor be go to ask sister balus why then do not she settle a little account with she but the quick _ panguinguera _ suspect this and add at once : do you know julus what you can do borrow two hundred and fifty peso on the house payable when the lawsuit be win this seem to be the best proposition so they decide to act upon it that same day sister balus offer to accompany she and together they visit the house of all the rich folk in tianus but no one would accept the proposal the case they say be already lose and to show favor to a enemy of the friar be to expose themselves to they vengeance at last a pious woman take pity on the girl and lend the money on condition that julus should remain with she as a servant until the debt be pay julus would not have so very much to do : sew pray accompany she to mass and fast for she now and then the girl accept with tear in she eye receive the money and promise to enter she service on the follow day christmas when the grandfather hear of that sale he fall to weep like a child what that granddaughter whom he have not allow to walk in the sun lest she skin should be burn julus she of the delicate finger and rosy foot what that girl the prettiest in the village and perhaps in the whole town before whose window many gallant have vainly pass the night play and sing what he only granddaughter the sole joy of he fading eye she whom he have dream of see dress in a long skirt talk spanish and hold herself erect wave a paint fan like the daughter of the wealthy -- she to become a servant to be scold and reprimand to ruin she finger to sleep anywhere to rise in any manner whatsoever so the old grandfather weep and talk of hang or starve himself to death if you go he declare i be go back to the forest and will never set foot in the town julus soothe he by say that it be necessary for she father to return that the suit would be win and they could then ransom she from she servitude the night be a sad one neither of the two could taste a bite and the old man refuse to lie down pass the whole night seat in a corner silent and motionless julus on she part try to sleep but for a long time could not close she eye somewhat relieved about she father 's fate she now think of herself and fall to weep but stifle she sob so that the old man might not hear they the next day she would be a servant and it be the very day basilio be accustom to come from manila with present for she henceforward she would have to give up that love basilio who be go to be a doctor could not marry a pauper in fancy she see he go to the church in company with the prettiest and richest girl in the town both well-dressed happy and smile while she juli follow she mistress carry novena buyo and the cuspidor here the girl feel a lump rise in she throat a sinking at she heart and beg the virgin to let she die first but -- say she conscience -- he will at least know that i prefer to pawn myself rather than the locket he give I this think console she a little and bring on empty dream who know but that a miracle might happen she might find the two hundred and fifty peso under the image of the virgin -- she have read of many similar miracle the sun might not rise nor morning come and meanwhile the suit would be win she father might return or basilio put in he appearance she might find a bag of gold in the garden the tulisane would send the bag of gold the curate padre camorra who be always tease she would come with the tulisane so she idea become more and more confuse until at length wear out by fatigue and sorrow she go to sleep with dream of she childhood in the depths of the forest : she be bathing in the torrent along with she two brother there be little fish of all color that let themselves be catch like fool and she become impatient because she find no pleasure in catchnig such foolish little fish basilio be under the water but basilio for some reason have the face of she brother tano she new mistress be watch they from the bank chapter v a cochero 's christmas eve basilio reach san diego just as the christmas eve procession be pass through the street he have be delay on the road for several hour because the cochero have forget he cedulum be hold up by the civil guard have he memory jog by a few blow from a rifle-butt and afterwards be take before the commandant now the carroma be again detain to let the procession pass while the abused cochero take off he hat reverently and recite a paternoster to the first image that come along which seem to be that of a great saint it be the figure of a old man with a exceptionally long beard seat at the edge of a grave under a tree fill with all kind of stuff bird a _ kalan _ with a clay jar a mortar and a _ kalikut _ for mash buyo be he only utensil as if to indicate that he live on the border of the tomb and be do he cooking there this be the methuselah of the religious iconography of the philippine he colleague and perhaps contemporary be call in europe santa claus and be still more smile and agreeable in the time of the saint

disappear each year as if they have be attack by the pest like the living animal he the abused sinong remember he two magnificent horse which at the advice of the curate he have cause to be bless to save they from plague spending therefor ten peso -- for neither the government nor the curate have find any better remedy for the epizootic -- and they have die after all yet he console himself by remember also that after the shower of holy water the latin phrase of the padre and the ceremony the horse have become so vain and self-important that they would not even allow he sinong a good christian to put they in harness and he have not dare to whip they because a tertiary sister have say that they be _ sanctify _ the procession be close by the virgin dress as the divine shepherd with a pilgrim 's hat of wide brim and long plume to indicate the journey to jerusalem that the birth might be make more explicable the curate have order she figure to be stuff with rag and cotton under

star surround by hoop with long streamer which produce a pleasant murmur when shake by the wind and fish of movable head and tail have a glass of oil inside suspend from the eaves of the window in the delightful fashion of a happy and homelike fiesta but he also notice that the light be flicker that the star be be eclipse that this year have fewer ornament and hanging than the former which in turn have have even fewer than the year precede it there be scarcely any music in the street while the agreeable noise of the kitchen be not to be hear in all the house which the youth ascribe to the fact that for some time thing have be go badly the sugar do not bring a good price the rice crop have fail over half the live stock have die but the tax rise and increase for some inexplicable reason while the abuse of the civil guard become more frequent to kill off the happiness of the people in the town he be just ponder over this when a energetic halt resound they be pass in front of the barracks and one of the guard have notice the extinguish lamp of the carroma which could not go on without it a hail of insult fall about the poor cochero who vainly excuse himself with the length of the procession he would be arrest for violate the ordinance and afterwards advertise in the newspaper so the peaceful and prudent basilio leave the carroma and go he way on foot carry he valise this be san diego he native town where he have not a single relative the only house wherein there seem to be any mirth be capitan basilio 's hen and chicken cackle they death chant to the accompaniment of dry

under the wane moon that year the place be wrap in darkness the chime have cease and only the toll sound through the darkness of the night amid the murmur of the breeze-stirred branch and the measure roar of the wave on the neighbor lake like the deep respiration of nature sink in profound sleep awed by the time and place the youth move along with he head down as if endeavor to see through the darkness but from time to time he raise it to gaze at the star through the open space between the treetop and go forward parting the bush or tear away the liana that obstruct he path at time he retrace he step he foot would get catch among the plant he stumble over a project root or a fall log at the end of a half-hour he reach a small brook on the opposite side of which arise a hillock a black and shapeless mass that in the darkness take on the proportion of a mountain basilio cross the brook on the stone that show black against the shine surface of the water ascend the hill and make he way to a small space enclose by old and crumble wall he approach the balete tree that rise in the center huge mysterious venerable form of root that extend up and down among the

of dawn thirteen year before to the day almost to the hour he mother have die there in the deepest distress on a glorious night when the moon shine brightly and the christian of the world be engage in rejoice wound and limp he have reach there in pursuit of she -- she mad and terrify flee from she son as from a ghost there she have die and there have come a stranger who have command he to build a funeral pyre he have obey mechanically and when he return he find a second stranger by the side of the other 's corpse what a night and what a morning those be the stranger help he raise the pyre

manila to work in some rich house and study at the same time as many do he journey be a odyssey of sleeplessness and startling surprise in which hunger count for little for he eat the fruit in the wood whither he retreat whenever he make out from afar the uniform of the civil guard a sight that recall the origin of all he misfortune once in manila ragged and sick he go from door to door offer he service a boy from the province who know not a single word of spanish and sickly besides discourage hungry and miserable he wander about the street attract attention by the wretchedness of he clothing how often be he tempt to throw himself under the foot of the horse that flash by draw carriage shine with silver and varnish thus to end he misery at once fortunately he see capitan tiago accompany by aunt isabel he have know they since the day in san diego and in he joy believe that in they he see almost fellow-townsfolk he follow the carriage until he lose sight of it and then make inquiry for the house as it be the very day that marium clara enter the nunnery and capitan tiago be accordingly depress he be admit as a servant without pay but instead with leave to study if he so wish in san juan de letran -lrb- 15 -rrb- dirty poorly dress with only a pair of clog for footwear at the end of several month ' stay in manila he enter the first year of latin on see he clothes he classmate draw away from he and the professor a handsome dominican never ask he a question but frown every time he look at he in the eight month that the class continue the only word that pass between they be he name read from the roll and the daily _ adsum _ with which the student respond with what bitterness he leave the class each day and guess the reason for the treatment accord he what tear spring into he eye and what complaint be stifle in he heart how he have weep and sob over the grave of he mother relate to she he hidden sorrow humiliation and affront when at the approach of christmas capitan tiago have take he back to san diego yet he memorize the lesson without omit a comma although he understand scarcely any part of they but at length he become resigned notice that among the three or four hundred in he class only about forty merit the honor of be question because they attract the professor 's attention by they appearance some prank comicality or other cause the greater part of the student congratulate themselves that they thus escape the work of think and understand the subject one go to college not to learn and study but to gain credit for the course so if the book can be memorize what more can be ask -- the year be thus gain -lrb- 16 -rrb- basilio pass the examination by answer the solitary question ask he like a machine without stop or breathe and in the amusement of the examiner win the pass certificate he nine companion -- they be examine in batch of ten in order to save time -- do not have such good luck but be condemn to repeat the year of brutalization in the second year the game-cock that he tend win a large sum and he receive from capitan tiago a big tip which he immediately invest in the purchase of shoe and a feel hat with these and the clothes give he by he employer which he make over to fit he person he appearance become more decent but do not get beyond that in such a large class a great deal be need to attract the professor 's attention and the student who in the first year do not make himself know by some special quality or do not capture the good-will of the professor could with difficulty make himself know in the rest of he school-day but basilio keep on for perseverance be he chief trait he fortune seem to change somewhat when he enter the third year he professor happen to be a very jolly fellow fond of joke and of make the student laugh complacent enough in that he almost always have he favorite recite the lesson -- in fact he be satisfy with anything at this time basilio now wear shoe and a clean and well-ironed camisa as he professor notice that he laugh very little at the joke and that he large eye seem to be ask something like a eternal question he take he for a fool and one day decide to make he conspicuous by call on he for the lesson basilio recite it from begin to end without hesitate over a single letter so the professor call he a parrot and tell a story to make the class laugh then to increase the hilarity and justify the epithet he ask several question at the same time wink to he favorite as if to say to they you 'll see how we be go to amuse ourselves basilio now understand spanish and answer the question with the plain intention of make no one laugh this disgusted everybody the expect absurdity do not materialize no one could laugh and the good friar never pardon he for have defraud the hope of the class and disappointed he own prophecy but who would expect anything worth while to come from a head so badly comb and place on a indian poorly shoe classify until recently among the arboreal animal as in other center of learn where the teacher be honestly desirous that the student should learn such discovery usually delight the instructor so in a college manage by man convince that for the most part knowledge be a evil at least for the student the episode of basilio produce a bad impression and he be not question again during the year why should he be when he make no one laugh quite discourage and thinking of abandon he study he pass to the fourth year of latin why study at all why not sleep like the other and trust to luck one of the two professor be very popular beloved by all pass for a sage a great poet and a man of advanced idea one day when he accompany the collegian on they walk he have a dispute with some cadet which result in a skirmish and a challenge no doubt recall he brilliant youth the professor preach a crusade and promise good mark to all who during the promenade on the follow Sunday would take part in the fray the week be a lively one -- there be occasional encounter in which cane and saber be cross and in one of these basilio distinguish himself bear in triumph by the student and present to the professor he thus become know to he and come to be he favorite partly for this reason and partly from he diligence that year he receive the highest mark medal include in view of which capitan tiago who since he daughter have become a nun exhibit some aversion to the friar in a fit of good humor induce he to transfer to the ateneo municipal the fame of which be then in its apogee here a new world open before he eye -- a system of instruction that he have never dream of except for a few superfluity and some childish thing he be fill with admiration for the method there use and with gratitude for the zeal of the instructor he eye at time fill with tear when he think of the four previous year during which from lack of means he have be unable to study at that center he have to make extraordinary effort to get himself to the level of those who have have a good preparatory course and it might be say that in that one year he learn the whole five of the secondary curriculum he receive he bachelor 's degree to the great satisfaction of he instructor who in the examination show themselves to be proud of he before the dominican examiner send there to inspect the school one of these as if to dampen such great enthusiasm a little ask he where he have study the first year of latin in san juan de letran padre answer basilio aha of course he be not bad -- in latin the dominican then remark with a slight smile from choice and temperament he select the course in medicine capitan tiago prefer the law in order that he might have a lawyer free but knowledge of the law be not sufficient to secure clientage in the philippine -- it be necessary to win the case and for this friendship be require influence in certain sphere a good deal of astuteness capitan tiago finally give in remember that medical student get on intimate term with corpse and for some time he have be seek a poison to put on the gaff of he game-cock the best he have be able to secure thus far be the blood of a chinaman who have die of syphilis with equal diligence or more if possible the young man continue this course and after the third year begin to render medical service with such great success that he be not only prepare a brilliant future for himself but also earn enough to dress well and save some money this be the last year of the course and in two month he would be a physician he would come back to the town he would marry juliana and they would be happy the grant of he licentiateship be not only assure but he expect it to be the crowning act of he school-day for he have be designate to deliver the valedictory at the graduation and already he see himself in the rostrum before the whole faculty the object of public attention all those head leader of manila science half-hidden in they color cape all the woman who come there out of curiosity and who year before have gaze at he if not with disdain at least with indifference all those man whose carriage have once be about to crush he down in the mud like a dog : they would listen attentively and he be go to say something to they that would not be trivial something that have never before resound in that place he be go to forget himself in order to aid the poor student of the future -- and he would make he entrance on he work in the world with that speech chapter vii simoun over these matter basilio be ponder as he visit he mother 's grave he be about to start back to the town when he think he see a light flickering among the tree and hear the snap of twig the sound of foot and rustling of leave the light disappear but the noise become more distinct come directly toward where he be basilio be not naturally superstitious especially after have carve up so many corpse and watch beside so many death-bed but the old legend about that ghostly spot the hour the darkness the melancholy sighing of the wind and certain tale hear in he childhood assert they influence over he mind and make he heart beat violently the figure stop on the other side of the balete but the youth could see it through a open space between two root that have grow in the course of time to the proportion of tree-trunk it produce from under its coat a lantern with a powerful reflect lens which it place on the ground thereby light up a pair of riding-boot the rest of the figure remain conceal in the darkness the figure seem to search its pocket and then bent over to fix a shovel-blade on the end of a stout cane to he great surprise basilio think he could make out some of the feature of the jeweler simoun who indeed it be the jeweler dig in the ground and from time to time the lantern illuminate he face on which be not now the blue goggles that so completely disguise he basilio shudder : that be the same stranger who thirteen year before have dig he mother 's grave there only now he have age somewhat he hair have turn white he wear a beard and a mustache but yet he look be the same the bitter expression the same cloud on he brow the same muscular arm though somewhat thinner now the same violent energy old impression be stir in the boy : he seem to feel the heat of the fire the hunger the weariness of that time the smell of freshly turn earth yet he discovery terrify he -- that jeweler simoun who pass for a british indian a portuguese a american a mulatto the brown cardinal he black eminence the evil genius of the captain-general as many call he be no other than the mysterious stranger whose appearance and disappearance coincide with the death of the heir to that land but of the two stranger who have appear which be ibarra the living or the dead this question which he have often ask himself whenever ibarra 's death be mention again come into he mind in the presence of the human enigma he now see before he the dead man have have two wound which must have be make by firearm as he know from what he have since study and which would be the result of the chase on the lake then the dead man must have be ibarra who have come to die at the tomb of he forefather he desire to be cremate be explain by he residence in europe where cremation be practice then who be the other the living this jeweler simoun at that time with such a appearance of poverty and wretchedness but who have now return load with gold and a friend of the authority there be the mystery and the student with he characteristic cold-bloodedness determine to clear it up at the first opportunity simoun dig away for some time but basilio notice that he old vigor have decline -- he pant and have to rest every few moment fear that he might be discover the boy make a sudden resolution rise from he seat and issue from he hiding-place he ask in the most matter-of-fact tone can i help you sir simoun straighten up with the spring of a tiger attack at he prey thrust he hand in he coat pocket and stare at the student with a pale and lower gaze thirteen year ago you render I a great service sir go on basilio unmoved in this very place by bury my mother and i should consider myself happy if i could serve you now without take he eye off the youth simoun draw a revolver from he pocket and the click of a hammer be cock be hear for whom do you take I he ask retreat a few pace for a person who be sacred to I reply basilio with some emotion for he think he last moment have come for a person whom all except I believe to be dead and whose misfortune i have always lament a impressive silence follow these word a silence that to the youth seem to suggest eternity but simoun after some hesitation approach he and place a hand on he shoulder say in a move tone : basilio you possess a secret that can ruin I and now you have just surprise I in another which put I completely in you hand the divulging of which would upset all my plan for my own security and for the good of the cause in which i labor i ought to seal you lip forever for what be the life of one man compare to the end i seek the occasion be fitting no one know that i have come here i be arm you be defenceless you death would be attribute to the outlaw if not to more supernatural cause -- yet i 'll let you live and trust that i shall not regret it you have toil you have struggle with energetic perseverance and like myself you have you score to settle with society you brother be murder you mother drive to insanity and society have prosecute neither the assassin nor the executioner you and i be the dregs of justice and instead of destroy we ought to aid each other simoun pause with a repress sigh and then slowly resume while he gaze wander about : yes i be he who come here thirteen year ago sick and wretched to pay the last tribute to a great and noble soul that be willing to die for I the victim of a vicious system i have wander over the world work night and day to amass a fortune and carry out my plan now i have return to destroy that system to precipitate its downfall to hurl it into the abyss toward which it be senselessly rush even though i may have to shed ocean of tear and blood it have condemn itself it stand condemn and i do not want to die before i have see it in fragment at the foot of the precipice simoun extend both he arm toward the earth as if with that gesture he would like to hold there the broken remain he voice take on a sinister even lugubrious tone which make the student shudder call by the vice of the ruler i have return to these island and under the cloak of a merchant have visit the town my gold have open a way for I and wheresoever i have behold greed in the most execrable form sometimes hypocritical sometimes shameless sometimes cruel fatten on the dead organism like a vulture on a corpse i have ask myself -- why be there not fester in its vitals the corruption the ptomaine the poison of the tomb to kill the foul bird the corpse be let itself be consume the vulture be gorge itself with meat and because it be not possible for I to give it life so that it might turn against its destroyer and because the corruption develop slowly i have stimulate greed i have abet it the case of injustice and the abuse multiply themselves i have instigate crime and act of cruelty so that the people might become accustomed to the idea of death i have stir up trouble so that to escape from it some remedy might be find i have place obstacle in the way of trade so that the country impoverished and reduce to misery might no longer be afraid of anything i have excite desire to plunder the treasury and as this have not be enough to bring about a popular uprising i have wound the people in they most sensitive fiber i have make the vulture itself insult the very corpse that it feed upon and hasten the corruption now when i be about to get the supreme rottenness the supreme filth the mixture of such foul product brew poison when the greed be begin to irritate in its folly hasten to seize whatever come to hand like a old woman catch in a conflagration here you come with you cry of hispanism with chant of confidence in the government in what can not come to pass here you have a body palpitate with heat and life young pure vigorous throb with blood with enthusiasm suddenly come forth to offer itself again as fresh food ah youth be ever inexperienced and dreamy always run after the butterfly and flower you have unite so that by you effort you may bind you fatherland to spain with garland of rose when in reality you be forge upon it chain harder than the diamond you ask for equal rights the hispanization of you custom and you do not see that what you be beg for be suicide the destruction of you nationality the annihilation of you fatherland the consecration of tyranny what will you be in the future a people without character a nation without liberty -- everything you have will be borrow even you very defect you beg for hispanization and do not pale with shame when they deny it you and even if they should grant it to you what then -- what have you gain at best a country of pronunciamento a land of civil war a republic of the greedy and the malcontent like some of the republic of south america to what be you tend now with you instruction in castilian a pretension that would be ridiculous be it not for its deplorable consequence you wish to add one more language to the forty odd that be speak in the island so that you may understand one another less and less on the contrary reply basilio if the knowledge of castilian may bind we to the government in exchange it may also unite the island among themselves a gross error rejoin simoun you be let yourselve be deceive by big word and never go to the bottom of thing to examine the result in they final analysis spanish will never be the general language of the country the people will never talk it because the conception of they brain and the feeling of they heart can not be express in that language -- each people have its own tongue as it have its own way of think what be you go to do with castilian the few of you who will speak it kill off you own originality subordinate you thought to other brain and instead of free yourselve make yourselve slave indeed nine-tenth of those of you who pretend to be enlighten be renegade to you country he among you who talk that language neglect he own in such a way that he neither write nor understand it and how many have i not see who pretend not to know a single word of it but fortunately you have a imbecile government while russium enslave poland by force the russian language upon it while germany prohibit french in the conquered province you government strive to preserve yours and you in return a remarkable people under a incredible government you be try to despoil yourselve of you own nationality one and all you forget that while a people preserve its language it preserve the mark of its liberty as a man preserve he independence while he hold to he own way of think language be the thought of the people luckily you independence be assure human passion be look out for that simoun pause and rub he hand over he forehead the wane moon be rise and send its faint light down through the branch of the tree and with he white lock and severe feature illuminate from below by the lantern the jeweler appear to be the fateful spirit of the wood plan some evil basilio be silent before such bitter reproach and listen with bow head while simoun resume : i see this movement start and have pass whole night of anguish because i understand that among those youth there be exceptional mind and heart sacrifice themselves for what they think to be a good cause when in reality they be work against they own country how many time have i wish to speak to you young man to reveal myself and undeceive you but in view of the reputation i enjoy my word would have be wrongly interpret and would perhaps have have a counter effect how many time have i not long to approach you makaraig you isaganus sometimes i thought of they death i wish to destroy they -- simoun check himself here be why i let you live basilio and by such imprudence i expose myself to the risk of be some day betray by you but you know who i be you know how much i must have suffer -- then believe in I you be not of the common crowd which see in the jeweler simoun the trader who incite the authority to commit abuse in order that the abused may buy jewel i be the judge who wish to castigate this system by make use of its own defect to make war on it by flattering it i need you help you influence among the youth to combat these senseless desire for hispanization for assimilation for equal rights by that road you will become only a poor copy and the people should look higher it be madness to attempt to influence the thought of the ruler -- they have they plan outline the bandage cover they eye and besides lose time uselessly you be deceive the people with vain hope and be help to bend they neck before the tyrant what you should do be to take advantage of they prejudice to serve you need be they unwilling that you be assimilate with the spanish people good enough distinguish yourselve then by reveal yourselve in you own character try to lay the foundation of the philippine fatherland do they deny you hope good do not depend on they depend upon yourselve and work do they deny you representation in they corte so much the better even should you succeed in send representative of you own choice what be you go to accomplish there except to be overwhelm among so many voice and sanction with you presence the abuse and wrong that be afterwards perpetrate the fewer rights they allow you the more reason you will have later to throw off the yoke and return evil for evil if they be unwilling to teach you they language cultivate you own extend it preserve to the people they own way of thinking and instead of aspire to be a province aspire to be a nation instead of subordinate thought think independently to the end that neither by right nor custom nor language the spaniard can be consider the master here nor even be look upon as a part of the country but ever as a invader a foreigner and sooner or later you will have you liberty here 's why i let you live basilio breathe freely as though a great weight have be lift from he and after a brief pause reply : sir the honor you do I in confide you plan to I be too great for I not to be frank with you and tell you that what you ask of I be beyond my power i be no politician and if i have sign the petition for instruction in castilian it have be because i saw in it a advantage to we study and nothing more my destiny be different my aspiration reduce itself to alleviate the physical suffering of my fellow man the jeweler smile what be physical suffering compare to moral torture what be the death of a man in the presence of the death of a society some day you will perhaps be a great physician if they let you go you way in peace but greater yet will be he who can inject a new idea into this anemic people you what be you do for the land that give you existence that support you life that afford you knowledge do not you realize that that be a useless life which be not consecrate to a great idea it be a stone waste in the field without become a part of any edifice no no sir reply basilio modestly i be not folding my arm i be work like all the rest to raise up from the ruin of the past a people whose unit will be bind together -- that each one may feel in himself the conscience and the life of the whole but however enthusiastic we generation may be we understand that in this great social fabric there must be a division of labor i have choose my task and will devote myself to science science be not the end of man declare simoun the most civilized nation be tend toward it yes but only as a means of seek they welfare science be more eternal it be more human it be more universal exclaim the youth in a transport of enthusiasm within a few century when humanity have become redeem and enlighten when there be no race when all people be free when there be neither tyrant nor slave colony nor mother country when justice rule and man be a citizen of the world the pursuit of science alone will remain the word patriotism will be equivalent to fanaticism and he who pride himself on patriotic idea will doubtless be isolate as a dangerous disease as a menace to the social order simoun smile sadly yes yes he say with a shake of he head yet to reach that condition it be necessary that there be no tyrannical and no enslaved people it be necessary that man go about freely that he know how to respect the rights of other in they own individuality and for this there be yet much blood to be shed the struggle force itself forward to overcome the ancient fanaticism that bind conscience it be necessary that many should perish in the holocaust so that the social conscience in horror declare the individual conscience free it be also necessary that all answer the question which with each day the fatherland ask they with its fettered hand extend patriotism can only be a crime in a tyrannical people because then it be rapine under a beautiful name but however perfect humanity may become patriotism will always be a virtue among oppressed people because it will at all time mean love of justice of liberty of personal dignity -- nothing of chimerical dream of effeminate idyl the greatness of a man be not in live before he time a thing almost impossible but in understand its desire in respond to its need and in guide it on its forward way the genius that be commonly believe to have exist before they time only appear so because those who judge they see from a great distance or take as representative of the age the line of straggler simoun fall silent see that he could awake no enthusiasm in that unresponsive mind he turn to another subject and ask with a change of tone : and what be you do for the memory of you mother and you brother be it enough that you come here every year to weep like a woman over a grave and he smile sarcastically the shot hit the mark basilio change color and advance a step what do you want I to do he ask angrily without means without social position how may i bring they murderer to justice i would merely be another victim shatter like a piece of glass hurl against a rock ah you do ill to recall this to I since it be wantonly reopen a wound but what if i should offer you my aid basilio shake he head and remain pensive all the tardy vindication of justice all the revenge in the world will not restore a single hair of my mother 's head or recall a smile to my brother 's lip let they rest in peace -- what should i gain now by avenge they prevent other from suffer what you have suffer that in the future there be no brother murder or mother drive to madness resignation be not always a virtue it be a crime when it encourage tyrant : there be no despot where there be no slave man be in he own nature so wicked that he always abuse complaisance i think as you do and you know what my fate be those who cause you misfortune be watch you day and night they suspect that you be only bide you time they take you eagerness to learn you love of study you very complaisance for burn desire for revenge the day they can get rid of you they will do with you as they do with I and they will not let you grow to manhood because they fear and hate you hate I still hate I after the wrong they have do I ask the youth in surprise simoun burst into a laugh ` it be natural for man to hate those whom he have wrong ' say tacitus confirm the _ quo laeserunt et oderunt _ of seneca when you wish to gauge the evil or the good that one people have do to another you have only to observe whether it hate or love thus be explain the reason why many who have enrich themselves here in the high office they have fill on they return to the peninsula relieve themselves by slander and insult against those who have be they victim _ proprium humani ingenius est odisse quern laeseri _ but if the world be large if one leave they to the peaceful enjoyment of power if i ask only to be allow to work to live -- and to rear meek-natured son to send they afterwards to submit to the yoke continue simoun cruelly mimic basilio 's tone a fine future you prepare for they and they have to thank you for a life of humiliation and suffer good enough young man when a body be inert it be useless to galvanize it twenty year of continuous slavery of systematic humiliation of constant prostration finally create in the mind a twist that can not be straighten by the labor of a day good and evil instinct be inherit and transmit from father to son then let you idylic idea live you dream of a slave who ask only for a bandage to wrap the chain so that it may rattle less and not ulcerate he skin you hope for a little home and some ease a wife and a handful of rice -- here be you ideal man of the philippine well if they give it to you consider yourself fortunate basilio accustom to obey and bear with the caprice and humor of capitan tiago be now dominate by simoun who appear to he terrible and sinister on a background bath in tear and blood he try to explain himself by say that he do not consider himself fit to mix in politics that he have no political opinion because he have never study the question but that he be always ready to lend he service the day they might be need that for the moment he see only one need the enlightenment of the people simoun stop he with a gesture and as the dawn be come say to he : young man i be not warn you to keep my secret because i know that discretion be one of you good quality and even though you might wish to sell I the jeweler simoun the friend of the authority and of the religious corporation will always be give more credit than the student basilio already suspect of filibusterism and be a native so much the more marked and watch and because in the profession you be enter upon you will encounter powerful rival after all even though you have not correspond to my hope the day on which you change you mind look I up at my house in the escolta and i 'll be glad to help you basilio thank he briefly and go away have i really make a mistake muse simoun when he find himself alone be it that he doubt I and meditate he plan of revenge so secretly that he fear to tell it even in the solitude of the night or can it be that the year of servitude have extinguish in he heart every human sentiment and there remain only the animal desire to live and reproduce in that case the type be deform and will have to be cast over again then the hecatomb be prepare : let the unfit perish and only the strongest survive then he add sadly as if apostrophize some one : have patience you who leave I a name and a home have patience i have lose all -- country future prosperity you very tomb but have patience and thou noble spirit great soul generous heart who do live with only one thought and didst sacrifice thy life without ask the gratitude or applause of any one have patience have patience the method that i use may perhaps not be thine but they be

bored or asleep at each movement or antic that may soil they clothing they be pinch and scold so the fact be that they do not laugh or feel happy while in they round eye can be read a protest against so much embroidery and a longing for the old shirt of week-days afterwards they be drag from house to house to kiss they relative ' hand there they have to dance sing and recite all the amusing thing they know whether in the humor or not whether comfortable or not in they fine clothes with the eternal pinching and scolding if they play any of they trick they relative give they cuarto which they

of sport arm be permit in all the country of the world the general shrug he shoulder and remark dryly we be not imitate any nation in the world between he excellency and the high official there be always a difference of opinion so it be sufficient that the latter offer any suggestion whatsoever to have the former remain stubborn the high official try another tack sport arm can harm only rat and chicken they 'll say -- but be we chicken interrupt the general again shrug he shoulder be i i have demonstrate that i be not but there be another thing observe the secretary four month ago when the possession of arm be prohibit the foreign importer be assure that sport arm would be admit he excellency knit he brow that can be arrange suggest simoun how very simply sport arm nearly all have a caliber of six millimeter at least those now in the market authorize only the sale of those that have not these six millimeter all approve this idea of simoun 's except the high official who mutter into padre fernandez 's ear that this be not dignified nor be it the way to govern the schoolmaster of tiani proceed the secretary shuffling some papers about ask for a better location for -- what better location can he want than the storehouse that he have all to himself interrupted padre camorra who have return have forget about the card-game he say that it be roofless reply the secretary and that have purchase out of he own pocket some map and picture he do not want to expose they to the weather but i have not anything to do with that mutter he excellency he should address the head

teach that corps rot just the same whether bury with great pomp or without any some day i be go to punch he here he double up he fist to tell the truth observe padre sibylum as if speak only to padre irene he who wish to teach teach everywhere in the open air socrate teach in the public street plato in the garden of the academy even christ among the mountain and lake i have hear several complaint against this schoolmaster say he excellency exchange a glance with simoun i think the best thing would be to suspend he suspend repeat the secretary the luck of that unfortunate who have ask for help and receive he dismissal pained the high official and he try to do something for he it be certain he insinuate rather timidly that education be not at all well provide for -- i have already decree large sum for the purchase of supplies exclaim he excellency haughtily as if to say i have do more than i ought to have do but since suitable location be lack the supplies purchase get ruin everything can not be do at once say he excellency dryly the schoolmaster here be do wrong in ask for building when those in spain starve to death it be great presumption to be better off here than in the mother country itself filibusterism -- before everything the fatherland before everything else we be spaniard add ben-zayb he eye glowing with patriotism but he blush somewhat when he notice that he be speak alone in the future decide the general all who complain will be suspend if my project be accept -- don custodio venture to remark as if talk to himself for the construction of schoolhouse it be simple practical economical and like all my project derive from long experience and knowledge of the country the town would have school without cost the government a cuarto that be easy observe the secretary sarcastically compel the town to construct they at they own expense whereupon all laugh no sir no sir cry the exasperated don custodio turn very red the building be already construct and only wait to be utilize hygienic unsurpassable spacious -- the friar look at one another uneasily would don custodio propose that the church and convento be convert into schoolhouse let 's hear it say the general with a frown well general it be very simple reply don custodio draw himself up and assume he hollow voice of ceremony the school be open only on week-day and the cockpit on holiday then convert these into schoolhouse at least during the week man man man what a lovely idea what be the matter with you don custodio that be a grand suggestion that beat they all but gentleman cry don custodio in answer to so many exclamation let 's be practical -- what place be more suitable than the cockpit they be large well construct and under a curse for the use to which they be put during the week-day from a moral standpoint my project would be acceptable by serve as a kind of expiation and weekly purification of the temple of chance as we might say but the fact remain that sometimes there be cockfight during the week object padre camorra and it would not be right when the contractor of the cockpit pay the government -- -lrb- 23 -rrb- well on those day close the school man man exclaim the scandalize captain-general such a outrage shall never be perpetrate while i govern to close the school in order to gamble man man i 'll resign first he excellency be really horrify but general it be better to close they for a few day than for month it would be immoral observe padre irene more indignant even than he excellency it be more immoral that vice have good building and learn none let 's be practical gentleman and not be carry away by sentiment in politics there be nothing worse than sentiment while from humane consideration we forbid the cultivation of opium in we colony we tolerate the smoking of it and the result be that we do not combat the vice but impoverish ourselves but remember that it yield to the government without any effort more than four hundred and fifty thousand peso object padre irene who be get more and more on the governmental side enough enough enough exclaim he excellency to end the discussion i have my own plan in this regard and will devote special attention to the matter of public instruction be there anything else the secretary look uneasily toward padre sibylum and padre irene the cat be about to come out of the bag both prepared themselves the petition of the student request authorization to open a academy of castilian answer the secretary a general movement be note among those in the room after glance at one another they fix they eye on the general to learn what he disposition would be for six month the petition have lie there await a decision and have become convert into a kind of _ casus bellus _ in certain circle he excellency have lower he eye as if to keep he thought from be read the silence become embarrassing as the general understand so he ask the high official what do you think what should i think general respond the person address with a shrug of he shoulder and a bitter smile what should i think but that the petition be just very just and that i be surprise that six month should have be take to consider it the fact be that it involve other consideration say padre sibylum coldly as he half close he eye the high official again shrug he shoulder like one who do not comprehend what those consideration could be besides the intemperateness of the demand go on the dominican besides the fact that it be in the nature of a infringement on we prerogative -- padre sibylum dare not go on but look at simoun the petition have a somewhat suspicious character corroborate that individual exchange a look with the dominican who wink several time padre irene notice these thing and realize that he cause be almost lose -- simoun be against he it be a peaceful rebellion a revolution on stamped paper add padre sibylum revolution rebellion inquire the high official stare from one to the other as if he do not understand what they could mean it be head by some young man charge with be too radical and too much interested in reform not to use stronger term remark the secretary with a look at the dominican among they be a certain isaganus a poorly balanced head nephew of a native priest -- he be a pupil of mine put in padre fernandez and i be much pleased with he _ puñales _ i like you taste exclaim padre camorra on the steamer we nearly have a fight he be so insolent that when i give he a shove aside he return it there be also one makaraguus or makaraus -- makaraig padre irene join in a very pleasant and agreeable young man then he murmur into the general 's ear he be the one i have talk to you about he be very rich the countess recommend he strongly ah a medical student one basilio -- of that basilio i 'll say nothing observe padre irene raise he hand and open they as if to say _ dominus vobiscum _ he be too deep for I i have never succeed in fathom what he want or what he be think about it be a pity that padre salvus be not present to tell we something about he antecedent i believe that i have hear that when a boy he get into trouble with the civil guard he father be kill in -- i do not remember what disturbance simoun smile faintly silently show he sharp white tooth aha aha say he excellency nod that be the kind we have make a note of that name but general object the high official see that the matter be take a bad turn up to now nothing positive be know against these young man they position be a very just one and we have no right to deny it on the ground of mere conjecture my opinion be that the government by exhibit confidence in the people and in its own stability should grant what be ask then it could freely revoke the permission when it see that its kindness be be abuse -- reason and pretext would not be want we can watch they why cause disaffection among some young man who later on may feel resentment when what they ask be command by royal decree padre irene don custodio and padre fernandez nod in agreement but the indian must not understand castilian you know cry padre camorra they must not learn it for then they 'll enter into argument with we and the indian must not argue but obey and pay they must not try to interpret the meaning of the law and the book they be so tricky and pettifogish just as soon as they learn castilian they become enemy of god and of spain just read the _ tandang basio macunat _ -- that be a book it tell truth like this and he hold up he clenched fist padre sibylum rub he hand over he tonsure in sign of impatience one word he begin in the most conciliatory tone though fume with irritation here we be not deal with the instruction in castilian alone here there be a underhand fight between the student and the university of santo toma if the student win this we prestige will be trample in the dirt they will say that they have beat we and will exult accordingly then good-by to moral strength good-by to everything the first dike break down who will restrain this youth with we fall we do no more than signal you own after we the government _ puñales _ that be not so exclaimed padre camorra we 'll see first who have the biggest fist at this point padre fernandez who thus far in the discussion have merely contented himself with smile begin to talk all give he they attention for they know he to be a thoughtful man do not take it ill of I padre sibylum if i differ from you view of the affair but it be my peculiar fate to be almost always in opposition to my brethren i say then that we ought not to be so pessimistic the instruction in castilian can be allow without any risk whatever and in order that it may not appear to be a defeat of the university we dominican ought to put forth we effort and be the first to rejoice over it -- that should be we policy to what end be we to be engage in a everlasting struggle with the people when after all we be the few and they be the many when we need they and they do not need we wait padre camorra wait admit that now the people may be weak and ignorant -- i also believe that -- but it will not be true tomorrow or the day after tomorrow and the next day they will be the stronger they will know what be good for they and we can not keep it from they just as it be not possible to keep from child the knowledge of many thing when they reach a certain age i say then why should we not take advantage of this condition of ignorance to change we policy completely to place it upon a basis solid and enduring -- on the basis of justice for example instead of on the basis of ignorance there be nothing like be just that i have always say to my brethren but they will not believe I the indian idolize justice like every race in its youth he ask for punishment when he have do wrong just as he be exasperate when he have not deserve it be theirs a just desire then grant it let 's give they all the school they want until they be tire of they youth be lazy and what urge they to activity be we opposition we bond of prestige padre sibylum be about wear out so let 's prepare another the bond of gratitude for example let 's not be fool let 's do as the crafty jesuit -- padre fernandez anything could be tolerate by padre sibylum except to propose the jesuit to he as a model pale and tremble he break out into bitter recrimination a franciscan first anything before a jesuit he be beside himself oh oh eh padre -- a general discussion break out regardless of the captain-general all talk at once they yell they misunderstand and contradict one another ben-zayb and padre camorra shake they fist in each other 's face one talking of simpleton and the other of ink-slingers padre sibylum keep harp on the _ capitulum _ and padre fernandez on the _ summa _ of st thoma until the curate of lo baños enter to announce that breakfast be serve he excellency arise and so end the discussion well gentleman he say we have work like nigger and yet we be on a vacation some one have say that grave matter should he consider at dessert i be entirely of that opinion we might get indigestion remark the secretary

after vainly propose that they play truant he would go away allege important business a appointment or illness just at the very moment when he companion be go to they class but by some occult thaumaturgic art tadeo pass the examination be beloved by the professor and have before he a promising future meanwhile the group begin to move inside for the professor of physics and chemistry have put in he appearance the student appear to be cheat in they hope and go toward the interior of the building with exclamation of discontent placido go along with the crowd penitente penitente call a student with a certain mysterious air sign this what be it never mind -- sign it it seem to placido that some one be twitch he ear he recall the story of a cabeza de barangay in he town who for have sign a document that he do not understand be keep a prisoner for month and month and come near to deportation a uncle of placido 's in order to fix the lesson in he memory have give he a severe ear-pulling so that always whenever he hear signature speak of he ear reproduce the sensation excuse I but i can not sign anything without first understanding what it be about what a fool you be if two _ celestial carbineer _ have sign it what have you to fear the name of _ celestial carbineer _ inspired confidence be as it be a sacred company create to aid god in the warfare against the evil spirit and to prevent the smuggling of heretical contraband into the market of the new zion -lrb- 27 -rrb- placido be about to sign to make a end of it because he be in a hurry -- already he classmate be recite the _ o thoma _ -- but again he ear twitch so he say after the class i want to read it first it be very long do not you see it concern the presentation of a counter-petition or rather a protest do not you understand makaraig and some other have ask that a academy of castilian be open which be a piece of genuine foolishness -- all right all right after awhile they be already begin answer placido try to get away but you professor may not call the roll -- yes yes but he call it sometimes later on later on besides i do not want to put myself in opposition to makaraig but it be not put yourself in opposition it be only -- placido hear no more for he be already far away hurry to he class he hear the different voice -- _ adsum adsum _ -- the roll be be call hasten he step he get to the door just as the letter q be reach _ tinamáan ñg -- _ -lrb- 28 -rrb- he mutter bite he lip he hesitate about enter for the mark be already down against he and be not to be erase one do not go to the class to learn but in order not to get this absence mark for the class be reduce to recite the lesson from memory read the book and at the most answer a few abstract profound captious enigmatic question true the usual preachment be never lack -- the same as ever about humility submission and respect to the cleric and he placido be humble submissive and respectful so he be about to turn away when he remember that the examination be approach and he professor have not yet ask he a question nor appear to notice he -- this would be a good opportunity to attract he attention and become know to be know be to gain a year for if it cost nothing to suspend one who be not know it require a hard heart not to be touch by the sight of a youth who by he daily presence be a reproach over a year of he life waste so placido go in not on tiptoe as be he custom but noisily on he heel and only too well do he succeed in he intent the professor stare at he knit he brow and shake he head as though to say ah little impudence you 'll pay for that chapter xiii the class in physics the classroom be a spacious rectangular hall with large grated window that admit a abundance of light and air along the two side extend three wide tier of stone cover with wood fill with student arrange in alphabetical order at the end opposite the entrance under a print of st thoma aquina rise the professor 's chair on a elevated platform with a little stairway on each side with the exception of a beautiful blackboard in a narra frame scarcely ever use since there be still write on it the _ viva _ that have appear on the opening day no furniture either useful or useless be to be see the wall paint white and cover with glazed tile to prevent scratch be entirely bare have neither a drawing nor a picture nor even a outline of any physical apparatus the student have no need of any no one miss the practical instruction in a extremely experimental science for year and year it have be so teach and the country have not be upset but continue just as ever now and then some little instrument descend from heaven and be exhibit to the class from a distance like the monstrance to the prostrate worshiper -- look but touch not from time to time when some complacent professor appear one day in the year be set aside for visit the mysterious laboratory and gaze from without at the puzzling apparatus arrange in glass case no one could complain for on that day there be to be see quantity of brass and glassware tube disk wheel bell and the like -- the exhibition do not get beyond that and the country be not upset besides the student be convince that those instrument have not be purchase for they -- the friar would be fool the laboratory be intend to be show to the visitor and the high official who come from the peninsula so that upon see it they would nod they head with satisfaction while they guide would smile as if to say eh you think you be go to find some backward monk well we be right up with the time -- we have a laboratory the visitor and high official after be handsomely entertain would then write in they _ travel _ or _ memoirs _ : the royal and pontifical university of santo toma of manila in charge of the enlighten dominican order possess a magnificent physical laboratory for the instruction of youth some two hundred and fifty student annually study this subject but whether from apathy indolence the limited capacity of the indian or some other ethnological or incomprehensible reason up to now there have not develop a lavoisier a secchus or a tyndall not even in miniature in the malay-filipino race yet to be exact we will say that in this laboratory be hold the class of thirty or forty _ advance _ student under the direction of a instructor who perform he duty well enough but as the greater part of these student come from the ateneo of the jesuit where science be teach practically in the laboratory itself its utility do not come to be so great as it would be if it could be utilize by the two hundred and fifty who pay they matriculation fee buy they book memorize they and waste a year to know nothing afterwards as a result with the exception of some rare usher or janitor who have have charge of the museum for year no one have ever be know to get any advantage from the lesson memorize with so great effort but let we return to the class the professor be a young dominican who have fill several chair in san juan de letran with zeal and good repute he have the reputation of be a great logician as well as a profound philosopher and be one of the most promising in he clique he elder treat he with consideration while the younger man envy he for there be also clique among they this be the third year of he professorship and although the first in which he have teach physics and chemistry he already pass for a sage not only with the complaisant student but also among the other nomadic professor padre millon do not belong to the common crowd who each year change they subject in order to acquire scientific knowledge student among other student with the difference only that they follow a single course that they quiz instead of be quiz that they have a better knowledge of castilian and that they be not examine at the completion of the course padre millon go deeply into science know the physics of aristotle and padre amat read carefully he ramo and sometimes glance at ganot with all that he would often shake he head with a air of doubt as he smile and murmur : _ transeat _ in regard to chemistry no common knowledge be attribute to he after he have take as a premise the statement of st thoma that water be a mixture and prove plainly that the angelic doctor have long forestall berzelius gay-lussac bunsen and other more or less presumptuous materialist moreover in spite of have be a instructor in geography he still entertain certain doubt as to the rotundity of the earth and smile maliciously when its rotation and revolution around the sun be mention as he recite the verse el mentir de las estrellas es un cómodo mentir -lrb- 29 -rrb- he also smile maliciously in the presence of certain physical theory and consider visionary if not actually insane the jesuit secchus to whom he imputed the making of triangulation on the host as a result of he astronomical mania for which reason it be say that he have be forbid to celebrate mass many person also notice in he some aversion to the science that he teach but these vagary be trifle scholarly and religious prejudice that be easily explain not only by the fact that the physical science be eminently practical of pure observation and deduction while he forte be philosophy purely speculative of abstraction and induction but also because like any good dominican jealous of the fame of he order he could hardly feel any affection for a science in which none of he brethren have excel -- he be the first who do not accept the chemistry of st thoma aquina -- and in which so much renown have be acquire by hostile or rather let we say rival order this be the professor who that morning call the roll and direct many of the student to recite the lesson from memory word for word the phonograph get into operation some well some ill some stammering and receive they grade he who recite without a error earn a good mark and he who make more than three mistake a bad mark a fat boy with a sleepy face and hair as stiff and hard as the bristle of a brush yawn until he seem to be about to dislocate he jaw and stretch himself with he arm extend as though he be in he bed the professor see this and wish to startle he eh there sleepy-head what be this lazy too so it be sure you -lrb- 30 -rrb- do not know the lesson ha padre millon not only use the depreciative _ tu _ with the student like a good friar but he also address they in the slang of the market a practice that he have acquire from the professor of canonical law : whether that reverend gentleman wish to humble the student or the sacred decree of the council be a question not yet settle in spite of the great attention that have be give to it this question instead of offend the class amuse they and many laugh -- it be a daily occurrence but the sleeper do not laugh he arise with a bind rub he eye and as though a steam-engine be turn the phonograph begin to recite the name of mirror be apply to all polished surface intend to produce by the reflection of light the image of the object place before say surface from the substance that form these surface they be divide into metallic mirror and glass mirror -- stop stop stop interrupted the professor heaven what a rattle we be at the point where the mirror be divide into metallic and glass eh now if i should present to you a block of wood a piece of kamagon for instance well polished and varnished or a slab of black marble well burnish or a square of jet which would reflect the image of object place before they how would you classify those mirror whether he do not know what to answer or do not understand the question the student try to get out of the difficulty by demonstrate that he know the lesson so he rush on like a torrent the first be compose of brass or a alloy of different metal and the second of a sheet of glass with its two side well polish one of which have a amalgam of tin adhering to it tut tut tut that be not it i say to you ' _ dominus vobiscum _ ' and you answer I with ' _ requiescat in pace _ ' the worthy professor then repeat the question in the vernacular of the market intersperse with _ cosa _ and _ abás _ at every moment the poor youth do not know how to get out of the quandary : he doubt whether to include the kamagon with the metal or the marble with glass and leave the jet as a neutral substance until juanito pelaez maliciously prompt he : the mirror of kamagon among the wooden mirror the incautious youth repeat this aloud and half the class be convulse with laughter a good sample of wood you be yourself exclaim the professor laughing in spite of himself let 's see from what you would define a mirror -- from a surface _ per se in quantum est superficies _ or from a substance that form the surface or from the substance upon which the surface rest the raw material modify by the attribute ` surface ' since it be clear that surface be a accidental property of body it can not exist without substance let 's see now -- what do you say i nothing the wretched boy be about to reply for he do not understand what it be all about confuse as he be by so many surface and so many accident that smite cruelly on he ear but a sense of shame restrain he fill with anguish and break into a cold perspiration he begin to repeat between he tooth : the name of mirror be apply to all polished surface -- _ ergo per te _ the mirror be the surface angle the professor well then clear up this difficulty if the surface be the mirror it must be of no consequence to the ` essence ' of the mirror what may be find behind this surface since what be behind it do not affect the ` essence ' that be before it _ id est _ the surface _ quae super faciem est quium vocatur superficies facy ea quae supra videtur _ do you admit that or do you not admit it the poor youth 's hair stand up straighter than ever as though act upon by some magnetic force do you admit it or do you not admit it anything whatever you wish padre be he thought but he do not dare to express it from fear of ridicule that be a dilemma indeed and he have never be in a worse one he have a vague idea that the most innocent thing could not be admit to the friar but that they or rather they estate and curacy would get out of it all the result and advantage imaginable so he good angel prompt he to deny everything with all the energy of he soul and refractoriness of he hair and he be about to shout a proud _ nego _ for the reason that he who deny everything do not compromise himself in anything as a certain lawyer have once tell he but the evil habit of disregard the dictate of one 's own conscience of have little faith in legal folk and of seek aid from other where one be sufficient unto himself be he undoing he companion especially juanito pelaez be make sign to he to admit it so he let himself be carry away by he evil destiny and exclaim _ concedo _ padre in a voice as falter as though he be say _ in manus tuas commendo spiritum meum _ _ concedo antecedentum _ echo the professor smile maliciously _ ergo _ i can scratch the mercury off a looking-glass put in its place a piece of _ bibinka _ and we shall still have a mirror eh now what shall we have the youth gaze at he prompter but see they surprised and speechless contract he feature into a expression of bitterest reproach _ deus meus deus meus quare dereliquiste I _ say he troubled eye while he lip mutter _ linintikan _ vainly he cough fumble at he shirt-bosom stand first on one foot and then on the other but find no answer come now what have we urge the professor enjoy the effect of he reasoning _ bibinka _ whisper juanito pelaez _ bibinka _ shut up you fool cry the desperate youth hope to get out of the difficulty by turn it into a complaint let 's see juanito if you can answer the question for I the professor then say to pelaez who be one of he pet the latter rise slowly not without first give penitente who follow he on the roll a nudge that mean do not forget to prompt I _ nego consequentiam _ padre he reply resolutely aha then _ probo consequentiam per te _ the polished surface constitute the ` essence ' of the mirror -- _ nego suppositum _ interrupted juanito as he feel placido pull at he coat how _ per te _ -- _ nego _ _ ergo _ you believe that what be behind affect what be in front _ nego _ the student cry with still more ardor feeling another jerk at he coat juanito or rather placido who be prompt he be unconsciously adopt chinese tactic : not to admit the most inoffensive foreigner in order not to be invade then where be we ask the professor somewhat disconcerted and look uneasily at the refractory student do the substance behind affect or do it not affect the surface to this precise and categorical question a kind of ultimatum juanito do not know what to reply and he coat offer no suggestion in vain he make sign to placido but placido himself be in doubt juanito then take advantage of a moment in which the professor be stare at a student who be cautiously and secretly take off the shoe that hurt he foot to step heavily on placido 's toe and whisper tell I hurry up tell I i distinguish -- get out what a ass you be yell placido unreservedly as he stare with angry eye and rub he hand over he patent-leather shoe the professor hear the cry stare at the pair and guess what have happen listen you meddler he address placido i be not question you but since you think you can save other let 's see if you can save yourself _ salva te ipsum _ and decide this question juanito sit down in content and as a mark of gratitude stick out he tongue at he prompter who have arise blush with shame and mutter incoherent excuse for a moment padre millon regard he as one gloat over a favorite dish what a good thing it would be to humiliate and hold up to ridicule that dudish boy always smartly dress with head erect and serene look it would be a deed of charity so the charitable professor apply himself to it with all he heart slowly repeat the question the book say that the metallic mirror be make of brass and a alloy of different metal -- be that true or be it not true so the book say padre _ liber dixit ergo ita est _ do not pretend that you know more than the book do it then add that the glass mirror be make of a sheet of glass whose two surface be well polished one of they have apply to it a amalgam of tin _ nota bene _ a amalgam of tin be that true if the book say so padre be tin a metal it seem so padre the book say so it be it be and the word amalgam mean that it be compound with mercury which be also a metal _ ergo _ a glass mirror be a metallic mirror _ ergo _ the term of the distinction be confuse _ ergo _ the classification be imperfect -- how do you explain that meddler he emphasize the _ ergo _ and the familiar you be with indescribable relish at the same time wink as though to say you be do for it mean that it mean that -- stammer placido it mean that you have not learn the lesson you petty meddler you do not understand it yourself and yet you prompt you neighbor the class take no offense but on the contrary many think the epithet funny and laugh placido bit he lip what be you name the professor ask he placido be the curt reply aha placido penitente although you look more like placido the prompter -- or the prompt but _ penitent _ i be go to impose some _ penance _ on you for you prompting please with he play on word he order the youth to recite the lesson and the latter in the state of mind to which he be reduce make more than three mistake shake he head up and down the professor slowly open the register and slowly scan it while he call off the name in a low voice palencium -- palomo -- panganiban -- pedraza -- pelado -- pelaez -- penitent aha placido penitente fifteen unexcused absence -- placido start up fifteen absence padre fifteen unexcused absence continue the professor so that you only lack one to be drop from the roll fifteen absence fifteen absence repeat placido in amazement i have never be absent more than four time and with today perhaps five jesso jesso monseer -lrb- 31 -rrb- reply the professor examine the youth over he gold eye-glass you confess that you have miss five time and god know if you may have miss oftener _ atquus _ as i rarely call the roll every time i catch any one i put five mark against he _ ergo _ how many be five time five have you forget the multiplication table five time five twenty-five correct correct thus you have still get away with ten because i have catch you only three time huh if i have catch you every time -- now how many be three time five fifteen fifteen right you be conclude the professor close the register if you miss once more -- out of door with you get out ah now a mark for the failure in the daily lesson he again open the register seek out the name and enter the mark come only one mark he say since you have not any before but padre exclaim placido restrain himself if you reverence put a mark against I for fail in the lesson you reverence owe it to I to erase the one for absence that you have put against I for today he reverence make no answer first he slowly enter the mark then contemplate it with he head on one side -- the mark must be artistic -- close the register and ask with great sarcasm _ abá _ and why so sir because i can not conceive padre how one can be absent from the class and at the same time recite the lesson in it you reverence be say that to be be not to be _ nakú _ a metaphysician but a rather premature one so you can not conceive of it eh _ sed patet experientium _ and _ contra experientiam negantem fusilibus est arguendum _ do you understand and can not you conceive with you philosophical head that one can be absent from the class and not know the lesson at the same time be it a fact that absence necessarily imply knowledge what do you say to that philosophaster this last epithet be the drop of water that make the full cup overflow placido enjoy among he friend the reputation of be a philosopher so he lose he patience throw down he book arise and face the professor enough padre enough you reverence can put all the mark against I that you wish but you have not the right to insult I you reverence may stay with the class i can not stand any more without further farewell he stalk away the class be astounded such a assumption of dignity have scarcely ever be see and who would have think it of placido penitente the surprised professor bit he lip and shake he head threateningly as he watch he depart then in a tremble voice he begin he preachment on the same old theme deliver however with more energy and more eloquence it deal with the grow arrogance the innate ingratitude the presumption the lack of respect for superior the pride that the spirit of darkness infuse in the young the lack of manners the absence of courtesy and so on from this he pass to coarse jest and sarcasm over the presumption which some good-for-nothing prompter have of teach they teacher by establish a academy for instruction in castilian aha aha he moralize those who the day before yesterday scarcely know how to say ` yes padre ' ` no padre ' now want to know more than those who have grow gray teach they he who wish to learn will learn academy or no academy undoubtedly that fellow who have just go out be one of those in the project castilian be in good hand with such guardian when be you go to get the time to attend the academy if you have scarcely enough to fulfill you duty in the regular class we wish that you may all know spanish and that you pronounce it well so that you will not split we ear-drum with you twist of expression and you ` p 's ' -lrb- 32 -rrb- but first business and then pleasure : finish you study first and afterwards learn castilian and all become clerk if you so wish so he go on with he harangue until the bell ring and the class be over the two hundred and thirty-four student after recite they prayer go out as ignorant as when they go in but breathe more freely as if a great weight have be lift from they each youth have lose another hour of he life and with it a portion of he dignity and self-respect and in exchange there be a increase of discontent of aversion to study of resentment in they heart after all this ask for knowledge dignity gratitude _ de nobis post haec tristi sententium fertur _ just as the two hundred and thirty-four spend they class hour so the thousand of student who precede they have spend theirs and if matter do not mend so will those yet to come spend theirs and be brutalize while wounded dignity and youthful enthusiasm will be convert into hatred and sloth like the wave that become polluted along one part of the shore and roll on one after another each in succession deposit a larger sediment of filth but yet he who from eternity watch the consequence of a deed develop like a thread through the loom of the century he who weigh the value of a second and have ordain for he creature as a elemental law progress and development he if he be just will demand a strict accounting from those who must render it of the million of intelligence darken and blind of human dignity trample upon in million of he creature and of the incalculable time lose and effort waste and if the teaching of the gospel be base on truth so also will these have to answer -- the million and million who do not know how to preserve the light of they intelligence and they dignity of mind as the master demand a accounting from the cowardly servant for the talent that he let be take from he chapter xiv in the house of the student the house where makaraig live be worth visit large and spacious with two entresol provide with elegant grating it seem to be a school during the first hour of the morning and pandemonium from ten o'clock on during the boarder ' recreation hour from the lower hallway of the spacious entrance up to the main floor there be a bubbling of laughter shout and movement boy in scanty clothing play _ sipa _ or practice gymnastic exercise on improvise trapeze while on the staircase a fight be in progress between eight or nine arm with cane stick and rope but neither attacker nor attack do any great damage they blow generally fall sidewise upon the shoulder of the chinese pedler who be there sell he outlandish mixture and indigestible pastry crowd of boy surround he pull at he already disorder queue snatch pie from he haggle over the price and commit a thousand deviltry the chinese yell swear forswore in all the language he could jabber not omit he own he whimper laugh plead put on a smile face when a ugly one would not serve or the reverse he curse they as devil savage _ no kilistano _ -lrb- 33 -rrb- but that matter nothing a whack would bring he face around smile and if the blow fall only upon he shoulder he would calmly continue he business transaction content himself with cry out to they that he be not in the game but if it strike the flat basket on which be place he wares then he would swear never to come again as he pour out upon they all the imprecation and anathema imaginable then the boy would redouble they effort to make he rage the more and when at last he vocabulary be exhaust and they be satiate with he fearful mixture they pay he religiously and send he away happy wink chuckle to himself and receive as caress the light blow from they cane that the student give he as token of farewell concert on the piano and violin the guitar and the accordion alternate with the continual clashing of blade from the fencing lesson around a long wide table the student of the ateneo prepare they composition or solve they problem by the side of other write to they sweetheart on pink perforated note-paper cover with drawing here one be compose a melodrama at the side of another practise on the flute from which he draw wheezy note over there the older boy student in professional course who affect silk sock and embroidered slipper amuse themselves in tease the smaller boy by pull they ear already red from repeat fillip while two or three hold down a little fellow who yell and cry defend himself with he foot against be reduce to the condition in which he be bear kick and howl in one room around a small table four be play _ revesino _ with laughter and joke to the great annoyance of another who pretend to be study he lesson but who be in reality wait he turn to play still another come in with exaggerated wonder scandalize as he approach the table how wicked you be so early in the morning and already gamble let 's see let 's see you fool take it with the three of spade close he book he too join in the game cry and blow be hear two boy be fight in the adjoining room -- a lame student who be very sensitive about he infirmity and a unhappy newcomer from the province who be just commence he study he be work over a treatise on philosophy and reading innocently in a loud voice with a wrong accent the cartesian principle : _ cogito ergo sum _ the little lame boy -lrb- _ el cojito _ -rrb- take this as a insult and the other intervene to restore peace but in reality only to sow discord and come to blow themselves in the dining-room a young man with a can of sardine a bottle of wine and the provision that he have just bring from he town be make heroic effort to the end that he friend might participate in he lunch while they be offer in they turn heroic resistance to he invitation other be bathing on the azotea play fireman with the water from the well and join in combat with pail of water to the great delight of the spectator but the noise and shout gradually die away with the come of lead student summon by makaraig to report to they the progress of the academy of castilian isaganus be cordially greet as be also the peninsular sandoval who have come to manila as a government employee and be finish he study and who have completely identify himself with the cause of the filipino student the barrier that politics have establish between the race have disappear in the schoolroom as though dissolve by the zeal of science and youth from lack of lyceum and scientific literary or political center sandoval take advantage of all the meeting to cultivate he great oratorical gift deliver speech and argue on any subject to draw forth applause from he friend and listener at that moment the subject of conversation be the instruction in castilian but as makaraig have not yet arrive conjecture be still the order of the day what can have happen what have the general decide have he refuse the permit have padre irene or padre sibylum win such be the question they ask one another question that could be answer only by makaraig among the young man gather together there be optimist like isaganus and sandoval who see the thing already accomplish and talk of congratulation and praise from the government for the patriotism of the student -- outburst of optimism that lead juanito pelaez to claim for himself a large part of the glory of found the society all this be answer by the pessimist pecson a chubby youth with a wide clownish grin who speak of outside influence whether the bishop a the padre b or the provincial c have be consult or not whether or not they have advise that the whole association should be put in jail -- a suggestion that make juanito pelaez so uneasy that he stammer out _ caramba _ do not you drag I into -- sandoval as a peninsular and a liberal become furious at this but pshaw he exclaim that be hold a bad opinion of he excellency i know that he be quite a friar-lover but in such a matter as this he will not let the friar interfere will you tell I pecson on what you base you belief that the general have no judgment of he own i do not say that sandoval reply pecson grin until he expose he wisdom-tooth for I the general have _ he own _ judgment that be the judgment of all those within he reach that be plain you be dodge -- cite I a fact cite I a fact cry sandoval let 's get away from hollow argument from empty phrase and get on the solid ground of fact -- this with a elegant gesture fact gentleman fact the rest be prejudice -- i will not call it filibusterism pecson smile like one of the bless as he retort there come the filibusterism but can not we enter into a discussion without resort to accusation sandoval protest in a little extemporaneous speech again demand fact well not long ago there be a dispute between some private person and certain friar and the act governor render a decision that it should be settle by the provincial of the order concerned reply pecson again break out into a laugh as though he be deal with a insignificant matter he cite name and date and promise document that would prove how justice be dispense but on what ground tell I this on what ground can they refuse permission for what plainly appear to be extremely useful and necessary ask sandoval pecson shrug he shoulder it be that it endanger the integrity of the fatherland he reply in the tone of a notary read a allegation that be pretty good what have the integrity of the fatherland to do with the rule of syntax the holy mother church have learn doctor -- what do i know perhaps it be fear that we may come to understand the law so that we can obey they what will become of the philippine on the day when we understand one another sandoval do not relish the dialectic and jest turn of the conversation along that path could rise no speech worth the while do not make a joke of thing he exclaim this be a serious matter the lord deliver I from joke when there be friar concerned but on what do you base -- on the fact that the hour for the class have to come at night continue pecson in the same tone as if he be quote known and recognize formula there may be invoke as a obstacle the immorality of the thing as be do in the case of the school at malolo another but do not the class of the academy of draw and the novenary and the procession cover themselves with the mantle of night the scheme affect the dignity of the university go on the chubby youth take no notice of the question affect nothing the university have to accommodate itself to the need of the student and grant that what be a university then be it a institution to discourage study have a few man band themselves together in the name of learning and instruction in order to prevent other from become enlighten the fact be that movement initiate from below be regard as discontent -- what about project that come from above interpolate one of the student there be the school of art and trade slowly slowly gentleman protest sandoval i be not a friar-lover my liberal view be well know but render unto caesar that which be caesar 's of that school of art and trade of which i have be the most enthusiastic supporter and the realization of which i shall greet as the first streak of dawn for these fortunate island of that school of art and trade the friar have take charge -- or the cat of the canary which amount to the same thing add pecson in he turn interrupt the speech get out cry sandoval enraged at the interruption which have cause he to lose the thread of he long well-rounded sentence as long as we hear nothing bad let 's not be pessimist let 's not be unjust doubt the liberty and independence of the government here he enter upon a defense in beautiful phraseology of the government and its good intention a subject that pecson dare not break in upon the spanish government he say among other thing have give you everything it have deny you nothing we have absolutism in spain and you have absolutism here the friar cover we soil with convento and convento occupy a third part of manila in spain the garrote prevail and here the garrote be the extreme punishment we be catholic and we have make you catholic we be scholastic and scholasticism shed its light in you college hall in short gentleman we weep when you weep we suffer when you suffer we have the same altar the same court the same punishment and it be only just that we should give you we rights and we joy as no one interrupt he he become more and more enthusiastic until he come to speak of the future of the philippine as i have say gentleman the dawn be not far distant spain be now break the eastern sky for she beloved philippine and the time be change as i positively know faster than we imagine this government which accord to you be vacillate and weak should be strengthen by we confidence that we may make it see that it be the custodian of we hope let we remind it by we conduct -lrb- should it ever forget itself which i do not believe can happen -rrb- that we have faith in its good intention and that it should be guide by no other standard than justice and the welfare of all the govern no gentleman he go on in a tone more and more declamatory we must not admit at all in this matter the possibility of a consultation with other more or less hostile entity as such a supposition would imply we resignation to the fact you conduct up to the present have be frank loyal without vacillation above suspicion you have address it simply and directly the reason you have present could not be more sound you aim be to lighten the labor of the teacher in the first year and to facilitate study among the hundred of student who fill the college hall and for whom one solitary professor can not suffice if up to the present the petition have not be grant it have be for the reason as i feel sure that there have be a great deal of material accumulate but i predict that the campaign be win that the summons of makaraig be to announce to we the victory and tomorrow we shall see we effort crown with the applause and appreciation of the country and who know gentleman but that the government may confer upon you some handsome decoration of merit benefactor as you be of the fatherland enthusiastic applause resound all immediately believe in the triumph and many in the decoration let it be remember gentleman observe juanito that i be one of the first to propose it the pessimist pecson be not so enthusiastic just so we do not get that decoration on we ankle he remark but fortunately for pelaez this comment be not hear in the midst of the applause when they have quiet down a little pecson reply good good very good but one supposition : if in spite of all that the general consult and consult and consult and afterwards refuse the permit this question fall like a dash of cold water all turn to sandoval who be take aback then -- he stammer then then he exclaim in a burst of enthusiasm still excite by the applause see that in write and in print it boast of desire you enlightenment and yet hinder and deny it when call upon to make it a reality -- then gentleman you effort will not have be in vain you will have accomplish what no one else have be able to do make they drop the mask and fling down the gauntlet to you bravo bravo cry several enthusiastically good for sandoval hurrah for the gauntlet add other let they fling down the gauntlet to we repeat pecson disdainfully but afterwards sandoval seem to be cut short in he triumph but with the vivacity peculiar to he race and he oratorical temperament he have a immediate reply afterwards he ask afterwards if none of the filipino dare to accept the challenge then i sandoval in the name of spain will take up the gauntlet because such a policy would give the lie to the good intention that she have always cherish toward she province and because he who be thus faithless to the trust repose in he and abuse he unlimited authority deserve neither the protection of the fatherland nor the support of any spanish citizen the enthusiasm of he hearer break all bound isagani embrace he the other follow he example they talk of the fatherland of union of fraternity of fidelity the filipino declare that if there be only sandoval in spain all would be sandoval in the philippine he eye glisten and it might well be believe that if at that moment any kind of gauntlet have be fling at he he would have leap upon any kind of horse to ride to death for the philippine the cold water alone reply : good that be very good sandoval i could also say the same if i be a peninsular but not be one if i should say one half of what you have you yourself would take I for a filibuster sandoval begin a speech in protest but be interrupted rejoice friend rejoice victory cry a youth who enter at that moment and begin to embrace everybody rejoice friend long live the castilian tongue a outburst of applause greet this announcement they fall to embrace one another and they eye fill with tear pecson alone preserve he skeptical smile the bearer of such good news be makaraig the young man at the head of the movement this student occupy in that house by himself two room luxuriously furnished and have he servant and a cochero to look after he carriage and horse he be of robust carriage of refined manners fastidiously dress and very rich although study law only that he might have a academic degree he enjoy a reputation for diligence and as a logician in the scholastic way have no cause to envy the most frenzied quibbler of the university faculty nevertheless he be not very far behind in regard to modern idea and progress for he fortune enable he to have all the book and magazine that a watchful censor be unable to keep out with these qualification and he reputation for courage he fortunate association in he earlier year and he refined and delicate courtesy it be not strange that he should exercise such great influence over he associate and that he should have be choose to carry out such a difficult undertaking as that of the instruction in castilian after the first outburst of enthusiasm which in youth always take hold in such exaggerated form since youth find everything beautiful they want to be inform how the affair have be manage i see padre irene this morning say makaraig with a certain air of mystery hurrah for padre irene cry a enthusiastic student padre irene continue makaraig have tell I about everything that take place at lo baños it seem that they dispute for at least a week he support and defend we case against all of they against padre sibylum padre fernandez padre salvi the general the jeweler simoun -- the jeweler simoun interrupt one of he listener what have that jew to do with the affair of we country we enrich he by buy -- keep quiet admonished another impatiently anxious to learn how padre irene have be able to overcome such formidable opponent there be even high official who be oppose to we project the head secretary the civil governor quiroga the chinaman -- quiroga the chinaman the pimp of the -- shut up at last resume makaraig they be go to pigeonhole the petition and let it sleep for month and month when padre irene remember the superior commission of primary instruction and propose since the matter concern the teaching of the castilian tongue that the petition be refer to that body for a report upon it but that commission have not be in operation for a long time observe pecson that be exactly what they reply to padre irene and he answer that this be a good opportunity to revive it and avail himself of the presence of don custodio one of its member he propose on the spot that a committee should be appoint don custodio 's activity be know and recognize he be name as arbiter and the petition be now in he hand he promise that he would settle it this month hurrah for don custodio but suppose don custodio should report unfavorably upon it inquire the pessimist pecson upon this they have not reckon be intoxicate with the thought that the matter would not be pigeonhole so they all turn to makaraig to learn how it could be arrange the same objection i present to padre irene but with he sly smile he say to I : ` we have win a great deal we have succeed in get the matter on the road to a decision the opposition see itself force to join battle ' if we can bring some influence to bear upon don custodio so that he in accordance with he liberal tendency may report favorably all be win for the general show himself to be absolutely neutral makaraig pause and a impatient listener ask how can we influence he padre irene point out to I two way -- quiroga some one suggest pshaw great use quiroga -- a fine present no that will not do for he pride himself upon be incorruptible ah yes i know exclaimed pecson with a laugh pepay the dancing girl ah yes pepay the dancing girl echo several this pepay be a showy girl suppose to be a great friend of don custodio to she resort the contractor the employee the intriguer when they want to get something from the celebrated councilor juanito pelaez who be also a great friend of the dancing girl offer to look after the matter but isagani shake he head say that it be sufficient that they have make use of padre irene and that it would be go too far to avail themselves of pepay in such a affair show we the other way the other way be to apply to he attorney and adviser señor pasta the oracle before whom don custodio bow i prefer that say isagani señor pasta be a filipino and be a schoolmate of my uncle 's but how can we interest he there be the _ quid _ reply makaraig look earnestly at isagani señor pasta have a dancing girl -- i mean a seamstress isaganus again shake he head do not be such a puritan juanito pelaez say to he the end justify the means i know the seamstress matea for she have a shop where a lot of girl work no gentleman declare isaganus let 's first employ decent method i 'll go to señor pasta and if i do not accomplish anything then you can do what you wish with the dancing girl and seamstress they have to accept this proposition agree that isaganus should talk to señor pasta that very day and in the afternoon report to he associate at the university the result of the interview chapter xv señor pasta isaganus present himself in the house of the lawyer one of the most talented mind in manila whom the friar consult in they great difficulty the youth have to wait some time on account of the numerous client but at last he turn come and he enter the office or _ bufete _ as it be generally call in the philippine the lawyer receive he with a slight cough look down furtively at he foot but he do not rise or offer a seat as he go on write this give isaganus a opportunity for observation and careful study of the lawyer who have age greatly he hair be gray and he baldness extend over nearly the whole crown of he head he countenance be sour and austere there be complete silence in the study except for the whisper of the clerk and understudy who be at work in a adjoining room they pen scratch as though quarrel with the paper at length the lawyer finish what he be write lay down he pen raise he head and recognize the youth let he face light up with a smile as he extend he hand affectionately welcome young man but sit down and excuse I for i do not know that it be you how be you uncle isaganus take courage believe that he case would get on well he related briefly what have be do the while study the effect of he word señor pasta listen impassively at first and although he be inform of the effort of the student pretend ignorance as if to show that he have nothing to do with such childish matter but when he begin to suspect what be want of he and hear mention of the vice-rector friar the captain-general a project and so on he face slowly darken and he finally exclaim this be the land of project but go on go on isaganus be not yet discourage he speak of the manner in which a decision be to be reach and conclude with a expression of the confidence which the young man entertain that he señor pasta would _ intercede _ in they behalf in case don custodio should consult he as be to be expect he do not dare to say would _ advise _ deter by the wry face the lawyer put on but señor pasta have already form he resolution and it be not to mix at all in the affair either as consulter or consult he be familiar with what have occur at lo baños he know that there exist two faction and that padre irene be not the only champion on the side of the student nor have he be the one who propose submit the petition to the commission of primary instruction but quite the contrary padre irene padre fernandez the countess a merchant who expect to sell the material for the new academy and the high official who have be cite royal decree after royal decree be about to triumph when padre sibylum wish to gain time have think of the commission all these fact the great lawyer have present in he mind so that when isaganus have finish speak he determine to confuse he with evasion tangle the matter up and lead the conversation to other subject yes he say purse he lip and scratch he head there be no one who surpass I in love for the country and in aspiration toward progress but -- i can not compromise myself i do not know whether you clearly understand my position a position that be very delicate i have so many interest i have to labor within the limit of strict prudence it be a risk -- the lawyer seek to bewilder the youth with a exuberance of word so he go on speaking of law and decree and talk so much that instead of confuse the youth he come very near to entangle himself in a labyrinth of citation in no way do we wish to compromise you reply isaganus with great calmness god deliver we from injure in the least the person whose life be so useful to the rest of the filipino but as little versed as i may be in the law royal decree writ and resolution that obtain in this country i can not believe that there can be any harm in further the high purpose of the government in try to secure a proper interpretation of these purpose we be seek the same end and differ only about the mean the lawyer smile for the youth have allow himself to wander away from the subject and there where the former be go to entangle he he have already entangled himself that be exactly the _ quid _ as be vulgarly say it be clear that it be laudable to aid the government when one aid it submissively follow out its desire and the true spirit of the law in agreement with the just belief of the govern power and when not in contradiction to the fundamental and general way of thinking of the person to whom be intrust the common welfare of the individual that form a social organism therefore it be criminal it be punishable because it be offensive to the high principle of authority to attempt any action contrary to its initiative even suppose it to be better than the governmental proposition because such action would injure its prestige which be the elementary basis upon which all colonial edifice rest confident that this broadside have at least stunned isaganus the old lawyer fall back in he armchair outwardly very serious but laugh to himself isagani however venture to reply i should think that government the more they be threaten would be all the more careful to seek basis that be impregnable the basis of prestige for colonial government be the weakest of all since it do not depend upon themselves but upon the consent of the govern while the latter be willing to recognize it the basis of justice or reason would seem to be the most durable the lawyer raise he head how be this -- do that youth dare to reply and argue with he _ he _ señor pasta be he not yet bewilder with he big word young man you must put those consideration aside for they be dangerous he declare with a wave of he hand what i advise be that you let the government attend to its own business government be establish for the welfare of the people and in order to accomplish this purpose properly they have to follow the suggestion of the citizen who be the one best qualify to understand they own need those who constitute the government be also citizen and among the most enlighten but be man they be fallible and ought not to disregard the opinion of other they must be trust they have to attend to everything there be a spanish proverb which say ` no tear no milk ' in other word ` to he who do not ask nothing be give ' quite the reverse reply the lawyer with a sarcastic smile with the government exactly the reverse occur -- but he suddenly check himself as if he have say too much and wish to correct he imprudence the government have give we thing that we have not ask for and that we could not ask for because to ask -- to ask presuppose that it be in some way incompetent and consequently be not perform its function to suggest to it a course of action to try to guide it when not really antagonize it be to presuppose that it be capable of err and as i have already say to you such supposition be menace to the existence of colonial government the common crowd overlook this and the young man who set to work thoughtlessly do not know do not comprehend do not try to comprehend the counter-effect of ask the menace to order there be in that idea -- pardon I interrupt isaganus offend by the argument the jurist be use with he but when by legal method people ask a government for something it be because they think it good and disposed to grant a blessing and such action instead of irritating it should flatter it -- to the mother one appeal never to the stepmother the government in my humble opinion be not a omniscient be that can see and anticipate everything and even if it could it ought not to feel offended for here you have the church itself do nothing but ask and beg of god who see and know everything and you yourself ask and demand many thing in the court of this same government yet neither god nor the court have yet take offense every one realize that the government be the human institution that it be need the support of all the people it need to be make to see and feel the reality of thing you yourself be not convince of the truth of you objection you yourself know that it be a tyrannical and despotic government which in order to make a display of force and independence deny everything through fear or distrust and that the tyrannize and enslave people be the only one whose duty it be never to ask for anything a people that hate its government ought to ask for nothing but that it abdicate its power the old lawyer grimace and shake he head from side to side in sign of discontent while he rub he hand over he bald pate and say in a tone of condescend pity : ahem those be bad doctrine bad theory ahem how plain it be that you be young and inexperienced in life look what be happen with the inexperienced young man who in madrid be ask for so many reform they be accuse of filibusterism many of they do not dare return here and yet what be they ask for thing holy ancient and recognize as quite harmless but there be matter that can not be explain they be so delicate let 's see -- i confess to you that there be other reason besides those express that might lead a sensible government to deny systematically the wish of the people -- no -- but it may happen that we find ourselves under ruler so fatuous and ridiculous -- but there be always other reason even though what be ask be quite just -- different government encounter different condition -- the old man hesitate stare fixedly at isaganus and then with a sudden resolution make a sign with he hand as though he would dispel some idea i can guess what you mean say isaganus smile sadly you mean that a colonial government for the very reason that it be imperfectly constitute and that it be base on premise -- no no not that no quickly interrupted the old lawyer as he seek for something among he papers no i mean -- but where be my spectacles there they be reply isaganus the old man put they on and pretend to look over some papers but see that the youth be wait he mumble i want to tell you something i want to say -- but it have slip from my mind you interrupt I in you eagerness -- but it be a insignificant matter if you only know what a whirl my head be in i have so much to do isagani understand that he be be dismiss so he say rise we -- ah you will do well to leave the matter in the hand of the government which will settle it as it see fit you say that the vice-rector be oppose to the teaching of castilian perhaps he may be not as to the fact but as to the form it be say that the rector who be on he way will bring a project for reform in education wait a while give time a chance apply yourself to you study as the examination be near and -- _ caramba _ -- you who already speak castilian and express yourself easily what be you bother yourself about what interest have you in see it specially teach surely padre florentino think as i do give he my regard my uncle reply isaganus have always admonish I to think of other as much as of myself i do not come for myself i come in the name of those who be in worse condition what the devil let they do as you have do let they singe they eyebrow study and come to be bald like myself stuff whole paragraph into they memory i believe that if you talk spanish it be because you have study it -- you be not of manila or of spanish parent then let they learn it as you have and do as i have do : i have be a servant to all the friar i have prepare they chocolate and while with my right hand i stir it with the left i hold a grammar i learn and thank god have never need other teacher or academy or permit from the government believe I he who wish to learn learn and become wise but how many among those who wish to learn come to be what you be one in ten thousand and more pish why any more retort the old man shrug he shoulder there be too many lawyer now many of they become mere clerk doctor they insult and abuse one another and even kill each other in competition for a patient laborer sir laborer be what we need for agriculture isaganus realize that he be lose time but still could not forbear reply : undoubtedly there be many doctor and lawyer but i will not say there be too many since we have town that lack they entirely and if they do abound in quantity perhaps they be deficient in quality since the young man can not be prevent from study and no other profession be open to we why let they waste they time and effort and if the instruction deficient as it be do not keep many from become lawyer and doctor if we must finally have they why not have good one after all even if the sole wish be to make the country a country of farmer and laborer and condemn in it all intellectual activity i do not see any evil in enlighten those same farmer and laborer in give they at least a education that will aid they in perfect themselves and in perfect they work in place they in a condition to understand many thing of which they be at present ignorant bah bah bah exclaim the lawyer draw circle in the air with he hand to dispel the idea suggest to be a good farmer no great amount of rhetoric be need dream illusion fancy eh will you take a piece of advice he arise and place he hand affectionately on the youth 's shoulder as he continue : i be go to give you one and a very good one because i see that you be intelligent and the advice will not be waste you be go to study medicine well confine yourself to learn how to put on plaster and apply leech and do not ever try to improve or impair the condition of you kind when you become a licentiate marry a rich and devout girl try to make cure and charge well shun everything that have any relation to the general state of the country attend mass confession and communion when the rest do and you will see afterwards how you will thank I and i shall see it if i be still alive always remember that charity begin at home for man ought not to seek on earth more than the greatest amount of happiness for himself as bentham say if you involve yourself in quixotism you will have no career nor will you get marry nor will you ever amount to anything all will abandon you you own countryman will be the first to laugh at you simplicity believe I you will remember I and see that i be right when you have gray hair like myself gray hair such as these here the old lawyer stroke he scanty white hair as he smile sadly and shake he head when i have gray hair like those sir reply isaganus with equal sadness and turn my gaze back over my past and see that i have work only for myself without have do what i plainly could and should have do for the country that have give I everything for the citizen that have help I to live -- then sir every gray hair will be a thorn and instead of rejoice they will shame I so say he take he leave with a profound bow the lawyer remain motionless in he place with a amaze look on he face he listen to the footfall that gradually die away then resume he seat poor boy he murmur similar thought also cross my mind once what more could any one desire than to be able to say : ' i have do this for the good of the fatherland i have consecrate my life to the welfare of other ' a crown of laurel steep in aloe dry leave that cover thorn and worm that be not life that do not get we we daily bread nor do it bring we honor -- the laurel would hardly serve for a salad nor produce ease nor aid we in win lawsuit but quite the reverse every country have its code of ethic as it have its climate and its disease different from the climate and the disease of other country after a pause he add : poor boy if all should think and act as he do i do not say but that -- poor boy poor florentino chapter xvi the tribulation of a chinese in the evening of that same Saturday

advisability of a chinese consulate in manila intimate that to manage it there could be no one but quiroga be the señor gonzalez who hide behind the pseudonym _ pitilí _ when he attack chinese

's nephew four rejoin a clerk what a commission suppose they disagree -- be they competent that be what i ask reply a clerk it be say that one civilian ought to go one who have no military prejudice -- a shoemaker for instance that be right add a importer of shoe but it would not do to send a indian or a chinaman and the only peninsular shoemaker demand such large fee -- but why do they have to make any investigation about footwear inquire the elderly lady it be not for the peninsular artilleryman the indian soldier can go barefoot as they do in they town -lrb- 38 -rrb- exactly so and the treasury would save more corroborate another lady a widow who be not satisfy with she pension but you must remember remark another in the group a friend of the officer on the commission that while it be true they go barefoot in the town it be not the same as move about under order in the service they can not choose the hour nor the road nor rest when they wish remember madam that with the noonday sun overhead and the earth below bake like a oven they have to march over sandy stretch where there be stone the sun above and fire below bullet in front -- it be only a question of get use to it like the donkey that get use to not eat in we present campaign the greater part of we loss have be due to wound on the sole of the foot remember the donkey madam remember the donkey but my dear sir retort the lady look how much money be waste on shoe-leather there be enough to pension many widow and orphan in order to maintain we prestige do not smile for i be not talk about myself and i have my pension even though a very small one insignificant consider the service my husband render but i be talk of other who be drag out miserable life it be not right that after so much persuasion to come and so many hardship in cross the sea they should end here by die of hunger what you say about the soldier may be true but the fact be that i have be in the country more than three year and i have not see any soldier limp in that i agree with the lady say she neighbor why issue they shoe when they be bear without they and why shirt and why trousers just calculate what we should economize on soldier clothe only in they skin conclude he who be defend the army in another group the conversation be more heated ben-zayb be talk and declaim while padre camorra as usual be constantly interrupt he the friar-journalist in spite of he respect for the cowled gentry be always at loggerheads with padre camorra whom he regard as a silly half-friar thus give himself the appearance of be independent and refute the accusation of those who call he fray ibañez padre camorra like he adversary as the latter be the only person who would take seriously what he style he argument they be discuss magnetism spiritualism magic and the like they word fly through the air like the knife and ball of juggler toss back and forth from one to the other that year great attention have be attract in the quiapo fair by a head wrongly call a sphinx exhibit by mr leed a american glaring advertisement cover the wall of the house mysterious and funereal to excite the curiosity of the public neither ben-zayb nor any of the padre have yet see it juanito pelaez be the only one who have and he be describe he wonderment to the party ben-zayb as a journalist look for a natural explanation padre camorra talk of the devil padre irene smile padre salvus remain grave but padre the devil do not need to come -- we be sufficient to damn ourselves -- it can not be explain any other way if science -- get out with science _ puñales _ but listen to I and i 'll convince you it be all a question of optics i have not yet see the head nor do i know how it look but this gentleman -- indicate juanito pelaez -- tell we that it do not look like the talk head that be usually exhibit so be it but the principle be the same -- it be all a question of optics wait a mirror be place thus another mirror behind it the image be reflect -- i say it be purely a problem in physics take down from the wall several mirror he arrange they turn they round and round but not get the desire result conclude : as i say it be nothing more or less than a question of optics but what do you want mirror for if juanito tell we that the head be inside a box place on the table i see in it spiritualism because the spiritualist always make use of table and i think that padre salvus as the ecclesiastical governor ought to prohibit the exhibition padre salvus remain silent say neither yes nor no in order to learn if there be devil or mirror inside it suggest simoun the best thing would be for you to go and see the famous sphinx the proposal be a good one so it be accept although padre salvus and don custodio show some repugnance they at a fair to rub shoulder with the public to see sphinx and talk head what would the native say these might take they for mere man endow with the same passion and weakness as other but ben-zayb with he journalistic ingenuity promise to request mr leed not to admit the public while they be inside they would be honor he sufficiently by the visit not to admit of he refusal and besides he would not charge any admission fee to give a show of probability to this he conclude : because remember if i should expose the trick of the mirror to the public it would ruin the poor american 's business ben-zayb be a conscientious individual about a dozen set out among they we acquaintance padre salvi camorra and irene don custodio ben-zayb and juanito pelaez they carriage set they down at the

represent in all shape and size the costume race and occupation of the country : indian spaniard chinese mestizo friar clergyman government clerk gobernadorcillo student soldier and so on whether the artist have more affection for the priest the fold of whose habit be better suit to they esthetic purpose or whether the friar hold such a important place in philippine life engage the attention of the sculptor more the fact be that for one cause or another image of they abound well-turned and finish represent they in the sublimest moment of they life -- the opposite of what be do in europe where they be picture as sleep on cask of wine playing card empty tankard rouse themselves to gaiety or pat the cheek of a buxom girl no the friar of the philippine be different : elegant handsome well-dressed they tonsure neatly shave they feature symmetrical and serene they gaze meditative they expression saintly somewhat rosy-cheeked cane in hand and patent-leather shoe on they foot invite adoration and a place in a glass case instead of the symbol of gluttony and incontinence of they brethren in europe those of manila carry the book the crucifix and the palm of martyrdom instead of kiss the simple country lass those of manila gravely extend the hand to be kiss by child and grow man double over almost to kneel instead of the full refectory and dining-hall they stage in europe in manila they have the oratory the study-table instead of the mendicant friar who go from door to door with he donkey and sack beg alms the friar of the philippine scatter gold from full hand among the miserable indian look here 's padre camorra exclaim ben-zayb upon whom the effect of the champagne still linger he point to a picture of a lean friar of thoughtful mien who be seat at a table with he head rest on the palm of he hand apparently write a sermon by the light of a lamp the contrast suggest draw laughter from the crowd padre camorra who have already forget about paulita see what be mean and laugh he clownish laugh ask in turn whom do this other figure resemble ben-zayb it be a old woman with one eye with disheveled hair seat on the ground like a indian idol iron clothes the sad-iron be carefully imitate be of copper with coal of red tinsel and smoke-wreath of dirty twisted cotton eh ben-zayb it be not a fool who design that ask padre camorra with a laugh well i do not see the point reply the journalist but _ puñales _ do not you see the title _ the philippine press _ that utensil with which the old woman be iron be here call the press all laugh at this ben-zayb himself join in good-naturedly two soldier of the civil guard appropriately label be place behind a man who be tightly bind and have he face cover by he hat it be entitle _ the country of abaka _ -lrb- 39 -rrb- and from appearance they be go to shoot he many of we visitor be displeased with the exhibition they talk of rule of art they seek proportion -- one say that this figure do not have seven head that the face lack a nose have only three all of which make padre camorra somewhat thoughtful for he do not comprehend how a figure to be correct need have four nose and seven head other say if they be muscular that they could not be indian still other remark that it be not sculpture but mere carpentry each add he spoonful of criticism until padre camorra not to be outdo venture to ask for at least thirty leg for each doll because if the other want nose could not he require foot so they fall to discuss whether the indian have or have not any aptitude for sculpture and whether it would be advisable to encourage that art until there arise a general dispute which be cut short by don custodio 's declaration that the indian have the aptitude but that they should devote themselves exclusively to the manufacture of saint one would say observe ben-zayb who be full of bright idea that night that this chinaman be quiroga but on close examination it look like padre irene and what do you say about that british indian he look like simoun fresh peal of laughter resound while padre irene rub he nose that be right it be the very image of he but where be simoun simoun should buy it but the jeweler have disappear unnoticed by any one _ puñales _ exclaim padre camorra how stingy the american be he be afraid we would make he pay the admission for all of we into mr leed ' show no rejoin ben-zayb what he be afraid of be that he 'll compromise himself he may have foresee the joke in store for he friend mr leed and have get out of the way thus without purchase the least trifle they continue on they way to see the famous sphinx ben-zayb offer to manage the affair for the american would not rebuff a journalist who could take revenge in a unfavorable article you 'll see that it be all a question of mirror he say because you see -- again he plunge into a long demonstration and as he have no mirror at hand to discredit he theory he tangle himself up in all kind of blunder and wind up by not know himself what he be say in short you 'll see how it be all a question of optics chapter xviii legerdemain mr leed a genuine yankee dress completely in black receive he visitor with great deference he speak spanish well from have be for many year in south america and offer no objection to they request say that they might examine everything both before and after the exhibition but

merry visitor the joke die away they speak in whisper and however much some try to appear indifferent they lip frame no smile all feel as if they have enter a house where there be a corpse a illusion accentuate by a odor of wax and incense don custodio and padre salvus consult in whisper over the expediency of prohibit such show ben-zayb in order to cheer the dispirited group and embarrass mr leed say to he in a familiar tone : eh mister since there be none but ourselves here and we be not indian who can be fool will not you let we see the trick we know of course that it be purely a question of optics but as padre camorra will not be convince -- here he start to jump over the rail instead of go through the proper opening while padre camorra break out into protest fear that ben-zayb might be right and why not sir rejoin the american but do not break anything will you the journalist be already on the platform you will allow I then he ask and without wait for the permission fear that it might not be grant raise the cloth to look for the mirror that he expect should be between the leg of the table ben-zayb utter a exclamation and step back again place both hand under the table and wave they about he encounter only empty space the table have three thin iron leg sink into the floor the journalist look all about as though seek something where be the mirror asked padre camorra ben-zayb look and look feel the table with he finger raise the cloth again and rub he hand over he forehead from time to time as if try to remember something have you lose anything inquire mr leed the mirror mister where be the mirror i do not know where yours be -- mine be at the hotel do you want to look at yourself you be somewhat pale and excited many laugh in spite of they weird impression on see the jest coolness of the american while ben-zayb retire quite abashed to he seat mutter it can not be you 'll see that he do not do it without mirror the table will have to be change later mr leed place the cloth on the table again and turn toward he illustrious audience ask they be you satisfy may we begin hurry up how cold-blooded he be say the widow then lady and gentleman take you seat and

for i think that i have find a royal mummy but what be my disappointment on open the coffin at the cost of infinite labor to find nothing more than this box which you may examine he hand the box to those in the front row padre camorra draw back in loathing padre salvus look at it closely as if he enjoy sepulchral thing padre irene smile a know smile don custodio affect gravity and disdain while ben-zayb hunt for he mirror -- there they must be for it be a question of mirror it smell like a corpse observe one lady fan herself furiously ugh it smell of forty century remark some one with emphasis ben-zayb forget about he mirror to discover who have make this remark it be a military official who have read the history of napoleon ben-zayb feel jealous and to utter another epigram that

he sleeve at the terrify look of the sinner hold he nose and padre salvus -- the same padre salvus who have on all soul ' day prepare a phantasmagoria of the soul in purgatory with flame and transparency illuminate with alcohol lamp and cover with tinsel on the high altar of the church in a suburb in order to get alms and order for mass -- the lean and taciturn padre salvus hold he breath and gaze suspiciously at that handful of ash _ memento homo quia pulvis es _ mutter padre irene with a smile pish sneer ben-zayb -- the same thought have occur to he and the canon have take the word out of he mouth not know what to do resume mr leed close the box carefully i examine the papyrus and discover two word whose meaning be unknown to I i decipher they and try to pronounce they aloud

box close the head disappear and in its place i again find the handful of ash without suspect it i have discover the two most potent word in nature the word of creation and destruction of life and of death he pause for a few moment to note the effect of he story then with grave and measure step approach the table and place the mysterious box upon it the cloth mister exclaim the incorrigible

house in the escolta just at the moment when the clock be striking half-past ten two hour later placido leave the jeweler 's house and walk gravely and thoughtfully along the escolta then almost desert in spite of the fact that the cafés be still quite animated now and then a carriage pass rapidly clatter noisily over the worn pavement from a room in he house that overlook the pasig simoun turn he gaze toward the walled city which could be see through the open window with its roof of galvanized iron gleam in the moonlight and its somber tower show dull and gloomy in the midst of the serene night he lay aside he blue goggles and he white hair like a frame of silver surround he energetic bronzed feature dimly light by a lamp whose flame be die out from lack of oil apparently wrap in thought he take no notice of the fading light and impending darkness within a few day he murmur when on all side that accurse city be burn den of presumptuous nothingness and impious exploitation

another revolution will sweep I into you arm and revive I that moon before reach the apogee of its brilliance will light the philippine cleanse of loathsome filth simoun stop suddenly as though interrupt a voice in he inner consciousness be ask if he simoun be not also a part of the filth of that accursed city perhaps its most poisonous ferment like the dead who be to rise at the sound of the last trumpet a thousand bloody specter -- desperate shades of murder man woman violate father tear from they family vice stimulate and encourage virtue mock now rise in answer to the mysterious question for the first time in he criminal career since in havana he have by means of corruption and bribery set out to fashion a instrument for the execution of he plan -- a man without faith patriotism or conscience -- for the first time in that life something within rise up and protest against he action he close he eye and remain for some time motionless then rub he hand over he forehead try to be deaf to he conscience and feel fear creep over he no he must not analyze himself he lack the courage to turn he gaze toward he past the idea of he courage he conviction he self-confidence fail he at the very moment when he work be set before he as the ghost of the wretch in whose misfortune he have take a hand continue to hover before he eye as if issue from the shine surface of the river to invade the room with appeal and hand extend toward he as reproach and lament seem to fill the air with threat and cry for vengeance he turn he gaze from the window and for the first time begin to tremble no i must be ill i can not be feel well he mutter there be many who hate I who ascribe they misfortune to I but -- he feel he forehead begin to burn so he arise to approach the window and inhale the fresh night breeze below he the pasig drag along its silvered stream on whose bright surface the foam glitter wind slowly about recede and advance follow the course of the little eddy the city loom up on the opposite bank and its black wall look fateful mysterious lose they sordidness in the moonlight that idealize and embellish everything but again simoun shiver he seem to see before he the severe countenance of he father die in prison but die for have do good then the face of another man severer still who have give he life for he because he believe that he be go to bring about the regeneration of he country no i can not turn back he exclaim wipe the perspiration from he forehead the work be at hand and its success will justify I if i have conduct myself as you do i should have succumb nothing of idealism nothing of fallacious theory fire and steel to the cancer chastisement to vice and afterwards destroy the instrument if it be bad no i have plan well but now i feel feverish my reason waver it be natural -- if i have do ill it have be that i may do good and the end justify the means what i will do be not to expose myself -- with he thought thus confuse he lay down and try to fall asleep on the follow morning placido listen submissively with a smile on he lip to he mother 's preachment when she speak of she plan of interesting the augustinian procurator he do not protest or object but on the contrary offer himself to carry it out in order to save trouble for he mother whom he beg to return at once to the province that very day if possible cabesang andang ask he the reason for such haste because -- because if the procurator learn that you be here he will not do anything until you send he a present and order some mass chapter xx the arbiter true it be that padre irene have say : the question of the academy of castilian so long before broach be on the road to a solution don custodio the active don custodio the most active of all the arbiter in the world accord to ben-zayb be occupy with it spend he day read the petition and fall asleep without reach any decision wake on the follow day to repeat the same performance drop off to sleep again and so on continuously how the good man labor the most active of all the arbiter in the world he wish to get out of the predicament by please everybody -- the friar the high official the countess padre irene and he own liberal principle he have consult with señor pasta and señor pasta have leave he stupefied and confuse after advise he to do a million contradictory and impossible thing he have consult with pepay the dancing girl and pepay who have no idea what he be talk about execute a pirouette and ask he for twenty-five peso to bury a aunt of hers who have suddenly die for the fifth time or the fifth aunt who have suddenly die accord to fuller explanation at the same time request that he get a cousin of hers who could read write and play the violin a job as assistant on the public work -- all thing that be far from inspiring don custodio with any save idea two day after the event in the quiapo fair don custodio be as usual busily study the petition without hit upon the happy solution while he yawn cough smoke and think about pepay 's leg and she pirouette let we give some account of this exalted personage in order to understand padre sibylum 's reason for propose he as the arbiter of such a vexatious matter and why the other clique accept he don custodio de salazar y sanchez de monteredondo often refer to as _ good authority _ belong to that class of manila society which can not take a step without have the newspaper heap title upon they call each _ indedefatigable distinguished zealous active profound intelligent well-informed influential _ and so on as if they fear that he might be confuse with some idle and ignorant possessor of the same name besides no harm result from it and the watchful censor be not disturb the _ good authority _ result from he friendship with ben-zayb when the latter in he two noisiest controversy which he carry on for week and month in the column of the newspaper about whether it be proper to wear a high hat a derby or a _ salakot _ and whether the plural of _ carácter _ should be _ carácteres _ or _ caractéres _ in order to strengthen he argument always come out with we have this on good authority we learn this from good authority later let it be know for in manila everything become known that this _ good authority _ be no other than don custodio de salazar y sanchez de monteredondo he have come to manila very young with a good position that have enable he to marry a pretty mestiza belong to one of the wealthiest family of the city as he have natural talent boldness and great self-possession and know how to make use of the society in which he find himself he launch into business with he wife 's money fill contract for the government by reason of which he be make alderman afterwards alcalde member of the economic society -lrb- 43 -rrb- councilor of the administration president of the directory of the _ obras pias _ -lrb- 44 -rrb- member of the society of mercy director of the spanish-filipino bank etc etc nor be these _ etceteras _ to be take like those ordinarily place after a long enumeration of title : don custodio although never have see a treatise on hygiene come to be vice-chairman of the board of health for the truth be that of the eight who compose this board only one have to be a physician and he could not be that one so also he be a member of the vaccination board which be compose of three physician and seven layman among these be the archbishop and three provincial he be a brother in all the confraternity of the common and of the most exalted dignity and as we have see director of the superior commission of primary instruction which usually do not do anything -- all these be quite sufficient reason for the newspaper to heap adjective upon he no less when he travel than when he sneeze in spite of so many office don custodio be not among those who sleep through the session content themselves like lazy and timid delegate in vote with the majority the opposite of the numerous king of europe who bear the title of king of jerusalem don custodio make he dignity feel and get from it all the benefit possible often frown make he voice impressive cough out he word often take up the whole session tell a story present a project or dispute with a colleague who have place himself in open opposition to he although not past forty he already talk of act with circumspection of let the fig ripen -lrb- add under he breath pumpkin -rrb- of ponder deeply and of step with careful tread of the necessity for understand the country because the nature of the indian because the prestige of the spanish name because they be first of all spaniard because religion -- and so on remembered yet in manila be a speech of he when for the first time it be propose to light the city with kerosene in place of the old coconut oil : in such a innovation far from see the extinction of the coconut-oil industry he merely discern the interest of a certain alderman -- because don custodio see a long way -- and oppose it with all the resonance of he bucal cavity consider the project too premature and predict great social cataclysm no less celebrated be he opposition to a sentimental serenade that some wish to tender a certain governor on the eve of he departure don custodio who feel a little resentment over some slight or other succeed in insinuate the idea that the rise star be the mortal enemy of the set one whereat the frightened promoter of the serenade give it up one day he be advise to return to spain to be cure of a liver complaint and the newspaper speak of he as a antaeus who have to set foot in the mother country to gain new strength but the manila antaeus find himself a small and insignificant person at the capital there he be nobody and he miss he beloved adjective he do not mingle with the upper set and he lack of education prevent he from amount to much in the academy and scientific center while he backwardness and he parish-house politics drive he from the club disgust vex see nothing clearly but that there they be forever borrow money and gamble heavily he miss the submissive servant of manila who endure all he peevishness and who now seem to be far preferable when a winter keep he between a fireplace and a attack of pneumonia he sigh for the manila winter during which a single quilt be sufficient while in summer he miss the easy-chair and the boy to fan he in short in madrid he be only one among many and in spite of he diamond he be once take for a rustic who do not know how to comport himself and at another time for a _ indiano _ he scruple be scoff at and he be shamelessly flout by some borrower whom he offend disgusted with the conservative who take no great notice of he advice as well as with the sponge who rifle he pocket he declare himself to be of the liberal party and return within a year to the philippine if not sound in he liver yet completely change in he belief the eleven month spend at the capital among café politician nearly all retire half-pay office-holder the various speech catch here and there this or that article of the opposition all the political life that permeate the air from the barber-shop where amid the scissors-clip the figaro announce he program to the banquet where in harmonious period and tell phrase the different shades of political opinion the divergence and disagreement be adjust -- all these thing awake in he the farther he get from europe like the life-giving sap within the sown seed prevent from burst out by the thick husk in such a way that when he reach manila he believe that he be go to regenerate it and actually have the holiest plan and the purest ideal during the first month after he return he be continually talk about the capital about he good friend about minister so-and-so ex-minister such-a-one the delegate c the author b and there be not a political event a court scandal of which he be not inform to the last detail nor be there a public man the secret of whose private life be unknown to he nor could anything occur that he have not foresee nor any reform be order but he have first be consult all this be seasoned with attack on the conservative in righteous indignation with apology of the liberal party with a little anecdote here a phrase there from some great man drop in as one who do not wish office and employment which same he have refuse in order not to be beholden to the conservative such be he enthusiasm in these first day that various crony in the grocery-store which he visit from time to time affiliated themselves with the liberal party and begin to style themselves liberal : don eulogio badana a retired sergeant of carbineer the honest armendium by profession a pilot and a rampant carlist don eusebio picote custom inspector and don bonifacio tacon shoe - and harness-maker -lrb- 45 -rrb- but nevertheless from lack of encouragement and of opposition he enthusiasm gradually wane he do not read the newspaper that come from spain because they arrive in package the sight of which make he yawn the idea that he have catch have be all expend he need reinforcement and he orator be not there and although in the casino of manila there be enough gamble and money be borrow as in madrid no speech that would nourish he political idea be permit in they but don custodio be not lazy he do more than wish -- he work foresee that he be go to leave he bone in the philippine he begin to consider that country he proper sphere and to devote he effort to its welfare think to liberalize it he commence to draw up a series of reform or project which be ingenious to say the least it be he who have hear in madrid mention of the wooden street pavement of pari not yet adopt in spain propose the introduction of they in manila by cover the street with board nail down as they be on the side of house it be he who deplore the accident to two-wheeled vehicle plan to avoid they by put on at least three wheel it be also he who while act as vice-president of the board of health order everything fumigate even the telegram that come from infected place it be also he who in compassion for the convict that work in the sun and with a desire of save to the government the cost of they equipment suggest that they be clothe in a simple breech-clout and set to work not by day but at night he marvel he storm that he project should encounter objector but console himself with the reflection that the man who be worth enemy have they and revenge himself by attack and tear to piece any project good or bad present by other as he pride himself on be a liberal upon be ask what he think of the indian he would answer like one confer a great favor that they be fit for manual labor and the _ imitative art _ -lrb- mean thereby music painting and sculpture -rrb- add he old postscript that to know they one must have reside many many year in the country yet when he hear of any one of they excel in something that be not manual labor or a _ imitative art _ -- in chemistry medicine or philosophy for example -- he would exclaim : ah he promise fairly fairly well he be not a fool and feel sure that a great deal of spanish blood must flow in the vein of such a _ indian _ if unable to discover any in spite of he good intention he then seek a japanese origin for it be at that time the fashion begin of attribute to the japanese or the arab whatever good the filipino might have in they for he the native song be arabic music as be also the alphabet of the ancient filipino -- he be certain of this although he do not know arabic nor have he ever see that alphabet arabic the purest arabic he say to ben-zayb in a tone that admit no reply at best chinese then he would add with a significant wink : nothing can be nothing ought to be original with the indian you understand i like they greatly but they must not be allow to pride themselves upon anything for then they would take heart and turn into a lot of wretch at other time he would say : i love the indian fondly i have constitute myself they father and defender but it be necessary to keep everything in its proper place some be bear to command and other to serve -- plainly that be a truism which can not be utter very loudly but it can be put into practice without many word for look the trick depend upon trifle when you wish to reduce a people to subjection assure it that it be in subjection the first day it will laugh the second protest the third doubt and the fourth be convince to keep the filipino docile he must have repeat to he day after day what he be to convince he that he be incompetent what good would it do besides to have he believe in something else that would make he wretched believe I it be a act of charity to hold every creature in he place -- that be order harmony that constitute the _ science _ of government in refer to he policy don custodio be not satisfy with the word _ art _ and upon pronounce the word _ government _ he would extend he hand downward to the height of a man bent over on he knee in regard to he religious idea he pride himself on be a catholic very much a catholic -- ah catholic spain the land of _ maría santísima _ a liberal could be and ought to be a catholic when the reactionary be set themselves up as god or saint just as a mulatto pass for a white man in kaffirland but with all that he eat meat during lend except on good Friday never go to confession believe neither in miracle nor the infallibility of the pope and when he attend mass go to the one at ten o'clock or to the shortest the military mass although in madrid he have speak ill of the religious order so as not to be out of harmony with he surroundings consider they anachronism and have hurl curse against the inquisition while relate this or that lurid or droll story wherein the habit dance or rather friar without habit yet in speaking of the philippine which should be rule by special law he would cough look wise and again extend he hand downward to that mysterious altitude the friar be necessary they be a necessary evil he would declare but how he would rage when any indian dare to doubt the miracle or do not acknowledge the pope all the torture of the inquisition be insufficient to punish such temerity when it be object that to rule or to live at the expense of ignorance have another and somewhat ugly name and be punish by law when the culprit be a single person he would justify he position by refer to other colony we he would announce in he official tone can speak out plainly we be not like the british and the dutch who in order to hold people in subjection make use of the lash we avail ourselves of other means milder and surer the salutary influence of the friar be superior to the british lash this last remark make he fortune for a long time ben-zayb continue to use adaptation of it and with he all manila the think part of manila applaud it and it even get to madrid where it be quote in the parliament as from _ a liberal of long residence there _ the friar flatter by the comparison and see they prestige enhance send he sack of chocolate present which the incorruptible don custodio return so that ben-zayb immediately compare he to epaminonda nevertheless this modern epaminonda make use of the rattan in he choleric moment and advise its use at that time the convento fearful that he would render a decision favorable to the petition of the student increase they gift so that on the afternoon when we see he he be more perplexed than ever he reputation for energy be be compromise it have be more than a fortnight since he have have the petition in he hand and only that morning the high official after praise he zeal have ask for a decision don custodio have reply with mysterious gravity give he to understand that it be not yet complete the high official have smile a smile that still worry and haunt he as we be say he yawn and yawn in one of these movement at the moment when he open he eye and close he mouth he attention be catch by a file of red envelope arrange in regular order on a magnificent kamagon desk on the back of each could be read in large letter : project for a moment he forget he trouble and pepay 's pirouette to reflect upon all that those file contain which have issue from he prolific brain in he hour of inspiration how many original idea how many sublime thought how many means of ameliorate the woe of the philippine immortality and the gratitude of the country be surely he like a old lover who discover a moldy package of amorous epistle don custodio arise and approach the desk the first envelope thick swollen and plethoric bear the title : project in project no he murmur they be excellent thing but it would take a year to read they over the second also quite voluminous be entitle : project under consideration no not those either then come the project near completion project present project reject project approve project postpone these last envelope hold little but the least of all be that of the project execute don custodio wrinkle up he nose -- what do it contain he have completely forget what be in it a sheet of yellowish paper show from under the flap as though the envelope be stick out its tongue this he draw out and unfold : it be the famous project for the school of art and trade what the devil he exclaim if the augustinian padre take charge of it -- suddenly he slap he forehead and arch he eyebrow while a look of triumph overspread he face i have reach a decision he cry with a oath that be not exactly _ eureka _ my decision be make repeat he peculiar _ eureka _ five or six time which strike the air like so many gleeful lash he sit down at he desk radiant with joy and begin to write furiously chapter xxi manila type that night there be a grand function at the teatro de variedades mr jouay 's french operetta company be give its initial performance _ les cloches de corneville _ to the eye of the public be to be exhibit he select troupe whose fame the newspaper have for day be proclaim it be report that among the actress be a very beautiful voice with a figure even more beautiful and if credit could be give to rumor she amiability surpass even she voice and figure at half-past seven in the evening there be no more ticket to be have not even though they have be for padre salvus himself in he direct need and the person wait to enter the general admission already form a long queue in the ticket-office there be scuffle and fight talk of filibusterism and race but this do not produce any ticket so that by a quarter before eight fabulous price be be offer for they the appearance of the building profusely illuminate with flower and plant in all the door and window enchant the new arrival to such a extent that they burst out into exclamation and applause a large crowd surge about the entrance gaze enviously at those go in those who come early from fear of miss they seat laughter whisper expectation greet the later arrival who disconsolately join the curious crowd and now that they could not get in contented themselves with watch those who do yet there be one person who seem out of place amid such great eagerness and curiosity he be a tall meager man who drag one leg stiffly when he walk dress in a wretched brown coat and dirty checkered trousers that fit he lean bony limb tightly a straw sombrero artistic in spite of be break cover a enormous head and allow he dirty gray almost red hair to straggle out long and kinky at the end like a poet 's curl but the most notable thing about this man be not he clothing or he european feature guiltless of beard or mustache but he fiery red face from which he get the nickname by which he be know _ camaroncocido _ -lrb- 46 -rrb- he be a curious character belong to a prominent spanish family but he live like a vagabond and a beggar scoff at the prestige which he flout indifferently with he rag he be repute to be a kind of reporter and in fact he gray goggle-eye so cold and thoughtful always show up where anything publishable be happen he manner of living be a mystery to all as no one seem to know where he eat and sleep perhaps he have a empty hogshead somewhere but at that moment camaroncocido lack he usual hard and indifferent expression something like mirthful pity be reflect in he look a funny little man accost he merrily friend exclaim the latter in a raucous voice as hoarse as a frog 's while he display several mexican peso which camaroncocido merely glance at and then shrug he shoulder what do they matter to he the little old man be a fitting contrast to he small very small he wear on he head a high hat which present the appearance of a huge hairy worm and lose himself in a enormous frock coat too wide and too long for he to reappear in trousers too short not reach below he calf he body seem to be the grandfather and he leg the grandchild while as for he shoe he appear to be float on the land for they be of a enormous sailor type apparently protest against the hairy worm wear on he head with all the energy of a convento beside a world 's exposition if camaroncocido be red he be brown while the former although of spanish extraction have not a single hair on he face yet he a indian have a goatee and mustache both long white and sparse he expression be lively he be know as _ tio quico _ -lrb- 47 -rrb- and like he friend live on publicity advertising the show and post the theatrical announcement be perhaps the only filipino who could appear with impunity in a silk hat and frock coat just as he friend be the first spaniard who laugh at the prestige of he race the frenchman have pay I well he say smile and show he picturesque gum which look like a street after a conflagration i do a good job in post the bill camaroncocido shrug he shoulder again quico he rejoin in a cavernous voice if they have give you six peso for you work how much will they give the friar tio quico throw back he head in he usual lively manner to the friar because you surely know continued camaroncocido that all this crowd be secure for they by the convento the fact be that the friar head by padre salvus and some lay brethren captain by don custodio have oppose such show padre camorra who could not attend water at the eye and mouth but argue with ben-zayb who defend they feebly think of the free ticket they would send he newspaper don custodio speak of morality religion good manners and the like but stammer the writer if we own farce with they play on word and phrase of double meaning -- but at least they be in castilian the virtuous councilor interrupt with a roar inflamed to righteous wrath obscenity in french man ben-zayb for god 's sake in french never he utter this _ never _ with the energy of three guzman threaten with be kill like flea if they do not surrender twenty tarifa padre irene naturally agree with don custodio and execrated french operetta whew he have be in pari but have never set foot in a theater the lord deliver he yet the french operetta also count numerous partizan the officer of the army and navy among they the general 's aide the clerk and many society people be anxious to enjoy the delicacy of the french language from the mouth of genuine _ parisienne _ and with they be affiliate those who have travel by the mm -lrb- 48 -rrb- and have jabber a little french during the voyage those who have visit pari and all those who wish to appear learn hence manila society be divide into two faction operettist and anti-operettist the latter be support by the elderly lady wife jealous and careful of they husband ' love and by those who be engage while those who be free and those who be beautiful declare themselves enthusiastic operettist note and then more note be exchange there be going and coming mutual recrimination meeting lobbying argument even talk of a insurrection of the native of they indolence of inferior and superior race of prestige and other humbug so that after much gossip and more recrimination the permit be grant padre salvus at the same time publish a pastoral that be read by no one but the proof-reader there be questioning whether the general have quarrel with the countess whether she spend she time in the hall of pleasure whether he excellency be greatly annoyed whether there have be present exchange whether the french consul -- and so on and on many name be bandy about : quiroga the chinaman 's simoun 's and even those of many actress thanks to these scandalous preliminary the people 's impatience have be arouse and since the evening before when the troupe arrive there be talk of nothing but attend the first performance from the hour when the red poster announce _ les cloches de corneville _ the victor prepare to celebrate they triumph in some office instead of the time be spend in read newspaper and gossip it be devote to devour the synopsis and spell out french novel while many feigned business outside to consult they pocket-dictionary on the sly so no business be transact caller be tell to come back the next day but the public could not take offense for they encounter some very polite and affable clerk who receive and dismiss they with grand salutation in the french style the clerk be practise brushing the dust off they french and call to one another _ ouus monsieur s ` il vous plait _ and _ pardon _ at every turn so that it be a pleasure to see and hear they but the place where the excitement reach its climax be the newspaper office ben-zayb have be appoint critic and translator of the synopsis tremble like a poor woman accuse of witchcraft as he see he enemy pick out he blunder and throw up to he face he deficient knowledge of french when the italian opera be on he have very nearly receive a challenge for have mistranslate a tenor 's name while a envious rival have immediately publish a article refer to he as a ignoramus -- he the foremost thinking head in the philippine all the trouble he have have to defend himself he have have to write at least seventeen article and consult fifteen dictionary so with these salutary recollection the wretched ben-zayb move about with leaden hand to say nothing of he foot for that would be plagiarize padre camorra who

sumptuous red hanging afford a view of a garden in which a fountain play yet how sad the gallery look to he and how melancholy the paint landscape a thousand vague recollection surge into he memory like distant echo of music hear in the night like song of infancy the murmur of lonely forest and gloomy rivulet moonlit night on the shore of the sea spread wide before he eye so the enamored youth consider himself very wretched and stare fixedly at the ceiling so that the tear should not fall from he eye a burst of applause draw he from these meditation the curtain have just rise and the merry chorus of peasant of corneville be present all dress in cotton cap with heavy wooden sabot on they foot some six or seven girl well-rouged on the lip and cheek with large black circle around they eye

cotton cap provoke and challenge _ hein quus parle de serpolette _ she demand of the gossip with she arm akimbo in a combative attitude some one applaud and after he all those in the reserved seat without change she girlish attitude serpolette gaze at the person who have start the applause and pay he with a smile display row of little tooth that look like a string of pearl in a case of red velvet tadeo follow she gaze and see a man in a false mustache with a extraordinarily large nose by the monk 's cowl he exclaim it be irene yes corroborate sandoval i see he behind the scene talk with the actress the truth be that padre irene who be a melomaniac of the first degree and know french well have be send to the theater by padre salvus as a sort of religious detective or so at least he tell the person who recognize he as a faithful critic who should not be satisfy with view the piece from a distance he wish to examine the actress at first hand so he have mingle in the group of admirer and gallant have penetrate into the greenroom where be whisper and talk a french require by the situation a _ market french _ a language that be readily comprehensible for the vender when the buyer seem disposed to pay well serpolette be surround by two gallant officer a sailor and a lawyer when she catch sight of he move about stick the tip of he long nose into all the nook and corner as though with it he be ferret out all the mystery of the stage she cease she chatter knit she eyebrow then raise they open she lip and with the vivacity of a _ parisienne _ leave she admirer to hurl

pecson in disgust a lady accompany by she husband enter at that moment and take she place in one of the two vacant box she have the air of a queen and gaze disdainfully at the whole house as if to say i have come later than all of you you crowd of upstart and provincial i have come later than you there be person who go to the theater like the contestant in a mule-race : the last one in win and we know very sensible man who would ascend the scaffold rather than enter a theater before the first act but the lady 's triumph be of short duration -- she catch sight of the other box that be still empty and begin to scold she better half thus start such a disturbance that many be annoyed ssh ssh the blockhead as if they understand french remark the lady gaze with supreme disdain in all direction finally fix she attention on juanito 's box whence she think she have hear a impudent hiss juanito be in fact guilty for he have be pretend to understand everything hold himself up proudly and applaud at time as though nothing that be say escape he and this too without guide himself by the actor ' pantomime because he scarcely look toward the stage the rogue have intentionally remark to paulita that as there be so much more beautiful a woman close at hand he do not care to strain he eye look beyond she paulita have blush cover she face with she fan and glance stealthily toward where isagani silent and morose be abstractedly watch the show paulita feel nettled and jealous would isagani fall in love with any of those alluring actress the thought put she in a bad humor so she scarcely hear the praise that doña victorina be heap upon she own favorite juanito be play he part well : he shake he head at time in sign of disapproval and then there could be hear cough and murmur in some part at other time he smile in approbation and a second later applause resound doña victorina be charm even conceive some vague idea of marry the young man the day don tiburcio should die -- juanito know french and de espadaña do not then she begin to flatter he nor do he perceive the change in the drift of she talk so occupied be he in watch a catalan merchant who be sit next to the swiss consul have observe that they be converse in french juanito be get he inspiration from they countenance and thus grandly give the cue to those about he scene follow scene character succeed character comic and ridiculous like the bailiff and grenicheux impose and winsome like the marquis and germaine the audience laugh heartily at the slap deliver by gaspard and intend for the coward grenicheux which be receive by the grave bailiff whose wig go fly through the air produce disorder and confusion as the curtain drop where 's the cancan inquire tadeo but the curtain rise again immediately reveal a scene in a servant market with three post on which be affix sign bear the announcement : _ servante _ _ cocher _ and _ domestique _ juanito to improve the opportunity turn to doña victorina and say in a loud voice so that paulita might hear and he convince of he learning : _ servante _ means servant _ domestique _ domestic and in what way do the _ servante _ differ from the _ domestique _ ask paulita juanito be not find want _ domestique _ be those that be domesticate -- have not you notice that some of they have the air of savage those be the _ servante _ that be right add doña victorina some have very bad manners -- and yet i think that in europe everybody be cultivate but as it happen in france -- well i see ssh ssh but what be juanito 's predicament when the time come for the opening of the market and the beginning of the sale and the servant who be to be hire place themselves beside the sign that indicate they class the man some ten or twelve rough character in livery carry branch in they hand take they place under the sign _ domestique _ those be the domestic explain juanito really they have the appearance of be only recently domesticate observe doña victorina now let 's have a look at the savage then the dozen girl head by the lively and merry serpolette deck out in they best clothes each wear a big bouquet of flower at the waist laugh smile fresh and attractive place themselves to juanito 's great desperation beside the post of the _ servante _ how 's this ask paulita guilelessly be those the savage that you speak of no reply the imperturbable juanito there be a mistake -- they have get they place mix -- those come behind -- those with the whip juanito nod assent but he be rather perplexed and uneasy so those girl be the _ cocher _ here juanito be attack by such a violent fit of cough that some of the spectator become annoyed put he out put the consumptive out call a voice consumptive to be call a consumptive before paulita juanito want to find the blackguard and make he swallow that consumptive observe that the woman be try to hold he back he bravado increase and he become more conspicuously ferocious but fortunately it be don custodio who have make the diagnosis and he fearful of attract attention to himself pretend to hear nothing apparently busy with he criticism of the play if it be not that i be with you remark juanito roll he eye like some doll that be move by clockwork and to make the resemblance more real he stick out he tongue occasionally thus that night he acquire in doña victorina 's eye the reputation of be brave and punctilious so she decide in she heart that she would marry he just as soon as don tiburcio be out of the way paulita become sadder and sadder in think about how the girl call _ cocher _ could occupy isaganus 's attention for the name have certain disagreeable association that come from the slang of she convent school-day at length the first act be conclude the marquis take away as servant serpolette and germaine the representative of timid beauty in the troupe and for coachman the stupid grenicheux a burst of applause bring they out again hold hand those who five seconds before have be torment one another and be about to come to blow bow and smile here and there to the gallant manila public and exchange know look with various spectator while there prevail the pass tumult occasion by those who crowd one another to get into the greenroom and felicitate the actress and by those who be go to make call on the lady in the box some express they opinion of the play and the player undoubtedly serpolette be the best say one with a know air i prefer germaine she be a ideal blonde but she have not any voice what do i care about the voice well for shape the tall one pshaw say ben-zayb not a one be worth a straw not a one be a artist ben-zayb be the critic for _ el grito de la integridad _ and he disdainful air give he great importance in the eye of those who be satisfy with so little serpolette have not any voice nor germaine grace nor be that music nor be it art nor be it anything he conclude with marked contempt to set oneself up as a great critic there be nothing like appear to be discontent with everything besides the management have send only two seat for the newspaper staff in the box curiosity be arouse as to who could be the possessor of the empty one for that person would surpass every one in chic since he would be the last to arrive the rumor start somewhere that it belong to simoun and be confirm : no one have see the jeweler in the reserved seat the greenroom or anywhere else yet i see he this afternoon with mr jouay some one say he present a necklace to one of the actress to which one ask some of the inquisitive lady to the finest of all the one who make eye at he excellency this information be receive with look of intelligence wink exclamation of doubt of confirmation and half-uttered commentary he be try to play the monte cristo remark a lady who pride herself on be literary or purveyor to the palace add she escort jealous of simoun in the student ' box pecson sandoval and isaganus have remain while tadeo have go to engage don custodio in conversation about he project and makaraig to hold a interview with pepay in no way as i have observe to you before friend isaganus declare sandoval with violent gesture and a sonorous voice so that the lady near the box the daughter of the rich man who be in debt to tadeo might hear he in no way do the french language possess the rich sonorousness or the varied and elegant cadence of the castilian tongue i can not conceive i can not imagine i can not form any idea of french orator and i doubt that they have ever have any or can have any now in the strict construction of the term orator because we must not confuse the name orator with the word babbler and charlatan for these can exist in any country in all the region of the inhabit world among the cold and curt englishman as among the lively and impressionable frenchman thus he deliver a magnificent review of the nation with he poetical characterization and most resounding epithet isagani nod assent with he thought fix on paulita whom he have surprise gaze at he with a expressive look which contain a wealth of mean he try to divine what those eye be express -- those eye that be so eloquent and not at all deceptive now you who be a poet a slave to rhyme and meter a son of the muse continue sandoval with a elegant wave of he hand as though he be salute on the horizon the nine sister do you comprehend can you conceive how a language so harsh and unmusical as french can give birth to poet of such gigantic stature as we garcilaso we herrera we esproncedas we calderon nevertheless object pecson victor hugo -- victor hugo my friend pecson if victor hugo be a poet it be because he owe it to spain because it be a established fact it be a matter beyond all doubt a thing admit even by the frenchman themselves so envious of spain that if victor hugo have genius if he really be a poet it be because he childhood be spend in madrid there he drink in he first impression there he brain be mold there he imagination be color he heart model and the most beautiful concept of he mind bear and after all who be victor hugo be he to be compare at all with we modern -- this peroration be cut short by the return of makaraig with a despondent air and a bitter smile on he lip carry in he hand a note which he offer silently to sandoval who read : my dive : you letter have reach I late for i have already hand in my decision and it have be approve however as if i have guess you wish i have decide the matter accord to the desire of you protégés i 'll be at the theater and wait for you after the performance you duckling custodine how tender the man be exclaim tadeo with emotion well say sandoval i do not see anything wrong about this -- quite the reverse yes rejoin makaraig with he bitter smile decide favorably i have just see padre irene what do padre irene say inquire pecson the same as don custodio and the rascal still have the audacity to congratulate I the commission which have take as its own the decision of the arbiter approve the idea and felicitate the student on they patriotism and they thirst for knowledge -- well only that consider we duty -- in short it say that in order that the idea may not be lose it conclude that the direction and execution of the plan should be place in charge of one of the religious corporation in case the dominican do not wish to incorporate the academy with the university exclamation of disappointment greet the announcement isaganus rise but say nothing and in order that we may participate in the

's dedicate the _ pansit _ to quiroga the chinaman one of the four power of the filipino world propose isaganus no to he black eminence silence caution one mysteriously there be people in the plaza

ability should deliver the last toast as a sum up tadeo lazy as ever have prepare nothing so he find himself in a quandary while dispose of a long string of vermicelli he meditate how to get out of

the frying-pan could be hear they take advantage of the delay to drink beg pecson to talk pecson cross himself gravely and arise restrain he clownish laugh with a effort at the same time mimic a certain augustinian preacher then famous and beginning in a murmur as though he be read a text _ si tripa plena laudal deum tripa famelica laudabit fratre _ -- if the full stomach praise god the hungry stomach will praise the friar word speak by the lord custodio through the mouth of ben-zayb in the journal _ el grito de la integridad _ the second article absurdity the one hundred and fifty-seventh beloved brethren in christ : evil blow its foul breath over the verdant shore of frailandium commonly call the philippine archipelago no day pass but the attack be renew but there be hear some sarcasm against the reverend venerable infallible corporation defenseless and unsupported allow I brethren on this occasion to constitute myself a knight-errant to sally forth in defense of the unprotected of the holy corporation that have rear we thus again confirm the save idea of the adage -- a full stomach praise god which be to say a hungry stomach will praise the friar bravo bravo listen say isaganus seriously i want you to understand that speaking of friar i respect one sandoval be get merry so he begin to sing a shady couplet about the friar hear I brethren continue pecson turn you gaze toward the happy day of you infancy endeavor to analyze the present and ask yourselve about the future what do you find friar friar and friar a friar baptize you confirm you visit you in school with loving zeal a friar hear you first secret he be the first to bring you into communion with god to set you foot upon the pathway of life friar be you first and friar will be you last teacher a friar it be who open the heart of you sweetheart dispose they to heed you sigh a friar marry you make you travel over different island to afford you change of climate and diversion he will attend you death-bed and even though you mount the scaffold there will the friar be to accompany you with he prayer and tear and you may rest assure that he will not desert you until he see you thoroughly dead nor do he charity end there -- dead he will then endeavor to bury you with all pomp he will fight that you corpse pass through the church to receive he supplication and he will only rest satisfied when he can deliver you into the hand of the creator purify here on earth thanks to temporal punishment torture and humiliation learn in the doctrine of christ who close heaven against the rich they we redeemer and genuine minister of the savior seek every means to lift away we sin and bear they far far off there where the accursed chinese and protestant dwell to leave we this air limpid pure healthful in such a way that even should we so wish afterwards we could not find a real to bring about we condemnation if then they existence be necessary to we happiness if wheresoever we turn we must encounter they delicate hand hunger for kiss that every day smooth the mark of abuse from we countenance why not adore they and fatten they -- why demand they impolitic expulsion consider for a moment the immense void that they absence would leave in we social system tireless worker they improve and propagate the race divide as we be thanks to we jealousy and we susceptibility the friar unite we in a common lot in a firm bond so firm that many be unable to move they elbow take away the friar gentleman and you will see how the philippine edifice will totter lack robust shoulder and hairy limb to sustain it philippine life will again become monotonous without the merry note of the playful and gracious friar without the booklet and sermon that split we side with laughter without the amusing contrast between grand pretension and small brain without the actual daily representation of the tale of boccaccio and la fontaine without the girdle and scapulary what would you have we woman do in the future -- save that money and perhaps become miserly and covetous without the mass novenary and procession where will you find game of _ panguinguus _ to entertain they in they hour of leisure they would then have to devote themselves to they household duty and instead of read divert story of miracle we should then have to get they work that be not extant take away the friar and heroism will disappear the political virtue will fall under the control of the vulgar take he away and the indian will cease to exist for the friar be the father the indian be the word the former be the sculptor the latter the statue because all that we be think or do we owe to the friar -- to he patience he toil he perseverance of three century to modify the form nature give we the philippine without the friar and without the indian -- what then would become of the unfortunate government in the hand of the chinaman it will eat lobster pie suggest isagani whom pecson 's speech bore and that be what we ought to be do enough of speech as the chinese who should have serve the course do not put in he appearance one of the student arise and go to the rear toward the balcony that overlook the river but he return at once make mysterious sign we be watch i have see padre sibylum 's pet yes ejaculate isagani rise it be no use now when he see I he disappear approach the window he look toward the plaza then make sign to he companion to come nearer they see a young man leave the door of the _ pansitería _ gaze all about he then with some unknown person enter a carriage that wait at the curb it be simoun 's carriage ah exclaim makaraig the slave of the vice-rector attend by the master of the general chapter xxvi pasquinade very early the next morning basilio arise to go to the hospital he have he plan make : to visit he patient to go afterwards to the university to see about he licentiateship and then have a interview with makaraig about the expense this would entail for he have use up the greater part of he savings in ransom julus and in secure a house where she and she grandfather might live and he have not dare to apply to capitan tiago fear that such a move would be construe as a advance on the legacy so often promise he preoccupy with these thought he pay no attention to the group of student who be at such a early hour return from the walled city as though the classroom have be close nor do he even note the abstracted air of some of they they whisper conversation or the mysterious signal exchange among they so it be that when he reach san juan de dio and he friend ask he about the conspiracy he give a start remember what simoun have plan but which have miscarry owe to the unexplained accident to the jeweler terrify he ask in a tremble voice at the same time endeavor to feign ignorance ah yes what conspiracy it be be discover reply one and it seem that many be implicate in it with a effort basilio control himself many implicate he echo try to learn something from the look of the other who student a lot of student basilio do not think it prudent to ask more fear that he would give himself away so on the pretext of visit he patient he leave the group one of the clinical professor meet he and place he hand mysteriously on the youth 's shoulder -- the professor be a friend of he -- ask he in a low voice be you at that supper last night in he excited frame of mind basilio think the professor have say _ night before last _ which be the time of he interview with simoun he try to explain i assure you he stammer that as capitan tiago be worse -- and besides i have to finish that book -- you do well not to attend it say the professor but you be a member of the student ' association i pay my due well then a piece of advice : go home at once and destroy any papers you have that may compromise you basilio shrug he shoulder -- he have no papers nothing more than he clinical note have señor simoun -- simoun have nothing to do with the affair thank god interrupt the physician he be opportunely wound by some unknown hand and be now confine to he bed no other hand be concern in this but hand no less terrible basilio draw a breath of relief simoun be the only one who could compromise he although he think of cabesang tale be there tulisane -- no man nothing more than student basilio recover he serenity what have happen then he make bold to ask seditious pasquinade have be find do not you know about they where in the university nothing more than that whew what more do you want ask the professor almost in a rage the pasquinade be attribute to the student of the association -- but keep quiet the professor of pathology come along a man who have more the look of a sacristan than of a physician appoint by the powerful mandate of the vice-rector without other merit than unconditional servility to the corporation he pass for a spy and a informer in the eye of the rest of the faculty the first professor return he greet coldly and wink to basilio as he say to he now i know that capitan tiago smell like a corpse -- the crow and vulture have be gather around he so say he go inside somewhat calm basilio now venture to inquire for more detail but all that he could learn be that pasquinade have be find on the door of the university and that the vice-rector have order they to be take down and send to the civil government it be say that they be fill with threat of assassination invasion and other braggadocio the student make they comment on the affair they information come from the janitor who have it from a servant in santo toma who have it from a usher they prognosticate future suspension and imprisonment even indicate who be to be the victim -- naturally the member of the association basilio then recall simoun 's word : the day in which they can get rid of you you will not complete you course could he have know anything he ask himself we 'll see who be the most powerful recover he serenity he go on toward the university to learn what attitude it behoove he to take and at the same time to see about he licentiateship he pass along calle legazpi then down through beaterio and upon arrive at the corner of this street and calle solana see that something important must indeed have happen instead of the former lively chattering group on the sidewalk be to be see civil-guard make the student move on and these latter issue from the university silent some gloomy some agitate to stand off at a distance or make they way home the first acquaintance he meet be sandoval but basilio call to he in vain he seem to have be smitten deaf effect of fear on the gastro-intestinal juice think basilio later he meet tadeo who wear a christmas face -- at last that eternal holiday seem to be realize what have happen tadeo we 'll have no school at least for a week old man sublime magnificent he rub he hand in glee but what have happen they be go to arrest all of we in the association and be you glad of that there 'll be no school there 'll be no school he move away almost burst with joy basilio see juanito pelaez approach pale and suspicious this time he hump have reach its maximum so great be he haste to get away he have be one of the most active promoter of the association while thing be run smoothly eh pelaez what be happen nothing i know nothing i do not have anything to do with it he respond nervously i be always tell you that these thing be quixotism it be the truth you know i have say so to you basilio do not remember whether he have say so or not but to humor he reply yes man but what be happen it be the truth be not it look you be a witness : i have always be oppose -- you be a witness do not forget it yes man but what be go on listen you be a witness i have never have anything to do with the member of the association except to give they advice you be not go to deny it now be careful will not you no no i will not deny it but for goodness ' sake what have happen but juanito be already far away he have catch a glimpse of a guard approach and fear arrest basilio then go on toward the university to see if perhaps the secretary 's office might be open and if he could glean any further news the office be close but there be a extraordinary commotion in the building hurry up and down the stairway be friar army officer private person old lawyer and doctor there doubtless to offer they service to the endanger cause at a distance he see he friend isaganus pale and agitate but radiant with youthful ardor harangue some fellow student with he voice raise as though he care little that he be hear by everybody it seem preposterous gentleman it seem unreal that a incident so insignificant should scatter we and send we into flight like sparrow at whom a scarecrow have be shake but be this the first time that student have go to prison for the sake of liberty where be those who have die those who have be shoot would you apostatize now but who can the fool be that write such pasquinade demand a indignant listener what do that matter to we rejoin isaganus we do not have to find out let they find out before we know how they be draw up we have no need to make any show of agreement at a time like this there where the danger be there must we hasten because honor be there if what the pasquinade say be compatible with we dignity and we feeling be he who he may that write they he have do well and we ought to be grateful to he and hasten to add we signature to he if they be unworthy of we we conduct and we conscience will in themselves protest and defend we from every accusation upon hear such talk basilio although he like isagani very much turn and leave he have to go to makaraig 's house to see about the loan near the house of the wealthy student he observe whispering and mysterious signal among the neighbor but not comprehend what they mean continue serenely on he way and enter the doorway two guard advance and ask he what he want basilio realize that he have make a bad move but he could not now retreat i have come to see my friend makaraig he reply calmly the guard look at each other wait here one of they say to he wait till the corporal come down basilio bit he lip and simoun 's word again recur to he have they come to arrest makaraig -- be he thought but he dare not give it utterance he do not have to wait long for in a few moment makaraig come down talk pleasantly with the corporal the two be precede by a warrant officer what you too basilio he ask i come to see you -- noble conduct exclaim makaraig laughing in time of calm you avoid we the corporal ask basilio he name then scan a list medical student calle anloague he ask basilio bite he lip you have save we a trip add the corporal place he hand on the youth 's shoulder you be under arrest what i also makaraig burst out into laughter do not worry friend let 's get into the carriage while i tell you about the supper last night with a graceful gesture as though he be in he own house he invite the warrant officer and the corporal to enter the carriage that wait at the door to the civil government he order the cochero now that basilio have again regain he composure he tell makaraig the object of he visit the rich student do not wait for he to finish but seize he hand count on I count on I and to the festivity celebrate we graduation we 'll invite these gentleman he say indicate the corporal and the warrant officer chapter xxvii the friar and the filipino vox populus vox dei we leave isaganus harangue he friend in the midst of he enthusiasm a usher approach he to say that padre fernandez one of the higher professor wish to talk with he isaganus 's face fall padre fernandez be a person greatly respect by he be the _ one _ always except by he whenever the friar be attack what do padre fernandez want he inquire the usher shrug he shoulder and isaganus reluctantly follow he padre fernandez the friar whom we meet in lo baños be wait in he cell grave and sad with he brow knit as if he be in deep thought he arise as isagani enter shake hand with he and close the door then he begin to pace from one end of the room to the other isagani stand wait for he to speak señor isaganus he begin at length with some emotion from the window i have hear you speak for though i be a consumptive i have good ear and i want to talk with you i have always like the young man who express themselves clearly and have they own way of think and act no matter that they idea may differ from mine you young man from what i have hear have a supper last night do not excuse yourself -- i do not intend to excuse myself interrupted isaganus so much the better -- it show that you accept the consequence of you action besides you would do ill in retract and i do not blame you i take no notice of what may have be say there last night i do not accuse you because after all you be free to say of the dominican what seem best to you you be not a pupil of ours -- only this year have we have the pleasure of have you and we shall probably not have you longer do not think that i be go to invoke consideration of gratitude no i be not go to waste my time in stupid vulgarism i have have you summon here because i believe that you be one of the few student who act from conviction and as i like man of conviction i be go to explain myself to señor isagani padre fernandez pause then continue he walk with bow head he gaze rivet on the floor you may sit down if you wish he remark it be a habit of mine to walk about while talk because my idea come better then isagani remain standing with he head erect wait for the professor to get to the point of the matter for more than eight year i have be a professor here resume padre fernandez still continue to pace back and forth and in that time i have know and deal with more than twenty-five hundred student i have teach they i have try to educate they i have try to inculcate in they principle of justice and of dignity and yet in these day when there be so much murmur against we i have not see one who have the temerity to maintain he accusation when he find himself in the presence of a friar not even aloud in the presence of any number young man there be who behind we back calumniate we and before we kiss we hand with a base smile beg kind look from we bah what do you wish that we should do with such creature the fault be not all theirs padre reply isaganus the fault lie partly with those who have teach they to be hypocrite with those who have tyrannize over freedom of thought and freedom of speech here every independent thought every word that be not a echo of the will of those in power be characterize as filibusterism and you know well enough what that mean a fool would he be who to please himself would say aloud what he think who would lay himself liable to suffer persecution what persecution have you have to suffer asked padre fernandez raise he head have not i let you express yourself freely in my class nevertheless you be a exception that if what you say be true i must correct so as to make the rule as general as possible and thus avoid set a bad example isaganus smile i thank you but i will not discuss with you whether i be a exception i will accept you qualification so that you may accept mine : you also be a exception and as here we be not go to talk about exception nor plead for ourselves at least i mean _ i be not _ i beg of my _ professor _ to change the course of the conversation in spite of he liberal principle padre fernandez raise he head and stare in surprise at isaganus that young man be more independent than he have think -- although he call he _ professor _ in reality he be deal with he as a equal since he allow himself to offer suggestion like a wise diplomat padre fernandez not only recognize the fact but even take he stand upon it good enough he say but do not look upon I as you professor i be a friar and you be a filipino student nothing more nor less now i ask you -- what do the filipino student want of we the question come as a surprise isaganus be not prepare for it it be a thrust make suddenly while they be prepare they defense as they say in fencing thus startle isagani respond with a violent stand like a beginner defend himself that you do you duty he exclaim fray fernandez straighten up -- that reply sound to he like a cannon-shot that we do we duty he repeat hold himself erect do not we then do we duty what duty do you ascribe to we those which you voluntarily place upon yourselve on join the order and those which afterwards once in it you have be willing to assume but as a filipino student i do not think myself call upon to examine you conduct with reference to you statute to catholicism to the government to the filipino people and to humanity in general -- those be question that you have to settle with you founder with the pope with the government with the whole people and with god as a filipino student i will confine myself to you duty toward we the friar in general be the local supervisor of education in the province and the dominican in particular by monopolize in they hand all the study of the filipino youth have assume the obligation to its eight million of inhabitant to spain and to humanity of which we form a part of steadily better the young plant morally and physically of training it toward its happiness of create a people honest prosperous intelligent virtuous noble and loyal now i ask you in my turn -- have the friar fulfil that obligation of theirs we be fulfil -- ah padre fernandez interrupted isaganus you with you hand on _ you _ heart can say that you be fulfil it but with you hand on the heart of you order on the heart of all the order you can not say that without deceive yourself ah padre fernandez when i find myself in the presence of a person whom i esteem and respect i prefer to be the accuse rather than the accuser i prefer to defend myself rather than take the offensive but now that we have enter upon the discussion let we carry it to the end how do they fulfill they obligation those who look after education in the town by hinder it and those who here monopolize education those who try to mold the mind of youth to the exclusion of all other whomsoever how do they carry out they mission by curtail knowledge as much as possible by extinguish all ardor and enthusiasm by trample on all dignity the soul 's only refuge by inculcate in we worn-out idea rancid belief false principle incompatible with a life of progress ah yes when it be a question of feed convict of provide for the maintenance of criminal the government call for bid in order to find the purveyor who offer the best means of subsistence he who at least will not let they perish from hunger but when it be a question of morally feed a whole people of nourish the intellect of youth the healthiest part that which be later to be the country and the all the government not only do not ask for any bid but restrict the power to that very body which make a boast of not desire education of wish no advancement what should we say if the purveyor for the prison after secure the contract by intrigue should then leave the prisoner to languish in want give they only what be stale and rancid excuse himself afterwards by say that it be not convenient for the prisoner to enjoy good health because good health bring merry thought because merriment improve the man and the man ought not to be improve because it be to the purveyor 's interest that there be many criminal what should we say if afterwards the government and the purveyor should agree between themselves that of the ten or twelve cuarto which one receive for each criminal the other should receive five padre fernandek bit he lip those be grave charge he say and you be overstep the limit of we agreement no padre not if i continue to deal with the student question the friar -- and i do not say you friar since i do not confuse you with the common herd -- the friar of all the order have constitute themselves we mental purveyor yet they say and shamelessly proclaim that it be not expedient for we to become enlighten because some day we shall declare ourselves free that be just the same as not wish the prisoner to be well-fed so that he may improve and get out of prison liberty be to man what education be to the intelligence and the friar ' unwillingness that we have it be the origin of we discontent instruction be give only to those who deserve it rejoin padre fernandez dryly to give it to man without character and without morality be to prostitute it why be there man without character and without morality the dominican shrug he shoulder defect that they imbibe with they mother ' milk that they breathe in the bosom of the family -- how do i know ah no padre fernandez exclaim the young man impetuously you have not dare to go into the subject deeply you have not wish to gaze into the depths from fear of find yourself there in the darkness of you brethren what we be you have make we a people tyrannize over be force to be hypocritical a people deny the truth must resort to lie and he who make himself a tyrant breed slave there be no morality you say so let it be -- even though statistics can refute you in that here be not commit crime like those among other people blind by the fume of they moralizer but without attempt now to analyze what it be that form the character and how far the education receive determine morality i will agree with you that we be defective who be to blame for that you who for three century and a half have have in you hand we education or we who submit to everything if after three century and a half the artist have be able to produce only a caricature stupid indeed he must be or bad enough the material he work upon stupider still then when know it to be bad he do not give it up but go on waste time not only be he stupid but he be a cheat and a robber because he know that he work be useless yet continue to draw he salary not only be he stupid and a thief he be a villain in that he prevent any other workman from try he skill to see if he might not produce something worth while the deadly jealousy of the incompetent the reply be sharp and padre fernandez feel himself catch to he gaze isaganus appear gigantic invincible convincing and for the first time in he life he feel beat by a filipino student he repent of have provoke the argument but it be too late to turn back in this quandary finding himself confront with such a formidable adversary he seek a strong shield and lay hold of the government you impute all the fault to we because you see only we who be near he say in a less haughty tone it be natural and do not surprise I a person hate the soldier or policeman who arrest he and not the judge who send he to prison you and we be both dancing to the same measure of music -- if at the same note you lift you foot in unison with we do not blame we for it it be the music that be direct we movement do you think that we friar have no conscience and that we do not desire what be right do you believe that we do not think about you that we do not heed we duty that we only eat to live and live to rule would that it be so but we like you follow the cadence finding ourselves between scyllum and charybdi : either you reject we or the government reject we the government command and he who command command -- and must be obey from which it may be infer remark isaganus with a bitter smile that the government wish we demoralization oh no i do not mean that what i mean to say be that there be belief there be theory there be law which dictate with the best intention produce the most deplorable consequence i 'll explain myself better by cite a example to stamp out a small evil there be dictate many law that cause greater evil still : ' _ corruptissima in republica plurimae leges _ ' say tacitus to prevent one case of fraud there be provide a million and a half preventive or humiliating regulation which produce the immediate effect of awakening in the public the desire to elude and mock such regulation to make a people criminal there be nothing more need than to doubt its virtue enact a law not only here but even in spain and you will see how the means of evade it will be seek and this be for the very reason that the legislator have overlook the fact that the more a object be hide the more a sight of it be desire why be rascality and astuteness regard as great quality in the spanish people when there be no other so noble so proud so chivalrous as it because we legislator with the best intention have doubt its nobility wound its pride challenge its chivalry do you wish to open in spain a road among the rock then place there a imperative notice forbid the passage and the people in order to protest against the order will leave the highway to clamber over the rock the day on which some legislator in spain forbid virtue and command vice then all will become virtuous the dominican pause for a brief space then resume : but you may say that we be get away from the subject so i 'll return to it what i can say to you to convince you be that the vice from which you suffer ought to be ascribe by you neither to we nor to the government they be due to the imperfect organization of we social system : _ quus multum probat nihil probat _ one lose himself through excessive caution lack what be necessary and have too much of what be superfluous if you admit those defect in you social system reply isaganus why then do you undertake to regulate alien society instead of first devote you attention to yourselve we be get away from the subject young man the theory in accomplished fact must be accept so let it be i accept it because it be a accomplished fact but i will further ask : why if you social organization be defective do you not change it or at least give heed to the cry of those who be injure by it we be still far away let 's talk about what the student want from the friar from the moment when the friar hide themselves behind the government the student have to turn to it this statement be true and there appear no means of ignore it i be not the government and i can not answer for its act what do the student wish we to do for they within the limit by which we be confine not to oppose the emancipation of education but to favor it the dominican shake he head without state my own opinion that be ask we to commit suicide he say on the contrary it be ask you for room to pass in order not to trample upon and crush you ahem cough padre fernandez stop and remain thoughtful begin by ask something that do not cost so much something that any one of we can grant without abatement of dignity or privilege for if we can reach a understanding and dwell in peace why this hatred why this distrust then let 's get down to detail yes because if we disturb the foundation we 'll bring down the whole edifice then let 's get down to detail let 's leave the region of abstract principle rejoin isaganus with a smile and _ also without state my own opinion _ -- the youth accent these word -- the student would desist from they attitude and soften certain asperity if the professor would try to treat they better than they have up to the present that be in they hand what demand the dominican have the student any complaint to make about my conduct padre we agree from the start not to talk of yourself or of myself we be speak generally the student besides get no great benefit out of the year spend in the class often leave there remnant of they dignity if not the whole of it padre fernandez again bite he lip no one force they to study -- the field be uncultivated he observe dryly yes there be something that impel they to study reply isaganus in the same tone look the dominican full in the face besides the duty of every one to seek he own perfection there be the desire innate in man to cultivate he intellect a desire the more powerful here in that it be repress he who give he gold and he life to the state have the right to require of it opporttmity better to get that gold and better to care for he life yes padre there be something that impel they and that something be the government itself it be you yourselve who pitilessly ridicule the uncultured indian and deny he he rights on the ground that he be ignorant you strip he and then scoff at he nakedness padre fernandez do not reply but continue to pace about feverishly as

chapter xxviii tatakut with prophetic inspiration ben-zayb have be for some day past maintain in he newspaper that education be disastrous very disastrous for the philippine island and now in view of the event of that Friday of pasquinade the writer crow and chant he triumph leave belittle and overwhelm he adversary _ horatius _ who in the _ pirotecnium _ have dare to ridicule he in the follow

captain-general do not appear at the head of he victorious cohort still the excitement have increase the friar who be accustom to frequent quiroga 's bazaar do not put in they appearance and this symptom presage terrific cataclysm if the sun have rise a square and the saint appear only in pantaloons quiroga would not have be so greatly alarm for he would have take the sun for a gaming-table and the sacred image for gambler who have lose they camisa but for the friar not to come precisely when some novelty have just arrive for they by means of a provincial friend of he quiroga forbid entrance into he gaming-house to every indian who be not a old acquaintance as the future chinese consul fear that they might get possession of the sum that the wretch lose there after arrange he bazaar in such a way that he could close it quickly in case of need he have a policeman accompany he for the short distance that separate he house from simoun 's quiroga think this occasion the most propitious for make use of the rifle and cartridge that he have in he warehouse in the way the jeweler have point out so that on the following day there would be search make and then -- how many prisoner how many terrify people would give up they savings it be the game of the old carbineer in slip contraband cigar and tobacco-leaf under a house in order to pretend a search and force the unfortunate owner to bribery or fine only now the art have be perfect and the tobacco monopoly abolish resort be have to the prohibit arm but simoun refuse to see any one and send word to the chinese that he should leave thing as they be whereupon he go to see don custodio to inquire whether he should fortify he bazaar but neither would don custodio receive he be at the time engage in the study of

possible time to shut himself up in he house and take to he bed under pretense of illness at four in the afternoon the talk be no longer of simple pasquinade there be whisper rumor of a understanding between the student and the outlaw of san mateo it be certain that in the _ pansitería _ they have conspire to surprise the city there be talk of german ship outside the bay to support the movement of

they be arm providence have save he excellency prevent he from receive those precocious criminal as he be at the time in conference with the provincial the vice-rector and with padre irene padre salvus 's representative there be considerable truth in these rumor if we have to believe padre irene who in the afternoon go to visit capitan tiago accord to he certain person have advise he excellency to improve the opportunity in order to inspire terror and administer a lasting lesson to the filibuster a number shoot one have advise some two dozen reformer deport at once in the silence of the night would extinguish forever the flame of discontent no rejoin another who have a kind heart sufficient that the soldier parade through the street a troop of cavalry for example with draw saber -- sufficient to drag along some cannon that be enough the people be timid and will all retire into they house no no insinuate another this be the opportunity to get rid of the enemy it be not sufficient that they retire into they house they should be make to come out like evil humor by means of plaster if they be incline to start riot they should be stir up by secret agitator i be of the opinion that the troops should be rest on they arm and appear careless and indifferent so the people may be embolden and then in case of any disturbance -- out on they action the end justify the means remark another we end be we holy religion and the integrity of the fatherland proclaim a state of siege and in case of the least disturbance arrest all the rich and educate and -- clean up the country if i have not get there in time to counsel moderation add padre irene speak to capitan tiago it be certain that blood would now be flow through the street i thought of you capitan -- the partizan of force could not do much with the general and they miss simoun ah if simoun have not be take ill -- with the arrest of basilio and the search make later among he book and papers capitan tiago have become much worse now padre irene have come to augment he terror with hair-raising tale ineffable fear seize upon the wretch manifest itself first by a light shiver which be rapidly accentuate until he be unable to speak with he eye bulge and he brow cover with sweat he catch padre irene 's arm and try to rise but could not and then utter two groan fall heavily back upon the pillow he eye be wide open and he be slaver -- but he be dead the terrify padre irene flee and as the die man have catch hold of he in he flight he drag the corpse from the bed leave it sprawl in the middle of the room by

dedicate paternoster and requiem to each of the soul of they relative and friend by eight o'clock hardly a pedestrian could be see -- only from time to time be hear the gallop of a horse against whose

replace with peninsular artilleryman and on the follow morning as the sun rise ben-zayb who have venture to take a morning stroll to examine the condition of the fortification find on the glaci near the luneta the corpse of a native girl half-naked and abandon ben-zayb be horrify but after touch it with he cane and gaze toward the gate proceed on he way muse over a sentimental tale he might base upon the incident however no allusion to it appear in the newspaper on the following day engross as they be with the fall and slipping cause by banana-peel in the dearth of news ben-zayb have to comment at length on a cyclone that have destroy in america whole town cause the death of more than two thousand person among other beautiful thing he say : _ the sentiment of charity _ more prevalent in catholic country than in other and the thought of he who influence by that same feeling sacrifice himself for _ humanity move -lrb- sic -rrb- _ we to compassion over the misfortune of we kind and to render thanks that _ in this country _ so scourge by cyclone there be not enact scene so desolating as that which the inhabitant of the united state mu have witness _ horatius _ do not miss the opportunity and also without mention the dead or the murder native girl or the assault answer he in he _ pirotecnium _ : after such great charity and such great humanity fray ibañez -- i mean ben-zayb -- bring himself to pray for the philippine but he be understand because he be not catholic and the sentiment of charity be most prevalent etc -lrb- 62 -rrb- chapter xxix exit capitan tiago talis vita finis ita capitan tiago have a good end -- that be a quite exceptional funeral true it be that the curate of the parish have venture the observation to padre irene that capitan tiago have die without confession but the good priest smile sardonically have rub the tip of he nose and answer : why say that to I if we have to deny the obsequy to all who die without confession we should forget the _ de profundis _ these restriction as you well know be enforce when the impenitent be also insolvent but capitan tiago -- out on you you have bury infidel chinaman and with a requiem mass capitan tiago have name padre irene as he executor and will he property in part to st clara part to the pope to the archbishop the religious corporation leave twenty peso for the matriculation of poor student this last clause have be dictate at the suggestion of padre irene in he capacity as protector of studious youth capitan tiago have annul a legacy of twenty-five peso that he have leave to basilio in view of the ungrateful conduct of the boy during the last few day but padre irene have restore it and announce that he would take it upon he own purse and conscience in the dead man 's house where be assemble on the follow day many old friend and acquaintance considerable comment be indulge in over a miracle it be report that at the very moment when he be die the soul of capitan tiago have appear to the nun surround by a brilliant light god have save he thanks to the pious legacy and to the numerous mass he have pay for the story be comment upon it be recount vividly it take on particulars and be doubt by no one the appearance of capitan tiago be minutely describe -- of course the frock coat the cheek bulge out by the quid of buyo without omit the game-cock and the opium-pipe the senior sacristan who be present gravely affirm these fact with he head and reflect that after death he would appear with he cup of white _ tajú _ for without that refreshing breakfast he could not comprehend happiness either on earth or in heaven on this subject because of they inability to discuss the event of the precede day and because there be gambler present many strange speculation be develop they make conjecture as to whether capitan tiago would invite st peter to a _ soltada _ whether they would place bet whether the game-cock be immortal whether invulnerable and in this case who would be the referee who would win and so on : discussion quite to the taste of those who find science theory and system base on a text which they esteem infallible reveal or dogmatic moreover there be cite passage from novenas book of miracle saying of the curate description of heaven and other embroidery don primitivo the philosopher be in he glory quote opinion of the theologian because no one can lose he state with great authority to lose would cause hard feeling and in heaven there can not be any hard feeling but some one have to win rejoin the gambler aristorena the fun lie in win well both win that be easy this idea of both win could not be admit by aristorena for he have pass he life in the cockpit and have always see one cock lose and the other win -- at best there be a tie vainly don primitivo argue in latin aristorena shake he head and that too when don primitivo 's latin be easy to understand for he talk of _ a gallus talisainus acuto tarus armatus a gallus beatus petrus bulikus sasabungus sit _ -lrb- 63 -rrb- and so on until at length he decide to resort to the argument which many use to convince and silence they opponent you be go to be damned friend martin you be fall into heresy _ cave ne cada _ i be not go to play monte with you any more and we 'll not set up a bank together you deny the omnipotence of god _ peccatum mortale _ you deny the existence of the holy trinity -- three be one and one be three take care you indirectly deny that two nature two understanding and two will can have only one memory be careful _ quicumque non crederit anathema sit _ martin aristorena shrink away pale and tremble while quiroga who have listen with great attention to the argument with marked deference offer the philosopher a magnificent cigar at the same time ask in he caress voice : surely one can make a contract for a cockpit with kilisto -lrb- 64 -rrb- ha when i die i 'll be the contractor ha among the other they talk more of the decease at least they discuss what kind of clothing to put on he capitan tinong propose a franciscan habit -- and fortunately he have one old threadbare and patch a precious object which accord to the friar who give it to he as alms in exchange for thirty-six peso would preserve the corpse from the flame of hell and which reckon in its support various pious anecdote take from the book distribute by the curate although he hold this relic in great esteem capitan tinong be dispose to part with it for the sake of he intimate friend whom he have not be able to visit during he illness but a tailor object with good reason that since the nun have see capitan tiago ascend to heaven in a frock coat in a frock coat he should be dress here on earth nor be there any necessity for preservative and fire-proof garment the decease have attend ball and fiesta in a frock coat and nothing else would be expect of he in the sky -- and wonderful to relate the tailor accidentally happen to have one ready which he would part with for thirty-two peso four cheaper than the franciscan habit because he do not want to make any profit on capitan tiago who have be he customer in life and would now be he patron in heaven but padre irene trustee and executor reject both proposal and order that the capitan be dress in one of he old suit of clothes remark with holy unction that god pay no attention to clothing the obsequy be therefore of the very first class there be responsory in the house and in the street three friar officiate as though one be not sufficient for such a great soul all the rite and ceremony possible be perform and it be report that there be even _ extra _ as in the benefit for actor it be indeed a delight : load of incense be burn there be plenty of latin chant large quantity of holy water be expend and padre irene out of regard for he old friend sing the _ die irae _ in a falsetto voice from the choir while the neighbor suffer real headache from so much knell-ringing doña patrocinio the ancient rival of capitan tiago in religiosity actually want to die on the next day so that she might order even more sumptuous obsequy the pious old lady could not bear the thought that he whom she have long consider vanquished forever should in die come forward again with so much pomp yes she desire to die and it seem that she could hear the exclamation of the people at the funeral : this indeed be what you call a funeral this indeed be to know how to die doña patrocinio chapter xxx julus the death of capitan tiago and basilio 's imprisonment be soon report in the province and to the honor of the simple inhabitant of san diego let it be record that the latter be the incident more regret and almost the only one discuss as be to be expect the report take on different form sad and startling detail be give what could not be understand be explain the gap be fill by conjecture which soon pass for accomplished fact and the phantom thus create terrify they own creator in the town of tianus it be report that at least at the very least the young man be go to be deport and would very probably be murder on the journey the timorous and pessimistic be not satisfy with this but even talk about execution and courts-martial -- January be a fatal month in January the cavite affair have occur and _ they _ -lrb- 65 -rrb- even though curate have be garrote so a poor basilio without protector or friend -- i tell he so sigh the justice of the peace as if he have at some time give advice to basilio i tell he so it be to be expect comment sister penchang he would go into the church and when he see that the holy water be somewhat dirty he would not cross himself with it he talk about germ and disease _ abá _ it be the chastisement of god he deserve it and he get it as though the holy water could transmit disease quite the contrary _ abá _ she then related how she have cure herself of indigestion by moisten she stomach with holy water at the same time recite the _ sanctus deus _ and she recommend the remedy to those present when they should suffer from dysentery or a epidemic occur only that then they must pray in spanish : santo diós santo fuerte santo inmortal ¡ librano señor de la peste y de todo mal -lrb- 66 -rrb- it be a infallible remedy but you must apply the holy water to the part affect she conclude but there be many person who do not believe in these thing nor do they attribute basilio 's imprisonment to the chastisement of god nor do they take any stock in insurrection and pasquinade know the prudent and ultra-pacific character of the boy but prefer to ascribe it to revenge on the part of the friar because of he have rescue from servitude julus the daughter of a tulisan who be the mortal enemy of a certain powerful corporation as they have quite a poor idea of the morality of that same corporation and could recall case of petty revenge they conjecture be believe to have more probability and justification what a good thing i do when i drive she from my house say sister penchang i do not want to have any trouble with the friar so i urge she to find the money the truth be however that she regret julus 's liberty for julus pray and fast for she and if she have stay a longer time would also have do penance why if the curate pray for we and christ die for we sin could not juli do the same for sister penchang when the news reach the hut where the poor julus and she grandfather live the girl have to have it repeat to she she stare at sister balus who be tell it as though without comprehension without ability to collect she thought she ear buzz she feel a sinking at the heart and have a vague presentiment that this event would have a disastrous influence on she own future yet she try to seize upon a ray of hope she smile think that sister balus be joke with she a rather strong joke to be sure but she forgive she beforehand if she would acknowledge that it be such but sister balus make a cross with one of she thumb and a forefinger and kiss it to prove that she be tell the truth then the smile fade forever from the girl 's lip she turn pale frightfully pale she feel she strength leave she and for the first time in she life she lose consciousness fall into a swoon when by dint of blow pinch dash of water cross and the application of sacred palm the girl recover and remember the situation silent tear spring from she eye drop by drop without sob without lament without complaint she think about basilio who have have no other protector than capitan tiago and who now with the capitan dead be leave completely unprotected and in prison in the philippine it be a well-known fact that patron be need for everything from the time one be christen until one die in order to get justice to secure a passport or to develop a industry as it be say that he imprisonment be due to revenge on account of herself and she father the girl 's sorrow turn to desperation now it be she duty to liberate he as he have do in rescue she from servitude and the inner voice which suggest the idea offer to she imagination a horrible means padre camorra the curate whisper the voice julus gnaw at she lip and become lose in gloomy meditation as a result of she father 's crime she grandfather have be arrest in the hope that by such mean the son could be make to appear the only one who could get he he liberty be padre camorra and padre camorra have show himself to be poorly satisfy with she word of gratitude have with he usual frankness ask for some sacrifice -- since which time julus have try to avoid meeting he but the curate make she kiss he hand he twitch she nose and pat she cheek he joke with she wink and laugh and laugh he pinch she julus be also the cause of the beat the good curate have administer to some young man who be go about the village serenade the girl malicious one see she pass sad and dejected would remark so that she might hear : if she only wish it cabesang tale would be pardon julus reach she home gloomy and with wander look she have change greatly have lose she merriment and no one ever see she smile again she scarcely speak and seem to be afraid to look at she own face one day she be see in the town with a big spot of soot on she forehead she who use to go so trim and neat once she ask sister balus if the people who commit suicide go to hell surely reply that woman and proceed to describe the place as though she have be there upon basilio 's imprisonment the simple and grateful relative have plan to make all kind of sacrifice to save the young man but as they could collect among themselves no more than thirty peso sister balus as usual thought of a better plan what we must do be to get some advice from the town clerk she say to these poor people the town clerk be what the delphic oracle be to the ancient greek by give he a real and a cigar she continue he 'll tell you all the law so that you head burst listen to he if you have a peso he 'll save you even though you may be at the foot of the scaffold when my friend simon be put in jail and flog for not be able to give evidence about a robbery perpetrate near he house _ abá _ for two real and a half and a string of garlic the town clerk get he out and i see simon myself when he could scarcely walk and he have to stay in bed at least a month ay he flesh rot as a result and he die sister balus 's advice be accept and she herself volunteer to interview the town clerk julus give she four real and add some strip of jerk venison she grand-father have get for tandang selo have again devoted himself to hunting but the town clerk could do nothing -- the prisoner be in manila and he power do not extend that far if at least he be at the capital then -- he venture to make a show of he authority which he know very well do not extend beyond the boundary of tianus but he have to maintain he prestige and keep the jerk venison but i can give you a good piece of advice and it be that you go with julus to see the justice of the peace but it be very necessary that julus go the justice of the peace be a very rough fellow but if he should see julus he might conduct himself less rudely -- this be wherein lay the wisdom of the advice with great gravity the honorable justice listen to sister balus who do the talking but not without stare from time to time at the girl who hang she head with shame people would say that she be greatly interested in basilio people who do not remember she debt of gratitude nor that he imprisonment accord to report be on she account after belch three or four time for he honor have that ugly habit he say that the only person who could save basilio be padre camorra _ in case he should care to do so _ here he stare meaningly at the girl and advise she to deal with the curate in person you know what influence he have -- he get you grand-father out of jail a report from he be enough to deport a new-born babe or save from death a man with the noose about he neck julus say nothing but sister balus take this advice as though she have read it in a novena and be ready to accompany the girl to the convento it so happen that she be just go there to get as alms a scapulary in exchange for four full real but julus shake she head and be unwilling to go to the convento sister balus think she could guess the reason -- padre camorra be repute to be very fond of the woman and be very frolicsome -- so she try to reassure she you have nothing to fear if i go with you have not you read in the booklet _ tandang basio _ give you by the curate that the girl should go to the convento even without the knowledge of they elder to relate what be go on at home _ abá _ that book be print with the permission of the archbishop julus become impatient and wish to cut short such talk so she beg the pious woman to go if she wish but he honor observe with a belch that the supplication of a youthful face be more move than those of a old one the sky pour its dew over the fresh flower in greater abundance than over the withered one the metaphor be fiendishly beautiful julus do not reply and the two leave the house in the street the girl firmly refuse to go to the convento and they return to they village sister balus who feel offend at this lack of confidence in herself on the way home relieve she feeling by administer a long preachment to the girl the truth be that the girl could not take that step without damn herself in she own eye besides be curse of man and curse of god it have be intimate to she several time whether with reason or not that if she would make that sacrifice she father would be pardon and yet she have refuse in spite of the cry of she conscience remind she of she filial duty now must she make it for basilio she sweetheart that would be to fall to the sound of mockery and laughter from all creation basilio himself would despise she no never she would first hang herself or leap from some precipice at any rate she be already damned for be a

l'espagne et sa grandeur tout s ` en va -- victor hugo the newspaper of manila be so engross in account of a notorious murder commit in europe in panegyric and puff for various preacher in the city in the constantly increase success of the french operetta that they could scarcely devote space to the crime perpetrate in the province by a band of tulisane head by a fierce and terrible leader who be call _ matanglawin _ -lrb- 68 -rrb- only when the object of the attack be a convento or a spaniard there then appear long article give frightful detail and ask for martial law energetic measure and so on so it be that they could take no notice of what have occur in the town of tianus nor be there the slightest hint or allusion to it in private circle something be whisper but so confused so vague and so little consistent that not even the name of the victim be know while those who show the greatest interest forget it quickly trust that the affair have be settle in some way with the wrong family the only one who know anything certain be padre camorra who have to leave the town to be transfer to another or to remain for some time in the convento in manila poor padre camorra exclaim ben-zayb in a fit of generosity he be so jolly and have such a good heart it be true that the student have recover they liberty thanks to the exertion of they relative who do not hesitate at expense gift or any sacrifice whatsoever the first to see himself free as be to be expect be makaraig and the last isaganus because padre florentine do not reach manila until a week after the event so many act of clemency secure for the general the title of clement and merciful which ben-zayb hasten to add to he long list of adjective the only one who do not obtain he liberty be basilio since he be also accuse of have in he possession prohibit book we do not know whether this refer to he text-book on legal medicine or to the pamphlet that be find deal with the philippine or both together -- the fact be that it be say that prohibit literature be be secretly sell and upon the unfortunate boy fall all the weight of the rod of justice it be report that he excellency have be thus advise : it be necessary that there be some one so that the prestige of authority may be sustained and that it may not be say that we make a great fuss over nothing authority before everything it be necessary that some one be make a example of let there be just one one who accord to padre irene be the servant of capitan tiago -- there 'll be no one to enter a complaint -- servant and student ask he excellency that fellow then let it be he you excellency will pardon I observe the high official who happen to be present but i have be tell that this boy be a medical student and he teacher speak well of he if he remain a prisoner he 'll lose a year and as this year he finish -- the high official 's interference in behalf of basilio instead of help harm he for some time there have be between this official and he excellency strain relation and bad feeling augment by frequent clash yes so much the greater reason that he should be keep prisoner a year longer in he study instead of injure he will do good not only to himself but to all who afterwards fall into he hand one do not become a bad physician by extensive practice so much the more reason that he should remain soon the filibuster reformer will say that we be not look out for the country conclude he excellency with a sarcastic laugh the high official realize that he have make a false move and take basilio 's case to heart but it seem to I that this young man be the most innocent of all he rejoin rather timidly book have be seize in he possession observe the secretary yes work on medicine and pamphlet write by peninsular with the leaf uncut and besides what do that signify moreover this young man be not present at the banquet in the _ pansitería _ he have not mix up in anything as i have say he be the most innocent -- so much the better exclaim he excellency jocosely in that way the punishment will prove more salutary and exemplary since it inspire greater terror to govern be to act in this way my dear sir as it be often expedient to sacrifice the welfare of one to the welfare of many but i be do more -- from the welfare of one will result the welfare of all the principle of endanger authority be preserved prestige be respect and maintain by this act of mine i be correct my own and other people 's fault the high official restrain himself with a effort and disregard the allusion decide to take another tack but do not you excellency fear the -- responsibility what have i to fear rejoin the general impatiently have not i discretionary power can not i do what i please for the better government of these island what have i to fear can some menial perhaps arraign I before the tribunal and exact from I responsibility even though he have the means he would have to consult the ministry first and the minister -- he wave he hand and burst out into laughter the minister who appoint I the devil know where he be and he will feel honor in be able to welcome I when i return the present one i do not even think of he and the devil take he too the one that relieve he will find himself in so many difficulty with he new duty that he will not be able to fool with trifle i my dear sir have nothing over I but my conscience i act accord to my conscience and my conscience be satisfy so i do not care a straw for the opinion of this one and that my conscience my dear sir my conscience yes general but the country -- tut tut tut tut the country -- what have i to do avith the country have i perhaps contract any obligation to it do i owe my office to it be it the country that elect I a brief pause ensue during which the high official stand with bow head then as if reach a decision he raise it to stare fixedly at the general pale and tremble he say with repress energy : that do not matter general that do not matter at all you excellency have not be choose by the filipino people but by spain all the more reason why you should treat the filipino well so that they may not be able to reproach spain the greater reason general the greater reason you excellency by come here have contract the obligation to govern justly to seek the welfare -- be i not do it interrupt he excellency in exasperation take a step forward have not i tell you that i be get from the good of one the good of all be you now go to give I lesson if you do not understand my action how be i to blame do i compel you to share my responsibility certainly not reply the high official draw himself up proudly you excellency do not compel I you excellency can not compel I _ I _ to share _ you _ responsibility i understand mine in quite another way and because i have it i be go to speak -- i have hold my peace a long time oh you excellency need not make those gesture because the fact that i have come here in this or that capacity do not mean that i have give up my rights that i have be reduce to the part of a slave without voice or dignity i do not want spain to lose this beautiful empire these eight million of patient and submissive subject who live on hope and delusion but neither do i wish to soil my hand in they barbarous exploitation i do not wish it ever to be say that the slave-trade abolish spain have continue to cloak it with she banner and perfect it under a wealth of specious institution no to be great spain do not have to be a tyrant spain be sufficient unto herself spain be greater when she have only she own territory wrest from the clutch of the moor i too be a spaniard but before be a spaniard i be a man and before spain and above spain be she honor the lofty principle of morality the eternal principle of immutable justice ah you be surprised that i think thus because you have no idea of the grandeur of the spanish name no you have not any idea of it you identify it with person and interest to you the spaniard may be a pirate he may be a murderer a hypocrite a cheat anything just so he keep what he have -- but to I the spaniard should lose everything empire power wealth everything before he honor ah my dear sir we protest when we read that might be place before right yet we applaud when in practice we see might play the hypocrite in not only pervert right but even in use it as a tool in order to gain control for the very reason that i love spain i be speak now and i defy you frown i do not wish that the come age accuse spain of be the stepmother of the nation the vampire of race the tyrant of small island since it would be a horrible mockery of the noble principle of we ancient king how be we carry out they sacred legacy they promise to these island protection and justice and we be play with the life and liberty of the inhabitant they promise civilization and ^ we be curtail it fearful that they may aspire to a nobler existence they promise they light and we cover they eye that they may not witness we orgy they promise to teach they virtue and we be encourage they vice instead of peace wealth and justice confusion reign commerce languish and skepticism be foster among the mass let we put ourselves in the place of the filipino and ask ourselves what we would do in they place ah in you silence i read they right to rebel and if matter do not mend they will rebel some day and justice will be on they side with they will go the sympathy of all honest man of every patriot in the world when a people be deny light home liberty and justice -- thing that be essential to life and therefore man 's patrimony -- that people have the right to treat he who so despoil it as we would the robber who intercept we on the highway there be no distinction there be no exception nothing but a fact a right a aggression and every honest man who do not place himself on the side of the wrong make himself a accomplice and stain he conscience true i be not a soldier and the year be cool the little fire in my blood but just as i would risk be tear to piece to defend the integrity of spain against any foreign invader or against a unjustified disloyalty in she province so i also assure you that i would place myself beside the oppressed filipino because i would prefer to fall in the cause of the outraged rights of humanity to triumph with the selfish interest of a nation even when that nation be call as it be call -- spain do you know when the mail-boat leave inquire he excellency coldly when the high official have finish speak the latter stare at he fixedly then drop he head and silently leave the palace outside he find he carriage await he some day when you declare yourselve independent he say somewhat abstractedly to the native lackey who open the carriage-door for he remember that there be not lack in spain heart that beat for you and struggle for you rights where sir ask the lackey who have understand nothing of this and be inquire whither they should go two hour later the high official hand in he resignation and announce he intention of return to spain by the next mail-steamer chapter xxxii effect of the pasquinade as a result of the event narrate many mother order they son immediately to leave off they study and devote themselves to idleness or to agriculture when the examination come suspension be plentiful and he be a rare exception who finish the course if he have belong to the famous association to which no one pay any more attention pecson tadeo and juanito pelaez be all alike suspend -- the first receive he dismissal with he foolish grin and declare he intention of become a officer in some court while tadeo with he eternal holiday realize at last pay for a illumination and make a bonfire of he book nor do the other get off much better and at length they too have to abandon they study to the great satisfaction of they mother who always fancy they son hang if they should come to understand what the book teach juanito pelaez alone take the blow ill since it force he to leave school for he father 's store with whom he be thenceforward to be associate in the business : the rascal find the store much less entertaining but after some time he friend again notice he hump appear a symptom that he good humor be return the rich makaraig in view of the catastrophe take good care not to expose himself and have secure a passport by means of money set out in haste for europe it be say that he excellency the captain-general in he desire to do good by good means and careful of the interest of the filipino hinder the departure of every one who could not first prove substantially that he have the money to spend and could live in idleness in european city among we acquaintance those who get off best be isaganus and sandoval : the former pass in the subject he study under padre fernandez and be suspend in the other while the latter be able to confuse the examining-board with he oratory basilio be the only one who do not pass in any subject who be not suspend and who do not go to europe for he remain in bilibid prison subject every three day to examination almost always the same in principle without other variation than a change of inquisitor since it seem that in the presence of such great guilt all give up or fall away in horror and while the document molder or be shift about while the stamped papers increase like the plaster of a ignorant physician on the body of a hypochondriac basilio become inform of all the detail of what have happen in tianus of the death of julus and the disappearance of tandang selo sinong the abused cochero who have drive he to san diego happen to be in manila at that time and call to give he all the news meanwhile simoun have recover he health or so at least the newspaper say ben-zayb render thanks to the omnipotent who watch over such a precious life and manifest the hope that the highest would some day reveal the malefactor whose crime remain unpunished thanks to the charity of the victim who be too closely follow the word of the great martyr : _ father forgive they for they know not what they do _ these and other thing ben-zayb say in print while by mouth he be inquire whether there be any truth in the rumor that the opulent jeweler be go to give a grand fiesta a banquet such as have never before be see in part to celebrate he recovery and in part as a farewell to the country in which he have increase he fortune it be whisper as certain that simoun who would have to leave with the captain-general whose command expire in may be make every effort to secure from madrid a extension and that he be advise he excellency to start a campaign in order to have a excuse for remain but it be further report that for the first time he excellency have disregard the advice of he favorite make it a point of honor not to retain for a single additional day the power that have be confer upon he a rumor which encourage belief that the fiesta announce would take place very soon for the rest simoun remain unfathomable since he have become very uncommunicative show himself seldom and smile mysteriously when the rumor fiesta be mention come señor sindbad ben-zayb have once rally he dazzle we with something yankee you owe something to this country doubtless be simoun 's response with a dry smile you 'll throw the house wide open eh maybe but as i have no house -- you ought to have secure capitan tiago 's which señor pelaez get for nothing simoun become silent and from that time on he be often see in the store of don timoteo pelaez with whom it be say he have enter into partnership some week afterward in the month of April it be rumor that juanito pelaez don timoteo 's son be go to marry paulita gomez the

marry he son to a rich heiress -- just say if those be not stroke of luck that all honorable man do not have if you only know whence come that luck of señor pelaez 's another respond in a tone which indicate that the speaker do know it be also assure that there 'll be a fiesta and on a grand scale be add with mystery it be really true that paulita be go to marry juanito pelaez she love for isaganus have gradually wane like all first love base on poetry and sentiment the event of the pasquinade and the imprisonment of the youth have shear he of all he charm to whom would it have occur to seek danger to desire to share the fate of he comrade to surrender himself when every one be hide and deny any complicity in the affair it be quixotic it be madness that no sensible person in manila could pardon and juanito be quite right in ridicule he represent what a sorry figure he cut when he go to the civil government naturally the brilliant paulita could no longer love a young man who so erroneously understand social matter and whom all condemn then she begin to reflect juanito be clever capable gay shrewd the son of a rich merchant of manila and a spanish mestizo besides -- if don timoteo be to be believe a full-blooded spaniard on the other hand isaganus be a provincial native who dream of forest infested with leech he be of doubtful family with a priest for a uncle who would perhaps be a enemy to luxury and ball of which she be very fond one beautiful morning therefore it occur to she that she have be a downright fool to prefer he to he rival and from that time on pelaez 's hump steadily increase unconsciously yet rigorously paulita be obey the law discover by darwin that the female surrender herself to the fittest male to he who know how to adapt himself to the medium in which he live and to live in manila there be no other like pelaez who from he infancy have have chicanery at he finger-tip lend pass with its holy week its array of procession and pompous

the ceremony would be solemnize two day before the departure of the general who would honor the house and make a present to the bridegroom it be whisper that the jeweler would pour out cascade of diamond and throw away handful of pearl in honor of he partner 's son thus since he could hold no fiesta of he own as he be a bachelor and have no house improve the opportunity to dazzle the filipino

save rope the prisoner move along almost uncovered and unshod he be the best off who have a handkerchief twist around he head pant suffer cover with dust which perspiration convert into mud they feel they brain melt they see light dance before they red spot float in the air exhaustion and dejection be picture in they face desperation wrath something indescribable the look of one who die cursing of a man who be weary of life who hate himself who blaspheme against god the strongest lower they head to rub they face against the dusky back of those in front of they and thus wipe away the sweat that be blind they many be limp but if any one of they happen to fall and thus delay the march he would hear a curse as a soldier run up brandish a branch tear from a tree and force he to rise by striking about in all direction the string then start to run drag rolling in the dust the fall one who howl and beg to be kill but perchance he succeed in get on he foot and then go along cry like a child and cursing the hour he be bear the human cluster halt at time while the guard drink and then the prisoner continue on they way with parched mouth darken brain and heart full of curse thirst be for these wretch the least of they trouble move on you son of -- cry a soldier again refresh hurl the insult common among the lower class of filipino the branch whistle and fall on any shoulder whatsoever the nearest one or at time upon a face to leave a welt at first white then red and later dirty with the dust of the road move on you coward at time a voice yell in spanish deepen its tone coward repeat the mountain echo then the coward quicken they pace under a sky of red-hot iron over a burning road lash by the knotty branch which be worn into shred on they livid skin a siberian winter would perhaps be tenderer than the may sun of the philippine yet among the soldier there be one who look with disapprove eye upon so much wanton cruelty as he march along silently with he brow knit in disgust at length see that the guard not satisfy with the branch be kick the prisoner that fall he could no longer restrain himself but cry out impatiently here mautang let they alone mautang turn toward he in surprise what be it to you carolino he ask to I nothing but it hurt I reply carolino they be man like ourselves it be plain that you be new to the business retort mautang with a compassionate smile how do you treat the prisoner in the war with more consideration surely answer carolino mautang remain silent for a moment and then apparently have discover the reason calmly rejoin ah it be because they be enemy and fight we while these -- these be we own countryman then draw nearer to carolino he whisper how stupid you be they be treat so in order that they may attempt to resist or to escape and then -- bang carolino make no reply one of the prisoner then beg that they let he stop for a moment this be a dangerous place answer the corporal gaze uneasily toward the mountain move on move on echo mautang and he lash whistle the prisoner twist himself around to stare at he with reproachful eye you be more cruel than the spaniard himself he say mautang reply with more blow when suddenly a bullet whistle follow by a loud report mautang drop he rifle utter a oath and clutch at he breast with both hand fall spin into a heap the prisoner see he writhe in the dust with blood spurt from he mouth halt call the corporal suddenly turn pale the soldier stop and stare about they a wisp of smoke rise from a thicket on the height above another bullet sing to its accompany report and the corporal wound in the thigh double over vomit curse the column be attack by man hide among the rock above sullen with rage the corporal motion toward the string of prisoner and laconically order fire the wretch fall upon they knee fill with consternation as they could not lift they hand they beg for mercy by kiss the dust or bow they head -- one talk of he child another of he mother who would be leave unprotected one promise money another call upon god -- but the muzzle be quickly lower and a hideous volley silence they all then begin the sharpshoot against those who be behind the rock above over which a light cloud of smoke begin to hover to judge from the scarcity of they shot the invisible enemy could not have more than three rifle as they advance firing the guard seek cover behind tree-trunk or crouch down as they attempt to scale the height splintered rock leap up broken twig fall from tree patch of earth be tear up and the first guard who attempt the ascent roll back with a bullet through he shoulder the hidden enemy have the advantage of position but the valiant guard who do not know how to flee be on the point of retire for they have pause unwilling to advance that fight against the invisible unnerved they smoke and rock alone could be see -- not a voice be hear not a shadow appear they seem to be fight with the mountain shoot carolino what be you aim at call the corporal at that instant a man appear upon a rock making sign with he rifle shoot he order the corporal with a foul oath three guard obey the order but the man continue stand there call out at the top of he voice something unintelligible carolino pause think that he recognize something familiar about that figure which stand out plainly in the sunlight but the corporal threaten to tie he up if he do not fire so carolino take aim and the report of he rifle be hear the man on the rock spin around and disappear with a cry that leave carolino horror-stricken then follow a rustling in the bush indicate that those within be scatter in all direction so the soldier boldly advance now that there be no more resistance another man appear upon the rock wave a spear and they fire at he he sink down slowly catch at the branch of a tree but with another volley fall face downward on the rock the guard climb on nimbly with bayonet fix ready for a hand-to-hand fight carolino alone move forward reluctantly with a wander gloomy look the cry of the man strike by he bullet still ring in he ear the first to reach the spot find a old man die stretch out on the rock he plunge he bayonet into the body but the old man do not even wink he eye be fix on carolino with a indescribable gaze while with he bony hand he point to something behind the rock the soldier turn to see caroline frightfully pale he mouth hang open with a look in which glimmer the last spark of reason for carolino who be no other than tano cabesang tale ' son and who have just return from the caroline recognize in the die man he grandfather tandang selo no longer able to speak the old man 's die eye utter a whole poem of grief -- and then a corpse he still continue to point to something behind the rock chapter xxxix conclusion in he solitary retreat on the shore of the sea whose mobile surface be visible through the open window extend outward until it mingle with the horizon padre florentino be relieve the monotony by play on he harmonium sad and melancholy tune to which the sonorous roar of the surf and the sighing of the treetop of the neighbor wood serve as accompaniment note long full mournful as a prayer yet still vigorous escape from the old instrument padre florentino who be a accomplished musician be improvise and as he be alone give free rein to the sadness in he heart for the truth be that the old man be very sad he good friend don tiburcio de espadaña have just leave he flee from the persecution of he wife that morning he have receive a note from the lieutenant of the civil guard which run thus : my dear chaplain -- i have just receive from the commandant a telegram that say spaniard hidden house padre florentino capture forward alive dead as the telegram be quite explicit warn you friend not to be there when i come to arrest he at eight tonight affectionately perez burn this note t-that v-victorina don tiburcio have stammer s-she 's c-capable of have I s-shot padre florentino be unable to reassure he vainly he point out to he that the word _ cojera _ should have read _ cogerá _ -lrb- 77 -rrb- and that the hidden spaniard could not be don tiburcio but the jeweler simoun who two day before have arrive wound and a fugitive beg for shelter but don tiburcio would not be convince -- _ cojera _ be he own lameness he personal description and it be a intrigue of victorina 's to get he back alive or dead as isaganus have write from manila so the poor ulyss have leave the priest 's house to conceal himself in the hut of a woodcutter no doubt be entertain by padre florentino that the spaniard want be the jeweler simoun who have arrive mysteriously himself carry the jewel-chest bleeding morose and exhaust with the free and cordial filipino hospitality the priest have take he in without ask indiscreet question and as news of the event in manila have not yet reach he ear he be unable to understand the situation clearly the only conjecture that occur to he be that the general the jeweler 's friend and protector be go probably he enemy the victim of wrong and abuse be now rise and call for vengeance and that the act governor be pursue he to make he disgorge the wealth he have accumulate -- hence he flight but whence come he wound have he try to commit suicide be they the result of personal revenge or be they merely cause by a accident as simoun claim have they be receive in escape from the force that be pursue he this last conjecture be the one that seem to have the greatest appearance of probability be further strengthen by the telegram receive and simoun 's decide unwillingness from the start to be treat by the doctor from the capital the jeweler submit only to the ministration of don tiburcio and even to they with marked distrust in this situation padre florentino be ask himself what line of conduct he should pursue when the civil guard come to arrest simoun he condition would not permit he removal much less a long journey -- but the telegram say alive or dead padre florentine cease playing and approach the window to gaze out at the sea whose desolate surface be without a ship without a sail -- it give he no suggestion a solitary islet outline in the distance speak only of solitude and make the space more lonely infinity be at time despairingly mute the old man be try to analyze the sad and ironical smile with which simoun have receive the news that he be to be arrest what do that smile mean and that other smile still sadder and more ironical with which he receive the news that they would not come before eight at night what do all this mystery signify why do simoun refuse to hide there come into he mind the celebrated saying of st john chrysostom when he be defend the eunuch eutropius : never be a better time than this to say -- vanity of vanity and all be vanity yes that simoun so rich so powerful so fear a week ago and now more unfortunate than eutropius be seek refuge not at the altar of a church but in the miserable house of a poor native priest hide in the forest on the solitary seashore vanity of vanity and all be vanity that man would within a few hour be a prisoner drag from the bed where he lay without respect for he condition without consideration for he wound -- dead or alive he enemy demand he how could he save he where could he find the move accent of the bishop of constantinople what weight would he weak word have the word of a native priest whose own humiliation this same simoun have in he better day seem to applaud and encourage but padre florentine no longer recall the indifferent reception that two month before the jeweler have accord to he when he have try to interest he in favor of isagani then a prisoner on account of he imprudent chivalry he forget the activity simoun have display in urge paulita 's marriage which have plunge isaganus into the fearful misanthropy that be worry he uncle he forget all these thing and think only of the sick man 's plight and he own obligation as a host until he sens reel where must he hide he to avoid he fall into the clutch of the authority but the person chiefly concern be not worry he be smile while he be ponder over these thing the old man be approach by a servant who say that the sick man wish to speak with he so he go into the next room a clean and well-ventilated apartment with a floor of wide board smooth and polish and simply furnish with big heavy armchair of ancient design without varnish or paint at one end there be a large kamagon bed with its four post to support the canopy and beside it a table cover with bottle lint and bandage a praying-desk at the foot of a christ and a scanty library lead to the suspicion that it be the priest 's own bedroom give up to he guest accord to the filipino custom of offer to the stranger the best table the best room and the best bed in the house upon see the window open wide to admit freely the healthful sea-breeze and the echo of its eternal lament no one in the philippine would have say that a sick person be to be find there since it be the custom to close all the window and stop up all the crack just as soon as any one catch a cold or get a insignificant headache padre florentine look toward the bed and be astonish to see that the sick man 's face have lose its tranquil and ironical expression hide grief seem to knit he brow anxiety be depict in he look he lip be curl in a smile of pain be you suffer señor simoun ask the priest solicitously go to he side some but in a little while i shall cease to suffer he reply with a shake of he head padre florentine clasp he hand in fright suspect that he understand the terrible truth my god what have you do what have you take he reach toward the bottle it be useless now there be no remedy at all answer simoun with a pained smile what do you expect I to do before the clock strike eight -- alive or dead -- dead yes but alive no my god what have you do be calm urge the sick man with a wave of he hand what be do be do i must not fall into anybody 's hand -- my secret would be tear from I do not get excite do not lose you head it be useless listen -- the night be come on and there be no time to be lose i must tell you my secret and intrust to you my last request i must lay my life open before you at the supreme moment i want to lighten myself of a load i want to clear up a doubt of mine you who believe so firmly in god -- i want you to tell I if there be a god but a antidote señor simoun i have ether chloroform -- the priest begin to search for a flask until simoun cry impatiently useless it be useless do not waste time i 'll go away with my secret the bewildered priest fall down at he desk and pray at the foot of the christ hide he face in he hand then he arise serious and grave as if he have receive from he god all the force all the dignity all the authority of the judge of conscience move a chair to the head of the bed he prepare to listen at the first word simoun murmur when he tell he real name the old priest start back and gaze at he in terror whereat the sick man smile bitterly take by surprise the priest be not master of himself but he soon recover and cover he face with a handkerchief again bent over to listen simoun related he sorrowful story : how thirteen year before he have return from europe fill with hope and smile illusion have come back to marry a girl whom he love disposed to do good and forgive all who have wrong he just so they would let he live in peace but it be not so a mysterious hand involve he in the confusion of a uprising plan by he enemy name fortune love future liberty all be lose and he escape only through the heroism of a friend then he swear vengeance with the wealth of he family which have be bury in a wood he have flee have go to foreign land and engage in trade he take part in the war in cuba aid first one side and then another but always profit there he make the acquaintance of the general then a major whose good-will he win first by loan of money and afterwards he make a friend of he by the knowledge of criminal secret with he money he have be able to secure the general 's appointment and once in the philippine he have use he as a blind tool and incite he to all kind of injustice avail himself of he insatiable lust for gold the confession be long and tedious but during the whole of it the confessor make no further sign of surprise and rarely interrupt the sick man it be night when padre florentino wipe the perspiration from he face arise and begin to meditate mysterious darkness flood the room so that the moonbeam enter through the window fill it with vague light and vaporous reflection into the midst of the silence the priest 's voice break sad and deliberate but consoling : god will forgive you señor -- simoun he say he know that we be fallible he have see that you have suffer and in ordain that the chastisement for you fault should come as death from the very one you have instigate to crime we can see he infinite mercy he have frustrate you plan one by one the best conceive first by the death of marium clara then by a lack of preparation then in some mysterious way let we bow to he will and render he thanks accord to you then feebly respond the sick man he will be that these island -- should continue in the condition in which they suffer finish the priest see that the other hesitate i do not know sir i can not read the thought of the inscrutable i know that he have not abandon those people who in they supreme moment have trust in he and make he the judge of they cause i know that he arm have never fail when justice long trample upon and every recourse go the oppress have take up the sword to fight for home and wife and child for they inalienable rights which as the german poet say shine ever there above unextinguished and inextinguishable like the eternal star themselves no god be justice he can not abandon he cause the cause of liberty without which no justice be possible why then have he deny I he aid ask the sick man in a voice charge with bitter complaint because you choose mean that he could not sanction be the severe reply the glory of save a country be not for he who have contribute to its ruin you have believe that what crime and iniquity have defile and deform another crime and another iniquity can purify and redeem wrong hate never produce anything but monster and crime criminal love alone realize wonderful work virtue alone can save no if we country have ever to be free it will not be through vice and crime it will not be so by corrupt its son deceive some and bribe other no redemption presuppose virtue virtue sacrifice and sacrifice love well i accept you explanation rejoin the sick man after a pause i have be mistaken but because i have be mistake will that god deny liberty to a people and yet save many who be much worse criminal than i be what be my mistake compare to the crime of we ruler why have that god to give more heed to my iniquity than to the cry of so many innocent why have he not stricken I down and then make the people triumph why do he let so many worthy and just one suffer and look complacently upon they torture the just and the worthy must suffer in order that they idea may be know and extend you must shake or shatter the vase to spread its perfume you must smite the rock to get the spark there be something providential in the persecution of tyrant señor simoun i know it murmur the sick man and therefore i encourage the tyranny yes my friend but more corrupt influence than anything else be spread you foster the social rottenness without sowing a idea from this fermentation of vice loathing alone could spring and if anything be bear overnight it would be at best a mushroom for mushroom only can spring spontaneously from filth true it be that the vice of the government be fatal to it they cause its death but they kill also the society in whose bosom they be develop a immoral government presuppose a demoralized people a conscienceless administration greedy and servile citizen in the settle part outlaw and brigand in the mountain like master like slave like government like country a brief pause ensue break at length by the sick man 's voice then what can be do suffer and work suffer -- work echo the sick man bitterly ah it be easy to say that when you be not suffer when the work be reward if you god demand such great sacrifice from man man who can scarcely count upon the present and doubt the future if you have see what i have the miserable the wretched suffering unspeakable torture for crime they have not commit murder to cover up the fault and incapacity of other poor father of family tear from they home to work to no purpose upon highway that be destroy each day and seem only to serve for sink family into want ah to suffer to work be the will of god convince they that they murder be they salvation that they work be the prosperity of the home to suffer to work what god be that a very just god señor simoun reply the priest a god who chastise we lack of faith we vice the little esteem in which we hold dignity and the civic virtue we tolerate vice we make ourselves its accomplice at time we applaud it and it be just very just that we suffer the consequence that we child suffer they it be the god of liberty señor simoun who oblige we to love it by make the yoke heavy for we -- a god of mercy of equity who while he chastise we betters we and only grant prosperity to he who have merit it through he effort the school of suffer temper the arena of combat strengthen the soul i do not mean to say that we liberty will be secure at the sword 's point for the sword play but little part in modern affair but that we must secure it by make ourselves worthy of it by exalt the intelligence and the dignity of the individual by loving justice right and greatness even to the extent of die for they -- and when a people reach that height god will provide a weapon the idol will be shatter the tyranny will crumble like a house of card and liberty will shine out like the first dawn we ill we owe to ourselves alone so let we blame no one if spain should see that we be less complaisant with tyranny and more disposed to struggle and suffer for we rights spain would be the first to grant we liberty because when the fruit of the womb reach maturity woe unto the mother who would stifle it so while the filipino people have not sufficient energy to proclaim with head erect and bosom bare its rights to social life and to guarantee it with its sacrifice with its own blood while we see we countryman in private life ashamed within themselves hear the voice of conscience roar in rebellion and protest yet in public life keep silence or even echo the word of he who abuse they in order to mock the abused while we see they wrap themselves up in they egotism and with a forced smile praise the most iniquitous action beg with they eye a portion of the booty -- why grant they liberty with spain or without spain they would always be the same and perhaps worse why independence if the slave of today will be the tyrant of tomorrow and that they will be such be not to be doubt for he who submit to tyranny love it señor simoun when we people be unprepared when it enter the fight through fraud and force without a clear understanding of what it be do the wisest attempt will fail and better that they do fail since why commit the wife to the husband if he do not sufficiently love she if he be not ready to die for she padre florentino feel the sick man catch and press he hand so he become silent hope that the other might speak but he merely feel a stronger pressure of the hand hear a sigh and then profound silence reign in the room only the sea whose wave be ripple by the night breeze as though awake from the heat of the day send its hoarse roar its eternal chant as it roll against the jagged rock the moon now free from the sun 's rivalry peacefully command the sky and the tree of the forest bent down toward one another tell they ancient legend in mysterious murmur bear on the wing of the wind the sick man say nothing so padre florentino deeply thoughtful murmured : where be the youth who will consecrate they golden hour they illusion and they enthusiasm to the welfare of they native land where be the youth who will generously pour out they blood to wash away so much shame so much crime so much abomination pure and spotless must the victim be that the sacrifice may be acceptable where be you youth who will embody in yourselve the vigor of life that have leave we vein the purity of idea that have be contaminate in we brain the fire of enthusiasm that have be quench in we heart we await you o youth come for we await you feel he eye moisten he withdraw he hand from that of the sick man arise and go to the window to gaze out upon the wide surface of the sea he be draw from he meditation by gentle rap at the door it be the servant ask if he should bring a light when the priest return to the sick man and look at he in the light of the lamp motionless he eye close the hand that have press he lie open and extend along the edge of the bed he think for a moment that he be sleep but notice that he be not breathe touch he gently and then realize that he be dead he body have already commence to turn cold the priest fall upon he knee and pray when he arise and contemplate the corpse in whose feature be depict the deepest grief the tragedy of a whole waste life which he be carry over there beyond death the old man shudder and murmur god have mercy on those who turn he from the straight path while the servant summon by
