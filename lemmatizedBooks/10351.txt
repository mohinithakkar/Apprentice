volume of the common ' journal comprise the debate from the accession of jame the first to the cessation of parliament under charle the first the publication in 1766 of a member 's note furnish authentic debate of the session in 1621 rushworth in he voluminous collection present we with many of the debate during the civil war gray 's more regular debate succeed from these until the time that follow the glorious revolution in 1688 we have no report of parliamentary proceedings interesting as they must have be on which we can place any more reliance than on those of dr johnson which we shall presently see can not pretend to the character of faithful report however deservedly eminent they be as eloquent and energetic composition but the revolution be not immediately follow by a liberal diffusion of parliamentary intelligence for the newspaper of william 's reign only give occasionally a detach speech that sovereign scarcely allow liberty of speech to the member of parliament themselves and be fully as tyrannical in disposition as he predecessor on the throne but happily for the english nation he be tie and bind by the strong fetter of law the stormy period that ensue on william 's death be somewhat illustrate by boyer 's political state the historical register which appear on the accession of george the first may be consider as more faithful depository of political information than boyer 's partial publication the spirited opposition to sir robert walpole excite a unprecedented anxiety in the nation to learn the internal proceedings of parliament this wish on the part of constituent to know and scrutinize the conduct of they representative which to we appear so reasonable a claim be regard in a different light by we ancestor but the frown of authority in the reign of george the second begin to have less power to alarm a people whose mind be undergo progressive illumination a general desire be then loudly express for parliamentary information which cave seek to gratify by the insertion of the debate in the gentleman 's magazine the jealousy of the house however subject that indefatigable man to the practice of stratagem for the accomplishment of he design he hold the office of inspector of frank in the postoffice which bring he into contact with the officer of both house of parliament and afford he frequent and ready access to many of the member cave avail himself of this advantage frequent the house when any debate of public interest be expect and along with a friend post himself in the gallery of the house of common and in some retired station in that of the lord where unobserved they take note of the several speech these note be afterwards arrange and expand by guthrie the historian then in the employment of cave and present to the public monthly in the gentleman 's magazine they first appear in July 1736 -lrb- footnote : gent mag vol vi -rrb- and be peruse with the greatest eagerness but it be soon intimate to cave that the speaker be offend with this freedom which he regard in the light of a breach of privilege and would subject cave unless he desist to parliamentary censure or perhaps punishment to escape this and likewise to avoid a abridgment of he magazine cave have recourse to the follow artifice he open he magazine for June 1738 with a article entitle debate in the senate of magna lilliputium in which he artfully deplore the prohibition that forbid he to present he reader with the consultation of they own representative and express a hope that they will accept as a substitute those of that country which gulliver have so lately render illustrious and which untimely death have prevent that enterprising traveller from publish himself under this fiction he continue to publish the debate of the british parliament hide the name of person and place by the transposition of letter in the way of anagram these he contrived to explain to he reader by annex to he volume for 1738 feigned proposal for print a work to be call anagrammata rediviva this list and other from different year we give in the present edition though we have reject the barbarous jargon from the speech themselves a contemporary publication the london magazine feign to give the debate of the roman senate and adapt roman title to the several speaker this expedient as well as cave 's contrivance suffice to protect its ingenious author from parliamentary resentment as the resolution of the common be never enforce the debate contain in the follow volume commence with the 19th November 1740 and terminate with the 23d February 1742-3 the animated attempt that be make to remove sir robert walpole from administration seem in cave 's opinion to call for a abler reporter than guthrie johnson be select for the task and he execution of it may well justify the admiration which we have so often avowed for those wonderful power of mind which apparently bid defiance to all impediment of external fortune he be only thirty-two year of age little acquaint with the world have never perhaps be in either house and certainly have never converse with the man whose style and sentiment he take upon himself to imitate but so well and skilfully do he assume not merely the sedate and stately dignity of the lord and the undaunted freedom of the common but also the tone of the respective party that the public imagine they recognize the individual manner of the different speaker voltaire and other foreigner of distinction compare british with greek and roman eloquence and ludicrous instance be detail by johnson 's biographer of praise award to pulteney or to pitt in the presence of the unsuspected author of the oration which have excite such regard -lrb- footnote : see boswell and sir john hawkin -rrb- for johnson confess that he compose many of the speech entirely from he own imagination and all of they from very scanty material this confession he undoubtedly make from he love of truth and not for the gratification of vanity when he hear that smollett be prepare he history of england he warn he against rely on the debate as authentic and on he death-bed he profess that the recollection of have be engage in a imposture be painful to he that this be a refine scrupulosity the most rigid moralist must allow but nevertheless it be matter for congratulation that the liberality of parliament no longer subject its reporter to the subterfuge which we have thus briefly attempt to describe and a comparison of this age and its privilege with the restriction of former time may not be without its use if by remind we that we be not always free it teach we political contentment suggest to we the policy of moderation and enable we to love liberty and yet be wise oxford November 1825 _ the list of

for prohibit the exportation of corn etc on the first day of the session he majesty in he speech from the throne recommend to parliament to consider of some good law to prevent the grow mischief of the exportation of corn to foreign country on the fourth day a bill for prevent for a limited time the exportation etc be read a first time in the house of common and the question put whether it should be print which pass in the negative this day the agent for the colony of pennsylvanium and new jersey present a petition against the say corn bill which be refer to the committee another petition be also present by the agent for the colony of connecticut in new england set forth that the chief trade of that colony arise from supply other british colony with corn so that unless that colony be except from the restraint intend by this bill both that and those which be supply by it will be reduce to great distress and pray therefore that such exception may be allow the allegation in this petition be confirm by another from one of the province supply by the colony of connecticut another petition be present by the agent for south carolina set forth that unless the rice produce in that province be allow to be export the colony must be ruin by the irretrievable loss of they whole trade as the country now supply from thence might easily procure rice from the french settlement already too much they rival in trade this petition be support by another offer at the same time by the merchant of bristol a petition be likewise present by the agent for the sugar island in which it be allege that if no provision be import thither from britain they must in one month suffer the extremity of famine all these petition be refer to the committee for the bill a print paper be also deliver to the member entitle ` consideration on the embargo ' which enumerate many dangerous consequence likely to be produce by a embargo on provision and suggest that it be no better than a wicked scheme for private profit with other reflection for which the paper be deem a libel and the author commit to prison the bill be read in the committee produce the follow memorable debate mr pultney speak to this effect : -- sir after all the attention which have be bestow upon the bill now before we i can not yet conceive it such as can benefit the nation or such as will not produce far greater inconveniency than those which it be intend to obviate and therefore as those inconveniency may be prevent by other means i can not but declare that i be far from approve it we ancestor sir have always think it the great business of this house to watch against the encroachment of the prerogative and to prevent a increase of the power of the minister and the common have always be consider as more faithful to they trust and more properly the representative of the people in proportion as they have consider this great end with more attention and prosecute it with more invariable resolution if we inquire into the different degree of reputation which the several assembly of common have obtain and consider why some be remembered with reverence and gratitude and other never mention but with detestation and contempt we shall always find that they conduct with regard to this single point have produce they renown or they infamy those be always by the general suffrage of mankind applaud as the pattern of they country who have struggle with the influence of the crown and those condemn as traitor who have either promote it by unreasonable grant or see it increase by slow degree without resistance it have not indeed sir be always the practice of minister to make open demand of larger power and avow without disguise they design of extend they authority such proposal would in former time have produce no consequence but that of awaken the vigilance of the senate of raise suspicion against all they proceedings and of embarrass the crown with petition address and impeachment they be under a necessity in those time of promote they scheme those scheme which scarcely any ministry have forbear to adopt by more secret and artful and silent method by method of divert the attention of the publick to other object and of make invisible approach to the point in view while they seem to direct all they endeavor to different purpose but such sir have be the proof of implicit confidence which the administration have receive from this assembly that it be now common to demand unlimited power and to expect confidence without restriction to require a immediate possession of we estate by a vote of credit or the sole direction of we trade by a act for prohibit during they pleasure the exportation of the produce of we land upon what instance of uncommon merit of regard to the publick prosperity unknown in former time or of discernment superior to that of they most celebrated predecessor the present minister find they new claim to submission and to trust i be indeed at a loss to discover for however mankind may have determine concern the integrity of those by whom the late memorable convention be transact defend and confirm i know not that they wisdom have yet appear by any incontestable or manifest evidence which may set they ability above question and fix they reputation for policy out of the reach of censure and inquiry the only act sir by which it can be discover that they have any degree of penetration proportionate to they employment be the embargo lately lay upon provision in ireland by which we enemy have be timely hinder from furnish themselves from we dominion with necessaries for they army and they navy and we fellow-subject have be restrain from expose themselves to the misery of famine by yield to the temptation of present profit a temptation generally so powerful as to prevail over any distant interest but as nothing be more contrary to my natural disposition or more unworthy of a member of this house than flattery i can not affirm that i ascribe this useful expedient wholly to the sagacity or the caution of the ministry nor can i attribute all the happy effect produce by it to they benign solicitude for the publick welfare i be incline to believe that this step be advise by those who be prompt to consider its importance by motive more prevalent than that of publick spirit and that the desire of profit which have so often dictate pernicious measure have for once produce in return a expedient just and beneficial and it have for once luckily fall out that some of the friend of the administration have discover that the publick interest be combine with they own it be highly probable sir that the contractor for supply the navy with provision consider with that acuteness which a quick sense of loss and gain always produce how much the price of victuals would be raise by exportation and by consequence how much of the advantage of they contract would be diminish suggest to the ministry the necessity of a embargo and lay before they those argument which they own observation and wisdom would never have discover thus sir the minister in that instance of they conduct on which they political reputation must be found can claim perhaps no higher merit than that of attend to superior knowledge of comply with good advice when it be offer and of not resist demonstration when it be lay before they but as i would never ascribe to one man the merit of another i should be equally unwilling to detract from due commendation and shall therefore freely admit that not to reject good counsel be a degree of wisdom at which i could not expect that they by whom the convention be conclude would ever have arrive but whatever proficiency they may have make in the art of government since that celebrated period however they may have increase they maxim of domestick policy or improve they knowledge of foreign affair i can not but confess myself still incline to some degree of suspicion nor can prevail upon myself to shut my eye and deliver up the publick and myself implicitly to they direction they sagacity sir may perhaps of late have receive some improvement from longer experience and with regard to they integrity i believe at least that it be not much diminish and yet i can not forbear assert the right of judge for myself and of determine accord to the evidence that shall be bring before I i have hitherto entertain a opinion that for this purpose only we be depute by we constituent who if they have repose no confidence in we care or ability would have give up long since the vexatious right of contest for the choice of representative they would have furnish the ministry with general power to act for they and sit at ease with no other regard to publick measure than might incite they to animate with they applause the laudable endeavor of they profound they diligent and they magnanimous governor as i do not therefore check any suspicion in my own mind i shall not easily be restrain from utter they because i know not how i shall benefit my country or assist she counsel by silent meditation i can not sir but observe that the power confer by this bill upon the administration be larger than the nation can safely repose in any body of man and with which no man who consider to what purpose they may be employ will think it convenient to invest the negotiator of the convention nor do my objection to this act arise wholly from my apprehension of they conduct who be intrust with the execution of it but from my reflection on the nature of trade and the conduct of those nation who be most celebrate for commercial wisdom it be well know sir how difficult it be to turn trade back into its ancient channel when it have by any means be divert from it and how often a profitable traffick have be lose for ever by a short interruption or temporary prohibition the resentment of disappointed expectation incline the buyer to seek another market and the civility to which he new correspondent be incite by they own interest detain he till those by whom he be formerly supply have no longer any vent for they product or they wares employ they labor on other manufacture or cultivate they land for other purpose thus sir if those nation who have hitherto be supply with corn from britain should find a method of purchase it from denmark or any other of the northern region we may hereafter see we grain rot in we storehouse and be burden with provision which we can neither consume ourselves nor sell to we neighbor the hollander whose knowledge of the importance or skill in the art of commerce will not be question be so careful to preserve the inlet of gain from obstruction that they make no scruple of supply they enemy with they commodity and have be know to sell at night those bullet which be next day to be discharge against they whether they example sir deserve we imitation i be not able to determine but it ought at least to be consider whether they conduct be rational or not and whether they do not by a present evil ensure a advantage which overbalance it there be doubtless sir sometimes such exigency as require to be comply with at the hazard of future profit but i be not certain that the scarcity which be fear or feel at present be to be number amongst they but however formidable it may be think there be surely no need of a new law to provide against it : for it be one of those extraordinary incident on which the king have the right of exert extraordinary power on occasion like this the prerogative have heretofore operate very effectually and i know not that the law have ever restrain it it be therefore sir in my opinion most prudent to determine nothing in so dubious a question and rather to act as the immediate occasion shall require than prosecute any certain method of proceeding or establish any precedent by a act of the senate to restrain that commerce by which the necessaries of life be distribute be a very bold experiment and such as once produce a insurrection in the empire of the turk that terminate in the deposition of one of they monarch i therefore willingly confess sir that i know not how to conclude : i be unwilling to deprive the nation of bread or to supply we enemy with strength to be exert against ourselves but i be on the other hand afraid to restrain commerce and to trust the author of the convention mr pelham speak next to the follow purport : -- sir i be always in expectation of improvement and instruction when that gentleman engage in any discussion of national question on which he be equally qualify to judge by he great ability and long experience by that popularity which enable he to sound the sentiment of man of different interest and that intelligence which extend he view to distant part of the world but on this occasion i have find my expectation frustrate for he have inquire without make any discovery and harangue without illustrate the question before we he have satisfy himself sir with declare he suspicion without condescend to tell we what design or what danger he apprehend to fear without be able to show the object of we terror be the last the most despicable degree of cowardice and to suspect without know the foundation of we own suspicion be surely a proof of a state of mind which would not be applaud on common occasion and such as no man but a patriot would venture to confess he have indeed sir utter some very ingenious conceit upon the late convention have allude to it with great luxuriancy of fancy and elegance of diction and must at least confess that whatever may be its effect upon the interest of the nation it have to he be very beneficial as it have supply he with a subject of raillery when other topic begin to fail he and give opportunity for the exercise of that wit which begin to languish for want of employment what connexion he wonderful sagacity have discover between the convention and the corn bill i can not yet fully comprehend but have too high a opinion of he ability to imagine that so many insinuation be wholly without any reason to support they i doubt not therefore sir but that when some fitter opportunity shall present itself he will clear they resemblance and branch out the parallel between they into a thousand particulars in the mean time sir it may be proper for the house to expedite the bill against which no argument have yet be produce and which be of too much importance to be delay by raillery or invective mr sandy speak next in substance as follow : -- sir the bill before we as it be of too great importance to be negligently delay be likewise too dangerous to be precipitately hurry into a law it have be always the practice of this house to consider money bill with particular attention because money be power in almost the highest degree and ought not therefore to be give but upon strong assurance that it will be employ for the purpose for which it be demand and that those purpose be in themselves just but if we consider sir the bill now before we it will appear yet more than a money bill it will be find a bill for regulate the disposal of that which it be the great use of money to procure and be therefore not to be pass into a law without a close attention to every circumstance that may be combine with it and a accurate examination of all the consequence that may be produce by it some of these circumstance or consequence it be the duty of every member to lay before the house and i shall therefore propose that the inducement to the discovery of any provision illegally export and the manner of levy the forfeiture may be particularly discuss for by a defect in this part the regulation lately establish by the regency however seasonable produce tumult and distraction which every good government ought studiously to obviate by they proclamation sir half the corn that should be find design for exportation be to be give to those who should discover and seize it the populace alarm at once with the danger of a famine and animated by a proclamation that put into they own hand the means of prevent it and the punishment of those from whose avarice they apprehend it rise in throng to execute so grateful a law every man sir whose distress have exasperate he be incite to gratify he resentment every man whose idleness prompt he to maintain he family by method more easy than that of daily labor be delighted with the prospect of grow rich on a sudden by a lucky seizure all the seditious and the profligate combine together in the welcome employment of violence and rapine and when they have once raise they expectation there be no small danger lest they impatience of disappointment should determine they to conclude that corn wherever find be design for exportation and to seize it as a lawful prize thus sir by a imprudent regulation be every man 's property bring into hazard and he person expose to the insult of a hungry a rapacious and ungovernable rabble let loose by a publick proclamation and encourage to search house and carriage by a imaginary law that we may not give occasion to violence and injustice of the same kind let we carefully consider the measure which be propose before we determine upon they propriety and pass no bill on this important occasion without such deliberation as may leave we nothing to change or to repent mr earle speak next to this effect : -- sir notwithstanding the danger which have be represent as likely to arise from any error in the prosecution of this great affair i can not but declare my opinion that no delay ought to be admit and that not even the specious pretence of more exact inquiry and minute consideration ought to retard we proceedings for a day my imagination sir be perhaps not so fruitful as that of some other member of this house and therefore they may discover many inconveniency which i be not able to conceive but as every man ought to act from he own conviction it be my duty to urge the necessity of pass this bill till it can be prove to I that it will produce calamity equally to be dread with the consequence of protract we debate upon it equal to the misery of a famine or the danger of enable we enemy to store they magazine to equip they fleet and victual they garrison if it could be imagine that there be in this assembly a subject of france or spain zealous for the service of he prince and the prosperity of he country i should expect that he would summon all he faculty to retard the progress of this bill that he would employ all he sophistry to show its inconveniency and imperfection and exhaust he invention to suggest the danger of haste and certainly he could do nothing that would more effectually promote the interest of he countryman or tend more to enfeeble and depress the power of the british nation if this would naturally be the conduct of a enemy it be unnecessary to prove that we can only be safe by act in opposition to it and i think it superfluous to vindicate my ardor for promote this bill when it be evident that its delay would be please to the spaniard mr burrel then speak as follow : -- sir if this law be necessary at any time it can not now be delay for a few day spend in deliberation may make it ineffectual and that evil may be past of which we sit here contrive the prevention that many contract sir for the exportation of provision be already make in all the maritime part of the empire be generally know and it require no great sagacity to discover that those by whom they be make and make with a view of immense profit be desirous that they may be execute and that they will soon complete the execution of they when they be alarm with the apprehension of a bill which in a few day may take from they the power of export what they have already collect and snatch they gain from they when it be almost in they hand a bill for these purpose sir ought to fall upon the contractor like a sudden blow of which they have no warning or dread against which they therefore can not provide any security and which they can neither elude nor resist if we allow they a short time we expedient will be of little benefit to the nation which be every day impoverish by the exportation of the necessaries of life in such quantity that in a few week the law if it be pass may be without penalty for there will be no possibility of disobey it sir john barnard speak next to the follow purpose : -- sir i can not discover the necessity of press the bill with such precipitation as must necessarily exclude many useful consideration and may produce error extremely dangerous for i be not able to conceive what inconveniency can arise from a short delay the exportation of provision from ireland be at present stop by the proclamation and the beef which be design for other nation have be prudently buy up by the contractor by which those murmur have be in a great measure obviate which naturally arise from disappointment and loss there be therefore sir no danger of exportation from that part of we dominion which be the chief market for provision and from whence we enemy have be generally supply : in britain there be less danger of any such pernicious traffick both because the scarcity here have raise all provision to a high price and because merchant do not immediately come to a new market the bill at least ought not to be pass without regard to the general welfare of we fellow-subject nor without a attentive consideration of those petition which have be present to we petition not produce by panic apprehension of imaginary danger or distant prospects of inconveniency barely possible but by the certain foresight of immediate calamity the total destruction of trade and the sudden desolation of flourishing province by prohibit the exportation of rice we shall sir in one year reduce the colony of south carolina below the possibility of subsist the chief product of that country the product which induce we originally to plant it and with which all its trade be carry on be rice with rice the inhabitant of that province purchase all the other necessaries of life and among they the manufacture of we own country this rice be carry by we merchant to other part of europe and sell again for large profit that this trade be very important appear from the number of ship which it employ and which without lade must rot in the harbor if rice be not except from the general prohibition without this exception sir it be not easy to say what number whose station appear very different and whose employment have no visible relation to each other will be at once involve in calamity reduce to sudden distress and oblige to seek new method of support they family the sailor the merchant the shipwright the manufacturer with all the subordination of employment that depend upon they all that supply they with material or receive advantage from they labor almost all the subject of the british crown must suffer at least in some degree by the ruin of carolina nor ought the danger of the sugar island and other province less to alarm we apprehension excite we compassion or employ we consideration since nothing be more evident than that by pass this bill without the exception which they petition propose we shall reduce one part of we colony to the want of bread and confine the other to live on nothing else for they subsist by the exchange of those product to which the soil of each country be peculiarly adapt : one province afford no corn and the other supplies its inhabitant with corn only the necessity of expedite this bill however it have be exaggerate be not so urgent but that we may be allow time sufficient to consider for what purpose it be to be pass and to recollect that nothing be design by it but to hinder we enemy from be supply from the british dominion with provision by which they might be enable more powerfully to carry on the war against we to this design no objection have be make but it be well know that a good end may be defeat by a absurd choice of means and i be not able to discover how we shall increase we own strength or diminish that of we enemy by compelling one part of we fellow-subject to starve the other it be necessary sir to prohibit the exportation of corn to the port of we enemy and of those nation by which we enemy will be supply but surely it be of no use to exclude any part of we own dominion from the privilege of be supply from another nor can any argument be allege in defense of such a law that will not prove with equal force that corn ought to remain in the same granary where it be now lay that all the market in this kingdom should be suspend and that no man should be allow to sell bread to another there be indeed sir a possibility that the liberty for which i contend may be use to wicked purpose and that some man may be incite by poverty or avarice to carry the enemy those provision which they pretend to export to british province but if we be to refuse every power that may be employ to bad purpose we must lay all mankind in dungeon and divest human nature of all its rights for every man that have the power of action may sometimes act ill it be however prudent to obstruct criminal attempt even when we can not hope entirely to defeat they and therefore i be of opinion that no provision ought to be export without some method of security by which the governor of every place may be assure that they will be convey to we own colony such security will easily be contrived and may be regulate in a manner that they shall not be defeat without such hazard as the profit that can be expect from illegal commerce will not be able to compensate it be therefore sir proper to delay the bill so long at least as that we may produce by it the end intend and distress we enemy more than ourselves that we may secure plenty at home without the destruction of we distant colony and without oblige part of we fellow-subject to desert to the spaniard for want of bread mr bowle speak in this manner : -- sir the necessity of except rice from the general prohibition be not only sufficiently evince by the agent of south carolina but confirm beyond controversy or doubt by the petition of the merchant of bristol of which the justice and reasonableness appear at the first view to every man acquaint with the nature of commerce how much the province of south carolina will be distressed by this prohibition how suddenly the whole trade of that country will be at a stand and how immediately the want of many of the necessaries of life will be feel over a very considerable part of the british dominion have already sir be very pathetically represent and very clearly explain nor do there need any other argument to persuade we to allow the exportation of rice but from the petition of the merchant of bristol it appear that there be other reason of equal force for this indulgence and that we regard for the inhabitant of that particular province however necessary and just be not the only motive for comply with they request it be show sir in this petition that the prohibition of rice will very little incommode we enemy or retard they preparation for they be not accustom to be supply with it from we plantation we ought therefore not to load we fellow-subject with embarrassment and inconveniency which will not in any degree extend to we enemy it appear sir not only that a very important part of we commerce will be obstruct but that it will probably be lose beyond recovery for as only a small quantity of the rice of carolina be consume at home and the rest be carry to other country it be easy to conceive that those who shall be disappoint by we merchant will procure so necessary a commodity from other place as there be many from which it may be easily purchase and it be well know that trade if it be once divert be not to be recall and therefore that trade which may be without difficulty transfer ought never to be interrupt without the most urgent necessity to prove sir that there be now no such necessity by a long train of argument would be superfluous for it have be show already that we enemy will not suffer by the prohibition and the misery that inevitably arise from a state of war be too numerous and oppressive to admit of any increase or aggravation upon trivial motive the province of carolina sir have already suffer the inconveniency of this war beyond any other part of he majesty 's dominion as it be situate upon the border of the spanish dominion and as it be weak by the paucity of the inhabitant in proportion to its extent let we therefore pay a particular regard to this petition lest we aggravate the terror which the neighborhood of a powerful enemy naturally produce by the severer misery of poverty and famine sir robert walpole speak next in substance as follow : -- sir nothing be more absurd than for those who declare on all occasion with great solemnity they sincere zeal for the service of the publick to protract the debate of this house by personal invective and delay the prosecution of the business of the nation by trivial objection repeat after confutation and perhaps after conviction of they invalidity i need not observe how much time would be spare and how much the despatch of affair would be facilitate by the suppression of this practice a practice by which truth be level with falsehood and knowledge with ignorance since if scurrility and merriment be to determine we it be not necessary either to be honest or wise to obtain the superiority in any debate it will only be necessary to rail and to laugh which one man may generally perform with as much success as another the embargo in ireland be a expedient so necessary and timely that the reputation of it be think too great to be allow to the administration of whom it have be for many year the hard fate to hear they action censure only because they be not the action of other and to be represent as traitor to they country for do always what they think best themselves and perhaps sometimes what be in reality approve by those who oppose they this sir they have bear without much uneasiness and have contented themselves with the consciousness of do right in expectation that truth and integrity must at last prevail and that the prudence of they conduct and success of they measure would at last evince the justice of they intention they hope sir that there would be some occasion on which they enemy would not deny the expedience of they counsel and do not expect that after have be so long accuse of engross exorbitant power of reject advice and pursue they own scheme with the most invincible obstinacy they should be suppose on a sudden to have lay aside they arrogance to have descend to adopt the opinion and give themselves up to the direction of other only because no objection could be make to this instance of they conduct how unhappy sir must be the state of that man who be only allow to be a free agent when he act wrong and whose motion whenever they tend to the proper point be suppose to be regulate by another whether such capricious censurer expect that any regard should be pay by the publick to they invective i be not able to determine but i be incline to think so well of they understanding as to believe that they intend only to amuse themselves and perplex those whom they profess to oppose in one part of they scheme i know not but they may have succeed but in the other it be evident how generally they have fail it must at least sir be observe of these great patron of the people that if they expect to gain they by artifice like this they have no high opinion of they discernment however they may sometimes magnify it as the last appeal and highest tribunal with regard sir to the manner in which the embargo be lay and the expedient make use of to enforce the observation of it they be not the effect of a sudden resolution but of long and deliberate reflection assist by the counsel of the most experienced and judicious person of both nation so that if any mistake be commit it proceed not from arrogance or carelessness but a compliance with reason that if lay before the house would whether just or not be allow to be specious but sir it have not appear that any improper measure have be pursue or that any inconveniency have arise from they which it be possible to have avoid by a different conduct for when any expedient fail of produce the end for which it be propose or give occasion to inconveniency which be neither expect nor design it be not immediately to be condemn for it might fail from such obstacle as nothing could surmount and the inconveniency which be complain of might be the consequence of other cause act at the same time or cooperate not by the nature of thing but by the practice of those who prefer they own interest to that of they country but though it be in my opinion easy to defend the conduct of the ministry i be far from think this a proper time to engage in they vindication the important business before we must now wholly engage we nor ought we to employ we attention upon the past but the future whatever have be the ignorance or knowledge whatever the corruption or integrity of the ministry this bill be equally useful equally necessary the question be now concern a act of the senate not of the ministry and the bill may proceed without obstruct future examination if the bill sir now before we be so far approve as to be conceive of any real benefit to the nation if it can at all contribute to the distress or disappointment of we enemy or the prevention of those domestic disturbance which be naturally produce by scarcity and misery there be no need of argument to evince the necessity of despatch in pass it for if these effect be to be produce by prevent the exportation of provision and a law be necessary for that purpose it be certain that the law must be enact while we provision be yet in we own hand and before time have be give for the execution of those contract which be already make that contract sir be enter into for quantity that justly claim the care of the legislative power i have be inform by such intelligence as i can not suspect of deceive I in one small town in the western part of this kingdom fifty thousand barrel of corn be sell by contract and will be export if time be allow for collect and for ship they a few contract like this will be sufficient to store a army with bread or to furnish garrison against the danger of a siege a few contract like this will produce a considerable change in the price of provision and plunge innumerable family into distress who might struggle through the present difficulty which unsuccessful harvest have bring upon the nation have we not sell the gift of providence for petty gain and support we enemy with those provision which be barely sufficient for we own consumption i have not hear many objection make against the intention of the bill and those which be offer be mention with such diffidence and uncertainty as plainly show that even in the opinion of he that propose they they be of little weight and i believe they have no greater effect upon those that hear they it may therefore be reasonably suppose that the propriety of a law to prevent the exportation of victuals be admit and surely it can be no question whether it ought to be press forward or to be delay till it will be of no effect mr fazakerly speak next to this effect : -- sir as the bill now under we consideration be entangled with a multitude of circumstance too important to be pass by without consideration and too numerous to be speedily examine as its effect whether salutary or pernicious must extend to many nation and be feel in a few week to the remotest part of the dominion of britain i can not but think that they who so much press for expedition on this occasion consult rather they passion than they reason that they discover rather enthusiasm than zeal and that by imagine that they have already trace the effect of a law like this to they utmost extent they discover rather a immoderate confidence in they own capacity than give any proof of that anxious caution and deliberate prudence which true patriotism generally produce there be another method sir of proceed more proper on this occasion which have be already point out in this debate a method of exert the prerogative in a manner allow by law and establish by immemorial precedent and which may therefore be revive without afford any room for jealousy or complaint a embargo impose only by the prerogative may be relax or enforce as occasion may require or regulate accord to the necessity arise from particular circumstance circumstance in themselves variable and subject to the influence of a thousand accident and which therefore can not be always foresee or provide against by a law positive and fixed let we not subject the commonwealth to a hazardous and uncertain security while we have in we hand the means of produce the same end with less danger and inconveniency and since we may obviate the exportation of we corn by method more speedily efficacious than the form of make law can allow let we not oppress we fellow-subject by hasty or imprudent measure but make use of temporary expedient while we deliberate upon the establishment of a more lasting regulation mr campbell speak to the follow purpose -- sir that a embargo on merchandise or provision may upon sudden emergency or important occasion be impose by the prerogative can not be doubt by any man whose study have make he acquaint with the extent of the regal power and the manner in which it have be exert in all age the chief use of the prerogative be to supply the defect of the law in case which do not admit of long consultation which do not allow time to convoke senate or inquire into the sentiment of the people for this reason in time of war the imperial power be much enlarged and have still a greater extent as exigency be more press if the nation be invade by a foreign force the authority of the crown be almost without limit the whole nation be consider as a army of which the king be general and which he then govern by martial law by occasional judicature and extemporary decree such sir be the power of the king on particular emergency and such power the nature of human affair must sometimes require for all form of government be intend for common good and calculate for the established condition of mankind but must be suspend when they can only obstruct the purpose for which they be contrived and must vary with the circumstance to which they be adapt to expect that the people shall be consult in question on which they happiness depend suppose there be a opportunity of consult they without hazard they life they freedom or they possession by the form of deliberation the necessity of extend the prerogative to the extremity of power be i hope at a very great distance from we but if the danger of the exportation of victuals be so urgent as some gentleman have represent it and so formidable as it appear to the whole nation it be surely requisite that the latent power of the crown should be call forth for we protection that plenty be secure within the nation by bar up we port and the people hinder from betray themselves to they enemy and squander those blessing which the fertility of we soil have bestow upon they sir robert walpole reply in the follow manner : -- sir it be so unusual among the gentleman who have oppose my opinion to recommend a exertion of the regal authority or willingly to intrust any power to the administration that though they have on this occasion express they sentiment without any ambiguity of language or perplexity of idea i be in doubt whether i do not mistake they meaning and can not without hesitation and uncertainty propose the motion to which all they argument seem necessarily to conduct I argument of which i do not deny the force and which i shall not attempt to invalidate by slight objection when i be convince in general of they reasonableness and truth the necessity of that despatch which i have endeavor to recommend be not only universally admit but affirm to be so press that it can not wait for the solemnity of debate or the common form of pass law the danger which be every moment increase require in the opinion of these gentleman to be obviate by extraordinary measure and that pernicious commerce which threaten the distress of the community be to be restrain by a immediate act of the prerogative if this be the opinion of the house it will be necessary to lay it before he majesty by a regular address that the nation may be convince of the necessity of such extraordinary precaution and that the embargo may be impose at once with the expedition peculiar to despotick power and the authority which can be confer only by senatorial sanction whether this be the intention of the member from whose declaration i have deduce it can only be discover by themselves who if they have any other scheme in view must explain it in clearer term that the house may deliberate upon it and reject or adopt it accord to its conformity to the law of we country and to the present state of we affair mr pulteney speak thus : -- sir whatever may be the meaning of other gentleman who must undoubtedly be leave at full liberty to explain they own expression i will freely declare that i be sufficiently understand by the right honorable gentleman and that in my opinion no remedy can be apply to the present distemper of the nation a distemper by which it be hourly pine away by which its vitals be impaired and the necessary nourishment withdraw from it that will operate with sufficient efficacy and speed except a embargo be impose by the prerogative that this opinion if receive by the house must be the subject of a address be in itself manifest and the reason for which a embargo be require prove that a address ought not to be delay i can not omit this opportunity of remark how plainly it must now appear that many of we have be unjustly charge with obstruct the progress of the bill for pernicious purpose with view of raise discontent in the nation of expose the administration to publick hatred of obstruct the measure of the government or hinder the success of the war when we have recede from we general principle and suspend the influence of we established maxim for the sake of facilitate a expedient which may promote the general advantage by recommend he majesty to the affection of he people mr pelham here reply to this effect : -- sir i be far from blame any gentleman for assert on all occasion the integrity of he design or display the reasonableness of he conduct and of what i do not disapprove i shall not decline the imitation it be not uncommon in the heat of opposition while each man be convince of he own honesty and strongly persuade of the truth of he own position to hear each party accuse by the other of design detrimental to the publick interest of protract debate by artful delay of struggle against they own conviction and of obscure known truth by objection which discover themselves to be without force these accusation which be on both side frequent be i hope on both side generally false at least it must appear on this occasion that those who press the bill have no view of strengthen they party by a victory of weary they opponent by obstinacy or of promote any private purpose by a new law since a expedient by which time may be gain and the avowed end of hasten this necessary bill secure be no sooner propose on one part than receive on the other at the close of the debate a form of a address be propose by mr clutterbuck which be approve by the house be present to he majesty : and a embargo be lay on all provision accordingly on the 17th day of sit the house proceed on the bill for prevent exportation and order a account of the corn which have be export for six year last past to be lay before the committee the house also address he majesty to take off the embargo on ship laden with fish or rice which he majesty have before order to be do on the 21st the corn bill be again the subject of deliberation and some amendment be offer by mr sandy contain not only exception of rice and fish which have be before admit but likewise of butter as a perishable commodity which if it be not allow to be export would corrupt and become useless in a short time he propose likewise that the two island of jersey and guernsey might continue to be supply with certain restriction from the port of southampton it be propose likewise in favor of some other colony that they might receive provision from britain lest there should be a necessity for the inhabitant of those province to abandon they settlement the penalty of this law and the manner in which they should be recover and apply be likewise settle on this day November 25 1740 the consideration of the corn bill be resume and it be particularly debate from what time it should commence which some of the member be incline to fix on the 9th day of the session on which occasion mr campbell speak as follow : sir that the law may be observe by the nation without daily violence and perpetual compulsion that we determination may be receive with reverence and the regulation which we establish confirm by the concurrence of we constituent it be necessary that we endeavor to preserve they esteem and convince they that the publick prosperity may be safely trust in we hand this confidence be to be gain as well in high station as in lower condition by large assembly as by individual only by a constant practice of justice and frequent exertion of superior wisdom when any man find he friend oppressive and malicious he naturally withdraw he affection from he when he observe he advance absurd opinion and adhering to they with obstinacy incapable of conviction he fall unavoidably into a distrust of he understanding and no longer pay any deference to he advice or consider he conduct as worthy of imitation in the same manner sir if the legislative power shall in make law discover that they regard any motive before the advantage of they country or that they pursue the publick good by measure inadequate and ill-concerted what can be expect from the people but that they should set up they own judgment in opposition to that of they governor make themselves the arbiter in all doubtful question and obey or disregard the law at discretion if this danger may arise from law injudiciously draw up it may surely be apprehend from a compliance with this proposal a proposal that the operation of the law should commence eleven day before the law itself be in be i have hitherto sir regard it as a principle equally true in politick as in philosophy that nothing _ can act _ when it do _ not exist _ and i do not suspect that a position so evident would ever stand in need of a proof or illustration we live indeed in a age of paradox and have hear several notion seriously defend of which some would not many year ago have condemn they abetter to a prison or a madhouse and would have be hear by the wisest of we ancestor with laughter or detestation but i do not expect that the most hardy innovator would have shock my understanding with a position like this or have assert that a law may operate before it be make or before it be project that where there be no law there be no transgression be a maxim not only establish by universal consent but in itself evident and undeniable and it be sir surely no less certain that where there be no transgression there can be no punishment if a man may be punish sir by a law make after the fact how can any man conclude himself secure from the jail or the gibbet a man may easily find means of be certain that he have offend no law in be but that will afford no great satisfaction to a mind naturally timorous since a law hereafter to be make may if this motion be suppose reasonable take cognizance of he action and how he can know whether he have be equally scrupulous to observe the future statute of future senate he will find it very difficult to determine mr pelham rise and speak thus : -- sir notwithstanding the absurdity which the honorable gentleman imagine himself to have discover in this proposal and which he must be confess to have place in a very strong light i be of opinion that it may with very little consideration be reconcile to reason and to justice and that the wit and satire that have be so liberally employ will appear to have be lose in the air without use and without injury the operation of the law may very properly commence from the day on which the embargo be lay by he majesty 's proclamation which surely be not issue to no purpose and which ought not to be disobey without punishment sir john barnard speak next to this effect : -- sir i can not but be somewhat surprised that a gentleman so long conversant in national affair should not yet have hear or know the difference between a proclamation and a penal law by a proclamation he majesty may prevent in some case what he can not punish he may hinder the exportation of we corn by order ship to be station at the entrance of we harbor but if any should escape with prohibit cargo he can inflict no penalty upon they at they return to enforce this prohibition by the sanction of punishment be the intention of the present bill but a proclamation can make nothing criminal and it be unjust and absurd to punish a action which be legal when it be do the law ought sir in my opinion not to commence till time be allow for disperse it to the utmost limit of this island for as it be unreasonable to punish without law it be not more equitable to punish by a law of which they who have unhappily break it could have no intelligence a future day be agree to house of common dec 2 1740 debate relate to a seditious paper of the same kind with the consideration on the embargo on provision lord thomson take notice of a paper which he have in he hand and say he receive it at the door where it be give to the member as they come in and complain of it as a indignity offer to the house desire that it might be read which be do he rise up and speak in substance as follow : sir the crime of exasperate the people against they governor of raise discontent and exciting murmur in a time of general danger and of attempt to represent wise and salutary measure which have receive the approbation of the whole legislature as mean artifice contrived only to raise the fortune of some favorite of the minister and aggrandize the officer of state by the misery of the people be a crime too enormous to require or admit any aggravation from rhetorick and too dangerous to hope for any excuse from candor and lenity to read or hear this paper be sufficient for a full conviction of its pernicious tendency and of the malice of its author a charge not fix upon particular expression capable of a doubtful meaning and which heat or inadvertency might casually have produce but support by the general design of the whole paper and the continue tenor of the argument which be evidently intend to show that a act of government which can not but appear necessary and seasonable in the present state of we affair a act ratify by the concurrence of all the power of the legislature be nothing but a scheme of avarice to grow rich by oppression nor be this scandalous libel write with more confidence and insolence than it be disperse not content sir with vilify the proceedings of the state the author have industriously publish he calumny at we door : the time have be when defamation skulk in secret and calumny against the government be disperse by whisper or private communication but this writer add insult to he injury and at once reproach and defy we i beg leave to move therefore that the house do censure this paper as a malicious and scandalous libel highly and injuriously reflect upon a just and wise act of he majesty 's government and also upon the proceedings of both house of senate and tend to create jealousy in the mind of the people i also move that the author may be order to attend to be examine at we bar -lrb- this be unanimously agree to by the house the doorkeeper be call in and be show the paper be ask from whom he receive it who answer that he believe the person who deliver it to he be then detain in one of the committee room upon which he be order to look for and fetch he to the bar -rrb- mr sandy take notice that the person be already in custody say that he should be glad to know by what authority it be not reasonable to punish first and judge afterwards upon which sir william yonge reply that he have cause he to be detain in order to know the pleasure of the house and that he think it he duty to secure so enormous a offender from escape soon after the doorkeeper bring the man in when he declare upon examination he name and he profession which be that of a scrivener and own with great openness that he be the author of the paper he be then ask who be the printer and answer that he print it himself which he explain afterwards by say that as he have carry it to the printer 's he might be say in the general acceptation of the term as apply to a author to be the printer he then discover the printer and be ask where be the original manuscript which he say he have destroy as he do any other useless paper it have be observe by some of the member that it be print in one of the daily papers he be ask who carry it thither and answer that he carry it himself it be then demand what he give for have it insert and he answer that he give nothing -lrb- after many question mr henry archer desire that he might be ask whether on the Friday before he be in the gallery at which some of the member express they disapprobation and the man be order to withdraw the follow debate ensue upon the propriety of the question -rrb- mr sandy speak first in substance as follow : -- sir those who be intrust by they country with the authority of make law ought undoubtedly to observe they with the utmost circumspection lest they should defeat they own endeavor and invalidate by they example they own decree there be no part sir of we civil constitution more sacred none that have be more revere by those that have trample upon other form of justice and wanton in oppression without restraint than that privilege by which every briton be exempt from the necessity of accuse himself and by which he be entitle to refuse a answer to any question which may be ask with a view to draw from he a confession of a offence which can not be prove whether this great privilege sir be not violate whether the unalienable right of a free subject be not infringe by the question put to the person at we bar the house must decide the punishment to which intruder be subject by the order of this house prove that he presence in the house be consider as a crime of which as we have no proof of it a confession ought not to be extort by a artful and insidious question of which he may not discover the intention or the consequence such treatment sir be rather to be expect by slave in the inquisition of spain than a briton at the bar of this house a house institute to preserve liberty and to restrain injustice and oppression mr campbell speak next to this effect : -- sir i can not but concur with the opinion of the honorable gentleman that in require a answer to this question we shall expose a man to a punishment against whom we have no evidence but what be extort from himself and consequently no knowledge of he crime upon which we can proceed to inflict censure or penalty without the manifest infraction of we constitution it can not be imagine sir that he intend to confess himself guilty of a crime of which no proof have be bring or that he will voluntarily subject himself to punishment it must therefore follow that he be entrap in he examination by a artifice which i hope will never find any countenance in this house mr winnington answer to the follow purpose : -- sir it be not impossible that the honorable gentleman have not lately look into the order of the house may mistake the tendency of the question i therefore move that the order may be read -lrb- the order be read by the clerk he proceed -rrb- it be evident sir that by the order now read the serjeant at arm attend on this house may take into custody all stranger that shall be find in the house or gallery while we be assemble and that this order be not always put in practice must be attribute to the lenity of the house but that this order extend to past offence and subject any man to imprisonment for have be present in some former day can not be conceive for how far may such a retrospect be extend or at what time after have intrude into the house can any man presume to consider himself as exempt from the danger of imprisonment we order sir only decree present punishment for present offence and therefore the question ask by the honorable gentleman may be insist on without scruple and answer without hazard let then the honorable gentleman reserve they laudable zeal for we constitution till it shall be invade by more important occasion mr sandy reply : -- sir what victory the honorable gentleman imagine himself to have gain or whence proceeds all he wantonness of exultation i be not able to discover the question only relate to the interpretation of one of we own order and be therefore not of the highest importance nor can he success in so trivial a debate entitle he to great applause from other or produce in a person of he ability any uncommon satisfaction to himself but whatever may be the pleasure of the victory it must at least be gain before it can be celebrate and it be by no means evident that he have yet any reason to assure himself of conquest he interpretation sir of the order which he have so confidently lay before the house seem to I to have no foundation in reason or justice for if it be a offence against the house to be present at we consultation and that offence be justly punishable why should any man be exempt from a just censure by a accidental escape or what make the difference between this crime and any other that this alone must be immediately punish or immediately obliterate and that a lucky flight be equivalent to innocence it be surely sir more rational to believe that the house may punish any breach of its order at a distant time that if we censure be once elude it may be afterwards enforce and therefore that the question put to the person at the bar ought not to be ask because it can not safely be answer mr pulteney speak next in word to this effect : -- sir i can not but conceive that we order may extend its influence beyond the present moment and that intrusion may be punish by the house on another day than that on which they be commit i be so far sir from be of opinion that to make the execution of this order valid the house must sit without interruption from the time of the offence to that of the punishment that if the gentleman in the gallery be to be take into custody i should advise the serjeant to wait till the house should break up and seize they as they should come out sir william yonge speak next in the manner following : -- sir if any such punishment be now intend i should advise the gentleman in the gallery to retire indeed but not to hide themselves like felon or man proscribe by proclamation for as the power of seize any man in the house be sufficient to secure we from intrusion there be no reason to extend it farther and penalty be not without reason to be inflict neither have the house ever covet the power of oppress and what else be unnecessary punishment if therefore a intruder be not seize in the act of intrusion he can not legally be imprison for it and any of the stranger who now hear this debate may retire to a very small distance from the house and set the serjeant at arm at defiance sir robert walpole then speak to this effect : -- sir whether the question be proper or not it seem very unnecessary to debate because however it be answer it can not be of great importance : the man have already confess himself the author of the libel and may therefore be punish without farther examination that he be the real author sir i be not indeed convince by he assertion with whatever confidence it be make for so far as he appearance enable I to judge of he education and sphere of life it be not probable that he should be much verse in political inquiry or that he should engage in the discussion of question like this there appear sir in the paper before we a more extensive knowledge of fact a more accurate attention to commerce more artful reasoning and a more elevated style than it be reasonable to expect from this man whom without pretend to determine the limit of he capacity or the compass of he knowledge i be for my part incline to look upon as a agent to some other person of higher station and greater accomplishment it be not uncommon sir for gentleman to exercise they ability and employ they pen upon political question and when they have produce any thing which they complaisance for themselves equally hinder they from own and suppress they be know to procure some person of inferior rank to take upon he in publick the character of the author and to stand the danger of the prosecution content themselves with the applause and admiration of they choose friend whom they trust with the important secret and with whom they sit and laugh at the conjecture of the publick and the ignorance of the ministry this sir be a frequent practice not only with those who have no other employment but as i have sufficient reason to believe among some gentleman who have seat in this house gentleman whose ability and knowledge qualify they to serve the publick in character much superior to that of lampooner of the government mr pulteney answer in term to the follow purpose : -- sir whether the man who confess himself the author of the paper have accuse himself of what he do not commit or have ingenuously and openly discover the truth it be beyond my penetration absolutely to decide the frankness and unconcern with which he make the declaration give it at least the appearance of truth nor do i discover any reason for doubt he sincerity be there any improbability in the nature of the fact that should incline we to suspect he veracity be there any apparent advantage to be gain by assume a false character neither of those circumstance can be produce against he and a assertion be to be admit for its own sake when there be nothing to invalidate it but the honorable gentleman sir appear to have a very particular reason for he doubt a reason which will i hope have no weight with any but himself by deny the paper to this man he give room for conjecture and suspicion to range far and wide and wanton with whatever character he shall think proper subject for he amusement a author be now to be seek and many divert argument may be bring by the dullest inquirer for fix it upon one man or deny it to another the honorable gentleman sir have give we a bold specimen of this kind of wit by insinuate that it be the production of some one of the member of this house a conjecture of which i be not able to find the foundation and therefore imagine that raillery rather than argument be intend but let the honorable gentleman recollect that the chief excellence of raillery be politeness to which he have surely pay little regard in suppose that what have be unanimously condemn as a libel have one of those who censure it for its author if i be particularly hint at in this sagacious conjecture i take this opportunity of declare that i be equally ignorant of the whole affair with any other gentleman in this house that i never see the paper till it be deliver to I at the door nor the author till he appear at the bar have thus clear myself sir from this aspersion i declare it as my opinion that every gentleman in the house can safely purge himself in the same manner for i can not conceive that any of they can have write a libel like this there be indeed some passage which would not disgrace the greatest ability and some maxim true in themselves though perhaps fallaciously apply and at least such a appearance of reasoning and knowledge as set the writer far above the level of the contemptible scribbler of the ministerial vindication : a herd of wretch whom neither information can enlighten nor affluence elevate low drudge of scurrility whose scandal be harmless for want of wit and whose opposition be only troublesome from the pertinaciousness of stupidity why such immense sum be distribute amongst these reptile it be scarce possible not to inquire for it can not be imagine that those who pay they expect any support from they ability if they patron would read they writings they salary would quickly be withdraw for a few page would convince they that they can neither attack nor defend neither raise any man 's reputation by they panegyrick nor destroy it by they defamation sir robert walpole then speak in the follow manner : -- i hope it be not expect that the heat with which one class of we political writer have be attack by the honorable gentleman should engage I to undertake they defense with the same earnestness i have neither interest enough in the question to awaken my passion nor curiosity or leisure sufficient for such a examination of the writings on each side as be necessary before the superiority of any author above he brethren can he justly assert it be no part sir of my employment or amusement to compare they argument or to balance they ability nor do i often read the papers of either party except when i be inform by some that have more inclination to such study than myself that they have rise by some accident above they common level yet that i may not appear entirely to desert the question i can not forbear to say that i have never from these accidental inspection of they performance discover any reason to exalt the author who write against the administration to a higher degree of reputation than they opponent that any of they deserve loud applause i can not assert and be afraid that all which deserve to be preserve of the writings on either side may be contract to a very few volume the writer for the opposition appear to I to be nothing more than the echo of they predecessor or what be still more despicable of themselves and to have produce nothing in the last seven year which have not be say seven year before i may perhaps be think by some gentleman of each class to speak contemptuously of they advocate nor shall i think my own opinion less just for such a censure for the reputation of controversial writer arise generally from the prepossession of they reader in favor of the opinion which they endeavor to defend man easily admit the force of a argument which tend to support notion that it be they interest to diffuse and readily find wit and spirit in a satire point at character which they desire to depress : but to the opposite party and even to themselves when they passion have subside and they interest be disunited from the question those argument appear only loud assertion or empty sophistry and that which be clamorously praise discover itself to be only impudence or low conceit the spirit evaporate and the malignity only remain if we consider sir what opposition of character be necessary to constitute a political writer it will not be wonder that so few excel in that undertaking he that will write well in politick must at the same time have a complete knowledge of the question and time to digest he thought into method and polish he style into elegance which be little less than to say he must be at once a man of business and a man of leisure for political transaction be not easily understand but by those who be engage in they and the art of write be not attainable without long practice and sedentary application thus it happen that political writings be generally defective : for they be draw up by man unacquainted with publick business and who can therefore only amuse they reader with fallacious recital specious sophistry or a agreeable style or they be the hasty production of busy negotiator who though they can not but excel the other class of writer in that which be of most importance the knowledge of they subject be yet rarely at leisure to display that knowledge to advantage or add grace to solidity writer of the latter sort appear but seldom and most of we political papers be the amusement of leisure or the expedient of want whether the paper now before we be the produce of ease or of necessity i shall not determine i have already offer my opinion that the man who claim it be not the author nor do i discover any reason for change my sentiment : the question be a question merely of conjecture since neither i nor the honorable gentleman attempt to offer any demonstrative proof of we opinion if he have any to produce in favor of he own notion let he lay they before you but let he always forbear to impute to I assertion which i never utter and beware of represent I as declare that i believe this paper the composition of some member of this house -lrb- it be then debate whether this offence should be punish by the authority of the house or refer to the cognizance of some of the court of judicature in westminster hall on which occasion mr howe speak as follow : -rrb- sir it be the duty of every part of the legislature not only to preserve the whole system of we government unaltered and unimpaired but to attend particularly to the support of they own privilege privilege not confer upon they by we ancestor but for wise purpose it be the privilege of this house that we and we only be the judge of we own rights and we only therefore can assign the proper punishment when they shall be presumptuously invade if we remit this offender who have attempt to debase the house in the opinion of the nation to any inferior court we allow that court to determine by the punishment that shall be inflict the importance of this assembly and the value of the collective character of this house it therefore concern we in regard to we own dignity and to the privilege of we successor that we retain the cognizance of this crime in we own hand in which it be place by perpetual prescription and the nature of we constitution -lrb- the house agree to this and the libeller be send to the common jail of middlesex by warrant from the speaker -rrb- sir william yonge then speak to this effect : -- sir i be pleased with find that the malice and indecency of this libel have raise in the house a just resentment and that the wretch who with a confidence so steady and such appearance of satisfaction in he countenance confess or rather proclaim himself the author be treat as he deserve but let we not forget that the same degree of guilt always require the same punishment and that when the author of scandal be in prison the printer and propagator of it ought not to be at liberty the printer of the daily news be surely the proper object of you indignation who insert this libel in he paper without the fondness of a author and without the temptation of a bribe a bribe by the help of which it be usual to circulate scurrility to this man the expense or labor of asperse the government be recompense by the pleasure and he could not prevail on himself to omit any opportunity of incense the people and expose at once the whole legislature to censure and contempt those therefore that have concur in the imprisonment of the author will doubtless join with I in require the attendance of he officious accomplice and i can not forbear express my hope that he will not meet with kinder treatment it be far from be the first offence of he licentious press and the lenity of the government by which he have be so long spare have have no other effect upon he than to add confidence to he malice and incite he to advance from one degree of impudence to another he have for several week persist in misrepresent the intention of the embargo by letter pretend to be write by friend of the government who be injure by it he have vent he insinuation hitherto as without punishment so as it appear without fear it be time therefore to disturb he security and restrain he from add one calumny to another sir john barnard rise up hereupon and oppose this motion in term to the following effect : -- sir the end of punishment be to prevent a repetition of the same crime both in the offender and in those who may have the same inclination and when that end be accomplish all farther severity have a appearance rather of cruelty than justice by punish the author of this libel we have in my opinion sufficiently secure we dignity from any future attack we have crush the head of the confederacy and prevent the subordinate agent from exert they malice printer can do no injury without author and if no man shall dare to write a libel it be not worthy of we inquiry how many may be incline to publish it but if the printer must necessarily be punish before the resentment of the house can be satisfy if it shall not be think sufficient to punish he without whose assistance the other could not have offend let we at least confine we animadversion to the present fault without trace back he life for past misdemeanor and charge he with accumulate wickedness for if a man 's whole life be to be the subject of judicial inquiry when he shall appear at the bar of this house the most innocent will have reason to tremble when they approach it even with regard sir to the offence of which he be now accuse somewhat may perhaps be say in extenuation of he guilt which i do not offer to gratify any personal affection or regard for he to whom i be equally a stranger with any other gentleman in this house but to prevent a punishment which may be hereafter think disproportioned to the crime it be sir to be remember that he be not the original printer of the libel which he only reprint from a paper of which he know that it be to be disperse at we door and in which he could not naturally suspect any seditious or dangerous assertion to be contain it be therefore probable that he fall into the offence by ignorance or at worst by inadvertency and as he intention be not criminal he may properly be spare mr winnington speak in answer to this effect : -- sir i can not but think the honorable gentleman betray by he zeal for the defense of this man into some assertion not to be support by law or reason if it be innocent to print a paper once print will it not inevitably follow that the most flagitious falsehood and the most enormous insult on the crown itself the most seditious invective and most dangerous position may be disperse through the whole empire without any danger but to the original printer and what reason sir can be assign why that which be criminal in one man should be innocent in another nor be this the only position which have be advance contrary to the law of we country for it have be assert that the general character of a offender be a consideration foreign from that of he immediate crime and that whatever any man 's past life have be he be only to be judge accord to the evidence for the offence which be then the subject of examination how much this opinion be consistent with the practice of we court a very slight knowledge of they method of proceeding will readily discover be any villain there convict but by the influence of he character and be not the chief question at a trial the past conduct of the person at the bar sir john barnard rise here and speak thus : -- sir i rise up only to answer a question which be whether properly or not put to I and hope the irregularity will not be imputed to I by the house but to the occasion which produce it i be ask whether it be not the chief question at the bar of we court of justice what be the character of the prisoner and can not but feel some amazement that any man should be so ignorant of common proceedings and so much unacquainted with the execution of we law as to have admit a notion so chimerical the character of the prisoner be never examine except when it be plead by himself and witness be produce to offer testimony in he favor that plea like all other be then to be examine and be sometimes confute by contrary evidence but the character of a criminal though it may be urge by himself as a proof of he innocence be never to be mention by he prosecutor as a aggravation or proof of he guilt it be not require by the law that the general character of a criminal but that the particular evidence of the crime with which he stand charge should be examine nor be he character ever mention but by he own choice sir william yonge speak next to the effect follow : -- sir to prove the malignity of the intention with which this libel be insert in the daily paper it can not be improper to observe that the embargo have be for many day past the favorite topic of this printer and that therefore it be not by accident that he admit so zealous a advocate for he opinion to be seasonably assist by the circulation of he paper but that he doubtless be delighted with a opportunity of disperse sedition by means of greater ability than he own nor can it be justly plead sir in he favor that he be encourage to publish it by the confidence with which he see it disperse for it be print by he in the morning and not bring hither till the afternoon i can not therefore but conclude that he intention be agreeable to he practice and that he deserve to accompany the author in he present confinement the advocate campbell speak next to this purpose : -- sir i hope it will not be imputed to I as disregard of the government or neglect of the honor of this house that i declare myself on all occasion like this inclined to lenity and think it necessary always to proceed by regular method and known form of justice not by capricious determination and order variable at pleasure i oppose the imprisonment of the man who just now appear at the bar of we house and be still more unwilling to proceed to severity against another who be criminal only in a subordinate degree the loudest declaimer against these man can not have stronger detestation of falsehood and sedition than myself but however flagrant may be the crime they may be punish with unjustifiable rigor and in my opinion we have already proceed with severity sufficient to discourage any other attempt of the same kind whether it will promote the advantage of the publick and the efficacy of we deliberation to deter any man from the common practice of give we information by deliver papers at we door must be consider by the house nor be it less worthy of we most attentive inquiry whether it be not more reasonable to prosecute this offender in the common form of justice than to punish he by any act of uncontroulable unaccountable authority whether it be not more reasonable to have he prosecute before a judge unprejudiced and a disinterested jury than to act at once as party evidence and judge i have no desire sir of diminish the privilege of this house and yet less would i contribute to establish any precedent of unlimited power or arbitrary punishment the attorney general then speak to the following effect : -- sir whence so much tenderness can arise for a offender of this kind i be at a loss to discover nor be i able to conceive any argument that can be produce for exempt from punishment the printer of a paper which have be already determine by the vote of the house to be a scandalous libel tend to promote sedition it have be indeed agree that there be contain in the paper some true position and some passage innocent at least and perhaps rational and seasonable but this sir be nothing more than to say that the paper flagitious as it be might have be swell to a greater degree of impudence and scurrility that what be already too heinous to be bear might by greater virulence become more enormous if no wickedness sir be to be check till it have attain the greatest height at which it can possibly arrive we court of criminal judicature may be shut up as useless and if a few innocent paragraph will palliate a libel treason may be write and disperse without danger or restraint for what libel be ever so crowd with sedition that a few period might not have be select which upon this principle might have secure it from censure the danger of discourage intelligence from be offer at the door of we house do not alarm I with any apprehension of disadvantage to the nation for i have not so mean a opinion of the wisdom of this assembly as to imagine that they can receive any assistance from the information of they officious instructor who ought in my opinion sir rather to be teach by some senatorial censure to know they own station than to be encourage to neglect they proper employment for the sake of direct they governor when bill sir be depend by which either the interest of the nation or of particular man may be think to be endanger it be indeed the incontestable right of every briton to offer he petition at the bar of the house and to deliver the reason upon which it be found this be a privilege of a unalienable kind and which be never to be infringe or deny and this may always be support without countenance anonymous intelligence or receive such papers as the author of they be afraid or ashamed to own and which they therefore employ meaner hand to distribute of this kind sir undoubtedly be the paper now under we consideration of which i be far from imagine that it be draw up by the man who declare himself the writer and be therefore convince of the necessity of call the printer to the bar that whatever the lenity or justice of this assembly may determine with regard to he punishment he may be examine with respect to the real author of the libel and that we resentment may fall upon he who have endeavor to shelter himself by expose another counsellor ord speak to this effect : -- sir i be incline to believe that the person associate in write and disperse this paper whosoever they may be be of no high rank or considerable influence as it be not likely that any man who have much to hazard would expose himself to the resentment of the whole legislature but let we not for that reason exert we superiority in wanton punishment or tyrannise merely because we can not be resist let we remember that the same justice and the same humanity be due to the meanest as the highest of we fellow-subject and that there be even less necessity of rigorous measure as the attack be less formidable but sir there be one motive to moderation that have seldom be find less efficacious than the consideration of the law of justice or humanity we ought to be withhold by regard to we posterity and even to ourselves from any exorbitant extension of we privilege we know that authority once exert be claim afterwards by prescription and who know by what sudden rotation of power he may himself suffer by a precedent which he have concur to establish and feel the weight of that oppressive power which he first grant for the punishment of another mr howe speak thus : -- sir i be always unwilling to oppose any proposal of lenity and forbearance nor have now any intention of heighten the guilt of this man by cruel exaggeration or incite the house to rigor and persecution but let we remember sir that justice and mercy be equally to be regard and while we pity the folly of a misguided or perhaps a thoughtless offender let we not suffer ourselves to be betray by we compassion to injure ourselves and we posterity this house sir have always claim and exert the privilege of judge of every offence against itself a privilege so long establish and so constantly exercise that i doubt whether the inferior court of judicature will take cognizance of a attack upon we for how can they venture to decide upon a question of such importance without any form or precedent for they proceedings there seem also to be at this time sir a uncommon necessity for tenaciousness of we privilege when as some whisper which have be waft from the other house inform we a motion have be make in term which might imply the subordination of this assembly a assertion without foundation either in reason or justice and which i shall always oppose as destructive to we rights and dangerous to we constitution let we therefore sir retain in we hand the cognizance of this affair and let the criminal either suffer he punishment from _ we _ sentence or owe he pardon to _ we _ mercy -lrb- it be agree that the printer of the daily paper should attend next day when be call in it be propose that he should be ask whether he print the paper complain of it be object to for the same reason as the question about the author 's be in the gallery because the answer might tend to accuse himself and he be withdraw a debate of the same nature ensue and the question be put whether he should be ask if he be the person that print the daily paper show to he which paper the house the day before resolve to contain a malicious and scandalous libel etc it be on a division carry in the affirmative by two hundred and twenty-two against one hundred and sixty-three : accordingly he be call in again and be ask the question he own that he print the say paper from a print copy which be leave for he with one of he servant and be ask what he have to allege in he justification or excuse for print the say libel he say that as he have before print several other thing which he have receive from the say person which have not give offence he insert part of the paper in he news and which he should not have insert if he have think it would have give offence to the house and that he forbear to print the remainder have hear that it have give offence upon which he withdraw and the house after some debate on a division one hundred and eighty-eight to one hundred and forty-five not only order he into the custody of the serjeant but resolve to present a address to he majesty that he would be please to give direction to he attorney general to prosecute he at law the first printer of the libel be also order into custody this be on the 3d of December but the next day present he petition express he sorrow for the offence whereby he have justly incur the displeasure of the house and pray to be discharge he be bring to the bar on the follow day receive a reprimand on he knee and be order to be discharge pay he fee -rrb- on the 12th lord barrington present a petition from the printer of the daily paper express he sorrow promise all possible care not to offend for the future and pray to be discharge this petition be read a motion be make that the serjeant at arm do carry the petitioner to some court of law to give security for he appearance to the prosecution to be carry on against he by the attorney general which do that he be discharge pay he fee sir william yonge speak to this effect : -- sir i know not for what reason this enormous offender be entitle to so much regard or by what interest he have engage so many who i doubt not abhor he crime to pity he suffering have he be young and unexperienced and seduce into the commission of this offence by artifice or persuasion he act might have be reasonably consider rather as a error than a crime and it might have be proper to treat with lenity a delinquent neither obstinate nor malicious but how sir can this plea be urge in favor of a man whose daily employment it have be for these two year past to misrepresent the public measure to disperse scandal and excite rebellion who have industriously propagate every murmur of discontent and preserved every whisper of malevolence from perish in the birth the proper judge sir of this affair be he majesty 's attorney general who be not now in the house i be therefore for detain he in custody and for refer the consideration of farther proceedings against he to that gentleman whose proper province it be to prosecute for the crown mr waller speak next to the follow purpose : -- sir it be undoubtedly the duty of every man to oppose the introduction of new law and method of oppression and severity which we constitution do not admit and what else be the mention of a prisoner 's character as a aggravation of he present offence it be well know and have be already assert upon this occasion that in the lower court of justice though the prisoner may plead he character in he own defense he prosecutor be not at liberty to produce it to he disadvantage even those who be cite to the bar for murder or for treason be try only by the evidence of that crime for which they be indict that this house be not bind to strict form and be not accountable for the exercise of its power be easily grant but authority can not change the nature of thing and what be unjust in a lower court would be in we not less unjust though it may not be punishable \* \* \* \* \* it be reply that this question have be before sufficiently discuss the attorney general not be present the debate be adjourn to the next sit on the next day of the session the lord barrington propose that the adjourn debate might be resume and several member intercede for the petitioner that he might be release to which it be object that it be not proper to release he unless a information be lodge against he without which he could not be hold to bail and the question be put whether he should be release be determine in the negative at the sixth sit the author of the libel who be commit to the common prison of middlesex petition the house to permit he to implore pardon on he knee and promising by the strongest and most solemn assurance not to offend again be order to be discharge the next day pay he fee on the forty-seventh sit the printer of the daily paper again petition the house represent that he most heartily bewail he offence that he be miserably reduce by he confinement have borrow money of all he friend to support himself he wife and child and pray the mercy of the house he be then order to be discharge pay he fee and give security for he appearance to answer the prosecution on the eighty-fifth day mr george heathcote offer another petition for the say printer and represent that the fee amount to one hundred and twenty-one pound he be not able to pay they that therefore he hope the house would consider he case but the petition be not allow to be bring up on which he remain in custody fourteen day longer till the end of the session and the authority of the senate ceasing have he liberty without pay any fee house of common dec 4-11 1740 on incorporate the new-raised man into the standing regiment on the 4th of December sir william yonge secretary at war have present to the house of common a estimate of the expense of raise ten thousand man the same be take into consideration in a committee on the supply and after debate agree to at the report of this proceeding on the 11th another debate happen on a motion that the new-raised man should be incorporate into the standing regiment etc as in these two debate the argument be the same they be throw into one to prevent unnecessary repetition sir william yonge open the debate with respect to what he have deliver in the estimate after the manner following : -- sir as this estimate have be draw up after very accurate calculation and careful inquiry i hope that no objection will be raise against it and that the sum necessary for raise the new regiment will be very readily grant by that house which vote the war necessary for which they be design i hope it will be admit as some proof of frugality that this estimate require less money than one that be lay before the senate in the reign of king william for if it be consider that since that time the necessaries of life be become dearer and that therefore all expense be increase it will appear to be the effect of the exactest economy that the sum require for the same service be less i have hear indeed sir that in conversation the method of raise troops on this occasion have be censure as improper and that in the opinion of some whose judgment can not be entirely disregard it would be more reasonable to add more man to we regiment already establish than to raise new regiment with new officer the chief argument sir produce in support of they method of augmentation be draw from the necessity of publick frugality a very popular topick which never fail to produce favor and attention for every man be naturally incline to hear he friend and to consider that man as perform the office of friendship who propose method of alleviate he tax frugality be undoubtedly a virtue very necessary to the happiness of the nation and such as there occur frequent occasion of inculcate to those who be intrust with the superintendence of publick disbursement but i be far from think that this estimate afford any opportunity for declamation of this kind and be of opinion that the addition of new soldier to each regiment would in reality be more expensive it can not be deny sir that by augment the regiment there would be immediately save to the publick the expense of the officer which be necessary in the method now propose but it be to be consider how much the number of officer contribute to the regularity and discipline of the troops and how much discipline and order promote they success it be to be consider sir that the most successful method of make war be undoubtedly the cheapest and that nothing be more expensive than defeat if by raise the same number of man under fewer officer we should give we enemy any advantage if a single party should be cut off a garrison force a expedition render fruitless or the war protracted but a few month where will be the advantage of this admire frugality what would be the consequence but the same or a greater expense not to gain advantage but to repair loss and obviate the effect of we former parsimony in private life sir it be common for man to involve themselves in expense only by avoid it to repair house at greater charge than new one might be build and to pay interest rather than the debt weak mind be fright at the mention of extraordinary effort and decline large expense though security and future affluence may be purchase by they as tender body shrink from severe operation though they be the certain method of restore health and vigor the effect of this timidity be the same in both case the estate be impaired insensibly and the body languish by degree till no remedy can be apply such example sir be frequent and the folly of imitate they be therefore greater for who would pursue that track by which he have see other lead to destruction nor need we search for remote illustration to discover the destructive tendency of unseasonable tenderness for the publick for i believe the whole history of the war of king william will prove that too close a attention to parsimony be inconsistent with great achievement it may be expect that i who can not claim any regard in this disquisition from my own experience should produce some decisive evidence in favor of the method which i have take upon I to defend this expectation i shall endeavor to satisfy by allege the authority of the greatest commander of later age whom neither he friend nor he enemy will deny to have be well verse in these subject and whose success be a sufficient proof of the soundness of he principle the illustrious duke of marlborough be of opinion that the whole force of the french army consist in the number of the officer and that to be always equal to they in the field it be necessary to form we troops nearly upon the same plan to this scheme he conform in he practice of war and how much he practice confirm he opinion let blenheim and ramilly attest as i pretend not to have determine myself on this question otherwise than by authority and as i know not any authority equal to that of the duke of marlborough i can not discharge the trust repose in I by my country any otherwise than by propose that on this occasion we agree to grant he majesty the sum calculate for raise the new regiment as i believe that method of augmentation most likely to produce success in we undertaking and consequently to procure a speedy conclusion of the war mr pulteney speak next to the following effect : -- sir i have be so long accustom to the debate of this house and have so often attend to the eloquence of the right honorable gentleman that i be never startle at paradox nor shocked at absurdity i can now hear with great tranquillity a harangue upon the necessity of placeman in this house upon the usefulness of stand army and the happiness of a general excise i be no longer offend with fact quote in opposition to history nor with calculation draw up without regard to the rule of arithmetick i know that there be person in this house who think themselves oblige to speak even when in they own opinion nothing can be say with weight or with propriety who come hither prepare against the shame of confutation and determine not to be convince to reason with such man sir be indeed no pleasing task it be to fight with enchanted hero upon whom the common weapon of argument have no effect and who must be soften by a countercharm before they can be attack with any prospect of success there be some however of whom i be willing to believe that they dispute only for truth and inquire with the view of attain a solution of they doubt for the sake of these sir i think it necessary to declare my sentiment as i shall be desirous in my turn to hear they sentiment but with regard to those whose opinion i know already by they post i should think it of great advantage to the despatch of publick affair if they would content themselves with vote for they pay without any ambition of other service or add the praise of volubility to that of steadiness have this opportunity sir of declare my opinion of the measure pursue in regulate we military preparation i shall not confine myself entirely to the present question but lay before the house my thought upon some part of the establishment which may perhaps require a reform and which be at least proper object of consideration though not absolutely necessary to the determination of we opinion upon the present motion i have long ago sir declare what therefore it be scarcely of any use to repeat that i know not any advantage to be hope from a standing army nor can discover why the ablest and most vigorous of the inhabitant of this kingdom should be seduce from the loom the anvil and the plough only to live at ease upon the labor of industry only to insult they landlord and rob the farmer i never could find why any body of man should be exempt from the common labor of social duty or why they should be support by a community who contribute neither to its honor nor its defense i doubt not sir but i shall hear on this occasion of the service of we troops in the suppression of riot we shall be tell by the next pompous orator who shall rise up in defense of the army that they have often disperse the smuggler that the collier have be drive down by the terror of they appearance to they subterraneous fortification that the weaver in the midst of that rage which hunger and oppression excited flee at they approach that they have at we market bravely regulate the price of butter and sometimes in the utmost exertion of heroick fury break those egg which they be not suffer to purchase on they own term some one perhaps of more penetration may inform we of the use which have be make of they at election where the surly burgess have be sometimes blind to the merit of those worthy gentleman whom the soldier have know how to esteem accord to they desert nor indeed do i see how those can refuse they vote in favor of we troops who be indebted for the power of give they to they kind interposition to these argument sir i shall content myself with answer that those who be verse in the history of britain know that we have have collier and weaver for many year before a standing army be hear of among we and that it be nevertheless nowhere record that any of we king be depose by those formidable body of man or that any remarkable change be make by they in the form of we government and therefore till some reason shall be allege why such insurrection be now more dangerous and we civil magistrate more impotent than in former age i humbly conceive that even without the protection of a standing army we might yet sleep in security notwithstanding the plot of the collier and the combination of the weaver but i must own sir these be not we only enemy for there be somewhere yet in existence a person that lay claim to the dominion of these kingdom and plead a hereditary title to dispose of we wealth to subvert we liberty and destroy we religion if any foreigner sir unacquainted with we affair be to be present at we debate and to hear with what ardor we animate each other to a obstinate resistance of this pretender to the throne how often he be represent as hover over we and how often we have catch a general panick and imagine ourselves upon the verge of destruction how often we most zealous patriot take opportunity of declare they resolution to die in defense of they liberty and how pathetically we most elegant declaimer have expatiate on the misery of that unhappy race whom they should leave behind to groan under the oppression of absolute power what would be he opinion of this pretender whom he see so perpetually dread against whom so many alliance be form so many army be levy and so many navy equip would he not believe he to be some formidable tyrant in a neighbouring country the lord of wide dominion and the master of numerous army and powerful fleet would he not imagine that he could assemble half the continent at he call that he be support by powerful alliance and that nothing but a fair wind be require to land he on we coast at the head of million and would he not even on that supposition be incline to censure we as timorous as somewhat regardless of the honor of we nation and condemn we for give way to such suspicion and exclamation as have a natural tendency to heighten the apprehension of danger and depress the spirit of the people but what would be he conclusion sir when he should be tell what in reality be true that this dreadful pretender be a unhappy fugitive drive in he infancy from this country and by consequence without any personal interest that he be support by the charity of a prince whose name be hate almost by every inhabitant of the kingdom that he have neither sovereignty nor money nor alliance nor reputation in war nor skill in policy that all he action be watch by british spy and that the few friend that remain to support the farce of a court be such only as dare not return to they native country and be therefore without fortune and without dependant what could a wise man conceive of a nation hold in continual alarm by a enemy like this of a nation always watchful against a invasion from a man who have neither dominion to supply nor money to hire a single regiment from a man whose title all the neighbouring prince disown and who be at such a distance from they that he can not be assist by they without open preparation of which we can not fail of have intelligence and which may be defeat without danger by the vessel regularly station on we coast would not any stranger imagine sir that we be a nation infect with a general phrensy that cowardice have pervert we imagination fill we with apprehension of impossible invasion raise phantom before we eye and distract we with wild idea of slavery and tyranny oppression and persecution i have dwell thus long on this point because i know the pretender be the last refuge of those who defend a standing army not that i propose to convince any man of the folly of such apprehension or to fortify he against such terror for the time to come for if any man in reality now dread the pretender fear must be he distemper he be doom to live in terror and it be of no importance whether he dread a invasion or a goblin whether he be afraid to disband the army or to put out he candle in the night he imagination be taint and he must be cure not by argument but by physick but the greatest part of those who disturb we consultation with the mention of the pretender be man of a very different character man equally unconcerned about he design or he motion with those who be most desirous of set the nation free from the burden of a army and very often such as we may discover from they conduct to be determine to comply with every government and such as have therefore nothing to fear from a change of master the man for whose sake i be now speak sir laugh equally with myself at the apprehension of those whom they contribute to terrify they know too well the impotence of the pretender to dread a invasion from he and affect only to continue they outcry that they may not be deprive of a topick on which by long practice they have attain a uncommon facility of haranguing which they know how to diversify with various combination of circumstance and how to accommodate to any emergent occasion without the pain of torture they invention it may be useful sir to inform these man that they disguise ought at last to be throw off because it deceive no longer and that the nation can not be cheat but at the expense of more cunning than they be willing or perhaps able to display a mask must necessarily be throw aside when instead of conceal it discover he by whom it be use those who be attempt sir to deceive other and whose character be exalt in they own opinion in proportion to the success of they endeavor have surely a sense of shame though they have none of virtue and can not without pain find they artifice detect and themselves make the object of ridicule by those stratagem which they employ for the deception of other i hope therefore sir that for they own sake these declaimer on the explode story of the pretender will change they bugbear that if it be necessary to frighten those whom they want art or eloquence to persuade they will find out some other object of terror which after a little practice in private meeting they may first produce in the court and then turn loose in the senate the world methink allow they a sufficient choice of tyrant more formidable than the pretender suppose they should revive the history of the mohock the mohock be a dreadful race not to be mention without horror by a true lover of he country and a steady adherent to the house of hanover they might then very easily increase we army or enhance we tax for who would not be urge by he wife and daughter to agree to any measure that might secure they from the mohock but as a army be at present likely to be keep up for we defense against a enemy less formidable it may be more seasonable to propose the regulation than the dismission of we troops and to mention those evil which arise from the present establishment rather than those which be inseparable from the expense of a standing force if it be necessary sir to support soldier i suppose that it will not be deny by the advocate for a army that we ought to levy such troops as may be of use yet in they practice they seem to have pay very little regard to this principle we trooper be mount upon horse which can serve no purpose but that of show which may indeed wheel about in the park with a formidable air but can neither advance upon a enemy with impetuosity nor retreat from he with expedition and which therefore though purchase by the nation at a very high price and support at a large expense can only grace a review but be of very little use in a enemy 's country and must perish in the march or stand unactive in the battle nor be much more service to be expect sir from they rider than from the horse for there be very few of they acquaint with the first element of they profession or who have ever learn more than a few posture of exercise and the meaning of a few word of command but have a number of officer with large appointment the french troops sir if they be doubly officer be officer and maintain at a less expense and to greater effect for the soldier be better instruct and the same number of man cost not perhaps much more than half the charge of a british regiment the guard sir that be maintained about this metropolis for no other purpose than to keep up the splendor of a modern court cost the nation yearly such a sum as would be sufficient to support a army of frenchman for the protection of they frontier town or the invasion of neighbouring country for my part i can not see what injury would be do to the nation by abolish a establishment at the same time useless and expensive and employ that money which be at present squander upon idler without effect upon levy of useful soldier for march regiment who might be employ when occasion should require they in the service of they country it will doubtless be object that the officer of this body of man many of whom be person of the highest merit and who have generally purchase they commission might very justly complain of be deprive without a crime of that which they have buy at its full value and to which therefore they imagine themselves entitle till they shall forfeit they right by some offence against the law or some neglect of they duty i shall not sir at present inquire into the justness of this plea nor examine whether he who purchase a employment which he know to be useless and therefore burdensome to the publick deserve that the publick should be solicitous to support he in the enjoyment of it but i shall declare on this occasion with confidence that i know many of the officer of the guard to be man of honor who would gladly exchange they post so chargeable to the nation for a opportunity of serve it and who be not very anxious for the increase of they pay so they may not be degrade from they present rank if these gentleman sir might in the regiment that should be raise by disband the guard be advance to higher commission though with some diminution of they pay they would imagine themselves abundantly compensate by the happiness of become useful subject and serve that nation by which they have be hitherto support only to fill up the pomp of levee and add to the magnificence of drawing-room to loiter in antechamber and to quarrel at gaming table if this scheme should not be approve the method eligible in the next degree seem to be that of incorporate we new levy into the regiment already raise that be associate with man already acquaint with discipline they may learn they duty much more expeditiously than in separate body where one officer will be oblige to attend to the instruction of great number and where no man will be excite to application because no man will see any degree of excellence which he may be ambitious of attain i have indeed hear no reason allege for the necessity of new levy which appear likely to convince even those by whom it be produce it appear to I that we present army be more than sufficient for the publick service without a augmentation and that some of we regiment might immediately embark not only without danger to the nation but with far greater hope of success as we enemy would have less time to strengthen they fortification and collect they troops and as disciplined force be more formidable than troops newly levy for discipline must be of great efficacy to the success of military undertaking or all argument which have be use in the defense of a standing army fall to the ground in answer to this proposal we shall probably be once again intimidate with a invasion whether from the pretender the spaniard the french or any other power it be of no great importance a invasion be a formidable sound the sack of town the destruction of village the captivity of we child the ruin of we fortune and the desolation of we country be frightful image and may therefore be successfully produce on this occasion to perplex we thought and embarrass we inquiry to remove therefore this panick and to dissipate for ever the phantom of invasion i will lay before the house the opinion of the great commander whose name have already be introduce in this debate in the late reign on a day when the great officer of the crown and many of the council be at a publick feast in the city a report be suddenly spread that the duke of ormond have land in the west with two thousand man this account be in appearance well attest and universally believe all jollity be therefore at a end the company depart the council be summon and every man offer such expedient as he present thought confuse and oppress with the proximity of the danger suggest to he one propose that a body of troops should be send to a distant part of the kingdom to restrain the sedition of the populace another apprehend more danger from a different quarter and advise that the inhabitant should be awed by another detachment send thither the most experienced easily see the unprofitableness of the measure propose but could not so easily strike out more efficacious expedient and therefore sit in great perplexity lord somer particularly shake he head and seem to consider the kingdom as in the hand of the invader and the dreadful pretender as seat on the throne at last the duke of marlborough who have hitherto sit silent ask calmly whether they be certain that any force be really land and be answer that though it might not be absolutely certain yet they be to consult and send order upon that supposition then say he i will lay down this great rule to be observe invariably whenever you be invade attend only to one point nor have any other purpose in view than that of destroy the regular force that shall be land in the kingdom without any regard to petty insurrection which may be always easily quell and which will probably cease of themselves when the army by which they be excite be cut off for this end let it be you rule to keep you army undivided and to make no motion but towards the enemy fight they with the utmost expedition before they can fortify themselves or receive reinforcement from the continent by the observation of this plain method of operation continue he i will engage without any other force than the regiment generally station about the capital to put a stop to any troops that shall be land on the coast of britain so far be this great officer who be acquaint with the whole art of war from sink into astonishment at the sound of a invasion and so far from think it necessary that the nation should be harass by stand troops to preserve it from be plunder by a foreign army but though we troops sir should not be necessary to prevent a invasion they may be useful in service of equal importance the ministry may think the suffrage of the officer more serviceable than they sword and may be more afraid of expose themselves than the nation by any detachment of they force such be at present sir the state of this unhappy country that neither in peace nor war be any measure take but with a view of increase or confirm the power of the ministry for this purpose those troops whose officer have seat here be to be retain at home and the fate of we american settlement to be commit to new-levied force without military skill for this reason be a army to be raise without necessity and raise in a manner that may furnish the court with a opportunity of extend its influence by the disposal of great number of new commission by this plan every family that be burden with a relation whose vice have ruin he fortune or whose stupidity disqualify he for employment will have a opportunity of sell for a commission its interest at the approach election dependence will be propagate and the troublesome spirit of liberty be depress to little purpose will it be object that soldier and officer will be equally ignorant that discipline be not infuse instantaneously that a military dress will not make a soldier that man can only know they duty by instruction and that nothing be to be hope from ploughman and manufacturer command by schoolboy the success of the expedition be not so much consider by those who have the direction of the levy as that of the election and while they keep they post they be very little concerned about the affair of america in defense of this method it have indeed be affirm that it be prefer by the duke of marlborough but we be not inform to whom or upon what occasion he declare he opinion and therefore be leave at liberty to doubt whether he authority be not produce for a method which he do not approve or approve only at some particular time for some extraordinary service it be urge that he recommend it by he practice and that he success be a sufficient proof that he practice be found upon right maxim but if it be remember what be in that time the method of obtain commission and who it be that have the disposal of they it will appear not absolutely certain that he practice ought to be produce as a decisive proof of he opinion if the success of troops be properly urge as a argument for the form of they establishment may not the victory of prince eugene afford a proof equally convince that a few officer be sufficient and if the argument which arise from success be equal on both side ought not the necessity of save the publick money to turn the balance war sir be in its own nature a calamity very grievous to the most powerful and flourishing people and to a trading nation be particularly destructive as it at once exhaust we wealth and interrupt we commerce at once drink up the stream and choke up the fountain in those country whose affair be wholly transact within they own frontier where there be either very little money or where they wealth be dig out of they own mine they be only weaken by the loss of man or by the diminution of they dominion and in general can only suffer by be overcome but the state of britain be far different it be not necessary to we ruin that a enemy should be stronger than ourselves that he should be able to pour army into we country to cover the sea with fleet to burn we village by incursion or destroy we fortress with bomb for he that can secure he own dominion from we attack to which nothing but distance and some advantage of situation be necessary may support a war against we and he that can fit out privateer to interrupt we trade may without obtain a victory reduce we to distress we situation sir as it preserve we from the danger of a invasion except from that powerful monarch the pretender who be indeed always to be dread have likewise the effect of secure other nation from be invade by we for it be very difficult to transport in one fleet and to land at one time a number sufficient to force they way into a country where the port be fortify and the inhabitant in arm we war sir be therefore to be determine by naval battle and those nation have very little to fear from we who have no trade to be disturbed and no navy to be destroy if they can only fit out cruiser which may always be do by grant commission to foreign adventurer they may ruin we merchant by capture exhaust the nation by the necessity of convoy and give neutral trader a opportunity of establish they credit at those market which have be hitherto supply by we manufacture this be indeed far from be at present a exact account of the state of spain whose wide-extended dominion be liable to insult and from whom many of she most wealthy province may be tear without great hazard or difficulty the particular state of she commerce which be only carry on from one part of she dominion to another can only be for a time interrupted but be in no danger of be invade by any rival or lose by disuse at least require we consideration and we ought to make war with the utmost frugality against a people whom no hostility can really impoverish whose commerce may be say to lie at rest rather than to be shackle as it will rise into greater vigor at the end of the war and whose treasure though the want of they be a present inconvenience be only pile up for a time of security as the only method sir of reduce this nation must be that of invade its colony and dismember its province by which the chief person will be deprive of they revenue and a general discontent be spread over the people the force which be levy for this expedition a expedition on which so much of the honor of we arm and the prosperity of we trade must necessarily depend ought to be select with the greatest care and discipline with the exactest regularity on this occasion therefore it be surely improper to employ troops newly collect from shop and village and yet more irrational to trust they to the direction of boy call on this occasion from the frolick of a school or force from the bosom of they mother and the softness of the nursery it be not without compassion compassion very far extend that i consider the unhappy stripling doom to a camp from whom the sun have hitherto be screen and the wind exclude who have be teach by many tender lecture the unwholesomeness of the evening mist and the morning dew who have be wrapt in fur in winter and cool with fan in summer who have live without any fatigue but that of dress or any care but that of they complexion who can forbear sir some degree of sympathy when he see animal like these take they last farewell of the maid that have feed they with sweetmeat and defend they from insect when he see they drest up in the habiliment of soldier load with a sword and invest with a command not to mount the guard at the palace nor to display they lace at a review not to protect lady at the door of a assembly room nor to show they intrepidity at a country fair but to enter into a kind of fellowship with the rugged sailor to hear the tumult of a storm to sustain the change of climate and to be set on shore in a enemy 's dominion surely he that can see such spectacles without sorrow must have harden he heart beyond the common degree of cruelty and it may reasonably be expect that he who can propose any method by which such hardship may be escape will be think entitle to gratitude and praise for my part i should imagine sir that a easy method might be discover of obviate such misery without lessen that number of officer which perhaps in opposition to reason and experience some gentleman will continue to think necessary and hope that this may be no improper time to declare my opinion i have observe that for some time no private centinel have ever rise to any rank above that of a serjeant and that commission have be reserve as reward for other service than those of the camp this procedure i can not but think at once impolitick and unjust it be impolitick sir as it have a natural tendency to extinguish in the soldiery all emulation and all industry soldier have a equal genius with other man and undoubtedly there might be find among they great number capable of learn and of improve the military science but they have likewise the same love of ease and the desire of honor and of profit and will not condemn themselves to labor without the prospect of reward nor sacrifice they time to the attainment of that knowledge which can have no other effect than to make they discover the stupidity of they commander and render they obedience more difficult as it will destroy that reverence which be necessary to subordination it be unjust sir because it be not to be doubt that some soldier by the natural force of they faculty or by a laudable activity of mind have extend they knowledge beyond the duty of a private station and he that excel in he profession have a equitable claim to distinction and preferment to advance any man in the army because he father be a orator in the senate or the chief inhabitant of a borough seem not more rational than to make another man a judge because some of he ancestor be skilled in gunnery nor would the lawyer have juster reason for complaint in one case than the soldier in the other it be therefore sir in my opinion necessary to the advancement of military knowledge that as a centinel be for excel in he profession advance to the degree of a serjeant the serjeant who continue he application and perform he duty should in time be honor with a commission it may be object indeed that serjeant though they be skilful commander in war can very seldom arrive at any remarkable skill in politick and though they should be so fortunate as to gain estate could never be of any use as the representative of a borough and to what purpose should those man be advance who can only serve they country but can contribute very little to the support of the court this be i own sir a objection which i despair of answer to the satisfaction of those by whom it will be raise the hardy serjeant would never cringe gracefully at a levee would never attain to any successful degree of address in solicit vote and if he should by mere bribery be depute hither would be unable to defend the conduct of he director in vindication of the present scheme i believe few of those rugged warrior would find many argument they would not recommend to the nation a troop of boy under the command of boy as the most proper force to be send to make conquest in distant country nor would imagine that unskilful soldier could under the direction of officer equally ignorant with themselves attain the knowledge of they duty in the same time as if they be incorporate with regular troops in which every man might receive instruction and learn he business from he comrade i have lately sir the opportunity of hear the opinion of one of the greatest general in the world on this subject who declare with the utmost confidence of certainty that raw troops could be discipline in a short time only by be incorporate with those that have be already teach they duty and assert that with a army so mixed he should think himself sufficiently enable to meet any force of the same number and should not fear to acquit himself successfully either in attack or defend such be the sentiment of this great man to whom i know not whether any name can be oppose that deserve equally to be reverence he have have the honor of defend the rights of he country in the senate as well as in the field have signalize himself equally in the debate and in the battle and perhaps deserve less regard for have hazard he life than for have be divest of he employment since therefore it be apparent that great number of officer be by no means necessary to success in war since they be dangerous to we liberty in time of peace since they be certainly expensive and at best not certainly useful and since the greatest general of the present age have declare that we new levy ought to be mingle with we standing force i shall think it my duty to vote against the present scheme of raise new regiment and shall agree to no other supplies than such as may be sufficient for add the same number to the present army general wade then speak as follow : -- sir though i can not pretend to pursue the honorable gentleman through the whole compass of he argument nor shall attempt to stand up as he rival either in extent of knowledge or elegance of language yet as my course of life have necessarily furnish I with some observation relate to the question before we and my present station in the army may in some measure be say to make it my duty to declare my opinion i shall lay before the house a few consideration with the artless simplicity of a plain soldier without engage in a formal debate or attempt to overthrow the argument of other it be observe sir that for the greatest part the farther any man have advance in life the less confidence he place in speculation and the more he learn to rest upon experience as the only sure guide in human affair and as the transaction in which he be engage be more important with the greater anxiety do he inquire after precedent and the more timorously do he proceed when he be oblige to regulate he conduct by conjecture or by deliberation this remark sir though it may be just with regard to all state of life be yet more constantly and certainly applicable to that of the soldier because as he profession be more hazardous than any other he must with more caution guard against miscarriage and error the old soldier therefore very rarely venture beyond the verge of experience unless in compliance with particular accident which do not make any change in he general scheme or in situation where nothing can preserve he but some new stratagem or unprecedented effort which be not to be mention as part of he original plan of operation because they be produce always by unforeseen emergency and be to be imputed not to choice but to necessity for in consequence of my first principle a old soldier never willingly involve himself in difficulty or proceeds in such a manner as that he may not expect success by the regular operation of war it will not therefore be strange if i who have serve in the army in the war of king william may justly claim the title of a old soldier should not easily depart from the method establish in my youth method of which they effect have show I that they at least answer the intention for which they be contrived and which therefore i shall be afraid of reject lest those which it be propose to substitute in they place however probable in speculation should be find defective in practice and the reasoning which indeed i can not answer should be confute in the field where eloquence have very little power the troops of britain form accord to the present establishment have be find successful they have preserve the liberty of europe and drive the army of france before they they have appear equally formidable in siege and in battle and with strength equally irresistible have press forward in the field and mount the breach it may be urge that this vigor alacrity and success can not be prove to have be produce by the number of officer by whom they be command but since on the contrary it can not be show that the number of officer do not contribute to they victory i think it not prudent to try the experiment which if it should succeed as it possibly may would produce no great advantage and if it should fail and that it may fail no man will deny must bring upon we not only the expense which we be so solicitous to avoid but disgrace and loss a long interruption of we trade and the slaughter of great number of we fellow-subject thus far sir i have proceed upon a supposition that the balance of argument be equal on both side and that nothing could be allege on one part but experience or object to the other but the want of it but as i be now call to declare my opinion in a question relate to my profession a question of great importance to the publick i should think that i have not discharge my duty to my country with that fidelity which may justly be exact from I if i should omit any observation that my memory may suggest by which the house may be better enable to proceed in this inquiry i think it therefore proper to declare that we not only in the last great war experience the usefulness of numerous officer but that we have likewise feel the want of they on a signal occasion and that the only great advantage which we enemy obtain be gain over a army render weak by the want of the usual number of officer such be the force that be defeat at the fatal battle of almanza by which almost all spain be recover from we and it be sir the opinion of very skilful commander that the german only by have fewer officer than the french do not succeed in those long and obstinate battle of parma and guastallum it be indeed natural to imagine that a greater number of officer must promote success because courage be kindle by example and it be therefore of use to every man to have he leader in he view shame at one time and affection at another may produce the effect of courage where it be wanted and those may follow they commander who be incline to desert they duty for it be seldom know that while the officer appear confident the soldier despair or that they think of retreat but after the example of they leader where there be only few officer it be apparent that more be leave to chance in which it become not a wise man to place any confidence for if the officer be kill at the beginning of the action the soldier must become a useless defenceless herd without order without unanimity and without design but by the present method if a officer happen to fall he place be immediately supply by another the action go forward and the enemy receive no advantage from confusion or delay i be therefore of opinion that in raise troops for the expedition now intend the established method ought to be follow and that we ought not to hazard the success of we attempt by new regulation of which no human sagacity can fortell the event though it can not be deny that some addition might be make to we company without any visible or certain inconvenience yet the augmentation now intend be too numerous to be so incorporate without some neglect of discipline as the officer would be charge with more man than they could properly superintend there be indeed sir another method of incorporation by add new company to each regiment but of this method the advantage would be small because the number of captain and inferior officer must be the same and the pay of only the field officer would be save and this trifling gain would be far over-balanced by the inconveniency which experience have show to arise from it there have be regiment form of thirteen company instead of ten but it be find that as the officer of a company may be over-charge with soldier a colonel may likewise have more company than he can conveniently inspect and the ancient regulation be restore as the least liable to difficulty and objection have thus endeavor to vindicate the manner in which we new troops be propose to be levy it may be expect that i should now make some observation on the service in which they be to be employ which i can not think liable to any unanswerable objection it be now sir in we choice whether we will send the new regiment abroad or keep they at home and we choice may easily be determine by compare the value of we colony with that of they mother country if it be not necessary to have any army here to defend we against insult and invasion the question about the manner of raise or employ new regiment be superfluous because none ought to be raise as we old troops be sufficiently numerous for foreign service but if the security of the nation require a army would it not be madness to send those troops to a distant part of the world in which we can confide most would not those who speak with such contempt of a expedition undertake by boy have a better reason for they censure if only boy be station on we coast to repel the veteran of france would not such measure animate we enemy and invite a invasion it may perhaps be urge farther that the troops which be send into america be more likely to succeed in they design than any regiment of ancient establishment the chief danger to be fear in that part of the world be not from the enemy but the climate with which young man be most able to contend though they may not be equally qualify for attempt in which skill be equally necessary with vigor i be convinced sir that this war have hitherto be prosecute with ardor and fidelity and that no measure have be take but such as experience and reason have support and therefore affirm without scruple that if we be not successful we miscarriage must be imputed to the chance of war from which no prudence can exempt we lord quarendon speak next in the follow manner be he first speech : -- sir having-but very lately have the honor of a seat in this assembly i be conscious how little i be acquaint with either the subject or form of debate and should therefore continue to listen to the sentiment of person more experienced with silent veneration do i not observe with how much indulgence they be hear who mean well however deficient in knowledge or in eloquence as the honorable gentleman who speak last sir profess to have form he opinion rather from fact than argument i hope i shall be indulge by the house in a attempt to examine those fact which he have produce because i think they not sufficient to support he position which must therefore be establish by some other proof before a decision of this question can be fix by they with regard to he experience to which undoubtedly no small degree of veneration be due he confess that we have try only one of the two form of establishment now in competition and that therefore though he have have reason to approve that with which he be most acquaint he have no certain proof of the inefficacy or imperfection of the other but experience sir may be extend much farther than we own personal transaction and may very justly comprehend those observation which we have have opportunity of make upon the conduct and success of other this gentleman though he have only command in the army of britain have see the force of other nation have remark they regulation and hear of they action with we confederate in the last war he have probably act in conjunction and though it be know that they differ from we in the proportion of soldier and officer he have mention no disadvantage which might be suppose to arise from they establishment and therefore i suppose he can not deny that they behavior and success be the same with that of we own troops the battle of almanza parma and guastallum which he have particularly mention be lose as he inform we by army not officer accord to the establishment which he recommend to we : but it be observable that he argument be defective in a essential part for though he affirm that the army which be defeat have fewer officer than the enemy he have neither show nor attempt to show that the want of officer occasion the defeat or that the loss would have be prevent by a greater number these instance therefore can be of no effect on the determination of the present question for though it be certain that at germany and at other place army with few officer have lose the battle it be not less common for those troops that be more liberally supply to be overthrow by other which be differently model with regard sir to the troops of germany i have hear they praise in many part of europe as not inferior either to those of france or of any other nation and have be inform that they ill success both at parma and guastallum may be justly imputed to other cause than the want of officer there have perhaps sir seldom be a example of firmness discipline and resolution beyond that which be show by the german at the action of parma where they attack the trench of the french sustain the fire of the rampart of the city and though they lose they commander-in-chief and two other towards the beginning of the action they continue the fight for eleven hour and at last retire only at the approach of night at guastallum sir they attack the french in they trench even with force inferior in number so far be they from any diffidence in the form of they establishment and after a fight of seven hour in which they loss be under all they disadvantage not greater than that of they enemy they retreat to they former camp unmolested and unpursue the french sir be preserve in both these battle not by the number of they officer but by they situation by wood cassine ditch and intrenchment nor do i discover sir what can be infer from he observation of the influence of example in time of action but that officer should be select with great care and not be promote by favor or interest or caprice for a example of cowardice in a leader must be pernicious in proportion as that of bravery be beneficial and as where more officer be suppose necessary there be less room for choice it must be allow that the troops which have more officer than other force be in more danger of be infect with cowardice it appear therefore to I that the expense of the present establishment be a certain evil and that the advantage be very doubtful : it appear that the present state of the nation require frugality and therefore i shall vote for the incorporation of we new levy with the old regiment by this incorporation sir we new-levied troops will be no longer distinguish from we veteran they will be equally acquaint with discipline and will learn from the conversation of they associate a spirit of enterprise and a contempt of danger we may then employ force equally formidable in all part of the publick service and invade the dominion of we enemy without leave we own country desolate the argument which the honorable gentleman have offer in defense of send we younger troops to america which may likewise be use against a incorporation be in my opinion sir far from be conclusive for it suppose what will not be grant that a cold climate may be change for a hotter with more safety by a young than a old man i have be tell on the contrary that superabundant heat be the great disease of youth and that the want of it produce most of the infirmity of age and every one have know the life of person languish with age prolong by a removal into warm country i be therefore of opinion that the honorable gentleman 's argument be defective in all its part and hope that i shall not be charge with obstinacy or perverseness for dissent from he mr howe speak next in substance as follow : -- sir before i engage in a discussion of the question i can not but think it necessary to observe that the honorable gentleman who speak the second in this debate have be very far from consult either policy or justice in he declamation and that he deviate from the subject only to ridicule he country to exalt we enemy and depress we effort he have describe sir the british youth the son of noble family and the hope of the nation in term too contemptuous to be hear without indignation he have amuse himself with display they ignorance and they effeminacy and have indulge he imagination in a malignant kind of gaiety which however it may divert himself be very far from contribute either to the reformation or prevention of those practice which he censure i believe sir it will be grant that nothing ought to please but in proportion to its propriety and truth and if we try the satire that we have lately hear by this test it will be find to have very little claim to applause for we army must be compose of the youth of the nation and for my part i can not discover what advantage we shall gain over the spaniard by inform they how little we troops be accustom to danger how short a time they have be acquaint with fatigue how tenderly they have be nurse how easily they may be fright and how certainly they will be conquer if they but meet with opposition nor sir be such a account of the youth of britain more true in my opinion than it be prudent i be far from discover any such remarkable degeneracy in the age or any great prevalence of cowardice and unmanly delicacy nor do i doubt of hear that we youth if they be send upon any expedition have show that the british courage be not yet extinguish and that if they be range on the plain of america they will discover themselves the son of those that force those pass and those trench that other troops would have fail in attempt that the degeneracy of the british youth be at least not universal we have just now sir receive a incontestable proof from the gentleman who speak last and speak with so much elegance of language and justness of reasoning as show that there be to be find among the youth of britain person very well qualify for the senate and i have never hear that a post in the army require greater ability the pleasure however with which i have attend to he remark have not so far prejudice I in favor of he opinion as that i shall easily consent to change that method of discipline to which we troops have be accustom and of which we know by experience that it be at least not less efficacious than that of any other nation custom if they be not bad be not to be change because it be a argument in favor of a practice that the people have experience it and approve it and every change be disagreeable to those who judge only by prejudice of whom i need not say how great be the number many argument may sir in my opinion be add to we experience in favor of the present establishment the number of officer -- but i find myself unable to pursue my design because i can no longer read my note which be write by another hand somewhat embarrass I in this decline of the light i shall therefore only make some observation upon the speech of the gentleman who speak the second in this debate and hope that i shall be allow to deviate from the principal question since i do it only in pursuit of another he have observe that we trooper be mount upon horse that be of no use a remark sir which i never hear from any other person and for which i believe no authority can be produce : they be mount indeed upon horse very different from those which be use by other nation because scarcely any other country breed horse of equal size and strength and therefore i be inform that the french have purchase horse from this island and believe that all the cavalry of europe would be mount upon we horse if they could procure they i have be inform that they pressure in the shock of battle be such as no force in the world be able to sustain and that it be not less by the strength of we horse than the spirit of we soldier that the squadron of france be in the battle of blenheim push into the danube nor do i less disapprove he censure of the choice which have be make of the troops intend for the american service which though i ardently desire its success i can not think of equal importance with the defense of we own country for though we may be disgrace by a defeat we can be endanger only by a invasion and therefore i think it necessary to retain those troops on which we may best rely for the security of this island lest we enemy should take the advantage of they absence and set the pretender on the throne sir william yonge next rose and speak to the effect follow : -- sir it be a standing maxim both in private life and public transaction that no man can obtain great advantage who be afraid of petty inconveniency and that he that will hope to obtain he end without expense will languish for ever in fruitless wish and have the mortification of see the adventurous and the liberal enjoy that felicity which though it be within he reach he be afraid of seize when the depredation of the spaniard become first the subject of we debate nothing be hear amongst we but threat of vengeance demand of reparation assertion of sovereignty and resolution to obtain security : the importance of we commerce the necessity of rigorous measure the danger of pusillanimity the meanness of negotiation and the disadvantage of delay be thunder from every part of the house every man seem to imagine that there be no mean between victory and ruin and that not to humble spain be to betray we country to insult ignominy and slavery far be i then sir from suspect that when the war thus vehemently urge should be declare that the prosecution of it would produce any debate i doubt not but that every man would be desirous of signalize he zeal for the prosperity of commerce by expedite the supplies and forwarding the preparation and that the only contention among we would be who should appear the most ardent enemy of spain but no sooner be hostility begin against this insolent and oppressive nation than those who express most resentment at the prudence and moderation by which they be delay those that accuse every attempt for a accommodation of cowardice and charge the ministry with connive at the rapine of pirate begin to inquire into the necessity of the expense occasion by the war to harangue on the advantage of parsimony and to think it of more importance to ease we tax than to subdue we enemy in pursuance of this new doctrine they be now endeavor to embarrass the measure of he majesty that they may save accord to they own computation only thirty thousand pound which in reality i can easily show to be no more than fifteen thousand for the sake of this important sum we army be to be model by a new regulation and the success of the war be to be impede the security of we commerce to be hazard and we colony be to be endanger frugality be undoubtedly a virtue but be like other to be practice on proper occasion : to compute expense with a scrupulous nicety in time of war be to prefer money to safety and by a very perverse kind of policy to hazard the whole for the preservation of a part the gentleman sir who have most endeavor to distinguish themselves as the constant opponent of the administration have charge it on all occasion with give encouragement to the spaniard but can charge it with nothing so likely to raise the confidence and confirm the obstinacy of the enemy as the objection which they themselves have make to the present scheme of levying force for to how great a degree of poverty must they believe that nation reduce of which the warmest patriot struggle to save a sum so inconsiderable by a experiment of so much uncertainty and how easily will the spaniard promise themselves that they shall gain the victory only by oblige we to continue in a state of war a state which by we own confession we be not able to support have any other argument sir be produce than the necessity of parsimony it have be less dangerous to have agree to this new scheme but to adopt it only for the sake of spare fifteen thousand pound would be to make ourselves contemptible to intimidate we ally and to unite all those against we who be incline to trample on misery and to plunder weakness i be incline to judge so favourably sir of the intention of those whom i be now oppose that i believe they have only use this argument because they be able to produce no other and that if either reason or experience have be on they side the poverty of the nation have not be mention but the honorable gentleman who have be so long engage in military employment have show that all we success have be obtain by the present establishment and that the battle in which we suffer most be lose by we unfortunate deficiency of officer nor do he reason sir however modestly offer deserve less regard than he experience for he have show that a greater number of officer naturally contribute to preserve discipline and excite courage and it be not necessary that a man should be much a soldier to discover that discipline and courage unite must generally prevail to the example which he have produce in favor of he opinion it have be object that victory equally wonderful have be gain with fewer officer and by the honorable gentleman that speak the second on this occasion the action of eugene be oppose to those of the duke of marlborough that victory have be gain by troops differently regulate i can not deny victory have likewise be gain sir under every circumstance of disadvantage victory have be gain by inferior number and by raw troops over veteran army yet no prudent general ever produce these instance as argument against the usefulness of discipline or as proof that superiority of number be no advantage the success of prince eugene in the late war be far from convince the british general that the german establishment be preferable to we own for he require that the hessian troops which be pay by britain should be officer like we national troops in this he could be influence only by he own opinion for he neither nominate they officer nor could advance he interest at home by create new post to which he do not recommend he could therefore only regard the success of the war and change they model only because he think it defective the german themselves sir be far from imagine that they army might not be make more formidable by approach nearer to the british method for one of they officer a man of great reputation and experience have inform I that they be convince of they defect and that nothing hinder they from add more officer but the fear of expense that they imputed all they defeat to the necessity of parsimony that they man want not courage but leader and that they enemy gain advantage merely by the superiority of they opulence in the late war it be common for the auxiliary troops when they be send upon any expedition of importance to be supply with officer either from they other regiment or by the british force so necessary do the duke of marlborough think a larger number of officer in time of action that where he could not alter the establishment he deviate from the common method of war and transfer he officer occasionally into troops over which they have no settle authority it be therefore most evident sir that the model on which we troops be form be by this great commander prefer to that which be now so warmly recommend and i know not why we should recede from he practice if we be desirous of he success nor can i discover sir any better method of select officer than that which have of late be follow however some may censure or ridicule it to advance gentleman to command seem to be the most likely way to unite authority with rank for no man willingly obey those to whom he have lately see himself equal or whose conduct in lower station he have perhaps have opportunity of examine too nearly the distinction of birth however chimerical in itself have be so long admit and so universally receive that it be generally imagine to confer on one man a indelible and evident superiority over another a superiority which those who would easily imagine themselves equal in merit can not deny and which they allow more willingly because though it be a advantage to possess it to want it can not be justly consider as a reproach for this reason sir man cheerfully obey those to whom they birth seem to have subject they without any scrupulous inquiry into they virtue or ability they have be teach from they childhood to consider they as place in a higher rank than themselves and be therefore not disgust at any transient burst of impatience or sudden start of caprice which would produce at least resentment and perhaps mutiny in man newly exalt from a low station the more attentively sir we look upon the world the more strongly shall we be convince of the truth of these assertion and the more evidently shall we discover the influence which operate in a degree scarcely credible even to those who have experience its power and which be indeed one of the chief means of subordination by which society be hold together nor be officer of birth sir to be prefer to man who be recommend by nothing but military service only because they be more cheerfully obey but for another reason of equal importance it have be observe that in reality they discharge the duty of commander in a manner more likely to preserve dignity and increase reverence that they discover on all occasion a sense of honor and dread of disgrace which be not easily to be find in a mind contract by a mean education and depress by long habit of subjection it be not indeed sir universally and unvariably certain that a man raise from meanness and poverty will be insolent and oppressive nor do i doubt but there be many now languish in obscurity whose ability might add new lustre to the highest honor and whose integrity would very faithfully discharge the most important trust and in they favor wherever they can be discover some exception ought to be make but as general rule be generally to be follow as well in military regulation as other transaction it will be find upon the exactest inquiry by no means improper to advance gentleman to post of command rather than private sentinel however skilful or courageous it be to be consider sir that the present state of the continent have for many year make it necessary to support a army even when we be not engage in a actual war that this army though of late it have for the ease of the people be sometimes encamp during the summer be for the greatest part quarter in town and mingle with the rest of the community but govern at the same time by the officer and subject to the martial law it have often be observe by those who have argue against stand force that this difference of government make different society which do not combine in the same interest nor much favor one another and it be indeed certain that feud be sometimes produce that when any private quarrel happen either by drunkenness or accident or claim really disputable between a soldier and any other person each apply for support and assistance to those in the same condition with himself the cause become general and the soldier and townsman be not easily restrain from blow and bloodsh it be true likewise that the rhetorick of the patriot have be so efficacious that they argument have be so clamorously echo and they weekly production so diligently disperse that a great part of the nation as man always willingly admit what will produce immediate ease or advantage believe the army to be a useless burden impose upon the people for the support of the ministry that the landlord therefore look upon the soldier as a intruder force into he house and rioting in sloth at he expense and the farmer and manufacturer have learn to call the army the vermin of the land the caterpillar of the nation the devourer of other man 's industry the enemy of liberty and the slave of the court it be not to be suppose sir that the soldier entertain the same idea of they profession or that they do not conceive themselves injure by such representation : they undoubtedly consider themselves as the bulwark of they country as man select for the defense of the rest of the community as those who have engage at the hazard of they life to repel invasion and repress rebellion and who contribute more than they part to the general felicity by secure property and prevent danger it be not to be doubt sir but sentiment so widely different must produce a equal contrariety of claim and diversity of conduct : the trader imagine that the man who subsist upon the tax which be raise only from he labor ought to consider himself as he inferior at least if not as he hireling and he servant the soldier wonder how he can ever conceive himself sufficiently grateful to he that have devote he life to he defense and to whom he must fly for protection whenever danger shall approach he and conclude that he have a incontestable right to the better part of that of which the preservation of the whole depend upon he thus do self-love magnify every man in he own eye and so differently will man determine when each be to judge in he own cause which of these competitor think most justly of he own station and character or whether both be not mistake in they opinion i think it by no means necessary to decide this at least be evident that to preserve peace and harmony between two body of man oblige to live together with sentiment so opposite there be require a uncommon degree of prudence moderation and knowledge of mankind which be chiefly to be exert on the part of the soldier because they be subject to more rigorous command and be more easily govern by the authority of they superior let we suppose any dispute of this kind sir to happen where the soldier be command only by private sentinel disguise in the dress of officer but retain what it can not be expect that they should suddenly be able to lay aside the prejudice which they have imbibe in the rank and all the ardor of trifling competition in which they station have once engage they what could be expect from they council and direction can it be imagine that they would inquire impartially into the original cause of the dispute that they would attend equally to the party endeavor by mildness and candor to soften the malevolence of each and terminate the dispute by some addressful expedient or decent accommodation he surely must be very little acquaint with the vulgar notion of bravery and honor that could form any hope of such conduct the plain soldier sir have not accustomed himself to regulate he motion by reason nor have learn any more of honor than that it consist in adhering invariably to he pretension even though he should discover that they be false and in resent affront with the utmost rigor even when they be provoke by himself he be teach that it be he business to conquer in whatever cause and that to desist from any of he attempt or retract any of he assertion be unworthy of a man of honor warm with such notion as these sir would such officer as have be recommend by the honorable gentleman apply themselves to the termination of difference without any knowledge of the law of society without any settle idea of the different rights of different person they would have nothing in view but the honor of they profession nor endeavor to support it by any other method than that of violence if a soldier be affront by a farmer they would probably lay he territory waste and ravage he plantation like a enemy 's country if another disagree with he landlord they would advise he to _ make good he quarter _ to invade the magazine of provision without restraint to force the barricado of the cellar and to forage in the stable without controul but gentleman sir be proper judge of debate between the army and the rest of the community because they be equally related to both party as man who possess or expect estate or who be ally to those whose influence arise from they property as man breed in affluence and freedom and acquaint with the blessing of we constitution and the necessity of civil government they can not willingly contribute to the increase of the military power and as member of the army they can not but be desirous to support they own rank and to hinder they profession from sink into contempt it be therefore they care to repress insolence on one part and to prevent oppression on the other to stop dissension in they beginning and reconcile all the different pretension of briton and soldier i be indeed surprised sir to hear the promotion of serjeant recommend by the honorable gentleman who have so often strain he lung and exhaust he invention to explain how much we constitution be endanger by the army how readily those man will concur in the abolition of property who have nothing to lose and how easily they may be persuade to destroy the liberty of they country who be already cut off from the enjoyment of they who therefore can only behold with envy and malevolence those advantage which they can not hope to possess and which produce in they no other effect than a quicker sense of they own misery upon what principle sir any gentleman can form those notion or with what view he can so long and so studiously disperse they it be he province to explain for the only reason that can be offer by any other person for he incessant declamation the desire of secure he country from the oppression of a standing army be now for ever overthrow by this new proposal which if it be to be receive would in a very few year produce a army proper to be employ in the execution of the most detestable design a army that could be of no other use than to gratify a ambitious prince or a wicked ministry as it would be command not by man who have lose they liberty but by man who never enjoy it by man who would abolish we constitution without know that they be engage in any criminal undertaking who have no other sense of the enjoyment of authority than that it be the power of act without controul who have no knowledge of any other law than the command of they superior to man like these sir to man raise up from poverty and servility to rank and power to ignorance invest with command and to meanness elate with preferment would any real patriot any zealous assertor of liberty any inflexible enemy to the corruption of the ministry consign the protection of he country and intrust to these we happiness property and we life whether the honorable gentleman have change any of the sentiment which he have hitherto appear to admit with regard to the army whether this new determination be only a instance of that inconsistency which be scarcely to be avoid in the vindication of a bad cause or whether he be betray to it only by he hatred of the administration which would prompt he to recant he own advice if it should happen to be approve i will not pretend to determine but i must lament on this occasion the entertainment which the house will lose by the eternal cessation of any harangue on the army since he can not now declaim on either part without contradict he former declaration nor will the honorable gentleman find less difficulty in prove that justice rather than policy require the promotion of serjeant to commission military preferment be always at the disposal of the crown nor can any right be pretend to they but such as arise from the custom which have be generally follow in confer they which be not only variable at pleasure but have never be at any time regularly observe the order of rotation have be suffer sometimes to proceed because of two person otherwise equal he that have serve longest may plead the most merit but the plea of service have be always overrule by birth or powerful recommendation and though sir it be natural for man disappoint to complain yet as those officer whose preferment have be delay be not think in reality to have receive any injury they murmur have be the less regard it might be expect sir from a patriot a lamenter of the degeneracy of mankind and a inflexible opponent of corruption that he should consider rather fact than person that he should regulate he decision by the unvariable principle of reason and justice and that therefore he should not applaud at one time what he condemn at another but this gentleman seem to have establish some new maxim of conduct and perhaps upon new notion of morality for he seem to imagine that he friend may seize as they right what he adversary can not touch without robbery though the claim of both be the same it be well know sir to the whole army that a noble person whose ability be so loudly celebrated whose virtue be so liberally praise and whose removal from he military employment be so solemnly lament as a publick calamity obtain he first preferment by pretension very different from military merit and that at the age only of seventeen a time of life in which whatever might be he ability very little prudence or experience could be expect he be advance to the command of a regiment and exalt above many officer whose known bravery and frequent hazard entitle they to favor i do not assert that he be undeservedly promote or condemn those who either solicit or grant he commission i maintain only that what be then reasonable and just be not now either iniquitous or ridiculous and different person in the same circumstance have a right to the same treatment in the reign of queen anne a reign sir which every briton recollect with so much satisfaction and which will for ever afford example of the wisest council and most successful war when new regiment be to be raise it be far from be think necessary to observe this gentleman 's favorite method of rotation post be fill not with the officer of other regiment that room might be leave for the promotion of serjeant but with gentleman who have never see a battle or learn any part of the military discipline but though sir the regulation of we army be thus violently attack the greatest crime of the ministry be in this gentleman 's opinion that of levy new troops when we have no employment for we standing force of lay unnecessary imposition upon the nation and alarming with the fear of a invasion only that the army might be increase on this head sir a declaration of the duke of marlborough have be produce with a great pomp of circumstance and such a seeming accuracy of narration that the attention of the house be engage and the account be receive with all the solemnity of universal silence and with the veneration due to so high a authority in a question of so much importance the subject be indeed so worthy of regard that i think sir every man ought to contribute to its elucidation and therefore i take the liberty of add to the honorable gentleman 's relation what i hope will be hear with equal curiosity the method by which that great commander propose to put a stop to a invasion with so small a number he be very far sir from imagine that he should be able to repel they by open force he be far from be so confident of he superiority in military skill as to imagine that he should defeat they by stratagem and therefore he design by burn the village and destroy the country to deprive they of the means of subsistence and harass they with famine to hover at a distance and cut off those party which necessity should force out to forage till a body of troops could be assemble sufficient to overthrow they in a battle or to drive they back to they ship such be the scheme sir as i have be inform of this great man nor perhaps can any other be strike out by human ability where greater number be to be oppose by smaller but this scheme though preferable in the last extremity to slavery be such as can not be mention without horror and of which the execution ought to be avoid by every expedient that can be practice without the danger of we liberty we ought certainly not to reject a nauseous medicine by which that health be preserve which if lose can only be restore by the amputation of a limb as it be therefore necessary sir to secure we coast from a invasion it be necessary to raise new troops for the american expedition nor do this method produce any delay for the regiment be complete a long time before the ship of war and the transport be ready to convoy and receive they nor could the utmost ardor and diligence despatch they sooner from we coast the ship sir be by the violence of a frost scarcely example retain for a long time in the harbor without a possibility of be put to sea when they be all assemble at the place appoint for they conjunction they wait for a wind all the delay that can be object be produce by the season of which the regulation be in no man 's power but the time sir which be unwillingly spend in the camp be not however lose or misemploy for the troops be by the order of the general every day exercise and instruct in the art of war so that what be lose in time be more than recompense by the advantage of better discipline nor do these troops appear a herd so ignorant and contemptible as they have be represent by malicious invective and ludicrous description there be not indeed among they many grey-headed warrior nor be they former campaign and past exploit the subject of they conversation but there be not one amongst they who do not appear ready to suffer in the cause of he country all that the most hardened veteran could undergo or whose alacrity and eagerness do not promise perseverance in the march and intrepidity in the battle they general sir who see they pursue they exercise declare how much he be satisfy with they proficiency applaud they appearance and express he confidence in they courage nor do i doubt but we enemy will find that it be not necessary to send out we most formidable force to humble they and that the youth of britain will compensate they want of experience by they courage if i sir have be draw aside from the present question it be by follow perhaps with a exactness too scrupulous the honorable gentleman whose proposition i have now show to be erroneous and whose reproach will i believe now appear rather the effect of disappointment than of zeal and therefore i think it now necessary to return to the business before we the consideration of the present establishment from which as it be approve by the duke of marlborough and have be defend with very strong argument by one of the most experienced officer of this time i can not think it safe or prudent to depart mr grenville speak next to the following effect : -- sir as a noble person have be frequently hint at in this debate to whom my relation be well know and whom as i know he well i have the strongest motive to reverence and honor i can not forbear to give on this occasion a attestation which he will be allow to deserve by all those whom interest have not blind and corruption deprave it will be allow sir that he be one of those who be indebted for they honor only to merit one whom the malice of a court can not debase as its favor can not exalt he be one of those whose loss of employment can be a reproach only to those who take they from he as he can not forfeit they but by perform he duty and can only give offence by steady integrity and a resolution to speak as he think and to act as he conscience dictate there be sir man i know to whom this panegyrick will seem romantick and chimerical man to whom integrity and conscience be idle sound man who be content to catch the word of they leader who have no sense of the obligation of any law but the supreme will of he that pay they and who know not any virtue but diligence in attendance and readiness in obedience it be surely sir no loss to the noble person to be debar from any fellowship with man like these nothing can be more unplease to virtue than such a situation as lay it under a necessity of behold wickedness that can not be reform as the sight of a pesthouse must raise horror though we should suppose the spectator secure from the contagion mr ord speak next in substance as follow : -- sir as i can not approve the scheme now propose for augment we force i shall endeavor to show why the argument by which it have hitherto be support have fail to convince I and shall lay before the house some reason against it to which i shall expect a answer before i shall think that i can agree to it without squander the money of which my constituent have intrust I with the disposal the argument sir with which this motion be introduce which be indeed the strongest that have yet be offer be that this estimate be less expensive than one that be lay before the house in a late reign and that therefore it could not reasonably be charge with extravagance let we now consider this argument with that care which be require by the importance of the question let we inquire what consequence will follow from it and to what previous supposition it must owe its force the argument sir evidently suppose that the estimate in king william 's reign be draw up without any intention to deceive the house or to raise money for purpose different from those for which it be really expend but if we suppose that estimate to be fraudulently calculate this may contain the same fallacy in a lower degree and the only merit that can be claim by the author of it will be that they be not the most rapacious plunderer of they country that however they may be charge with profusion of publick money they be yet more modest than some of they predecessor but it be know sir that in king william 's reign very few estimate be honestly compute it be know that the rotation of party and fluctuation of measure reduce the ministry to subsist upon artifice to amuse the senate with exorbitant demand only that they might obtain the necessary grant and to pretend expense which never be incur that the supplies which the publick affair really require might not be withhold as fraudulent tradesman fix immoderate price that the buyer may make offer proportionate to they demand the estimate therefore of that reign be of very little authority though they might sometimes pass the house without censure for it be to be consider that by the frequency of new election the greatest part of the member be often unacquainted with the state of publick account and that a army be so little known to this kingdom that the true expense of it might easily be conceal nor be this sir the only fallacy of this argument for it suppose likewise that the nation be no less wealthy than in the time when that computation be offer with which this be so triumphantly compare for every man know that publick as well as private expense be to be proportion to the revenue by which they be supply and that the charge which be easily support at one time may threaten ruin at another but unhappily sir it be evident that since the day of that sovereign the nation have be exhaust by a long and wasteful war and since by a peace equally destructive it be embarrass with a enormous debt and entangled in treaty of which the support may call every day for new expense it have suffer since that time a thousand loss but gain no advantage and yet the expense of that time be mention as a example to be compare with those which be propose in this the difference of the condition of the british nation at those two period of time sir be not less than that of the strength of the same man in the vigor of youth and the frigidity of old age in the flush of health and the languor of disease of the same man newly rise from rest and plenty and debilitate with hunger and fatigue to make such a comparison sir betray at least a very criminal insensibility of the publick misery if it may not be charge with greater malignity i know not whether those who shall hear of this debate may not impute such reflection rather to cruelty than negligence and imagine that those who squander the treasure of the nation take pleasure in reproach that poverty which they counsel produce and indulge they own vanity by contemplate the calamity from which they be themselves secure and to which they be indebted for opportunity of increase they own fortune and gratify they ambition it be evident that a estimate which require less than that which have be mention may yet exact more than the nation can now raise without feeling too great inconveniency to be compensate by the advantage which can be expect from we new force nor be it sufficient that it be lower than those of former time for as it ought to be the care of the government to preserve the ease and happiness of the people it should be reduce in proportion to the diminution of the national wealth the right honorable gentleman confess sir that frugality be a virtue and he argument suppose that to contract expense be a argument of prudent measure why then be he afraid of carry virtue to a greater height of make the burden still more light and prefer the cheapest estimate that can be propose when it be assert by those whose authority be most worthy of regard that it will produce no weakness in we troops nor give we enemy any superiority i do not pretend any other skill in military affair than may be gain by casual conversation with soldier and by a cursory observation of daily occurrence but i speak with greater confidence on this occasion because i do not think any other qualification necessary for the determination of this question than a habit of just reasoning and freedom from the prejudice of interest every man know sir without a military education that it be imprudent to purchase any thing at a greater price which may be procure at a less and that when the same sum will buy two thing of which one be evidently preferable to the other the best ought to be choose if the application of either of these two position will decide this controversy there will be no need of recur to experience of cite the authority of foreign commander of compare the action of the german and british general or of inquire how battle have be lose or to what victory be to be ascribe it be evident sir that the scheme now propose be twice as costly as that which be recommend in opposition to it and therefore unless it will produce twice the advantage it must be acknowledge to be imprudently choose the advantage in war be to be rate by compare the strength of different number in different circumstance and inquire what degree of superiority will be find if we suppose sir two body of man equally arm and discipline oppose to each other without any advantage of situation we must conceive that neither party could be conquer that the balance of the day must remain equal and that the contest would continue undecided it can not be object to this supposition sir that no such event be record in history because in war many cause really act which can not be estimate one army may consist of soldier more courageous and more confident in the justice of they cause unforeseen accident may operate order may be mistaken or leader may be misinform but all these consideration be to be set aside in speculation because they may equally be allege on either part two body of man sir equally numerous be therefore suppose equal it be to be inquire how either may be superior to the other it be propose on one part to produce this effect by double the number of officer rather than increase that of the soldier on the other to double the soldier under the same officer the expense be the same of both method when two army model accord to these different scheme enter the field what event can be expect either five thousand man with a double number of officer must be equal to ten thousand differently regulate or the publick have pay more for assistance of the officer than its real value and have choose of two method equally expensive that which be least efficacious this sir be the state of the question now before we we present deficiency be not of man but money and we may procure ten thousand man regulate like the foreign troops at the same expense as five thousand in the form propose but i be afraid that no man will be find to assert that the addition of officer will be equivalent to a double number of soldier thus it be evident sir evident to demonstration that the most expensive method be at the same time the least advantageous and that the proposal of new regiment be intend to augment the strength of the ministry rather than of the army if we suppose sir what be more than any foreigner will grant that the additional officer raise a body of five thousand man to a equality with six thousand be not the pay of four thousand man apparently throw away and do not the officer receive a reward which they service can not deserve would it not be far more rational to raise seven thousand by which we army would be stronger by a seventh part and as the pay of three thousand would be save the publick would be richer by almost a third surely sir numerical argument can not but deserve some consideration even from those who have learn by long practice to explain away mere probability at pleasure to select the circumstance of complicated question and only to show those which may be produce in favor of they own opinion in the present question sir there be very little room for fallacy nor do i see what remain to the decision of it but that those gentleman who have be acquaint with military operation inform we what degree of superiority be confer by any assignable number of officer that we may compare they service with the price and discover whether the same money will not purchase greater advantage the experience of the late war may evince sir that those troops which have the greatest number of officer be not always victorious for we establishment never admit the same or nearly the same number with that of the french we enemy nevertheless we still boast of we victory nor be it certain that we might not have be equally successful though the number of we officer have be yet less foreigner sir be very far from discover the defect of they own establishment or imagine that they should become more formidable by imitate we method when i travel i take opportunity of converse with the general of those nation which be most famous for the valor of they troops and be inform by they that they think a multitude of officer by no means useful and that they be so far from desire to see they own regulation change that they should make no scruple of recommend it to other nation who in they opinion squander they treasure upon useless commission and increase the calamity of war by unnecessary burden i hope no man will think it sufficient to reply to these argument with general assertion or will deny the necessity of frugality and extol the opulence of the nation the extent of we commerce and the happiness of we condition such indeed sir be the method of argumentation make use of by the hirele scribbler of the court who because they feel none of the publick calamity represent all complaint as criminal murmur and charge those with sedition who petition only for relief wretch like these would celebrate we victory though we country should be overrun by a invader would praise the lenity of any government by which themselves should be spare and would boast of the happiness of plenty when half the people should be languish with famine i do not suppose sir that the despicable sophistry of prostitute like these have any effect here nor should i have think they worthy of the least notice have it not be proper to inquire whether those may not be justly suspect of some inclination to deceive even in this assembly by whom the most profligate of mankind be openly pay for the promulgation of falsehood and the patronage of corruption it be indeed sir artful in those who be daily impair we honor and influence to endeavor to conceal from the people they own weakness that weakness which be so well know in foreign country that every nation be encourage to insult we and by which it may reasonably be imagine that new enemy will in a short time be raise the late change in we military regulation have indeed take away all the terror of we arm those troops be now no longer dread by which the liberty of europe be recover and the french reduce to abandon they scheme of universal empire for the defense of they own country because the officer by whom they be formerly conduct to glory and to victory be now dismiss and man advance to they post who be neither fear nor know when the duke of argyle be lately deprive of he command the spaniard could not conceal they satisfaction they bestow however unwillingly the highest panegyrick upon he bravery and conduct by show that he be the only briton of whom they be afraid nor do they ally the french discover less exultation for by they it be declare that the nation be now disarm that either no war be intend or that none could be successfully prosecute since as they make no scruple to assert though i know not whether i ought to repeat it we have no other man capable of command army or conduct any great design i be inform that this illustrious warrior whose ability be sufficiently attest by these enemy that have feel they prevalence be of opinion that the number of officer now require be not necessary and have declare that he should with equal confidence undertake either invasion or defense with force model after the german custom and since i have show that unless the troops so regulate be equivalent to a double number add to the standing regiment part of the expense of the officer be evidently squander i shall vote against the motion unless it be prove which i believe will not be attempt that the force of a regiment be double by double the officer general wade then speak to the purpose following : -- sir the learn gentleman who speak last must be acknowledge to have discover a very specious method of reasoning and to have carry he inquiry as far as speculation without experience can hope to proceed but have in my opinion admit a false principle by which all he argument have be perplex he suppose that the advantage must be always in proportion to the money expend in procure they and that therefore if five thousand man raise at any give cost will be equal to five thousand they ought if they be regulate accord to a establishment of double the charge to be able to encounter ten thousand but in this supposition sir he forget that the possibility of loss be to be throw into the balance against the advantage of the expense save and that though the strength of the troops be not increase in proportion to the increase of the cost yet the additional security against a great loss may justly entitle the most expensive regulation to the preference suppose five thousand man to be bring into the field against six thousand if they can by multiply they officer at a double expense be enable to engage successfully a body superior in number by only a sixth part the nation may be justly say to gain all that would have be lose by suffer a defeat that we ought not to choose a worse method when we can discover a better be indisputably true but which method be worse or better can be discover only by experience the last war have teach we that we troops in they present establishment be superior to the force of france but how much they might suffer by any alteration it be not possible to foresee success be gain by courage and courage be produce by a opinion of superiority and it may easily be imagine that we soldier who judge of they own strength only by experience imagine they own establishment and discipline advance to the highest perfection nor would they expect any other consequence from a alteration of it but weakness and defeat it be therefore dangerous to change the model of we force because it be dangerous to depress the spirit of we soldier though it be confess sir that the french whose officer be still more numerous have be conquer by we troops it must be likewise allege that they have yield we far easier victory have they officer be want for to they be they indebted for they conquest wherever they have be successful and for they resistance wherever they have be with difficulty defeat they soldier be a spiritless herd and be they not invigorate by the example of they leader and restrain by the fear of instant punishment would fly at the approach of any enemy without wait for the attack i can not therefore sir but be of opinion that the necessity of a large number of officer may be learn even from the behavior of those troops which have be unsuccessful since it be certain that though they have be often overcome they have generally resist with great steadiness and retire with great order if those who be only speculative warrior shall imagine that they argument be not confute i can only repeat what i declare when i first attempt to deliver my sentiment in this debate that i do not pretend to be very skilful in the art of disputation i who claim no other title than that of a old soldier can not hope to prevail much by my oratory it be enough for I that i be confident of confute those argument in the field which i oppose in the senate mr fox speak next in this manner : -- sir i be far from think that this question have be hitherto fully explain by those who have either consider it only as a dispute about money or a question merely speculative concern the proportion between different degree of expense and probability of success in a war of this kind expense be the last and lowest consideration and where experience may be consult the conjecture of speculation ought to have no weight the method sir by which we troops have hitherto be regulate be well know to have produce success beyond we expectation to have exalt we to the arbitration of the world to have reduce the french to change they threat of force a monarch upon we into petition for peace and to have establish the liberty of almost every nation of the world that can call itself free whether this method sir so successful so easy and so formidable shall be change whether it shall be change at a time when the whole continent be in commotion and every nation call soldier to its standard when the french recover from they defeat seem to have forget the force of that hand that crush they in the pride of victory when they seem to be revive they former design and rekindle they extinguish ambition whether at such a time the regulation of we army shall be change to save upon the highest computation only thirty thousand pound be the present question on such a question sir i can not observe without astonishment any man deliberate for a single moment to suspend we opinion in this case would be to balance we life we liberty we patrimony and we posterity against thirty thousand pound the effect of we present method sir be well know to ourselves we confederate we enemy to every man that have hear the name of blenheim and ramilly the consequence of the establishment now contend for we most experienced commander own themselves unable to foresee and i be far from believe that theoretical disquisition can enable any man to make great discovery in military affair we own inexperience of the method which be so warmly recommend be not the strongest objection to it though even this ought in my opinion to restrain we from try it at this hazardous conjuncture but since argument merely negative may be think over-balanced by the prospect of save money i shall lay before the house what effect the want of officer have produce with regard to those nation whose poverty have lay they under a necessity of parsimonious establishment when the german be defeat by the french in the late war i be at the sardinian court where the battle be as it may easily be suppose the reign subject of conversation and where they do not want opportunity of inform themselves minutely of all the circumstance which contribute to the event it be there sir universally determine that the german lose the day merely for want of officer it be observe also sir that some troops which be once court and fear by all the neighbouring potentate have lose they reputation in later time of which no reason could be allege but that they have lessen the number of they officer such be the change in the model of the walloon and such be the consequence produce by it i be very far sir from think that reason be not to be consult in military operation as in other affair and have no less satisfaction than the learn gentleman who speak last but one in clear and demonstrative deduction but in this question reason itself inform I that regard ought only to be have to experience and that authority unsupported by practice ought to have no prevalence i shall therefore sir make no inquiry into the ability of the general by whom these contrary opinion be defend nor draw any parallel between they action or they knowledge it be sufficient for I that the one be propose a new scheme and that the opinion of the other can plead the practice of king william and the duke of marlborough and the success of the last war yet sir if parsimony be a virtue at this time so eminently necessary it may be urge in favor of this estimate that it will be less expensive than those that have be formerly offer and that as all change ought to be gradual this may be consider as the first step towards a general reduction of the publick charge mr heathcote speak to the follow purpose : -- sir it be not without astonishment that i hear the honorable gentleman who speak lately conclude he remark with a attempt to renew we apprehension of the pretender a chimerical invader a enemy in the cloud without spirit and without force without dominion without money and without ally a miserable fugitive that have not a friend in this kingdom or none but such as be exasperate by those whom the man that mention he with so much terror be attempt to vindicate the vanity sir of such fear the folly of admit they if they be real and of counterfeit they if they be false have be sufficiently expose in this debate by my honorable friend but as he think it unnecessary to employ argument in proof of what can not be deny and believe it sufficient to ridicule a panick which he suppose merely political i who judge perhaps more favourably of the sincerity of some and more tenderly of the cowardice of other shall endeavor to show that the frequent revolution which have happen in this nation afford we no reason for fear another equally sudden and unforeseen in favor of the pretender the government sir be always stronger as it be complicate with the private interest of more individual because though there be few that have comprehension sufficient to discern the general advantage of the community almost every man be capable of attend to he own and though not many have virtue to stand up in opposition to the approach of general calamity of which every one may hope to exempt himself from he particular share yet the most sanguine be alarmed and the most indolent awaken at any danger which threaten themselves and will exert they utmost power to obviate or escape it for this reason sir i have long consider the publick fund establish in this nation as a barrier to the government which can not easily be break : a foreign prince can not now be place upon the throne but in opposition almost to every wealthy man who have trust the government with he money have reposit a pledge of he own fidelity but to this gentleman sir whom i be now answer argument can be of very little importance because by he own confession he be retain as a mere machine to speak at the direction of another and to utter sentiment which he never conceive and which he hesitation and abrupt conclusion show he to admit with very little examination he have not even allow himself time to know the opinion which he be to assert or to imprint upon he memory those argument to which he be to add the sanction of he authority he seem to have boldly promise to speak and then to have inquire what he be to say yet have this gentleman often declaim here with all the apparent ardor of integrity and be hear with that regard which be only due to virtue and independence some of he assertion be such however as require confutation which be perhaps more necessary since he have produce a authority for they which many of those who hear he may think of much greater weight than he own he affirm that we can suffer only by a invasion and infer from this position that we need only to guard we own coast i be of a opinion very different and have not yet prevail upon myself to receive note from any other person can not forbear to speak what i think and what the publick prosperity require to be generally know we may surely suffer by many other cause by the ignorance or treachery or cowardice of the ministry by the negligence of that person to whom this gentleman be probably indebted for he note we may suffer by the loss of we sugar colony which may be justly value at ten million these plantation which afford we almost all the profitable trade that be now leave we have be expose to the insult of the enemy without any other guard than two ship almost unfit for service they have be leave to the protection of chance with no other security at a time when the spaniard have fit out a squadron to infest and ravage we american dominion the admiral who be send into america be confine for almost a year in the port without force ship or ammunition which yet might have be send in a few month have not pretence of delay be studiously invent have not the preparation be obstruct by clandestine expedient and have not every man be tacitly assure that he should recommend himself to he superior by raise difficulty rather than by remove they such be the conduct of those who now stand up in the face of they country and without diffidence or shame boast of they zeal they assiduity and they despatch who proclaim with a air of triumphant innocence that no art or diligence could have be more expeditious and that the embarkation be only impede by the season and the wind with assertion equally intrepid and argument equally contemptible have the same person who boast he expedition endeavor to defend the establishment of new regiment in opposition to the practice of foreign nation and to the opinion of the greatest general among we and to show how little he fear confutation have recommend he scheme on account of its frugality it be not to be wonder sir that such a orator should undertake to defend the model of the troops send to america that he should prefer boy to veteran and assert the propriety of intrust new levy to unexperienced commander for he have give we in this debate such proof of controversial courage that nothing can be now imagine too arduous for he to attempt he strength sir be indeed not equal to he spirit and he be frequently unsuccessful in he most vigorous effort but it must be confess that he be generally overborne only by the force of truth by a power which few can resist so resolutely as himself and which therefore though it make no impression upon he prevail upon other to leave he sometimes alone in the vindication of he position the example sir of those noble person who be advance early to commission will be produce by he without effect because the case be by no means parallel they be not invest with command till they have spend some time in the service and exhibit proof of they courage and they capacity and it can not be doubt but some man may discover at seventeen more merit than other in the full strength of manhood but sir there be another consideration of more importance which will annihilate the parallel and destroy the argument found upon it at the time in which these person be prefer the nation have but newly see a army and have therefore very few old officer whose experience could be trust or whose service require to be reward : the minister be oblige to select those who though they do not understand the military science be likely to attain they in a short time and the event have sufficiently prove that in the choice no greater regard be pay to interest than to judgment it be prudent likewise sir to choose young person suppose they ability equal with those of other because the nation be likely to possess they longer and would not be reduce by a interval of peace to make war again with raw force under the direction of ignorant commander but this provision however reasonable the wisdom of this ministry have find means to defeat by detain at home the disciplined troops and deprive the most experienced general of they command at a time when they be most necessary at a time when the whole world be in arm when the ambition of france be revive its claim and the spaniard be prepare to invade we colony but sir though we general be discard we be sufficiently inform that it be not because we be imagine to be in a state of safety for the increase of we army betray we fear of which whether it will be dispel or increase by such measure it be not difficult to determine a army thus numerous sir be in the opinion of every honest briton of every man that revere the constitution or love he liberty a evil more to be dread than any from which we can be defend by it the most unpopular act of the most unpopular of we monarch be the establishment of a standing-army nor do i know any thing to be fear from the exaltation of the dreadful pretender to the throne but that he will govern the nation with a armed force if we troops continue to be increase which we may reasonably suspect since if argument like these be admit pretence for augmentation can never be want the consequence be easily foresee they will grow too numerous to be quarter in the town and with a affectation of ease they of such unwelcome guest it will be propose that after have spend the summer in a camp they shall retire in winter to barracks then will the burden of a standing army be impose for ever on the nation then may we liberty be openly invade and those who now oppress we by the power only of money will then throw aside the mask and deliver themselves from the constraint of hypocrisy those who now sooth we with promise and protestation will then intimidate we with threatening and perhaps revenge the opposition of they scheme by persecution and sequestration mr gage speak next to the following effect : -- sir if the weakness of argument prove the insincerity of those who produce they i should be incline to suspect the advocate for the establishment of new regiment of design very different from the defense of they country but as they intention can not be know they can not be censure and i shall therefore confine myself to a examination of the reason which they have offer and the authority which they have cite the german general who have be mention on this occasion with so much regard be not less know to I than to the honorable gentleman nor have i be less diligent to improve the hour in which i enjoy he friendship and conversation among other question which my familiarity with he entitle I to propose i have ask he to what cause he imputed the ill success of the last war and he frankly ascribe the miscarriage of it to the unhappy division by which the german council be at that time embarrassed faction produce nearly the same consequence in all country and have then influence the imperial court as of late the court of great britain to dismiss the most able and experienced commander and to intrust the conduct of the war to man unequal to the undertaking who when they be defeat for want of skill endeavor to persuade they patron and they countryman that they lose the victory for want of officer they might perhaps think of they countryman what we minister seem to imagine of we that to gain belief among they it be sufficient to assert boldly that they have not any memory of past transaction and that therefore they could not observe that the same troops be victorious under eugene which be defeat under the direction of he successor nor could discover that the regulation be the same where the effect be different thus in every place it be the practice of man in power to blind the people by false representation and to impute the publick calamity rather to any other cause than they own misconduct it be every where equally they practice to oppress and obscure those who owe they greatness to they virtue or ability because they can never be reduce to blind obedience or teach to be creature of the ministry because man who can discover truth will sometimes speak it and because those be best qualify to deceive other who can be persuade that they be contend for the right but it be surely time for this nation to rouse from indolence and to resolve to put a end to fraud that have be so long know it be time to watch with more vigilance the distribution of the publick treasure and to consider rather how to contract the national expense than upon what pretence new office may be erect and new dependency create it be time to consider how we debt may be lessen and by what expedient we tax may be diminish we tax sir be such at present as perhaps no nation be ever load with before such as never be pay to raise force against a invader or impose by the insolence of victory upon a conquered people every gentleman pay to the government more than two third of he estate by various exaction -- this assertion be receive i see with surprise by some whose ample patrimony have exempt they from the necessity of nice computation and with a affected appearance of contempt by other who instead of pay tax may be say to receive they and whose interest it be to keep the nation ignorant of the cause of its misery and to extenuate those calamity by which themselves be enriched but sir to endeavor to confute demonstration by a grin or to laugh away the deduction of arithmetick be surely such a degree of effrontery as nothing but a post of profit can produce nor be it for the sake of these man that i shall endeavor to elucidate my assertion for they can not but be well inform of the state of we tax whose chief employment be to receive and to squander the money which arise from they it be frequent sir among gentleman to mistake the amount of the tax which be lay upon the nation by pass over in they estimate all those which be not pay immediately out of the visible rent of they land and imagine that they be in no degree interested in the impost upon manufacture or other commodity they do not consider that whenever they purchase any thing of which the price be enhance by duty those duty be levy upon they and that there be no difference between pay ten shilling a year in land tax and pay five shilling in land tax and five shilling to manufacturer to be pay by they to the government it would be in reality equally rational for a man to please himself with he frugality by direct half he expense to be pay by he steward and the event be such as might be expect from such a method of economy for as the steward might probably bring in false account the tradesman commonly add twopence to the price of he goods for every penny which be lay on they by the government as it be easy to show particularly in the price of those two great necessaries of life candle and leather now sir let any gentleman add to the land tax the duty raise from the malt candle salt soap leather distil liquor and other commodity use in he house let he add the expense of travel so far as they be increase by the burden lay upon innkeeper and the extortion of the tradesman which the excise have occasion and he will easily agree with I that he pay more than two-third of he estate for the support of the government it can not therefore be doubt that it be now necessary to stop in we career of expense and to inquire how much longer this weight of impost can possibly be support it have already sir depress we commerce and overborne we manufacture and if it be yet increase if there be no hope of see it alleviate every wise man will seek a milder government and enlist himself amongst slave that have master more wise or more compassionate we ought to consider sir whether some of we present expense be not superfluous or detrimental whether many of we office be not merely pension without employment and whether multitude do not receive salary who serve the government only by they interest and they vote such office if they be find ought immediately to be abolish and such salary withdraw by which a fund might be now establish for maintain the war and afterwards for the payment of we debt it be not now sir in my opinion a question whether we shall choose the dearest or the cheapest method of increase we force for it seem to I not possible to supply any new expense new troops will require more money to raise and to pay they and more money can only be obtain by new tax but what now remain to be tax or what tax can be increase the only resource leave we be a lottery and whether that will succeed be likewise a lottery but though folly and credulity should once more operate accord to we wish the nation be in the meantime impoverished and at last lottery must certainly fail like other expedient when the publick wealth be entirely exhaust artifice and violence will be equally vain and though the troops may possibly be raise accord to the estimate i know not how we shall pay they or from what fund yet unmortgage the officer who will be entail upon we can hope to receive they half-pay for my part sir i think the question so easy to be decide that i be astonish to see it the subject of a debate and imagine that the controversy might be end only by ask the gentleman on whose opinion all he party appear to rely without any knowledge or conviction of they own whether if he be to defend a nation from its enemy and could procure only a small sum for the war he would not model he force by the cheapest method mr sloper then speak thus : -- sir i can not without the highest satisfaction observe any advance make in useful knowledge by my fellow-subject as the glory of such attainment must add to the reputation of the kingdom which give rise to such elevated ability this satisfaction i have receive from the observation of the right honorable member whose accurate computation can not but promise great improvement of the doctrine of arithmetick nor can i forbear to solicit he for the sake of the publick to take into he consideration the present method of traffick use by we merchant and to strike out some more commodious method of state the accoinpt between those two contend party debtor and creditor this he would doubtless execute with great reputation who have prove from the state of we tax that new force require new fund and that new fund can not be establish without a lottery i be indeed incline to differ from he in the last of he position and believe the nation not yet so much exhaust but that it may easily bear the expense of the war and shall therefore vote for that establishment of we troops which will be most likely to procure success without the least apprehension of be censure either by the present age or by posterity as a machine of the ministry or a oppressor of my country general wade speak again thus : -- sir since the right honorable member have be please to insinuate that by answer a plain question i may put a end to the debate i be willing to give a proof of my desire to promote unanimity in we council and despatch in we affair by comply with he proposal if i be oblige with a small sum to raise a army for the defense of a kingdom i should undoubtedly proceed with the utmost frugality but this noble person 's idea of frugality would perhaps be very different from mine he would think those expense superfluous which to I would seem indispensably necessary and though we should both intend the preservation of the country we should provide for its security by different method he would employ the money in such a manner as might procure the greatest number i should make my first inquiry after the most skilful officer and should imagine myself oblige by my fidelity to the nation that intrust I with its defense to procure they assistance though at a high price it be not easy for person who have never see a battle or a siege whatever may be they natural ability or however cultivate by reading and contemplation to conceive the advantage of discipline and regularity which be such that a small body of veteran troops will drive before they multitude of man perhaps equally bold and resolute with themselves if they be unacquainted with the rule of war and unprovided with leader to direct they motion i should therefore in the case which he have mention prefer discipline to number and rather enter the field with a few troops well govern and well instruct than with a confused multitude unacquainted with they duty unable to conduct themselves and without officer to conduct they mr viner speak next to the following effect : -- sir i be not very solicitous what may be the determination of the house upon this question because i think it more necessary to resolve against a augmentation of the army than to inquire whether it shall be make by one method or another every addition to we troops i consider as some approach towards the establishment of arbitrary power as it be a alienation of part of the british people by which they be deprive of the benefit of the constitution and subject to rigorous law from which every other individual be exempt the principal of these law which all the rest be intend to enforce require from every soldier a unlimited and absolute obedience to the command of he officer who hold they commission and expect advancement by the same compliance with the order of the ministry the danger of add to the number of man thus separate from they fellow-subject and direct by the arbitrary determination of they officer have be often explain with great strength and perspicuity nor should i have take this occasion of recall it to the attention of the house but that i think it a consideration to which in all debate on the army the first regard ought to be pay colonel mordaunt speak to the purpose following : -- sir the objection which the honorable gentleman have raise will be most easily remove by consider the word of the act by which the military authority be establish where it be by no means declare that either officer or soldier be oblige indiscriminately to obey all the order which they shall receive but that they shall on pain of the punishment there enact obey all the _ lawful _ order of they commander the obedience therefore sir require from a soldier be a obedience accord to law like that of any other briton unless it can be imagine that the word _ lawful _ be in that place without a meaning nor do he condition differ from that of he fellow-subject by a exemption from any law but by a greater number of duty and stricter obligation to the performance of they and i be not able to conceive how we constitution can be endanger by augment a army which as it can only act in conformity to it can act only in defense of it -lrb- the question at last be put that the new-raised troops be incorporate into the standing corps but it pass in the negative 232 to 166 -rrb- house of lord dec 9 1740 debate on take the state of the army into consideration the duke of argyle rise first and speak to the following effect : -- my lord as the present situation of we affair may require a augmentation of we force and as the success of we arm and the preservation of we liberty may equally depend upon the manner in which the new force shall be raise there be in my opinion no question more worthy the attention of this August assembly than what may be the most proper method of increase we army on this question my lord i shall offer my own sentiment with greater confidence as there be few man who have have more opportunity of be acquaint with it in its whole extent as i have spend great part of my life in the field and in the camp i command a regiment under king william and have long be either the first or almost the first man in the army i hope my lord it will be allow without difficulty that i have at least be educate at the best school of war and that nothing but natural incapacity can have hinder I from make some useful observation upon the discipline and government of army and the advantage and inconveniency of the various plan upon which other nation regulate they force i have always maintain my lord that it be necessary in the present state of the neighbouring country to keep up a body of regular troops that we may not be less able to defend ourselves than we enemy to attack we it be well know my lord that state must secure themselves by different means as they be threaten by danger of different kind : policy must be oppose by policy and force by force we fleet must be increase when we neighbor grow formidable by they naval power and army must be maintain at a time like this in which every prince on the continent estimate he greatness by the number of he troops but a army my lord as it be to be admit only for the security of the nation be to be so regulate that it may produce the end for which it be establish that it may be useful without danger and protect the people without oppress they to this purpose my lord it be indispensably necessary that the military subordination be inviolably preserved and that discipline be discreetly exercise without any partial indulgence or malicious severity that every man be promote accord to he desert and that military merit alone give any pretension to military preferment to make the army yet more useful it ought to be under the sole command of one man exalt to the important trust by he known skill courage justice and fidelity and uncontrouled in the administration of he province by any other authority a man enable by he experience to distinguish the deserving and invest with power to reward they thus my lord ought a army to be regulate to which the defense of a nation be intrust nor can any other scheme be form which will not expose the publick to danger more formidable than revolution or invasion and yet my lord how widely those who have assume the direction of affair have deviate from this method be well know it be know equally to the highest and meanest officer that those who have most opportunity of observe military merit have no power of reward it and therefore every man endeavor to obtain other recommendation than those of he superior in the army and to distinguish himself by other service than attention to he duty and obedience to he commander we general my lord be only colonel with a higher title without power and without command they can neither make themselves love nor fear in they troops nor have either reward or punishment in they power what discipline my lord can be establish by man whom those who sometimes act the farce of obedience know to be only phantom of authority and to be restrain by a arbitrary minister from the exercise of those commission which they be invest with and what be a army without discipline subordination and obedience what but a rabble of licentious vagrant set free from the common restraint of decency exempt from the necessity of labor betray by idleness to debauchery and let loose to prey upon the people such a herd can only awe the village and bluster in the street but can never be able to oppose a enemy or defend the nation by which they be support they may indeed form a camp upon some of the neighbouring heath or pass in review with tolerable regularity they may sometimes seize a smuggler and sometimes assist a constable with vigor and success but unhappy would be the people who have no other force to oppose against a army habituate to discipline of which every one found he hope of honor and reward upon the approbation of the commander that no man will labor to no purpose or undergo the fatigue of military vigilance without a adequate motive that no man will endeavor to learn superfluous duty and neglect the easiest road to honor and to wealth merely for the sake of encounter difficulty be easily to be imagine and therefore my lord it can not be conceive that any man in the army will very solicitously apply himself to the duty of he profession of which when he have learn they the most accurate practice will avail he nothing and on which he must lose that time which might have be employ in gain a interest in a borough or in form a alliance with some orator in the senate for nothing my lord be now consider but senatorial interest nor be any subordination desire but in the supreme council of the empire for the establishment of this new regulation the honor of every profession be prostitute and every commission be become merely nominal to gratify the leader of the ministerial party the most despicable trifler be exalt to a authority and those whose want of understand exclude they from any other employment be select for military commission no sooner have they take possession of they new command and gratify with some act of oppression the wantonness of new authority but they desert they charge with the formality of demand a permission to be absent which they commander dare not deny they thus my lord they leave the care of the troops and the study of the rule of war to those unhappy man who have no other claim to elevation than knowledge and bravery and who for want of relation in the senate be condemn to linger out they life at they quarter amuse themselves with recount they action and suffering in former war and with reading in the papers of every post the cormission which be bestow on those who never see a battle for this reason my lord preferment in the army instead of be consider as proof of merit be look on only as badge of dependence nor can any thing be infer from the promotion of a officer but that he be in some degree or other ally to some member of the senate or the lead voter of a borough after this manner my lord have the army be model and on these principle have it subsist for the last and the present reign neither myself nor any other general officer have be consult in the distribution of command or any part of military regulation we army have know no other power than that of the secretary of war who direct all they motion and fill up every vacancy without opposition and without appeal but never my lord be he power more conspicuous than in raise the levy of last year never be any authority more despotically exert or more tamely submit to never do any man more wantonly sport with he command or more capriciously dispose of post and preferment never do any tyrant appear to set censure more openly at defiance treat murmur and remonstrance with greater contempt or with more confidence and security distribute post among he slave without any other reason of preference than he own uncontroulable pleasure and surely no man my lord could have make choice of such wretch for military command but to show that nothing but he own private inclination should influence he conduct and that he consider himself as supreme and unaccountable : for we have see my lord the same animal to-day cringe behind a counter and to-morrow swell in a military dress we have see boy send from school in despair of improvement and intrust with military command fool that can not learn they duty and child that can not perform it have be indiscriminately promote the dross of the nation have be sweep together to compose we new force and every man who be too stupid or infamous to learn or carry on a trade have be place by this great disposer of honor above the necessity of application or the reach of censure do not sometimes indignation and sometimes pity check the sally of mirth it would not be a disagreeable entertainment my lord to observe in the park the various appearance of these raw commander when they be expose they new scarlet to view and strut with the first rapture of sudden elevation to see the mechanick new-modelling he mien and the stripling totter beneath the weight of he cockade or to hear the conversation of these new adventurer and the instructive dialogue of schoolboy and shopkeeper i take this opportunity my lord of clear myself from any suspicion of have contribute by my advice to this stupendous collection i only once interpose with the recommendation of a young gentleman who have learn he profession in two campaign among the muscovian and whom yet neither he own desert nor my patronage could advance to a commission and i believe my lord all the other general officer be equally unconsulted and would if they advice have be ask equally have disapprove the measure that have be pursue but thus my lord be we new regiment complete in which of two hundred and fifty officer who have subsist upon half-pay only thirty-six have be promote though surely they might have plead a juster claim to employment who have learn they profession in the service of they country and have long languish in penury than those who have neither knowledge nor capacity who have neither act nor suffer any thing and who might have be destine to the hammer or the plough without any disreputation to they family or disappointment to themselves i have be tell indeed my lord that to some of these officer commission be offer which they refuse and for this refusal every reason be allege but the true : some indeed excuse themselves as disabled by age and infirmity from military service nor can any objection be make to so just a plea for how could those be refuse in they age the comfort of ease and repose who have serve they country with they youth and vigor other there be my lord who refuse commission upon motive very different in which nevertheless some justice can not be deny they who have long study and long practice they profession they who have try they courage in the breach and give proof of they skill in the face of the enemy refuse to obey the command of novice of tradesman and of schoolboy : they imagine my lord that they ought to govern those whom they should be oblige to instruct and to lead those troops whom they must range in order but they have forget that they have outlive the time when a soldier be form by study and experience and have not hear in they retreat that a colonel or a captain be now form in a day and therefore when they see and hear they new commander they retire back to they half-pay with surprise and indignation but my lord the folly of last year can not be easily rectify and be only now to be expose that they may not be repeat if we be now to make new levy and increase the number of we land-force it be in my opinion incumbent upon we to consider by what method we may best augment we troops and how we may be able to resist we foreign enemy without expose the nation to intestine misery and leave we liberty at the mercy of the court there be my lord two method of increase we force the first be that of raise new regiment the other of add new man to those which already subsist by raise new regiment my lord we shall only gratify the minister with the distribution of new commission and the establishment of new dependent we shall enlarge the influence of the court and increase the charge of the nation which be already load with too many tax to support any unnecessary expense by the other method of add a hundred man to every company we shall not only save the pay of the officer which be no slight consideration but what seem if the report raise by the ministry of we present danger be true of far more importance shall form the new force with more expedition into regular troops for by distribute they among those who be already instruct in they duty we shall give they a opportunity of hourly improvement every man 's comrade will be he master and every one will be ambitious of form himself by the example of those who have be in the army longer than themselves if it be object my lord that the number of officer will not then bear a just proportion to that of the soldier it may be answer that the foreign troops of the greatest reputation have no greater number of officer as every one must know who be acquaint with the constitution of the most formidable army of europe those of the prussian monarch or of the various nation by which we be assist in the late war either as confederate or mercenary have but few officer and i very well remember my lord that whenever they be join by party of we own nation the inequality in the number of the officer produce contest and dispute the only troops of europe my lord that swarm with officer be those of france but even these have fewer officer in proportion to they private man in time of war for when they disband any part of they force they do not like we reduce they officer to half-pay but add they to the regiment not reduce that the family of they nobility may not be burden with needy dependent and that they may never want officer for new levy there be many reason my lord that make this practice in france more reasonable than it would be in we kingdom it be the chief view of they governor to continue absolute and therefore they constant endeavor to keep great number in dependence it ought to be we care to hinder the increase of the influence of the court and to obstruct all measure that may extend the authority of the ministry and therefore those measure be to be pursue by which independence and liberty will be most support it be likewise to be remembered my lord that a french officer be support with pay not much larger than that of a private soldier among we and that therefore the argument which arise from the necessity of frugality be not of the same force in both nation there be yet another reason why the french be under the necessity of employ more officer than any other nation : the strength of they army consist in they gentleman who can not be expect to serve without some command : the common soldier of the french army be a mean spiritless despicable herd fit only to drudge as pioneer to raise intrenchment and to dig mine but without courage to face a enemy or to proceed with vigor in the face of danger they gentleman my lord be of a very different character jealous of they honor and conscious of they birth eager of distinction and ambitious of preferment they have commonly they education in the army and have no expectation of acquire fortune equal to they desire by any other profession and be therefore intent upon the improvement of every opportunity which be offer they of increase they knowledge and exalt they reputation to the spirit of these man my lord be the french army indebted for all they victory and to they be to be attribute the present perfection of the art of war they have the vigilance and perseverance of roman join with the natural vivacity and expedition of they own nation we be therefore not to wonder my lord that there be in the french army a establishment for more gentleman than in other country where the disparity between the military virtue of the higher and lower class of man be less conspicuous in the troops of that nation nothing be expect but from the officer but in ours the common soldier meet danger with equal intrepidity and scorn to see himself excel by he officer in courage or in zeal we be therefore my lord under no necessity of burden we country with the expense of new commission which in the army will be superfluous and in the state dangerous as they will fill we senate with new dependent and we corporation with new adherent to the minister whose steady perseverance in he favorite scheme of senatorial subordination will be perhaps the only occasion of these new levy or at least have hinder the right application of we standing troops for what reason my lord can invention or imagination assign why the troops who have be for some time discipline be not rather send to the assistance of vernon than the new marine except that some of they be command by man who have obtain seat in the other house and who by they settle adherence and avowed fidelity to the minister have recommend themselves too powerfully to be rashly expose in the service of they country to the bullet of the spaniard so great my lord have be the minister 's regard to senatorial ability and so strict he gratitude to he friend that i know of but one member of the other house that have be hazard in this expedition and he a hopeless abandon patriot insensible of the capacity or integrity of we ministry and whom nothing have be able to reconcile to we late measure he therefore who have never exert himself in defense of the ministry be in he turn think unworthy of ministerial protection and be give up to the chance of war without reluctance but i hope you lordship will concur with I in the opinion that it be not always necessary to gratify the ministry but that we country claim some part of we regard and therefore that in establish we army we should pursue that method which may be most accommodate to we constitution and instead of imitate the military policy of the french follow the example of those nation by whose troops they have be conquer have this scheme be hitherto follow have we new levy instead of be put under the command of boy be distribute in just proportion among the standing regiment where they might soon have be qualify for service by the inspection of experienced officer we might now have see a army capable of awe the court of spain into submission or if we demand have be still refuse of reveng we injury and punish those who have insult and despise we from a army thus raise and discipline detachment my lord ought to have be send on board of all we fleet and particularly that which be now station in the mediterranean which would not then have coast about from one port to another without hurt or fright the enemy but might by sudden descent have spread terror through a great part of the kingdom harass they troops by continual march and by frequent incursion have plunder all the maritime province drive the inhabitant into the inland country and lay the village in ash there be yet my lord no appearance of a peace for we success have not enable we to prescribe term and i hope we be not yet fall so low as to receive they it be therefore proper to form such resolution as may influence the conduct of the war and enable we to retrieve the error of we past measure the minister my lord be not without panegyrist who may perhaps endeavor to persuade we that we ought to resign all we understanding to he superior wisdom and blindly trust we fortune and we liberty to he unshaken integrity they will in proof of he ability produce the wonderful dexterity and penetration which the late negotiation have discover and will confirm the reputation of he integrity by the constant parsimony of all he scheme and the unwillingness with which he at any time increase the expense of the nation but my lord it be the great duty of you high station to watch over the administration and to warn those who be more immediately intrust with the publick affair against measure which may endanger the safety or happiness of the nation and therefore if i have prove to you lordship that to raise new regiment be dangerous to we liberty that a multitude of officer be of no use in war and that a army may be more expeditiously discipline by add new man to every company i hope you lordship will agree to this resolution which i have draw up with the utmost brevity and of which the meaning can not be mistake : that the augment the army by raise regiment as it be the most unnecessary and expensive method of augmentation be also the most dangerous to the liberty of the nation the duke of newcastle next speak to this effect : -- my lord as my education and employment have afford I no opportunity of acquire any skill in military affair it will not be expect by you lordship that i should be able to confute the argument of the noble duke whose acknowledge superiority in the art of war and the ability which he have display in the administration of every province which he have undertake give he a claim to the highest deference but my lord as i can not assume the province of dispute on this question so i can not without longer consideration form any resolution concern it for argument may be fallacious which yet i can not confute and to approve without knowledge be no less weak than to censure there be not any present necessity my lord of form a resolution on this subject we be not now call upon particularly to consider it and certainly it can not be prudent by so determinate a decision pronounce without reflection or deliberation to preclude a fuller examination of this important question lord carteret rise and speak in this manner : -- my lord the noble duke who make the present motion have support it by such strength of argument and so fully explain the advantage of the method which it tend to recommend that not only the present age but posterity may probably be indebted to he for juster notion of a military establishment than have be yet attain even by those whose profession oblige they to such inquiry nor my lord could we expect less from he long experience and extensive capacity experience gain in the heat of war and in the midst of danger a capacity not only cultivate by solitary disquisition in retirement and security but exercise by difficulty and quicken by opposition such ability my lord mature by such a education have justly make the noble duke the oracle of war and procure he the esteem and reverence of all the power upon earth as i do not receive from my education any military knowledge i be not able to add much to the argument which you lordship have already hear but nevertheless have be under the necessity of regulate the army when i have the honor to be employ in ireland and have make in those country where i transact the business of the crown some observation upon the different form of military establishment i hope i shall be allow to offer what my experience or my remark may suggest to I in confirmation of the sentiment of the noble duke when i be in ireland my lord the troops of that kingdom consist of twenty-one regiment of which ten be as last year bring into britain and the irish force be to be fill up by new levy which be raise in the manner now propose by increase every regiment from three hundred and forty to six hundred man so that the eleven regiment remain compose a body of nearly the same number with the twenty-one regiment as formerly constitute of the swedish establishment my lord the reputation and success of they troops be a uncontrovertible vindication attd i have often have a opportunity of compare the number of officer with that of ours and find they private man to be far more numerous in proportion to the officer in hanover my lord i have see he majesty 's troops remarkable for the elegance of they appearance and be once ask by the commander at what expense one of those gallant trooper and he horse be support be tell after confess my ignorance that he cost no more than fourteen pound a year who could not in this country be maintain for less than forty i believe my lord that the french force be not more expensive than those of hanover and therefore we be by no means to imitate they establishment for the price of provision and habit of life do not admit of any diminution of the pay of either we officer or soldier and we can only lessen we expense by reduce they number to which i shall for my part most willingly contribute but as this my lord be not the proper time for disband we force of which the present state of we affair may perhaps demand a augmentation it be necessary to compare the state of we force with that of foreign troops and supply by prudent method the disadvantage to which we be subject by the peculiar condition of we country for if the french can support a army at a fourth part of we expense what must be the consequence of a war suppose the wealth of the two nation nearly equal it will be to little purpose that we boast however justly of the superiority of we troops for though it should be grant that the british can not be resist by a equal number yet it can never be expect that they should conquer troops four time as numerous as themselves thus my lord it appear with all the evidence of arithmetical demonstration that the method now propose be highly expedient nor can any objection in my opinion be make to the resolution offer to you lordship that this be not a proper time for this inquiry have be indeed urge but surely no time can be more proper than when we may by a resolution unanimously pass regulate in some degree the conduct of the other house and faint to they the opinion of this assembly on a question which be perhaps to-morrow to be bring before they lord cholmondeley then speak thus : -- my lord though i be once honor with a command in the army and consequently ought to have attain some military knowledge yet i have so long resign my commission possess it for so short a time and have suffer my attention to be divert from inquiry on that subject by employment of so different a kind that i can not presume to oppose any knowledge of my own to the reason which have be offer but i can not think that the conclusion draw by the noble duke be so evidently true as to force conviction and exclude all possibility of reply nor can i conceive it consistent with the dignity of this assembly to yield implicitly to any man 's assertion or to pass any resolution without a accurate inquiry some objection my lord arise upon reflection from my narrow observation and transient reading and these i shall lay before you lordship with a open acknowledgment of my insufficiency to discuss the question and a sincere desire of be instruct where i may be mistake the subordination of the army my lord appear to I in general to be sufficiently maintain nor be it ever infringe but by particular partiality that can never be prevent or a casual difference in the circumstance of the officer which though not relative to they military character will always produce some degree of influence i know not my lord how the general regulation of we force and the distribution of military honor can be condemn without extend some degree of censure to a person who ought not to be mention as concur in any measure injurious to the publick we army my lord be maintain by the parliament but command by the king who have not either do or direct any thing of which he people may justly complain here the duke of argyle interrupt he : -- my lord it be necessary to clear myself from misrepresentation and to preserve at the same time the order of this assembly by remind the noble lord that he majesty be never to be introduce into we debate because he be never to be charge with wrong and by declare to you lordship that i impute no part of the error commit in the regulation of the army to he majesty but to those minister whose duty it be to advise he and whom the law condemn to answer for the consequence of they counsel lord cholmondeley resume : -- my lord if i misrepresent any assertion of the noble duke it be by misapprehension or failure of memory and not by malice or design and if in any other objection which i shall make i shall fall into any error of the same kind i desire that it may be ascribe to the same cause the ignorance and inexperience of we present officer have be expose with great gaiety of imagination and with the true spirit of satirical rhetorick nor can i presume to support they against so formidable censure but my lord i can not discover any method of protract the life of we old officer beyond the usual term nor of supply the loss of those whom death take away from the army but by substitute other who as they have see no war can have little experience with regard to the number of officer in the foreign troops i have be inform that they be by a express stipulation to be constitute in the same manner with the british and dutch force then the duke of argyle again interrupt he : -- my lord as it be my province in the late war to superintend the payment of the foreign troops i may be allow to have some knowledge of the establishment and hope i shall not be imagine to need any information on that subject lord cholmondeley say : -- my lord i do not presume to dispute any assertion of the noble duke for whose knowledge i have the highest veneration but only to offer such hint for inquiry as may be pursue by other lord of greater ability and to show that as some difficulty may be raise the resolution ought not to be agree to without farther deliberation since it not only tend to prescribe the measure which shall be hereafter take and prohibit a method of raise force which when diligently examine may perhaps appear most eligible but to censure the method which when they be put in practice the last year receive the approbation of all the power of the legislature lord westmoreland speak next as follow : -- my lord i have for my own satisfaction state the difference of the expense between the two method of raise force and find it so great that the method propose by the noble duke ought undoubtedly to be prefer even though it be attend with some inconvenience from which he have show it to be free frugality my lord be one of the chief virtue of a administration a virtue without which no government can be long support : the publick expense can never be too accurately compute or the first tendency to profusion too rigorously oppose for as in private life so in political economy the demand of necessity be easily supply but if once the call of wantonness and caprice be comply with no limit can be fix nor will any treasure be sufficient whether the burden under which the people be now toiling be all impose by necessity i will not inquire but i think my lord we may readily determine that whatever be not necessary be cruel and oppressive and that therefore since the expense of raise new regiment appear at least not to be necessary it ought to be oppose and how can it be oppose more properly or effectually than by the noble duke 's resolution lord hervey speak to this effect : -- my lord i do not claim any superiority of knowledge in any affair that relate to the publick but have less acquaintance with the military establishment than with any other part of the government and can therefore neither oppose the resolution now offer to you lordship by such argument as may deserve you attention nor agree to it with that degree of conviction which the importance of it seem to require that the chief argument which have be produce against raise new regiment be less formidable than it have be represent will i believe appear to you lordship when it be consider that the officer be always gentleman of the first family in the empire who therefore can not be suppose voluntarily to give up they relation and posterity to the power of any ministry or for the sake of they commission to betray that constitution by which they own property be secure whether every other argument may not with equal justice be controvert be not without longer consideration possible to be determine and therefore it can not be reasonably expect that we should agree to the resolution which would be only to decide without examination and to determine what we do not understand for i be under no apprehension of be imagine to reflect unjustly on this assembly in suppose that many of you lordship may be stranger to the question which when the last levy be make be neither discuss nor propose i therefore move that the previous question may be put which may perhaps gain time sufficient for a more exact inquiry upon this important subject lord talbot reply to this purport : -- my lord if in imitation of some noble lord i profess my ignorance of the subject on which i be to speak may it not yet be allow I after the example of other to employ the little knowledge which i have in the defense of a resolution which appear to have no other tendency than the advantage of the publick and to show my zeal for the happiness of my country though perhaps without the true knowledge of its interest the noble lord who speak last be too great a master of eloquence not to be hear with all the attention which pleasure naturally produce and a reasoner too formidable not to raise in he hearer all the anxiety which be produce by the fear of be deceive by partial representation and artful deduction i be always afraid my lord lest error should appear too much like truth in the ornament which he lordship 's imagination may bestow and lest sophistry should dazzle my understanding whilst i imagine myself only guide by the light of reason i shall therefore endeavor my lord to review he ornament and try whether they owe they influence to the force of truth or to that of eloquence he lordship have observe that the objection which be now make to the method of raise new regiment be not produce last year upon a like occasion i know not indeed what can be infer from this assertion for surely it will not maintain that a error once admit be to become perpetual but my lord another reason may be assign for which the objection that occur last year might not be produce the ministry after a long course of disgraceful negotiation and artful delay be at length compel to a war by the general clamor of the whole nation but they act as man unwilling to execute what they do not approve they proceed so slowly in they preparation and be so languid in all they motion that it be evident how willingly they would have improve every opportunity of retard the vengeance which they be force to threaten and with what artifice they would have protracted any delay which they could have imputed to those by whom they be oppose it be therefore to the last degree improper to embarrass they measure of themselves sufficiently perplex or to lay any obstacle in the way of those who would gladly be stop that the army be fill with gentleman be so far my lord from prove that there be nothing to be fear from it that it be the only foundation of all we solicitude for none but gentleman can injure we liberty and while the post of the army be bestow as reward of senatorial slavery gentleman will always be find who will be corrupt themselves and can corrupt a borough who will purchase a vote in the house and sell it for military preferment by the post of the army the senate may be corrupt and by the corruption of the senate the army be perpetuate those my lord who be the warmest opponent of the army apprehend not any danger from they sword but from they vote as they have be of late regulate without discipline or subordination i should not feel such anxiety at see they lead on by they new commander against a body of honest ploughman unite in the cause of virtue and of liberty i should with great alacrity draw my sword against they and should not doubt of see they in a short time heap upon we field but my lord they be employ to ruin we by a more slow and silent method they be direct to influence they relation in the senate and to suborn the voter in we small town they be disperse over the nation to instil dependence and be enslave themselves willingly undertake the propagation of slavery that the army be instrumental in extend the influence of the ministry to the senate can not be deny when military preferment be hold no longer than while he that possess they give a sanction by he vote to the measure of the court when no degree of merit be sufficient to balance a single act of senatorial opposition and when the nation be rather to be leave to the defense of boy than the minister be suspect of misconduct could either bravery or knowledge reputation or past service know fidelity to he majesty or the most conspicuous capacity for high trust have secure any man in the enjoyment of he post the noble duke who make the motion have carry he command to he grave nor have the nation now be deprive either of he arm or of he counsel but as he have now offer he advice to he country and support he opinion with proof from reason and experience which even those who oppose they have confess themselves unable to answer as the justness of he reasoning and the extent of he knowledge have silence those whose prejudice will not suffer they to own themselves convinced let we not my lord reject what we can not condemn nor suffer we country to be defraud of the advantage of this resolution by that low senatorial craft the previous question then the chancellor speak to the follow purpose : -- my lord i be far from suspect that a open profession of my inability to examine the question before we in its full extent will be imputed to a affectation of modesty since any knowledge of military affair could not be acquire in those station in which i have be place or by those study in which the greatest part of my life be know to have be spend it will not be expect my lord that i should attempt a formal confutation of the noble duke 's position or that i should be able to defend my own opinion against he knowledge and experience nor would i my lord expose myself to the censure of have harangue upon war in the presence of hannibal the noble duke have explain he sentiment to you lordship with the utmost accuracy of method and the most instructive perspicuity of language he have enforce they with a strength of reasoning rarely to be find and with a extent of knowledge peculiar to himself yet my lord as he argument however powerful in themselves do not strike I with the same force with which other may be affect who be more capable of receive they i hope that you lordship will allow I to mention such objection as occur to I that in voting on this question i may at least preserve my conscience from violation and neither adopt the opinion of another however great without examination nor obstinately reject the means of conviction every lord who have speak either in support of the noble duke 's opinion or in opposition to it have confess that he be very little acquaint with the subject of we debate and it may not therefore be a improper or useless attempt if i endeavor by objection however injudicious or by argument however inconclusive to procure some illustration of a question so important and at the same time so little understand the objection my lord which i shall produce be such as i have hear in conversation with those whose long acquaintance with military employment give they a just claim to authority in all question which relate to the art of war among whom i find no uniformity of opinion with regard to the most proper method of augment we force and my lord when we observe those to differ in they sentiment whose education experience and opportunity of knowledge have be nearly the same and who have all obtain a very great degree of reputation in they profession what can be infer but that the question be in its own nature obscure and difficult that it involve a multitude of relation and be diffuse through a great variety of circumstance and that therefore it be prudent for every man who can judge only upon the authority of other to suspend he opinion the chief argument or that at least which impress itself most strongly on my mind against any innovation in we military constitution be draw from the success of we army in they present form with that proportion of soldier and officer which the present motion tend to abolish we force say the advocate for the present establishment have afford we a sufficient testimony of the propriety of they regulation by they frequent victory over troops whose discipline have be study with the utmost vigilance and which have be train up to war with a degree of attention not disproportion to the mighty design for which they be raise the subjection of the world and attainment of universal monarchy these troops who have be teach almost from they infancy that cowardice and flight be the greatest crime and persuade by national prejudice and principle studiously instil that no foreign force could withstand they have flee before equal number of briton and be drive from one province to another till instead of grasp at general dominion they be reduce to defend they wife and child how much of this success be to be ascribe to that part of the regulation which this motion propose to be change it be not my lord within my province to determine the great commander whom i have the honor to oppose can best explain to you lordship the province of every officer in the field and how far the number of inferior officer may influence the success of a battle and the fate of a kingdom but to I my lord the establishment of we army comprise different view and connect various subordinate regulation may be compare to a medicine compose of different ingredient and find infallibly efficacious in a dangerous disease in which though some of the part may seem to physician of the profoundest learning superfluous or improper it would be no less than the folly of prefer experiment to life to make any alteration the wantonness of innovation my lord be a dangerous disease of the mind in a private station it prompt man to be always discontent with what they find and to lose the enjoyment of good in search of something better it incite they to leave the safe and beaten track of life in search of those which they imagine nearer but which be at best less secure and which generally lead they to point far different from that to which they originally intend to direct they course it be dangerous my lord to admit any alteration which be not absolutely necessary for one innovation make way for another the part of a constitution like a complicated machine be fit to each other nor can one be change without change that which correspond to it this necessity be not always foresee but when discover by experience be generally comply with for every man be more inclined to hazard farther change than to confess himself mistake by retract he scheme thus my lord one change introduce another till the original constitution be entirely destroy by the ambition of innovation my lord have almost all those empire be destroy of which nothing now be leave but the memory every human establishment have its advantage and its inconveniency and by weak attempt to remedy these defect which notwithstanding the utmost attention will embarrass the machine of government alteration have be introduce which have be quickly follow by a total dissolution there seem my lord to be few regulation on which it be more dangerous to make experiment than on that of the army of a nation we be sufficiently convinced how much of success be the consequence of courage and that courage be only a opinion of we own superiority arise from certain circumstance either imaginary or real the courage which at present animate we force arise my lord from a very proper ground they former victory over the enemy which they be now to combat and will therefore doubtless continue while they can consider themselves as enjoy the same advantage with those particular man by whom the victory be obtain but my lord if any essential part of they establishment be change they will be consider both by themselves and they enemy as a different army they will then charge with less alacrity and be oppose with less dejection they will consider themselves as fight without that certainty of success which arise from experience and they enemy will resolve to try by a obstinate resistance whether they be now equally formidable as in they former state thus my lord i have attempt however weakly to represent the argument which i have hear for the continuance of the establishment of which you lordship will examine the validity and shall now proceed to consider the noble duke 's system of a military subordination in time of peace whether a standing army in time of peace be make necessary to the change of conduct in foreign court it be now useless to inquire but it will be easily grant by you lordship that no motive but necessity necessity absolute and inevitable ought to influence we to support a standing body of regular force which have always be account dangerous and generally find destructive to a free people the chief reason my lord of the danger arise from a standing army may be ascribe to the circumstance by which man subject to military law be distinguish from other member of the same community they be by the nature of martial government expose to punishment which other man never incur and try by form of a different and more rigorous kind than those which be practice by the civil power they be if not exempt from the jurisdiction of a magistrate yet subject to another authority which they see more frequently and more severely exert and which therefore they fear and reverence in a higher degree they by enter into the army lay aside for the most part all prospect of advantage from commerce or civil employment and in a few year neither fear nor hope any thing but from the favor or displeasure of they own officer for these my lord or for other reason the soldier have always be incline to consider themselves as a body distinct from the rest of the community and independent on it a government regulate by they own law without regard to the general constitution of they country they have therefore be ready to subvert the constitution from which they receive little advantage and to oppress the civil magistrate for whom they have lose they reverence and how soon my lord might such outrage be expect from a army form after the model of the noble duke release from the common obligation of society disunited from the bulk of the nation direct solely by they own officer and ultimately command by a man who have the right of command no other would they not soon consider themselves as a separate community whose interest be no less than they law peculiar to themselves would they not consider he from whom they receive all they reward and all they punishment as the proper object of they supreme regard and endeavor to exalt he to the same dominion over other which he enjoy in regard to themselves that they might share in he superiority a body of man my lord thus separate from the rest of the people must consider themselves as either ennoble or degrade by such distinction and would soon find themselves incline to use the power of they arm either in the exertion of they privilege or the revenge of they disgrace then my lord would they set at defiance the law of the nation nor would one of these noble lord be able to disband nor the other to resist they the army my lord be in time of peace then best regulate when it be keep under the strictest subordination to the civil power that power which it be institute to protect and to preserve thus my lord have i examine the proposal and reason of the noble duke perhaps not much to the information of you lordship but it can not be expect that any capacity should be able in a unexpected and sudden debate to dispute on a subject which the noble duke 's education give he particular opportunity of understand far beyond almost every other man and which he have have time to consider with respect to this present motion for this reason my lord i can not but think the previous question highly expedient but not for this reason alone for as the state of the army and the proper method of augment it be soon to be examine by the other house to prejudice they determination may raise a contest about privilege and oblige we either to persist for we own honor in opposition to measure necessary to the security of the publick or in compliance with the present exigence accept they scheme however opposite to we own resolution lord carteret speak in substance as follow : -- my lord the known ability of that noble lord incline I always to hear he with uncommon expectation and attention which seldom fail to be reward by such pleasure and information as few other man be able to afford but he observation on the question before we my lord have only convinced I that the greatest ability may be sometimes betray into error and the most candid disposition be vitiate by accidental prejudice for he own argument neither appear just nor he representation impartial of those advance in favor of the motion with regard to the number of officer necessary in time of war he lordship assert nothing from he own knowledge nor do i believe that any other lord will imagine himself qualify to dispute with the noble duke upon question purely military he experience entitle he to the highest authority in debate of this kind and if every man have a claim to credit in he own profession surely he who have give evidence of he proficiency in the art of war in the eye of the whole world will not be deny in this house that superiority which would readily be allow he in any other part of the universe and yet less my lord can it be suspect that he intend to deceive we than that he can be deceive himself for not only he probity he love of he country and he fidelity to the crown concur to secure he from any temptation to make a ill use of he credit but he own interest oblige he to offer that scheme for the regulation of we force which in he own opinion will most certainly contribute to they success for it be not to be doubt my lord that when we shall be engage in war too far for negotiation and convention when we shall be surround by enemy and terrify at the near approach of danger he will be call upon to lead we army to battle and attack once more those enemy that have flee so often before he then my lord if he have contribute to form a weak plan of we military constitution must he atone for it with the loss of he reputation that reputation for which he have undergo so many fatigue and be expose to so many danger but my lord it be ridiculous to suspect where nothing appear to provoke suspicion and i be very far from imagine that the danger of innovation however artfully magnify or the apprehension of the soldier however rhetorically represent will be think of any weight the establishment of the army my lord be a innovation and as the noble lord have justly represent it a innovation that threaten nothing less than the destruction of we liberty and the dissolution of we government we vigilance ought therefore to be very anxiously employ in regulate this new part of we government and adapt it in such a manner to the national constitution that no detriment may arise from it and that we civil rights may be protect not oppress by the military power to this purpose say the noble lord the soldier be to be restrain by a due subordination to the magistrate a position undoubtedly true but now superfluously urge : for it be never controvert by the noble person whose opinion he intend to oppose should any man assert my lord that the army ought to be form into a distinct and independent society which should receive law only from a council of war and have no other governor than they officer none should oppose such a assertion with more ardor or constancy than myself but what be never advance it be unnecessary to confute yet my lord to obviate those danger from the army which have be so strongly and justly represent it be necessary not only that a legal subordination to the civil authority be firmly establish but that a personal dependence on the ministry be take away how readily man learn to reverence and obey those on whom they fortune depend have be already show by the noble lord and therefore it will follow that a minister who distribute preferment at he pleasure may acquire such a influence in the army as may be employ to secure himself from justice by the destruction of liberty and unless it can be prove that no such minister can ever exist that corruption ambition and perfidy have place only in the military race every argument that show the danger of a army dependent only on the general will show the danger likewise of one dependent only on the minister the influence of the minister my lord be know to arise from the number of the officer and to be proportion to the value of the preferment which it be in he power to bestow it be therefore evident by add new officer to we army we shall throw weight into the scale which already be at least a equal balance to we constitution and enable the ministry either to employ a army in defense of they measure or to obtain such a influence in the senate as shall make any other security superfluous such my lord be the danger of a multitude of officer a danger which surely deserve more attention than the imaginary prejudice of the soldier in favor of the present establishment a prejudice represent so powerful both in we own force and those of we enemy that the future success of we arm may probably depend upon it surely my lord that cause may be allow indefensible which such a patron defend so weakly what can be more chimerical than to imagine that man would lay down they arm and forsake they standard because there be twenty more in a company than have formerly be that such a panick from such a cause be never find i need not prove and i scarce think it necessary to assert that without suppose a universal depravity of reason it never can be find the establishment propose by the noble duke be the same with that of most foreign troops and particularly with that of he majesty 's force in he foreign dominion and therefore can not but be approve by he if it should be propose by you lordship for why should he imagine a greater number of officer necessary to the troops of britain than to those of any other nation the expediency of the motion my lord be in my opinion so obvious and incontestable as to require no farther consideration and therefore it be no argument against it that we be not previously inform of the question much less my lord can i discover the force of the assertion that by such a resolution we shall excite the displeasure of the other house we have my lord at least a equal right with they to examine any position relate to the publick security a right which we may exert with less danger of disgust they while they have yet form no determination and with less danger to the nation than when they opinion whatever it may be can not be controvert without retard the important bill against mutiny we be never offend my lord at receive the opinion of the other house which we often adopt without any alteration and often make use of for we own instruction and now be become so contemptible as that no regard should be pay by they to we resolution it be well know my lord that this assembly be a essential and constituent part of the legislature of this kingdom and that we receive from we ancestor a great extent of power which it ought to be we care not to suffer to be contract by degree till this assembly shall become merely formal and sit only to ratify implicitly the determination of the other house -lrb- several other lord speak in the debate and the president have put the previous question whether the question should be then put upon a division it pass in the negative content 42 not content 59 -rrb- house of common December 12 1740 respecting officer on half-pay mr sandy this day move for a humble address to he majesty that for the future ease of he majesty 's subject all officer now subsist upon half-pay etc might be employ in the army and support it to the following effect : sir though i have often known motion oppose without any just objection or at least without any proof of such inconveniency likely to arise from they as be equivalent to the advantage which they would have produce yet i can not but confess that any opposition to this will be unexpected and surprising for it be in my opinion support by every law of justice and humanity if we regard the publick in general it can not but produce some alleviation of the national expense and if we consider the particular person to whom it immediately relate they have certainly a just claim to that regard which it be the tendency of this motion to procure they to burden with superfluous officer and unnecessary expense a people already overwhelm with tax and overrun with the dependent on the crown be surely to the highest degree cruel and absurd and to condemn those man to contempt and penury who have serve they country with bravery and fidelity to prefer unexperienced stripling to those commission which would gladly be accept by man who have already try they courage in the battle and bear the fatigue of march and the change of climate be surely not only to oppress the deserving and scatter promotion without just distinction but what be yet more enormous it be to wanton with the publick safety and expose we to we enemy nor do it appear to I sufficient that the veteran officer be restore to the commission which they formerly enjoy they ought upon a augmentation of we troops to be recompense by some advancement for they service and they suffering the ensign ought to become a lieutenant and the lieutenant be exalt to a captain station which they will surely fill with more dignity and greater ability than boy newly discharge from school and intrust with unexpected authority if it be reasonable sir that expense should be spare in a time of general poverty if it be politick to carry on war in the manner most likely to produce success if it be just that those who have serve they country should be prefer to those who have no merit to boast this motion can not be reject sir william yonge answer to this purpose : -- sir to the motion now make it will not i believe be object that it be unreasonable or unjust but that it be unnecessary and that it be not draw up with sufficient consideration it be unnecessary because he majesty be advise by it to no other measure than those which he have already determine to pursue for he have declare to I sir he intention of confer the new commission upon the officer who receive half-pay before any other officer shall be promote the motion appear to I not to be very attentively consider or draw up with great propriety of expression for it suppose all the half-pay officer fit for the service which can not be imagine by any man who consider that there have be peace for almost thirty year a space of time in which many vigorous constitution must have decline and many who be once well qualify for command must be disable by the infirmity of age nor be the promotion of one of these gentleman consider always by he as a act of favor many of they have in this long interval of peace engage in method of life very little consistent with military employment many of they have family which demand they care and which they would not forsake for any advantage which a new commission could afford they and therefore it would not be very consistent with humanity to force they into new danger and fatigue which they be now unable to support with regard to these man compassion and kindness seem to require that they should be suffer to spend they few remain day without interruption and that the danger and toil of they youth should be requite in they age with ease and retirement there be other who have less claim to the regard of the publick and who may be pass by in the distribution of new preferment without the imputation of neglect merit these be they who have voluntarily resign they commission for the sake of half-pay and have prefer indolence and retreat to the service of they country so that it appear that of those who subsist upon half-pay some be unable to execute a commission some do not desire and some do not deserve it and with regard to the remain part which can be no great number i have already state the intention of he majesty and therefore can not but conclude that the motion be needless mr pulteney speak as follow : -- sir i know not by what fatality it be that all the motion make by one party be reasonable and necessary and all that be unhappily offer by the other be discover either to be needless or of pernicious tendency whenever a question can be cloud and perplex the opponent of the ministry be always mistaken confute and in consequence of the confutation defeat by the majority of vote when truth be too notorious to be deny and too obvious to be contest the administration claim the honor of the first discovery and will never own that they be incite to they duty by the remonstrance of they opponent though they never before those remonstrance have discover the least intention of perform it but that the motion be allow to be just and proper be sufficient the importance of it will be easily discover for my part i shall always consider that motion as important which tend to contract the expense of the publick to rescue merit from neglect and to hinder the increase of the dependent on the ministry sir robert walpole answer : -- sir there be no temper more opposite to that incessant attention to the welfare of the publick which be the perpetual boast of those who have signalize themselves by oppose the measure of the administration than a lust of contradiction and a disposition to disturb this assembly with superfluous debate whether this disposition be not discover in the reply make to the declaration of he majesty 's intention and the confession of the propriety of the motion let the house determine it must surely be confess that it be not necessary to advise what be already determine nor be it less evident that many of the officer whose interest be now so warmly solicit must be incapacitate by they age for service and unable to receive any benefit from the offer of new commission to deny this be to question the flux of time or to imagine that the constitution of a soldier be exempt from its injury mr sandy explain himself to this effect : -- sir i be far from intend by this motion to fill the army with decrepit officer or to obstruct in any manner the service of the publick nor have i any other intention than to secure to those whose year permit and whose inclination incite they to enter once more into the army that preferment to which they have a claim not only from they past service but from the state of penury and obscurity in which they have languish i desire to preserve those whose valor have heretofore make we nation the terror of the world from the mortification of see themselves insult by childhood and command by ignorance by ignorance exalt to authority by the countenance of some rhetorician of the senate or some mayor of a borough whoever have observe the late distribution of military honor will easily discover that they have be attain by qualification very different from bravery or knowledge of the art of war he will find that regiment and company be the reward of a seasonable vote and that no man can preserve he post in the army whether give he as the reward of acknowledged merit or sell he for the full value any longer than he employ all he influence in favor of the ministry sir robert walpole then say : -- sir it have be already admit that the motion can only be object to as superfluous and therefore all farther debate be mere waste of time without any prospect of advantage nor be any thing now necessary but to review the motion and correct such expression as may be think inaccurate or improper that _ all _ the half-pay officer be not able to enter into the service have be already show and therefore i should imagine that instead of _ all the officer _ we might very justly substitute _ officer properly qualify _ sir john barnard reply : -- sir though i can not discover the necessity of any alteration since it can not be conceive that the senate can advise impossibility yet since so much accuracy be affect it may be allow that the word _ all _ shall be leave out as seem to imply more than can be intend but the honorable gentleman be not in my opinion so happy in he amendment as in he objection for the word _ properly qualify _ convey to I no distinct idea he that be qualify be i suppose _ properly qualify _ for i never hear of _ improper qualification _ but if the word _ properly _ be omit i have no objection to the amendment this motion be agree to house of common jan 24 1740-1 -lrb- debate on a address for papers relate to admiral haddock -rrb- mr waller this day offer the following motion in write that a humble address be present to he majesty that he will be graciously pleased to give direction that there may be lay before this house copy of two particular letter write by he majesty 's secretary of state to admiral haddock which have be address for before and of the letter receive from admiral ogle mention therein together with all letter write by admiral haddock to either of he majesty 's secretary of state concern the say letter and the execution of the order contain therein this motion he support by argument to the following effect : -- sir no man who consider the present situation of we foreign affair the expense and inefficacy of we military preparation the appearance of negligence in we naval expedition and the general disappointment of the hope which the nation have conceive of victory vengeance and reparation can in my opinion doubt the expediency of the motion which i have take the liberty to make when the expectation of the nation be deceive it certainly become those who be depute to watch over the prosperity of the publick to inquire whence the disappointment proceeds and either to inform they constituent that they uneasiness arise from they own error and that they hope be destroy because they have no rational foundation or to detect the weak management of those by whom the publick measure have be ill-conducted or the national treasure have be misapply with regard sir to the present war i know not how the nation can be charge with have form unreasonable expectation if they consider the speech from the throne the most authentick declaration of the intention of the government they find there the warmest resentment of the injury which they have sustain and the strongest assurance of a vigorous prosecution of all those measure which might produce speedy recompense and inviolable security if they reflect sir on the preparation for war on the multitude of ship the demand of material for naval equipment and the high price at which workman be retain they could not but imagine that either some mighty attempt be design or some formidable enemy dread and as they know not whom they have to fear they ascribe the vigor of we proceedings to a resolution of humbling we enemy by one fatal blow and re-establish we naval dominion by a single effort and justly sir might they indulge this pleasing imagination with reason might they anticipate a triumph over a enemy whose strength bear no proportion to the force that be fit out against they and expect that in a few month they should see the ambassador of spain supplicate for peace to raise they expectation yet higher they trade be suspend by a embargo long continue and in the strictest manner enforce and the impress be let loose upon the sailor they see nothing omit however grievous to the nation that could contribute to make it formidable and bear part of the misery of war without impatience in hope of be reward by military glory and repay by the plunder of spain but sir when so long a time have elapse and no account be bring of either a victory or a battle when they hear nothing but that we fleet have visit several neutral port and those of the enemy sail unmolested from coast to coast and when they be every day tell of the loss of we merchant be insult in we own channel by the spanish privateer and receive no relation of we success upon the shore of we enemy can it be wonder that they suspect the reality of we design or inquire whence it proceed that they money have be waste they trade interrupted and the liberty of they fellow-subject invade to no purpose but how much more justly sir be they inflamed when they hear of the lucky stratagem or daring enterprise of those enemy which a just sense of they own superiority have induce they to consider as vanquish before the battle and of whom they have no apprehension but that they cowardice would always secure they from vengeance how justly may they murmur when they read that we fleet leave every part of the enemy 's coast where they presence be necessary and have afford the spaniard a opportunity of change one port for another as it be most convenient and at length of join the french squadron and sailing to the defense of they american dominion may they not justly sir require of they representative some reason for such inexplicable conduct may they not reasonably demand a account of the argument which procure they approbation of measure which so far as they can be examine by those who have no opportunity of peruse the necessary papers appear either cowardly or treacherous and what answer sir can we return to such remonstrance unless this motion be agree to how can we appease the discontent of we constituent or discharge the trust repose in we without a very minute and attentive inquiry into question thus obscure and thus important be we to tell we constituent that we absolutely rely upon the prudence and fidelity of the ministry and admiral and recommend to they the same implicit dependence be we to confess that we have now for two session vote in the dark and approve what we be not suffer to examine and understand such answer sir to question so reasonable will not contribute to increase the veneration of the people either for ourselves or we constitution and yet this answer and this only they can receive from we if the papers mention in the motion i have make be deny mr clutterbuck reply in the follow manner : -- sir this motion though so warmly urge and so artfully support i can consider only as a repetition of a former motion which be approve by the assembly so far as it could properly be comply with nor be any paper then conceal which it would not have be a injury to the nation to have divulge if the design of this motion be to promote the success of the present war and the zeal with which it have be press be incite only by the ardor of true patriotism i doubt not but it will easily be withdraw by those who be now most inclined to support it when they shall reflect that it tend to the discovery of we scheme and to the overthrow of we design that it will expose all we consultation to we enemy and instruct they how to annoy we with most success and how to shelter themselves from we intended attack it be the first care sir of every administration that they military design should only be discover by the execution of they and that they enemy by be oblige to guard all part should be weak in all if by lay we papers before this house the spaniard should come to be inform against what part of they dominion we expedition be design will they not increase they strength improve they fortification and double they vigilance and if we be thus oblige to form new scheme must we not impute the defeat of the former to we own imprudent zeal or unseasonable curiosity mr sandy speak to this effect : -- sir that we should demand the scheme lay for the future conduct of the war with spain be never propose nor as it may reasonably be conclude ever imagine for what be mention in the motion but the papers relate to the transaction of the two last year that it should be necessary to remind gentleman of the difference between the _ future _ and the _ past _ would hardly be suspect by any man not accustom to senatorial controversy and artifice of state and yet in the argument which have be offer against the motion nothing have be assert but that the order relate to past transaction be not to be lay before we lest the enemy should thereby gain intelligence of what we now design against they the necessity of secrecy in war need not be urge because it will not be deny but when design have be lay and miscarry the reason of that miscarriage may surely be inquire without danger of betray the council of we country if the negligence of we council and the misconduct of we commander have be such that no design have be premeditate if a war have be carry on by chance and nothing have succeed because nothing have be attempt if we commander have not do ill and have only do nothing if they have avoid loss by avoid danger we may surely inquire to whom such proceedings be to be imputed whether the defeat of we design be to be charge upon the strength of we enemy or the cowardice of we officer or whether the inactivity and apparent neutrality of we force be occasion by the negligence of we admiral or the irresolution of we own ministry there have be sir many incident in these two last year of which the examination can be of very little advantage to the spaniard i do not know what pernicious intelligence they can glean from a inquiry into the reason for which haddock 's fleet be divide and ogle send to the defense of minorca or for which he afterwards return nor can i conceive that any advantage except that of merriment and diversion can be throw into the hand of we enemy though we should seriously inquire into what no man have yet pretend to understand the wonderful escape of the spanish squadron a transaction on which we have dwell long enough with that admiration which ignorance produce and on which it may not be improper at length to enable we to reason this be a affair perhaps much better understand by we enemy than by ourselves and surely we can not therefore be afraid of inform they of it at least since the fleet have long since sail out and leave they coast we can hardly be restrain in we inquiry by the fear of discover we _ future _ design if therefore it be the incontestable right of the senate to examine the conduct of publick affair which i suppose will scarcely be deny this motion can not be reject as unseasonable nor can the papers be refuse without increase those suspicion which be already too prevalent throughout the nation nor indeed for we own sake ought we to delay this inquiry any longer lest by have long act without be accountable the minister should form a prescription against we privilege and in time tell we in plain term that we be he slave and that we be not to presume to carry we examination however solemn and important they may continue to appear farther than he shall be please to permit and that whatever may be the opinion of the people that depute we or whatever ancient claim we may plead to authority we be now to consider ourselves only as the oppressor of the nation and the panegyrist of the court mr walpole next rose and speak to this purpose : -- sir it can not be deny to be reasonable that all those papers should be lay before the senate which can be communicate without injury to the publick of this number we may justly imagine the order send to the admiral in which the time of they departure be fix and many other which may be of use to inform the house but can not enable the enemy to judge either of we force or we design but it be evident that there must be other include in this motion which we regard for the success of the war and the prosperity of we country ought to determine we to conceal and such as be never expose by any administration it be therefore proper to limit the address to papers of a certain kind or a certain date which may be consider by the house without benefit to we enemy and for the examination of which a day or two will be more than sufficient mr pulteney speak in substance as follow : -- sir i know not what number of papers the wisdom of the administration will allow we but if we judge by the time propose to be spend in examination we shall not be distract with a great diversity of subject intelligence will be very penuriously deal out and if we submit to they choice of the writings which shall be lay before we we inquiry will probably end without any discovery make either by we enemy or ourselves but i hope sir we shall not be so cheaply satisfied nor expose by the fear of one enemy to the insolence of another i hope we shall resolutely continue we demand of information while a single line be conceal from which any light can be expect there may indeed be circumstance in which we demand however loud will necessarily be vain it be not impossible that we may suspect those transaction of deep art and secret contrivance which have be the consequence of mere indolence and want of consideration we great minister have be perhaps only do nothing while we have imagine that they be work out of sight mislead sir by this notion we may call for the order that have be despatch in these two last year when perhaps we secretary of state have be fattening on they salary without employment and have sleep without care and without curiosity while we have be congratulating ourselves upon they vigilance for we preservation or if order have be give it be to be consider that the end of inspect order be to compare they with the conduct of the admiral to whom they be direct : from this comparison i doubt not but many gentleman expect uncommon discovery but to check all unreasonable hope before they have take possession of they heart for unreasonable hope be the parent of disappointment i think it proper to remind they that to draw any conclusion from the order it be necessary to understand they this consideration alone be sufficient to redress the ardor of inquiry for every man that have have opportunity of know the wonderful accomplishment of we ministry the depth of they design the subtilty of they stratagem and the closeness of they reasoning will easily conceive it probable that they might send such order as none but themselves could understand and what then will be the consequence of we idle curiosity but that we be lead into a labyrinth of endless conjecture for we have long ago find that no explanation be to be expect and that we ministry be too wise to discover they secret to they enemy let we therefore examine the naked fact which have fall within we observation and endeavor to inform ourselves of the meaning of these secret order by the execution of they admiral ogle be despatch from haddock 's fleet to protect minorca and in he absence the spanish squadron sail away perhaps he be order to watch ferrol and minorca at the same time and not understand how that be to be do neglect one part of he charge by a attention to the other : as a watchman who should be employ to guard at once the bank in london and the treasury in westminster admiral norri sir sail lately forth i suppose in pursuance of order with a very formidable fleet and after have lose sight for some day of the british coast sail back again with great precipitation whether he order be only to sail forth or whether when he examine they farther he could not understand they i pretend not to determine but it may reasonably be imagine that he order be of the same kind with those of we other admiral because they produce the same consequence i have be tell that formerly we commander be order to _ burn _ _ sink _ and _ destroy _ and that in those time it be not uncommon for a british admiral to do much mischief with a strong fleet but it be evident that the style be since change for we admiral be now very inoffensive and go out only to come back i therefore think the motion highly necessary and such as ought to be comply with admiral norri here rise up and speak thus : -- sir i be not conscious that my conduct in any part of my life have expose I to be justly treat with contempt and ridicule and what i have not deserve i will not bear if any gentleman in this house can accuse I of have neglect my duty or desert it let he not spare insult or invective let he now expose my cowardice or my carelessness let he prove I unworthy of trust or of command but my own conscience acquit I and i defy any man to produce and support he accusation nor can you sir -lrb- footnote : address himself to mr pulteney -rrb- who have thus contemptuously treat I allege any thing against I that may justify you neglect of decency : that you have transgress the rule of decency be the softest censure that you behavior admit and i think it may with equal propriety be assert that you have break the law of justice mr pulteney reply in this manner : -- sir i shall submit to you and all who hear I whether i have treat the honorable gentleman 's name with any contemptuous freedom of speech the usual method of mention a expedition be that of name the commander who be not thereby necessarily include in the censure of a unsuccessful attempt and i be very far from call he courage and capacity into question not that i shall ever think it necessary to make a apology for express my sentiment with freedom as a member of this house in which i shall always speak what i think and in what manner it shall appear to I most proper nor shall i fear to repeat without door what i say here sir robert walpole next rise up and speak to this purpose : -- sir as i be not acquaint with any measure pursue by the administration which it be they particular interest to conceal i be desirous that all papers should be lay before the house which will not afford we enemy any opportunity of obviate we design what necessity there be for this address i can not indeed discover because i know not any foundation for suspicion of either negligence or treachery which have be both insinuate in this debate nor be the ministry however ludicrously they ability have be treat afraid of discover they ignorance by lay before the house the order which they have give to we admiral order of which they be far from doubt that they will appear upon a candid examination rational and proper the chief objection to this motion arise from its unreasonableness and the necessity which it will produce of assign to a fruitless inquiry those hour that may be more usefully employ mr pitt reply in term to the effect follow : -- sir it be my opinion that we time can not be more usefully employ during a war than in examine how it have be conduct and settle the degree of confidence that may be repose in those to whose care be intrust we reputation we fortune and we life there be not any inquiry sir of more importance than this it be not a question about a uncertain privilege or a law which if find inconvenient may hereafter be repeal we be now to examine whether it be probable that we shall preserve we commerce and we independence or whether we be sink into subjection to a foreign power but this inquiry sir will produce no great information if those whose conduct be examine be allow to select the evidence for what account will they exhibit but such as have often already be lay before we and such as they now offer without concern : account obscure and fallacious imperfect and confuse from which nothing can be learn and which can never entitle the minister to praise though they may screen he from punishment mr pelham speak as follow : -- sir i be confident that no man engage in the administration desire to be _ screen _ from the most rigorous inquiry or would defer to exhibit the papers a moment for any other reason than he regard for the publick i be confident that nothing could so much contribute to advance the particular and distinct interest of the ministry as the publication of all the writings that relate to the present war by which it would incontestably appear that nothing have be omit that could promote we success that we commander have be send out with order to act with the utmost vigor and that we preparation have be not disproportion to the importance of we design it will appear that no former ministry have give greater proof of they zeal for the publick interest or have more steadily pursue the most proper measure by which it might be advance i be not indeed certain that those who now call so loudly for information would be prevail on by any degree of evidence to suspend they censure they who be now dissatisfy i shall despair of influence by reason or testimony for they seem to inquire only to condemn nor be this motion perhaps make so much for the sake of obtain information as of harass the ministry with delay and suspend affair of greater importance this motion be agree to and upon another motion make by mr sandy it be resolve that a humble address be present to he majesty that he will be graciously pleased to give direction that there may be lay before this house a copy of the reason send by admiral cavendish in pursuance of a order from the commissioner of the admiralty which have retard the sailing of admiral ogle 's squadron so much beyond expectation likewise that a humble address be present to he majesty that he will be graciously pleased to give direction that there may be lay before this house a copy of the reason transmit by admiral ogle that do prevent he from sail pursuant to he repeated order for that purpose and particularly to those send he by the commissioner of the admiralty house of common feb 3 1740-1 -lrb- debate regard the departure of the french and spanish squadron -rrb- mr sandy this day present a motion in write for petition he majesty to inform they when the regency receive intelligence that the french and spanish squadron sail which be second as follow by mr waller : -- sir the information now move for appear to I so necessary in they deliberation on the conduct of the war that without it we can only conjecture in the dark and entangle ourselves in a inextricable labyrinth it be well know that in war all motion be in a great degree to be regulate by those of the enemy and that therefore no vigilance be to be spare by which any knowledge can be gain of they design nor any method omit of communicate they to those who have the direction of the war a ministry may in conduct military operation disappoint the expectation of they country either by neglect to procure intelligence or by fail to make use of those opportunity which seasonable information put into they power and they may when they design fail of success justify themselves by prove that they be deceive by intelligence which it be reasonable to believe or that better intelligence be not attainable or that they make use however unsuccessfully of all the force that could then be employ and of all the advantage that be then in they possession but how shall we judge of we administration how shall we know what confidence we ought to repose in they prudence and fidelity and what miscarriage be to be attribute to the chance of war or superior force of we enemy if we can not be inform with what diligence they endeavor at information and how early they have notice of the motion of the enemy the sailing or rather escape of the ferrol squadron and departure of the french fleet be the most important event of the present war event that threaten very dangerous consequence no less than descent upon we american colony the conquest of we dominion the slavery of we fellow-subject and perhaps the destruction of the brave vernon who be secure in the imagine vigilance of the other commander and may perhaps in a few day see himself surround by formidable squadron of different nation and expose to the attack of force to which he little fleet bear no proportion nothing appear more evident than that we have opportunity of observe at least all the preparation of the french and of watch the moment of they departure and that we force on the coast of spain be sufficient to have confine they fleet for ever in they harbor or to have destroy they at they first entrance into the open sea of which we may justly inquire why it be not attempt but shall inquire to no purpose till we know when they depart that we may consider the state of we own force and whether we enemy escape by we negligence cowardice or weakness mr winnington then speak to the follow purpose : -- sir that we can not deliberate upon subject which we do not understand and that therefore no necessary or useful information ought to be deny to the house i shall readily admit but must observe at the same time that the reputation of the house would be very little consult in demand information which can not be give to address he majesty to inform we of the time at which the squadron of we enemy sail be to inquire of he what it ought to be the highest care of those prince to conceal from he and which he can only know by have spy in they privy council and of what importance be it to inquire what intelligence be bring he or when he receive it if it appear that he intelligence must be in its own nature uncertain and dubitable that they have leave they port be now certain because they have be twice discover in different part of the world but as we can now only form conjecture on they design and course so before they sail it be impossible to know when they be fully equip or what time be fix for they departure it be to be remember that they form they measure and make they preparation in they own dominion and therefore have more advantage of conceal they scheme than we of discover they mr advocate campbell then speak thus : -- sir this motion which have be represent as unreasonable and absurd be in my opinion not only proper but important it be important because it will enable we to judge upon sufficient foundation of the conduct of the ministry who be censure by the voice of the nation for have be either defective in vigilance or in activity for have be either ignorant by they own fault of the design of the enemy or perfidiously passive in permit the execution of they i be far from believe that such intelligence as we ministry be expect to procure require any uncommon subtilty or any other agent than be always employ by every minister to transmit to they information from foreign court such i be afraid be always hover about we consultation and i know not why we minister should be less diligent or less successful than those of other prince if therefore such intelligence might have be obtain it be criminal not to obtain it and if the departure of the spanish squadron be foresee it ought to be inquire why it be not prevent and if it be only know when it be too late to hinder it from sail why it be not pursue or why succor be not immediately despatch to admiral vernon all these question can only be resolve in consequence of the information which he majesty shall give we and for which it be therefore in my opinion necessary to petition mr henry pelham speak next to this purpose : -- sir how the regency could be inform of the intention of the spaniard to leave they port till it appear by they departure or by what mean it can be expect that he majesty should be now acquaint with they particular course or farther design i confess myself unable to conceive with regard sir to the intelligence transmit from foreign court by agent and spy a little consideration will easily discover that it be not to be trust for what can be generally expect from they but that they should catch fly report or by chance intercept uncertain whisper that they should inquire timorously and therefore for the greatest part of those from whom no satisfactory account can be receive and that they should often endeavor to deserve they salary by such information as be rather please than true all the knowledge that can be obtain of a enemy 's design must arise from a diligent comparison of one circumstance with another and from a general view of he force he interest and he opportunity and that such conjecture will be often erroneous need not be tell probability therefore be in such inquiry all that can be attain and he that sit idle in the time of war expect certain intelligence will see he enemy enjoy the advantage of he folly and lay hold on a thousand opportunity which he have neglect to improve the war in which we be now engage have be carry on by the administration with the utmost diligence and vigor nor have any measure be omit that could probably produce success and the success of the wisest measure be only probable should the great admiral who be now present in the house have meet the french and spaniard in the open sea by what art could he arrive at a certain knowledge of they design he might by he acquaintance with the situation and state of neighbouring country the observation of they course the period of particular wind and other hint of observation form probable conjecture but could never reach to certainty or confidence it seem to I therefore highly improper to petition he majesty for intelligence which he can not be imagine to have receive and i can not agree to any motion for that purpose mr sandy then make another motion to address he majesty that there may be lay before the house copy of all letter receive from or write to admiral vernon since he go to the west indy which be second mr pelham speak to this effect : -- sir this motion if the intention of it be limit by proper restriction be doubtless reasonable and just for the right of this house to examine into the conduct of publick affair and consequently for call for the papers necessary to enlighten they inquiry be not to be dispute but as the end of all such inquiry be the promotion of the publick welfare so they be not to be make in a manner by which that end may be defeat papers be not to be demand which can not be produce without discover we own secret and acquaint we enemy either with that weakness which we ought carefully to conceal or that force which will be most effectually employ if it be not know and therefore no preparation be make to oppose it it can not be imagine but that many of the papers which have pass between the admiralty and the commander in america contain plan for the prosecution of the war observation on the condition of we own colony and perhaps intelligence of the estate of the spanish fortress and town many information of the utmost consequence to we enemy may be collect from those papers but nothing can be expect from they that will enable we to prosecute a senatorial inquiry with more success that will put it in we power to discover fraud negligence or treachery there be sir other papers which may indeed be lay before we without any benefit to we enemy and perhaps with some advantage to ourselves the papers which contain the accompt of we preparation and store the list of we force and the calculation of we expense be the proper subject of senatorial inquiry and if the motion be restrain to those i believe it will not be oppose by any gentleman engage in the administration of we affair i shall beg leave to propose these word may be add so far as the same relate to a supply of ship marine or land force the motion thus amend be agree to house of lord feb 13 1740-1 debate on address he majesty for remove sir robert walpole the opposition which for a long time have be make in the common to the measure of the administration be on this day push to a crisis and produce a motion in both house in the house of lord it occasion the follow debate : lord carteret begin in this manner : -- my lord as the motion which i be about to make be of the highest importance and of the most extensive consequence as it can not but meet with all the opposition which the prejudice of some and the interest of other can raise against it as it must have the whole force of ministerial influence to encounter without any assistance but from justice and reason i hope to be excuse by you lordship for spend some time in endeavor to show that it want no other support that it be not found upon doubtful suspicion but upon uncontestable fact that it be not dictate by private interest but by the sincerest regard to publick happiness not abet by the personal malevolence of particular man but enforce by the voice of the people a voice which ought always to be attend to and generally to be obey to endeavor my lord to remove from place of publick trust all those who appear to want either the virtue or ability necessary for execute they office be the interest of every member of a community and it be not only the interest but the duty of all those who be either by the choice of the people or by the right of birth invest with the power of inspect publick affair and intrust with the general happiness of they country that therefore every motive combine to make it the duty and every argument concur to prove it the privilege of you lordship be too evident to be doubt how often this privilege have be exert by this house and how often it have rescue we country from oppression insolence and rapine how often we constitution have be reanimate and impending ruin be avert by it a superficial acquaintance with history may inform we and we be now call upon by the universal cry of the nation and urge by the perplexed and uncertain state of we foreign affair and declension of we wealth and attack upon we liberty at home to recollect these precedent of magnanimity and justice and to make another effort for the relief of we country this house my lord have proceed against minister whose conduct they disapprove by method of greater or less severity accord to the necessity of affair or the suppose malignity of the crime allege against they and therefore have sometimes think it necessary to deter posterity from imitate they by rigorous censure and exemplary punishment and sometimes have think it sufficient to set the nation free from its distress without inflict any penalty on those by whose misconduct they imagine they produce what be the more violent and vindictive method of proceed it be not necessary with regard to this motion to examine since i shall only propose that we should in imitation of we predecessor in case of this nature humbly address he majesty to remove the minister from he presence and council nothing my lord can be more moderate or tender than such a address by which no punishment be inflict nor any forfeiture exact the minister if he be innocent if he misconduct be only the consequence of he ignorance or incapacity may lay down in peace a office for which nature have not design he enjoy the vast profit of long employment in tranquillity and escape the resentment of a unhappy people who when irritated to the highest degree by a continuation of the same miscarriage may perhaps in the heat of a more malevolent prosecution not sufficiently distinguish between inability and guilt those therefore among you lordship that think he honest but mistaken must willingly agree to a motion like this as the best expedient to appease the people without the ruin of the minister for surely no man who have read the history or be acquaint with the temper of this nation can expect that the people will always bear to see honor favor and preferment distribute by the direction of one universally suspect of corruption and arbitrary measure or will look only with silent envy upon the affluence of those whom they believe to be make great by fraud and plunder swell to insolence by the prosperity of guilt and advance to wealth and luxury by publick misery such of you lordship who join with the people in ascribe we present unhappy state not to the error but to the crime of the minister and who therefore think a bare removal not sufficient to satisfy the demand of justice must doubtless give they consent to the motion for the sake of obtain proper evidence of he wickedness which can not be expect while he stand exalt in prosperity and distribute the riches of the nation and the gift of he sovereign at he own choice while he be in possession of every motive that can influence the mind enforce secrecy and confirm fidelity while he can bribe the avaricious and intimidate the fearful while he can increase the gratification of luxury and enlarge the prospects of ambition for my lord if it be consider from whom this evidence must be draw it will soon appear that no very important discovery can be make but by those whom he have intrust with he secret man whose disregard of virtue recommend they to he favor and who as they be move only by interest will continue faithful while they can hope for recompense but may perhaps be willing to buy they own security by sacrifice they master when they shall see no farther prospect of advantage from serve he or any other method of escape punishment but my lord all must allow this motion to be reasonable whatever they think of the minister 's conduct who be of opinion that a free people have a right of complain when they feel oppression and of address the crown to remove a minister that have incur they universal detestation that such be the condition of the present minister i believe will scarcely be deny or may be discover by those who find themselves incline to doubt it by ask any man whom they shall accidentally meet what be he sentiment on the situation of national affair and of the hand by which they be administer what answer he will receive be well know to most of you lordship let he not be satisfy with a single suffrage let he repeat the question to ten thousand person different in they age they condition and religious opinion in every thing that produce contrariety of disposition and affection he will yet find they unanimous in complain of publick misconduct and in censure one gentleman as the author of it let we not imagine my lord that these accusation and murmur be confine to the lowest class of the people to man whose constant attention to more immediate distress hinder they from make excursion beyond they own employment for though perhaps it might be make evident from the account of past time that no general dissatisfaction even among man of this rank be ever groundless though it might be urge that those who see little can only clamor because they feel themselves oppress and though it might not unseasonably be hint that they be at least formidable for they number and have sometimes execute that justice which they have not interest to procure and trample upon that insolence that have dare to defy they yet i shall not insist upon such motive because it be notorious that discontent be epidemical in all rank and that condition and observation be far from appease it whether the discontent thus general be groundless whether it be raise only by the false insinuation of the disappointed and the wicked art of the envious whether it be in exception to all the maxim of government the first dislike of a administration that ever overspread a nation without just reason deserve to be inquire into in this inquiry my lord it will be necessary to consider not only the state of domestick affair increase or diminution of we debt the security or violation of we liberty the freedom or dependence of we senate and the prosperity or declension of we trade but to examine the state of this nation with regard to foreign power to inquire whether we be equally fear and equally trust now as in former administration whether we alliance have contribute to secure we from we inveterate and habitual enemy or to expose we to they whether the balance of europe be still in we hand and whether during this long interval of peace we power have increase in the same proportion with that of we neighbor france my lord be the constant and hereditary enemy of briton so much divide from she in religion government and interest that they can not both be prosperous together as the influence of one rise that of the other must by consequence decline alliance may form a temporal show of friendship but it can not continue for they situation produce a natural rivalship which every accidental circumstance have contribute to increase long war for many reign after the conquest establish a radical and insuperable hatred between we nor do those war cease till the reformation produce new occasion of jealousy and aversion france be by these reason oblige for many age to employ all she influence and policy in strengthen herself against we by treaty and alliance and in we time have give we a new reason for jealousy by extend she commerce and improve she manufacture it have be therefore my lord the settle principle of every wise administration of every briton whose opinion be not regulate by some other motive than those of reason to attend with the highest degree of vigilance to all the design of the french and oppose with incessant diligence every attempt to increase they force or extend they influence and to check they conquest obstruct they alliance and forestal they trade for this great end it have be we constant endeavor to support the austrian family whose large dominion and numerous force make a counterbalance on the continent to the power of france for this end we enter into a long war of which we still languish under the consequence squander the life of we countryman and mortgage the possession of we posterity for fail in the prosecution of this purpose for leave france too formidable and neglect the interest of the emperor be the treaty of utrecht censure and the author of it prosecute by the present minister but how much he have improve the error of he predecessor to he own advantage how diligent he have be to rectify the miscarriage of they conduct and supply the defect i shall endeavor to explain it be well know my lord that during the regency of the duke of orlean we have nothing to apprehend from french machination he interest a tie which that nation be seldom find to break held he steady to he engagement with we nor be it less known how much he distrust spain and how little by consequence he favor she we have at that time no necessity of anxiously attend to every whisper of the french court which be sufficiently engage in regulate they domestick affair and repair the ruin of a destructive war but my lord we ought to observe that it have be happy for we have we minister labor with equal address at the same employment after the death of this duke the affair of france be restore to they former situation she old scheme be revive she ancient alliance cultivate and she general interest pursue spain be again consider as the power which have the same view with she and which could never rival but might always assist she this alliance my lord be intend to have be unalterably confirm by a marriage but as no human policy can form measure certain of success a irreconcilable hatred be nearly produce by the measure intend to confirm a settle and indissoluble friendship the infanta be send back after she arrival in france a affront which no nation would soon have forget but which the general character and habitual sentiment of the spaniard incline they to resent beyond any other people to any one acquaint with they character in this respect it will readily appear that no other insult or injury could so sensibly affect they or excite so eager a desire of revenge this my lord the sagacity of we minister should have discover this opportunity should have be improve with the utmost care by which spain and france might possibly have be disunite for age and britain have gain such advantage as would have make she the sole arbitress of europe the spaniard be not deficient on they side nor do they neglect to court we friendship but give we the highest proof of they confidence by offer we the sole mediation of they difference with the emperor of germany : but at this time it be that the gentleman whose conduct i be examine obtain the chief influence in we council and by he peculiar penetration discover that nothing be to be do which might give the least offence to the french we therefore refuse to mediate unless french minister might be associate with ours which the spaniard have too much spirit to consent to thus my lord be neglect the first opportunity of form against the french a alliance by which they might have be awed in all they design and by which the peace of europe might have be long preserve the spaniard find that we would not undertake to reconcile they difference with the emperor of germany and continue they abhorrence of french mediator conclude without the intervention of any other power a treaty both of peace and alliance with he imperial majesty this my lord be the famous treaty of vienna the source of so many project and expedient of so much terror and solicitude of such immense expense and perplexed negotiation this treaty a paper innocent and well-meaning which related only to the contracting party keep for some time this nation in alarm in apprehension of conspiracy and expectation of invasion to this treaty have we singly regard we own affair without apply to france for instruction we ought to have accede by which we should have divide the interest of the house of bourbon break the combination of these pontifical power and by improve one lucky incident obtain what we arm and we politick have never hitherto be able to accomplish but the french sensible of they danger and well acquaint with we minister contrived a expedient which indeed would not often have succeed but which be so well adapt to the intellect of this gentleman that it extricate they from all they difficulty they tell we my lord and what be yet more wonderful they prevail upon we to believe that in this dreadful treaty of vienna it be stipulate between the german emperor and spain that they should employ they joint force against britain that they should exalt the pretender to the throne take immediate possession of gibraltar and without mercy debar we for ever from we trade both in spain and in the western indy this he late majesty be advise to assert in he speech from the throne which i desire may be read of which the follow clause be read : my lord and gentleman the distressed condition of some of we religious brethren abroad and the negotiation and engagement enter into by some foreign power which seem to have lay the foundation of new trouble and disturbance in europe and to threaten my subject with the loss of several of the most advantageous branch of they trade oblige I without any loss of time to concert with other power such measure as might give a check to the ambitious view of those who be endeavor to render themselves formidable and put a stop to the farther progress of such dangerous design for these end i have enter into a defensive alliance with the french king and the king of prussium to which several other power and particularly the dutch have be invite to accede and i have not the least reason to doubt of they concurrence this treaty shall in a short time be lay before you by these means and by you support and assistance i trust in god i shall be able not only to secure to my own subject the enjoyment of many valuable rights and privilege long since acquire for they by the most solemn treaty but effectually to preserve the peace and balance of europe the only view and end of all my endeavor it be not to be doubt but the enemy to my government will conceive hope that some favourable opportunity for renew they attempt may offer from the prospect of new trouble and commotion : they be already very busy by they instrument and emissary in those court whose measure seem most to favor they purpose in solicit and promote the cause of the pretender but i persuade myself notwithstanding the countenance and encouragement they may have receive or flatter themselves with the provision you shall make for the safety and defense of the empire will effectually secure I from any attempt from abroad and render all such project vain and abortive when the world shall see that you will not suffer the british crown and nation to be menace and insult those who most envy the present happiness and tranquillity of this empire and be endeavor to make we subservient to they ambition will consider they own interest and circumstance before they make any attempt upon so brave a people strengthen and support by prudent and powerful alliance and though desirous to preserve the peace able and ready to defend themselves against the effort of all aggressor such resolution and such measure timely take i be satisfied be the most effectual means of prevent a war and continue to we the blessing of peace and prosperity who would not have be terrify my lord at a treaty like this we religion be to be destroy we government subvert and we trade reduce to nothing what could a ministry thus intimidate do but resign themselves implicitly to the direction of a kind neighbor that promise to shelter they from the storm there have be minister my lord in former time who upon hear such a representation would have consider that britain be a island that the pretender could not be force upon we without a army and that a army could not be transport without ship that the emperor of germany have neither navy nor port that gibraltar might be easily supply with every thing requisite for its defense and that any attempt make by spain to injure we trade might easily be punish by intercept they plate fleet they would then have consider whether attempt so improbable and stipulation so absurd and ridiculous ought to be credit upon the information of a ambassador 's secretary who as he propose to reveal he master 's secret for a bribe might as probably take another reward for impose upon those whom he pretend to inform those therefore who advise he majesty to assert to the senate what they know from no better authority those whose daring insolence could make they sovereign instrumental in alarming the people with false terror and oppress they with unnecessary burden well deserve to feel a senatorial censure but we minister my lord be too much fright to make such reflection : they imagine that destruction be hang over we and in a dread of arbitrary government oppression and persecution conclude at hanover a treaty with the french thus the french gain we confidence and raise in we a distrust of both the power with whom it be we interest to be unite : but the alliance of the emperor of germany with spain make they still uneasy and therefore they determine once more to make we credulity instrumental in procure a reconciliation between they and the spaniard to effect this they kindly give we intelligence that when the spaniard should receive they treasure from the western indy they design to employ it in favor of the pretender and that therefore it be necessary to intercept it this advice be thankfully listen to a fleet be fit out and thousand be sacrifice without any advantage for the french not only forbore to assist we in the expedition but forbid we to seize the treasure when we have find it the spaniard apprehend themselves attack omit no opportunity of show they resentment they seize we ship and lay siege to gibraltar while we new ally look quietly on and expect the event of they own scheme which be far from be defeat by we policy for the spaniard find the return of they american revenue insuperably obstruct and know that the emperor of germany that emperor who be to invade britain have not any power even to assist they be oblige to have recourse to the nation which they then hate and to forgive the past affront that they might obtain they good office in this exigence but my lord it be not sufficient for the design of the french that they have recover they ancient ally the spaniard unless they could disunite they from the emperor of germany : this it be likewise we interest to prevent and yet this likewise we enable they to effect for they prevail upon we to promise in we stipulation with the spaniard what they have not the least claim to demand that spain instead of neutral troops should be introduce into italy to secure certain succession there to a son of the queen of spain with what reluctance the emperor of germany would consent to see troops place in the province border upon he dominion which would certainly on the first occasion be employ to invade they it be easy to foresee and with what degree of good-will he would regard those by whom they be introduce yet my lord such be the influence of france and so ardent we desire of divert spain from set the pretender upon the throne of britain that we comply at all event without any prospect or promise of advantage thus be the spaniard by be persuade to make this demand and we by grant it bring equally to ill term with the emperor of germany and france be by procure such agreeable condition to the spaniard again consider as they most useful ally that nation my lord be in a very unhappy state which be reduce to admit such term as mediator be pleased to prescribe we dare not refuse the introduction of spanish troops nor durst we introduce they without the emperor of germany 's consent which however he grant at a easy rate for he demand only that we should become guarantee of the pragmatick sanction this we gladly agree to and think ourselves so happy in purchase so cheaply a opportunity of ingratiate ourselves with spain that we desire no other recompense this treaty with the emperor of germany be however by no means improper nor could we after the error which have be commit do any thing more effectual to preserve the balance of europe and reestablish we credit but my lord this only treaty which it be for we interest to make seem to have be make without any intention of observe it for about this time all the northern power be alarm by the approach election of poland and every nation that have any thing either to hope or fear from the event of it endeavor to influence it how this election be determine my lord and by what mean it be unnecessary to relate but it may not be improper to remark that whatever cause we may have to congratulate ourselves upon the choice it do not appear that we have any part in promote it nay as it be not common for minister to keep the best part of they conduct secret there be reason for suspect that they be not altogether without foundation report to have favor france the emperor of germany sensible of he own interest promote the election with vigor and resolution proportion to the greatness of the danger that might have arise from neglect it by this conduct he draw upon himself the resentment of the french who have now a pretence for take measure which might effectually reunite they to spain and as the event show alienate we from the emperor and therefore in vindication of the claim of stanislaus declare war upon germany in conjunction with spain now my lord the emperor learn to set the true value upon he alliance with britain and all europe have a opportunity of remark we spirit we power and we vigilance the troops which we prevail upon he imperial majesty to admit into italy be now draw out of the garrison against he he dominion be attack on each side by formidable enemy and he british ally look with tranquillity and unconcern upon the difficulty into which they have betray he the liberty of europe be endanger by a new combination of the house of bourbon and britain the great protectress of the rights of mankind the great arbitress of the balance of power either neglect or fear to interpose of the event of the war my lord i need only observe that it add new strength to france and contribute to such a union between she and spain as the most artful politician can not hope to dissolve thus my lord whether by negligence ignorance cowardice or treachery it be not easy to determine we be make the instrument of the french policy thus be that power enable by we assistance to retrieve all that she have lose by the ill success of she arm and by she indecent and contemptuous treatment of spain thus be the german emperor dispirited and weaken thus be we deprive at once of we ally and we reputation we loss of reputation the greatest loss that bad measure can bring upon a nation be make evident beyond controversy by the insolence with which the spaniard have treat we while we be flattering enrich and support they while we be fitting out squadron to convey they prince to italy and increase they dominion at we own expense they seem to have consider we good office not as the benefit of friend but the drudgery of slave and therefore could scarcely refrain from insult while they employ we at least when they no longer want we immediate assistance they renew they contempt and cruelty they robbery and oppression they prescribe law to we navigation and lay claim to we colony to these ravages and injury what do we oppose what but humble intreaty pacifick negotiation and idle remonstrance instead of assert we just claim and incontestable possession instead of prevent war by threaten it and secure ourselves from a second injury by punish the first we amuse ourselves with inquiry demand representation and dispute till we become the jest of that nation which it be in we power to distress by intercept they treasure and to reduce to term almost without bloodshed thus my lord do we proceed new question ever arise and the controversy become more intricate commissary be despatch to spain who return without obtain either restitution or security and in the mean time no opportunity be neglect of plunder we merchant and insulting we flag : account of new confiscation and of new cruelty daily arrive the nation be enraged and the senate itself alarm and we minister at length awaken from they tranquillity send order to the envoy at the spanish court to expedite a accommodation these direction be immediately obey and produce the celebrated convention what be give up or what be endanger by this detestable treaty you lordship have often have occasion to observe and the consequence of it be so obvious that the nation be astonished every man see that we be either treacherously betray by we own ministry or that the minister be almost the only man in the kingdom utterly unacquainted with we claim we injury and we danger a war could now no longer be avoid it be not in the power of the ministry any longer to refuse to send out we fleet and make a appearance of hostile measure but they have still some expedient remain to shelter the spaniard from we resentment and to make they country yet more contemptible : they could contrive such order for they admiral as should prevent they from destroy they enemy with too little mercy and if any one be suspect of intention less pacifick there be method of equip he fleet in such a manner as would effectually frustrate he scheme of revenge reprisal and destruction these my lord be not the murmur of the disappointed nor the insinuation of the factious it be well know to we countryman and to we enemy how ill admiral vernon be furnish with naval and military store and how little he importunate demand of a supply be regard what opportunity be lose and what advantage neglect may be conjecture from the success of he inconsiderable force a very little reflection on the situation and state of those country will easily satisfy you lordship how far a small body of land-force might have penetrate what treasure they might have gain and what consternation they might have spread over the whole spanish america that we squadron in the mediterranean have be at least useless that they have sail from point to point and from one coast to another only to display the bulk of we ship and to show the opulence of we nation can require no proof : i wish my lord there be less reason for suspect that they act in concert with we enemy that they retire from before they port only to give they a opportunity of escape and that they in reality connive at some attempt which they be in appearance send to prevent there be some miscarriage in war my lord which every reasonable man impute to chance or to cause of which the influence could not be foresee there be other that may justly be term the consequence of misconduct but of misconduct involuntary and pardonable of a disregard perhaps of some circumstance of a affair produce by too close a attention to other but there be miscarriage too for which candor itself can find no excuse and of which no other cause can be assign than cowardice or treachery from the suspicion of one the past action of the admiral who command we fleet in those sea will secure he but i know not whether there be now any that will attempt to clear the minister 's character from the imputation of the other all the insolence of the spaniard a nation by no means formidable be the consequence of the reunion of the house of bourbon a reunion which could not easily have be accomplish but by the instrumental office of we ministry whom therefore the nation have a right to charge with the diminution of its honor and the decay of its trade nor have we trade my lord be only contract and obstruct by the piracy of spain but have be suffer to languish and decline at home either by criminal negligence or by they complaisance for france which have give rise to we other calamity the state of we woollen manufacture be well know and those whose indolence or love of pleasure keep they stranger to the other misfortune of they country must yet have be acquaint with this by the daily account of riot and insurrection raise by those who have be employ in that manufacture can provide for they family by no other business and be make desperate by the want of bread we be tell my lord by all party and tell with truth that we manufacture decline because the french have engross most of the foreign market and it be not deny even by those whose interest it might be to ' deny it that the cloth which they ruin we by vend be make of we own wool which they be suffer to procure either by the folly of a unskilful or the connivance of a treacherous administration if we own manufacture my lord have be carefully promote if the whole influence of we government have be make to cooperate with the industry of we trader there have always be such a demand for we wool that they could not have afford to purchase it at a price equivalent to the danger of export it : and if any means be now steadily practice to prevent the exportation we trade must consequently revive because cloth be one of the necessaries of life which other nation must have from britain when france can no longer supply they but my lord notwithstanding the decay of trade we expense have never be contract we have squander million in idle preparation and ostentatious folly we have equip fleet which never leave the harbor and raise army which be never to behold any other enemy than the honest trader and husbandman that support they we have indeed hear many reason allege for oppress the empire with stand troops which can have little effect upon those who have no interest to promote by admit they : sometimes we be in danger of invasion though it be not easy to imagine for what purpose any prince should invade a nation which he may plunder at pleasure without the least apprehension of resentment and which will resign any of its rights whenever they shall be demand : sometimes as we have already hear the pretender be to be set upon the throne by a sudden descent of army from the cloud and sometimes the licentiousness and disobedience of the common people require the restraint of a standing army that the people be to the last degree exasperate and inflamed i be far from intend to deny but surely they have yet be guilty of no outrage so enormous as to justify so severe a punishment they have generally confine themselves to harmless complaint or at least to execution in effigy the people my lord be enraged because they be impoverished and to prevent the consequence of they anger they poverty be increase by new burden and aggravate by the sight of a useless despicable herd support by they industry for no other purpose than to insult they by these useless armament and military farce we tax my lord have be continue without diminish we debt and the nation seem condemn to languish for ever under its present misery which by furnish employment to a boundless number of commissioner officer and slave to the court under a thousand denomination by diffuse dependence over the whole country and enlarge the influence of the crown be too evidently of use to the minister for we to entertain any hope of he intention to relieve we let it not be boast that nine million be pay when a new debt of seven million appear to be contract nothing be more easy than to clear debt by borrow or to borrow when a nation be mortgage for the payment but the weight of the present tax my lord though heavier than be perhaps ever support by any nation for so long a time tax greater than ever be pay to purchase neither conquest nor honor neither to prevent invasion from abroad nor to quell rebellion at home be not the most flagrant charge of this wonderful administration which not contented with most exorbitant exaction contrive to make they yet more oppressive by tyrannical method of collection with what reason the author of the excise scheme dread the resentment of the nation be sufficiently obvious but surely in a virtuous and benevolent mind the first sentiment that would have arise on that occasion would not have be motion of anger but of gratitude a whole nation be condemn to slavery they remonstrance be neglect they petition ridicule and they detestation of tyranny treat as disaffection to the established government and yet the author of this horrid scheme riot in affluence and triumph in authority and without fear as without shame lift up he head with confidence and security how much my lord be the forbearance of that people to be admire whom such attack as these have not provoke to transgress the bound of they obedience who have continue patiently to hope for legal method of redress at a time when they see themselves threaten with legal slavery when they see the legislative power establish only for they protection influence by all possible method of corruption to betray they to the mercy of the ministry for that corruption have find its way into one of the house of the legislature be universally believe and without scruple maintain by every man in the nation who be not evidently restrain from speak as he think and that any man can even be of a different opinion that any man can even affirm that he think otherwise would be in any other age the subject of astonishment that a immense revenue be divide among the member of the other house by known salary and publick employment be apparent that large sum be privately scatter on press exigency that some late transaction of the ministry be not confirm but at a high price the present condition of the civil list a civil list vastly superior to all the know expense of the crown make highly probable that the common themselves suspect the determination of they assembly to be influence by some other motive than justice and truth be evident from the bill this day send hither for we concurrence and surely no aggravation can be add to the crime of that man who have patronise we enemy and give up we navigation sink he country into contempt abroad and into poverty at home plunder the people and corrupt the legislature but my lord the minister have not only contribute by he wickedness or he ignorance to the present calamity but have apply all he art and all he interest to remove from post of honor and trust to banish from the court and to exclude from the legislature all those whose counsel might contribute to restore the publick affair without any regard to the popularity of they character the usefulness of they talent or the importance of they past service to the crown have any of these consideration prevail we have not see the greatest general in britain dispossessed of all he preferment dispossess at a time when we be at war with one nation and in expectation of be attack by another far more powerful which will doubtless be encourage by he removal to more daring contempt and more vigorous measure what be the motive of this procedure it be easy to discover as he open defense of the present royal family in the late rebellion exempt he from the imputation of be disaffected to the crown the only crime with which he can be charge be disaffection to the minister perhaps my lord the minister may have determine to have no need of general in he transaction with foreign power but in proportion as he rely less upon the sword he must depend more upon the art of peaceable negotiation and surely there have be another person dismiss from he employment whose counsel it have be no reproach to have ask and to have follow the nature of my motion my lord make it not necessary to produce evidence of these fact it be sufficient that any minister be universally suspect for when do a innocent man support by power and furnish with every advantage that could contribute to exalt or preserve he character incur the general hatred of the people but if it could ever happen by a combination of unlucky accident what could be more for the happiness of himself he master and the nation than that he should retire and enjoy the consciousness of he own virtue he own interest in such a retirement i have already consider and that both of the prince and the people be no less apparent : while a hate minister be employ the king will always be distrust by the nation and surely nothing can so much obstruct the publick happiness as a want of confidence in those who be intrust with its preservation that common fame be in this case sufficient will not be question when it be consider that common fame be never without a foundation in fact that it may spread disquiet and suspicion over all the kingdom and that the satisfaction of million be very cheaply purchase by the degradation of one man who be exalt only for they benefit the objection that there be no sole minister will create no greater difficulty if there be many concerned in these transaction _ respondeat superior : _ but it be too apparent that there be in reality one whose influence be greater than that of any other private man and who be arrive at a height not consistent with the nature of the british government it be uncontested that there be one man to whom the people impute they misery and by whose removal they will be appease the affair of europe my lord will probably be so much embarrassed and the struggle between the different design of its prince be so violent that they will demand all we attention and employ all we address and it will be to the highest degree dangerous to be distract at the same time with apprehension of domestick trouble yet such be the present unhappy state of this nation and such be the general discontent of the people that tranquillity adherence to the government and submission to the law can not reasonably be hope unless the motion i shall now take leave to make you lordship be comply with : and i move that a humble address be present to he majesty most humbly to advise and beseech he majesty that he will be most graciously pleased to remove the right honorable sir robert walpole knight of the most noble order of the blue riband first commissioner of he majesty 's treasury and chancellor of the exchequer and one of he majesty 's most honorable privy council from he majesty 's presence and council for ever he be second by lord abingdon in the follow manner : -- my lord the copiousness and perspicuity with which the noble lord have lay down the reason of he motion make it neither easy nor necessary to enlarge upon they i shall therefore only offer to you lordship a few thought upon the authority of common fame as the evidence upon which the motion be in part found that all the miscarriage of we late measure be by common fame imputed to one man i suppose will not be deny nor can it in my opinion be reasonably require that in the present circumstance of thing any other proof should be bring against he common fame my lord be admit in court of law as a kind of auxiliary or supplemental evidence and be allow to corroborate the cause which it appear to favor the general regard which every wise man have for he character be a proof that in the estimation of all mankind the testimony of common fame be of too great importance to be disregard if we consider the nature of popular opinion on publick affair it will be difficult to imagine by what mean a persuasion not found on truth should universally take possession of a people it will be yet more difficult to believe that it should preserve its empire and that in opposition to every art that can be make use of to undeceive they they should pertinaciously adhere to a error not imbibe in they education nor connect with they interest and how have any man be originally prejudice against the present minister or what passion or interest can any man gratify by imagine or declare he country on the verge of ruin the multitude my lord censure and praise without dissimulation nor be ever accuse of disguise they sentiment they voice be at least the voice of honesty and have be term the voice of heaven by that party of which those affect to be think whom it now condemn let it not be urge that the people be easily deceive that they think and speak merely by caprice and applaud or condemn without any calm inquiry or settle determination these censure be applicable only to sudden tumult and gust of zeal excite by fallacious appearance or by the alarm of a false report industriously disseminate but have no relation to opinion gradually propagate and slowly receive if the credulity of the people expose they to so easy a admission of every report why have the writer for the minister find so little credit why have all the loud declamation and the labored argument the artful insinuation and positive assertion which have be for many year circulate round the nation at the expense of the government produce no effect upon the people nor convinced any man who be not apparently bribe to resign he private opinion to that of he patron whence come it my lord that falsehood be more successful than truth and that the nation be incline to complain rather than to triumph it be well know that the people have be charge in all former age with be too much dazzle by the glitter of fortune and the splendor of success and bestow they applause not accord to the degree of merit but prosperity the minister my lord have defeat he opponent in almost all they attempt he friend have sound victory every session and yet the people declare against he he adversary have retire into the country with all the vexation of disappointment and have be reward for they unsuccessful effort with general acclamation what be it my lord but the power of truth that can preserve the vanquish from ridicule and influence the nation to believe they the only patron of they commerce and liberty in opposition to all the writer and voter for the ministry if we consult history my lord how seldom do we find a innocent minister overwhelm with infamy innocent man have sometimes be destroy by the hasty fury but scarcely ever by the settle hatred of the populace even that fury have generally be kindle by real grievance though imputed to those who have no share in produce they but when the tempest of they first rage have subside they have seldom refuse to hear truth and to distinguish the patriot from the oppressor but though it should be acknowledge my lord that the people have be blind by false representation and that some cause yet undiscover some influence which never have be know to operate in any state before hinder they from behold they own felicity yet as publick happiness be the end of government and no man can be happy that think himself miserable it be in my opinion necessary to the honor of he majesty and to the tranquillity of the nation that you lordship should agree to the present motion the duke of newcastle answer to this effect : -- my lord it be not without wonder that i hear a motion so uncommon and important a motion which may be reasonably suppose to have be long premeditated and of which such affect expectation have be raise so weakly support by evidence i can not think that any other attestation be needful for the vindication of the right honorable gentleman whose conduct be this day to be examine than the declaration of the noble lord that there appear no positive evidence against he the pretence that no evidence can be expect while he continue in he present station be too openly fallacious to impose upon you lordship for why should he influence be greater and he power less resistible than that of other minister who be well know to have find accuser in the height of they authority and to have be drag to punishment almost from behind the throne it be sufficiently know that during the continuance of this administration many have be dismiss from they employment who appear not altogether unaffected with the loss and from whose resentment a discovery of wicked measure might be reasonably expect as they acquaintance with the secret of the government must have give opportunity of detect they if therefore no particular crime be charge upon he if he enemy confine themselves to obscure surmise and general declamation we may reasonably conclude that he behavior have be at least blameless for what can be a higher encomium than the silence of those who have make it the business of year to discover something that might be allege against he on the day of trial i suppose that no man can question the penetration of those noble lord who have open this debate and i my lord shall be very far from insinuate that cowardice suppress any of they sentiment as the highest reproach that can be throw upon any man be to suggest that he speak what he do not think the next degree of meanness would be to think what he dare not speak when the publick voice of he country call upon he when therefore popular report be allege as the foundation of the address it be probable that it be not found in reality upon known crime or attest fact and if the sudden blast of fame may be esteem equivalent to attest accusation what degree of virtue can confer security that the clamor be so loud and so general as it be represent i can discover no necessity of admit but however the populace may have be exasperate against he we be surely not to be influence by they complaint without inquire into the cause of they and inform ourselves whether they proceed from real hardship unnecessary severity and calamity too heavy to be bear or from caprice and inconstancy idle rumor and artful representation i very readily allow my lord that nothing have be leave unattempted that might fill the people with suspicion and discontent that inevitable calamity have be imputed to misconduct or to treachery and even the inconstancy of the wind and severity of the weather charge upon the right honorable gentleman the daily libel that be in every man 's hand be a standing evidence and though i should grant that the people never complain without cause and that they burden be always heavy before they endeavor to shake they off yet it will by no means follow that they do not sometimes mistake the cause of they misery and impute they burden to the cruelty of those whose utmost application be employ to lighten they common fame be therefore my lord no sufficient ground for such a censure as this a censure that condemn a man long verse in high employment long honor with the confidence of he sovereign and distinguish by the friendship of the most illustrious person in the nation to infamy and contempt unheard and even unaccused for he against whom nothing be produce but general charge support by the evidence of common fame may be justly esteem to be free from accusation that other evidence will appear against he when he shall be reduce in consequence of we agree to this motion to the level with he fellow-subject that all information be now preclude by the terror of resentment or the expectation of favor have be insinuate by the noble lord who make the motion : whether he insinuation be found only upon conjecture whether it be one of those vision which be raise by hope in a warm imagination or upon any private information communicate to he lordship i pretend not to determine but if we may judge from the known conduct of the opposition if we consider they frequent triumph before the battle and they chimerical scheme of discovery or prosecution and punishment they constant assurance of success upon the approach of a new contest and they daily prediction of the ruin of the administration we can not but suspect that man so long accustom to impose upon themselves and flatter one another with fallacious hope may now likewise be dream of intelligence which they never will receive and amusing themselves with suspicion which they have no reasonable expectation of see confirm and to confess the truth my lord if i may be allow in imitation of these patron of they country to indulge my own imagination and presume to look forward to the future conduct of those who have exert such unwearied industry in they attempt upon the administration and so long pursue the right honorable gentleman with inquiry examination rhetorick and ridicule i can not but find myself incline to question whether after they motion shall have be receive in this house and they petition grant by he majesty they will very solicitously inquire after evidence or be equally diligent in the discovery of truth as in the persecution of the minister i be afraid my lord that they will be too deeply engage in the care of make a dividend of the plunder in just proportion to find leisure for pursuit of the enemy and that the sight of vacant post large salary and extensive power will revive some passion which the love of they country have not yet wholly extinguish and leave in they attention no room for deep reflection and intricate inquiry there have formerly my lord be patriot who upon a sudden advancement to a place of profit have be immediately lull into tranquillity learn to repose a implicit confidence in the minister forget to harangue threaten inquire and protest and spend the remain part of they life in the harmless amusement of count they salary perquisite and gratuity how great my lord would be the disappointment of the people that unhappy people which have be long neglect and oppress which so justly detest the minister and call so loudly for vengeance when they shall see they defender remit the vigor of the pursuit when once the minister fly before they and instead of drive he into exile contend about he place unhappy then surely my lord would the nation be : the administration we be tell be already universally abhor and its hope be only in the opposition but should the zeal of the patriot once grow cold should they discover to the publick that they have be labor not for general liberty but for private advantage that they be enemy to power only because it be not in they hand and disapprove the measure of the government only because they be not consult how inevitably must the people then sink into despair how certain must they then imagine they destruction it seem therefore my lord equally prudent and just to reject this motion till better proof shall be bring to support it lest by comply with it we should heighten rather than appease the discontent of the people lest we should too soon deprive they of they only consolation and expose the patriot to censure without vindicate the ministry in my opinion my lord all who have approve the conduct of the present ministry must necessarily join in reject the motion as cruel and unequitable and incline to support a just and continue a wise administration and all those whom the restless clamor of the opposite party have persuade to regard they as arbitrary corrupt and perfidious must if they be true friend to they country and steady exacter of justice resolve to defer they compliance in order to bring to light the evidence necessary for a legal conviction and severer punishment that these evidence will never be find and that therefore no legal punishment will ever be inflict we may reasonably collect from the injustice of the labored charge which you lordship have now hear a charge draw up with all the assistance of senatorial and political knowledge and display with all the power of eloquence a collection of every occurrence for many year of which any circumstance could be show in a unfavourable light and a recapitulation of all the measure which have miscarry by unforeseen event or which the populace have be persuade to dislike in the administration of government my lord many measure reasonable and just plan out in pursuance of a very exact knowledge of the state of thing then present and very probable conjecture concern future event have yet fail to produce the success which be expect they have be sometimes defeat by the inconstancy or dishonesty of those who be equally engage in they and sometimes frustrate by accident of which only providence have the disposal it will even be allow my lord that the ministry have be sometimes mistake in they conjecture and perhaps deceive by they intelligence but i will presume to say it never will be discover that they willingly betray or heedlessly neglect they trust that they ever oppress they country with unnecessary burden or expose it to be insult by foreign power nor will it perhaps be find that they ever appear grossly ignorant of the publick interest or fail to discover any obvious truth or foresee any probable contingency but my lord i be willing to confess that they can not judge of event to come with such unerring and demonstrative knowledge as they opponent can obtain of they after they have happen and they be incline to pay all necessary deference to the great sagacity of those wonderful prognosticator who can so exactly _ foresee _ the _ past _ they only hope my lord that you will consider how much harder they task be than that of they enemy they be oblige to determine very often upon doubtful intelligence and a obscure view of the design and inclination of the neighbouring power and as they informer may be either treacherous or mistaken and the interest of other state be subject to alteration they may be sometimes deceive and disappoint but they opponent my lord be exempt by they employment from the laborious task of search into futurity and collect they resolution from a long comparison of dark hint and minute circumstance they business be not to lead or show the way but to follow at a distance and ridicule the perplexity and aggravate the mistake of they guide they be only to wait for consequence which if they be prosperous they misrepresent as not intend or pass over in silence and be glad to hide they from the notice of mankind but if any miscarriage arise they penetration immediately awake they see at the first glance the fatal source of all we misery they be astonish at such a concatenation of blunder and alarm with the most distracting apprehension of the danger of they country accusation of political measure be a easy province easy my lord in the same proportion as the administration of affair be difficult for where there be difficulty there will be some mistake and where there be mistake there will be occasion of triumph to the factious and the disappointed but the justice of you lordship will certainly distinguish between error and crime and between error of weakness and inability and such as be only discoverable by consequence i may add my lord that you wisdom will easily find the difference between the degree of capacity requisite for recollect the past and foreknow the future and expect that those whose ambition incite they to endeavor after a share in the government of they country should give better proof of they qualification for that high trust than mere specimen of they memory they rhetorick or they malice even the noble lord who must be confess to have show a very extensive acquaintance with foreign affair and to have very accurately consider the interest and disposition of the prince of europe have yet fail in the order of time and by one error very much invalidate he charge of misconduct in foreign affair the treaty of vienna my lord be not produce by the rejection of the infanta unless a treaty that be make before it could be the consequence of it so that there be no such opportunity throw into we hand as the noble lord have be please to represent spain have discover herself we enemy and we enemy in the highest degree before the french provoke she by that insult and therefore how much soever she might be enrage against france there be no prospect that she would favor we nor could we have court she alliance without the lowest degree of meanness and dishonor see then my lord this atrocious accusation found upon false date upon a preposterous arrangement of occurrence behold it vanish into smoke at the approach of truth and let this instance convince we how easy it be to form chimerical blunder and impute gross folly to the wisest administration how easy it be to charge other with mistake and how difficult to avoid they but we be tell my lord that the danger of the confederacy at vienna be merely imaginary that no contract be make to the disadvantage of we dominion or of we commerce and that if the weakness of the spaniard and german have contrived such a scheme it would soon have be discover by they to be a airy dream a plan impossible to be reduce to execution we have be amuse my lord on this occasion with great profusion of mirth and ridicule and have receive the consolation of hearing that britain be a island and that a island be not to be invade without ship we have be inform of the nature of the king 's territory and of the natural strength of the fortress of gibraltar but the noble lord forget that though britain have no dominion on the continent yet we sovereign have there a very extensive country which though we be not to make war for the sake of strengthen or enlarge it we be surely to defend when we have draw a invasion upon it the weakness of the spaniard my lord have be also much enlarged upon but the strength of the jacobite at home have be pass over in silence though it be apparent how easily the pretender might have land here and with what warmth he cause would have be espouse not only by those whose religion avowed and profess make they the enemy of the present royal family but by many whom prospects of interest the love of novelty and rage of disappointment might have incline to a change that no such stipulation be make by that treaty that no injury be intend to we commerce nor any invasion propose in favor of the pretender be very bold assertion and though they could be support by all the evidence that negative admit of yet will not easily be believe by you lordship in opposition to the solemn assurance of he late majesty it be evident from this instance how much prejudice prevail over argument they be ready to condemn the right honorable gentleman to whom they give the title of sole minister upon the suffrage of common fame yet will not acquit he upon the testimony of the king himself but my lord the argument allege to prove the improbability of such a confederacy be so weak in themselves that they require no such illustrious evidence to overbalance they for upon what be they found but upon the impossibility of execute such design it be well know my lord how differently different party consider the same cause the same design and the same state of affair every man be partial in favor of he own equity strength and sagacity who can show that the same false opinion of they own power and of we intestine division which now prompt the spaniard to contend with we might not then incite they to invade we or at least to countenance the attempt of one whom they be industriously teach to believe the greatest part of the nation be ready to receive that they might have injure we trade be too evident from we present experience and that they would have support the ostend company which they espouse in a open manner be undeniable nor be it in the least unlikely that elated with the certain power of do much mischief and with the imaginary prospects of far greater effect they might engage in a confederacy and farther attempt against we i be far from imagine my lord that it be in the power of the german and spaniard unite to force the pretender upon we though we have stand alone against they but the impossibility of succeed in they design be not then so apparent to they as it be at present to we they have many reason to wish and therefore would not be long without some to believe it practicable and it be not the danger but the insult that determine he late majesty to enter into a alliance with france war my lord be always to be avoid if the possession and reputation of a people can be preserve without it it be therefore more eligible to oblige they to lay aside they scheme while it be yet only in idea than to defeat it in its execution and a alliance with france effectually restrain the emperor as we fleet in america reduce the spaniard to desire peace why we do not seize the cargo of the galleon have be often ask and as often such answer have be return as ought to satisfy any rational examiner we do not seize they my lord because a larger part belong to other nation than to the spaniard and because the interest of we trade make it convenient not to exasperate the spaniard so far as to render a reconciliation very difficult in the term of this reconciliation my lord it be charge upon the ministry that they be guilty of contribute to the power of the house of bourbon by stipulate that spain instead of neutral troops should be introduce into italy that those troops be less agreeable to the emperor can not be deny but it have already be show how little reason we have to consult he satisfaction and with regard to the advantage gain by the french and spaniard in the late war a very small part of they can be ascribe to six thousand troops with as little reason my lord be the charge advance of neglect to preserve the balance of europe by decline to assist the emperor against the french for the intention of the war seem to have be rather revenge than conquest and the emperor rather exchange than lose he dominion that we decline engage too far in the affair of the continent proceed my lord from a regard to the trade of the nation which be not only suspend and interrupt during the time of war but often throw into another channel out of which it be the business of many year to recover it nor have the ministry my lord deviate from they regard to trade in they transaction with spain which have be the subject of so much clamor and such pathetick declamation they always know what the nation now feel that the merchant would suffer much more from a war than from piracy and depredation which however they be far from submit to and for which they constantly make demand of satisfaction to these demand they receive such answer as if they have be sincere would have leave the nation no room to complain but when it be discover that nothing but verbal satisfaction be to be expect the security of we trade and the honor of we country demand that war should be declare the conduct of the war my lord have be frequently the subject of censure we be tell of the inactivity of one fleet and the imperfect equipment of another the escape of we enemy and the interception of we trading ship war my lord be confess to be uncertain and ill success be not always the consequence of bad measure : naval war be by the nature of the element on which they be to be conduct more uncertain than any other so that though it can not but be suspect that the common people will murmur at any disappointment call every misfortune a crime and think themselves betray by the ministry if spain be not reduce in a single summer it might be reasonably hope that man enlighten by a long familiarity with the account of past and instruct by personal experience in national transaction will produce stronger argument than want of success when they charge the ministry with misconduct in war but my lord they have not any misfortune to complain of nor be the accusation that we have be defeat ourselves but that we have not enough molest we enemy of this my lord it be not easy to judge at a distance from the scene of action and without a more accurate knowledge of a thousand minute circumstance which may promote or retard a naval expedition it be undoubtedly true my lord that many of we merchant ship have be take by the enemy but it be not certain that they do not murmur equally that they have be obstruct in they commerce and have be so little able to interrupt ours since they have so many advantage from the situation of they coast when we reckon those that be lose let we not forget to number those that have escape if admiral vernon 's fleet be ill provide with arm and ammunition even then let all censure be suspend till it can be prove that it be ill furnish by the fault of the ministry nothing be more common my lord in all naval war than sudden change of fortune for on many occasion a accidental gust of wind or unexpected darkness of the weather may destroy or preserve a fleet from destruction or may make the most formidable armament absolutely useless and in the present disposition of some people towards the ministry i should not wonder to hear a alteration of wind charge upon they for what objection may they not expect my lord when all the disadvantage which the nation suffer from the enemy of he majesty be imputed to they when daily endeavor be use to make they suspect of favor arbitrary power for maintain a army which nothing have make necessary but the struggle of those man whose principle have no other tendency than to enslave they country let not we domestick animosity be keep alive and foment by a constant opposition to every design of the administration nor we foreign enemy incite by the observation of we division to treat we with insolence interrupt we trade prescribe bound to we dominion and threaten we with invasion -- and the army may safely be disband for the ministry my lord be not conscious of have consult any thing but the happiness of the nation and have therefore no apprehension of publick resentment nor want the protection of a armed force they desire only the support of the law and to they they willingly appeal from common fame and unequitable charge i mention the ministry my lord because i be unacquainted with any man who either claim or possess the power or title of sole minister i own in my province no superior but he majesty and be willing and ready to answer any charge which relate to that part of the publick business which i have have the honor to transact or direct a great part of what i have now offer be therefore no otherwise necessary on the present occasion than because silence might have appear like a consciousness of misconduct and have afford a new subject of airy triumph to the enemy of the administration for very few of the transaction which have be so severely censure fall under the particular inspection of the right honorable gentleman against whom the motion be level he be not otherwise concern in counselling or in ratify than as one of he majesty 's privy council and therefore though they should be defective i do not see how it be reasonable or just that he should be single out from the rest for disgrace or punishment the motion therefore my lord appear to I neither found on fact nor law nor reason nor any better grounds than popular caprice and private malevolence if it be contrary to law to punish without proof if it be not agreeable to reason that one should be censure for the offence of another if it be necessary that some crime should be prove before any man can suffer as a criminal then my lord i be convince that you lordship will be unanimous in reject the motion the duke of argyle speak next as follow : -- my lord if we will obstinately shut we eye against the light of conviction if we will resolutely admit every degree of evidence that contribute to support the cause which we be incline to favor and to reject the plainest proof when they be produce against it to reason and debate be to little purpose : as no innocence can be safe that have incur the displeasure of partial judge so no criminal that have the happiness of be favor by they can ever be in danger that any lord have already determine how to vote on the present occasion far be it from I to assert : may it never my lord be suspect that private interest blind adherence to a party personal kindness or malevolence or any other motive than a sincere and unmingled regard for the prosperity of we country influence the decision of this assembly for it be well know my lord that authority be found on opinion when once we lose the esteem of the publick we vote while we shall be allow to give they will be only empty sound to which no other regard will be pay than a standing army shall enforce the veneration of the people my lord will not easily be lose : this house have a kind of hereditary claim to they confidence and respect the great action of we ancestor be remembered and contribute to the reputation of they successor nor do we countryman willingly suspect that they can be betray by the descendant of those by whose bravery and counsel they have be rescue from destruction but esteem must languish and confidence decline unless they be renew and reanimate by new act of beneficence and the higher expectation the nation may have form of we penetration to discover its real advantage and of we steadiness to pursue they the more violent will be its resentment if it shall appear on this important question that we be either ignorant or timorous that we be unconcerned at the misery of the people or content ourselves with pity what we ancestor never fail to redress let we therefore my lord for we own interest attend impartially to the voice of the people let we hear they complaint with tenderness and if at last we reject they let it be evident that they be impartially hear and that we only differ from they because we be not convince even then my lord we shall suffer for some time under the suspicion of crime from which i hope we shall always be free the people will imagine that we be influence by those whose interest it appear to continue they misery and my lord all the consolation that will be leave we must arise from the consciousness of have do we duty but my lord this be to suppose what i believe no history can furnish a example of it be to conceive that we may inquire diligently after the true state of national affair and yet not discover it or not be able to prove it by such evidence as may satisfy the people the people my lord however they be misrepresent by those who from a long practice of treat they with disregard have learn to think and speak of they with contempt be far from be easily deceive and yet farther from be easily deceive into a opinion of they own unhappiness : we have some instance of general satisfaction and a unshaken affection to the government in time when the publick good have not be very diligently consult but scarcely any of perpetual murmur and universal discontent where there have be plain evidence of oppression negligence or treachery let we not therefore my lord think of the people as of a herd to be lead or drive at pleasure as wretch whose opinion be found upon the authority of seditious scribbler or upon any other than that of reason and experience let we not suffer they to be at once oppressed and ridicule nor encourage by we example the wretched advocate for those whom they consider as they enemy nor represent they as impute to the misconduct of the ministry the late contrariety of the wind and severity of the winter the people my lord if they be mistake in they charge be mistake with such evidence on they side as never mislead any nation before not only they reason but they sens must have betray they and those mark of certainty that have hitherto establish truth must have combine in the support of falsehood they be persuade my lord too firmly persuade to yield up they opinion to rhetorick or to vote or any proof but demonstration that there be a _ first _ or to speak in the language of the nation a _ sole _ minister one that have the possession of he sovereign 's confidence and the power of exclude other from he presence one that exalt and degrade at he pleasure and distribute for he own purpose the revenue of he master and the treasure of the nation of this my lord can it be maintain that they have no proof can this be term a chimerical suspicion which nothing can be produce to support how can power appear but by the exercise of it what can prove any degree of influence or authority but universal submission and acknowledgment and surely my lord a very transient survey of the court and its dependent must afford sufficient conviction that this man be consider by all that be engage in the administration as the only disposer of honor favor and employment attend to any man my lord who have lately be prefer reward or caress you will hear no expression of gratitude but to that _ man _ no other benefactor be ever hear of the royal bounty itself be forget and unmentioned nor be any return of loyalty fidelity or adherence profess but to the minister the minister a term which however lately introduce be now in use in every place in the kingdom except this house preferment my lord whether civil ecclesiastical or military be either wholly in he hand or those who make it the business of they life to discover the high road to promotion be universally deceive and be daily offer they adoration to a empty phantom that have nothing to bestow for no sooner be any man infect with avarice or ambition no sooner be extravagance reduce to beg new supplies from the publick or wickedness oblige to seek for shelter than this man be apply to and honor conscience and fortune offer at he foot do either those whose study and station give they a claim to advancement in the church or those whose bravery and long service entitle they to more honorable post in the army do either those who profess to understand the law of they own country or they who declare themselves verse in the interest and transaction of foreign power apply to any other man for promotion or employment he might then indeed be call the _ chief _ but not properly the _ sole _ minister but it be well know my lord many of we know it too well that whatever be the profession or the ability of any person there be no hope of encouragement or reward by any other method than that of application to this man that he shall certainly be disappoint who shall attempt to rise by any other interest and whoever shall dare to depend on he honesty bravery diligence or capacity or to boast any other merit than that of implicit adherence to he measure shall inevitably lie neglect and obscure for this reason my lord every one whose calmness of temper can enable he to support the sight without start of indignation and sally of contempt may daily see at the levee of this great man what i be ashamed to mention a mixture of man of all rank and all profession of man whose birth and title ought to exalt they above the meanness of cringe to a mere child of fortune man whose study ought to have teach they that true honor be only to be gain by steady virtue and that all other art all the low application of flattery and servility will terminate in contempt disappointment and remorse this scene my lord be daily to be view it be ostentatiously display to the sight of mankind the minister amuse himself in publick with the splendor and number and dignity of he slave and he slave with no more shame pay they prostration to they master in the face of day and boast of they resolution to gratify and support he and yet my lord it be inquire why the people assert that there be a _ sole _ minister those who deny my lord that there be a _ sole _ minister to whom the miscarriage of the government may justly be imputed may easily persuade themselves to believe that there have be no miscarriage that all the measure be necessary and well form that there be neither poverty nor oppression feel in the nation that we compliance with france be no weakness and that we dread of the treaty of vienna be not chimerical the treaty of vienna my lord which have be the parent of so many terror consultation embassy and alliance be i find not yet to be acknowledge what it certainly be a mere phantom a empty illusion send by the art of the french to terrify we ministry he late majesty 's testimony be cite to prove that stipulation be really enter into by the two power ally by that treaty to destroy we trade subvert we constitution and set a new king upon the throne without consent of the nation such improbability my lord ought indeed to be prove by a high testimony by a testimony which no man shall dare to question or contradict for as any man be at liberty to consult he reason it will always remonstrate to he that it be no less absurd to impute the folly of design impossibility to any power not remarkable for weak counsel than unjust to suspect prince of intend injury to which they have not be incite by any provocation but my lord nowithstand the solemnity with which he late majesty have be introduce he testimony can prove nothing more than that he believe the treaty to be such as he represent that he have be deceive into false apprehension and unnecessary caution by he own minister as they have be impose upon by the agent of france this be all my lord that can be collect from the royal speech and to infer more from it be to suppose that the king be himself a party in the design form against he for if he be not himself engage in this treaty he could only be inform by another of the stipulation and could only report what he have be tell upon the credit of the informer a man necessarily of very little credit thus my lord all the evidence of he late majesty vanish into nothing more than the whisper of a spy but as great stress ought doubtless to be lay upon intelligence which the nation be believe to purchase at a very high price let it be inquire what proof those have who dare to suspect the sagacity of we minister to put in the balance against they intelligence and it will be discover my lord that they have a testimony no less than that of the german emperor himself who could not be mistake with regard to the meaning of the treaty conclude at he own court and to whom it will not be very decent to deny such a degree of veracity as may set he at least on the level with a traitor and a hirele if the treaty of vienna be a imposture most of we misfortune be evidently produce by the weakness of the minister but even suppose it real as it be only a formidable mockery a idle threat that could never be execute it be not necessary that in order to obviate it we should give ourselves implicitly into the hand of france it be not necessary my lord that we should suffer they first to elude the treaty of utrecht by make a port at mardyke and then directly and openly to violate it by repair dunkirk that this latter be a port contrary to treaty the bill of entry at the custom-house daily show and as the custom be particularly under the inspection of the commissioner of the treasury this man can not plead ignorance of this infraction be no information give he by other means if it should now be ask my lord what in my opinion ought to be do i can not advise that we should attempt to demolish it by force or draw upon ourselves the whole power of france by a declaration of war but what it may be difficult now to remedy it be once easy to obviate have we show the same contempt of the french power with we ancestor and the same steadiness in we council the same firmness in we alliance and the same spirit in we treaty that court would never have venture to break a known solemn stipulation to have exasperate a brave and determine adversary by flagrant injustice and to have expose themselves to the hazard of a war in which it would have be the interest of every prince of europe who regard justice or posterity to wish they defeat now they see we engage in a war my lord they may be animated to a more daring contempt of the faith of treaty and insult we with yet greater confidence of success as they can not but remark the cowardice or the ignorance with which we have hitherto carry on this war they can not but observe that either we minister mean in reality to make war rather upon the briton than the spaniard or that he be totally unacquainted with military affair and too vain to ask the opinion of other who have greater knowledge than himself nothing my lord be more apparent than that the minister be force by the continual clamor of the nation to declare war contrary to he own inclination and that he always affect to charge it upon other and to exempt himself from the imputation of it it be therefore probable that he have not act on this occasion so wisely as even he own experience and penetration might if they be honestly employ enable he to act and that he have suffer we counsel to be embarrass that he see with great tranquillity those suffer by the war at whose request it be begin and imagine it a proof of the excellence of he own scheme that those who force he to break it may in time repent of they importunity for that in the management of the war my lord no regard have be have either to the advantage which the course of we trade inevitably give to we enemy or to the weakness to which the extent of they dominion necessarily subject they that neither the interest of the merchant have be consult nor the ease of the nation in general regard that the treasure of the publick have be squander and that we military preparation have intimidate no nation but we own be evident beyond contradiction it be well know my lord to every man but the minister that we have nothing to fear from either the fleet or army of the spaniard that they can not invade we except in america and that they can only molest we by intercept we trader this they can only effect by means of they privateer whose vessel be light and active may be easily fit out nimbly seize they prey and speedily retire the experience of the last french war my lord might have teach we how much we have to fear from the activity of man incite by prospects of private gain and equip with that care and vigilance which however omit in national affair the interest of particular man never fail to dictate it be well know my lord how much we lose amidst we victory and triumph and how small security the merchant receive from we magnificent navy and celebrated commander it be therefore surely the part of wise man not to miscarry twice by the same omission when they have a opportunity to supply it i need not inform you lordship of what every reader of newspaper can tell and which common sense must easily discover that privateer be only to be suppress by ship of the same kind with they own which may scour the sea with rapidity pursue they into shallow water where great ship can not attack they seize they as they leave the harbor or destroy they upon they own coast that this be in its own nature at once obvious to be contrived and easy to be do must appear upon the bare mention of it and yet that it have be either treacherously neglect or ignorantly omit the account of every day have long inform we not a week pass in which we ship be not seize and we sailor carry into a state of slavery nor do this happen only on the wide ocean which be too spacious to be garrison or upon we enemy ' coast where they may have sometimes insuperable advantage but on we own shore within sight of we harbor and in those sea of which we vainly style we nation the sovereign who be there my lord whose indignation be not raise at such ignominy who be there by whom such negligence will not be resent it can not be allege that we have not time to make better preparation we have expect war long before we declare it and if the minister be the only man by whom it be not expect it will make another head of accusation nor be he disregard of we dominion less flagrant than that of we trade : it be publickly declare by don geraldino that he master would never give up he claim to part of we american colony which yet be neither fortify on the frontier nor supply with arm nor enable to oppose a enemy nor protect against he one man there be my lord whose natural generosity contempt of danger and regard for the publick prompt he to obviate the design of the spaniard and to attack they in they own territory a man whom by long acquaintance i can confidently affirm to have be equal to he undertaking and to have learn the art of war by a regular education who yet miscarry in he design only for want of supplies necessary to a possibility of success nor be there my lord much probability that the force send lately to vernon will be more successful for this be not a war to be carry on by boy : the state of the enemy 's dominion be such partly by situation and partly by the neglect of that man whose conduct we be examine that to attack they with any prospect of advantage will require the judgment of a experienced commander of one who have learn he trade not in hyde-park but in the field of battle of one that have be accustom to sudden exigency and unsuspected difficulty and have learn cautiously to form and readily to vary he scheme a officer my lord a officer qualify to invade kingdom be not form by bluster in he quarter by drinking on birth-night or dancing at assembly nor even by the more important service of regulate election and suppress those insurrection which be produce by the decay of we manufacture many gallant colonel have lead out they force against woman and child with the exactest order and scatter terror over numerous body of collier and weaver who would find difficulty not very easily surmountable be they to force a pass or storm a fortress but my lord those whom we have destine for the conquest of america have not even flush they arm with such service nor have learn what be most necessary to be learn the habit of obedience they be only such as the late frost hinder from the exercise of they trade and force to seek for bread in the service they have scarcely have time to learn the common motion of the exercise or distinguish the word of command nor be they officer my lord extremely well qualify to supply those defect and establish discipline and order in a body of new-raised force for they be absolutely stranger to service and take from school to receive a commission or if transplant from other regiment have have time only to learn the art of dress we have send soldier undisciplined and officer unable to instruct they and sit in expectation of conquest to be make by one boy act under the direction of another to they commander-in-chief my lord i object nothing but he inexperience which be by no means to be imputed to he negligence but he want of opportunity though of the rest surely it may be say that they be such a swarm as be never before send out on military design and in my opinion to the other equipment the government should have add provision for woman to nurse they have my knowledge of war my lord be think sufficient to have qualify I for the chief command in this expedition or have my advice be ask with regard to the conduct of it i should willingly have assist my country with my person or my counsel but my lord this man who engross all authority seem likewise to believe that he be in possession of all knowledge and that he be equally capable as he be equally willing to usurp the supreme and uncontroulable direction both of civil and military affair why new force be raise my lord it be very easy to judge new force require new commission and new commission produce new dependency which might be of use to the minister at the approach election but why the new-raised troops be send on this expedition rather than those which have be longer discipline it be very difficult to assign a reason unless it be consider that some who have command in they have likewise seat in the senate and the minister be too grateful to expose he friend to danger and too prudent to hazard the loss of a single vote besides the commander-in-chief there be but one senator in the expedition and my lord he be one of too great integrity to be corrupt and though sensible of the weakness of the troops too brave to quit he post how much we country may suffer by such absurd conduct i need not explain to you lordship it may easily be conceive how much one defeat may dispirit the nation and to what attempt one victory may excite we enemy those enemy whom under a steady and wise administration we should terrify into submission even without a army i can not forbear to remark on this occasion how much the ignorance of this man have expose a very important part of we foreign dominion to the attempt of the spaniard gibraltar my lord be well know to be so situate as to be naturally in very little danger of a attack from the land and to command the country to a great distance but these natural advantage be now take away or greatly lessen by new fortification erect within much less than gunshot of the place erect in the sight of the garrison and while one of we admiral be cruize upon the coast the pretence my lord upon which they be erect be that though gibraltar be grant to britain yet there be no district appendent to it nor do the british authority extend beyond the wall of the town : this poor excuse do the chicanery of the spaniard invent and with this my lord be we minister contented either not know or not appear to know what i hope the child whom we have despatch to america have be teach and what no man verse in national affair can be ignorant of without a crime that when a fortress be yield to another nation the treaty always virtually include even without mention it a extent of land as far as the gun of the fortification can reach whether this man my lord be so ignorant as to be deceive thus grossly or so abandon as willingly to deceive he country he be equally unqualified to support the office of first minister and almost equally deserve to be prosecute by the indignation and justice of this assembly in the severest manner for how great must be he wickedness who undertake a charge above he ability when he country may be probably ruin by he error you lordship can not but observe that i make use rather of the term minister than that of the administration which other be so desirous to substitute in its place either to elude all inquiry into the management of we affair or to cover they own shameful dependence administration my lord appear to I a term without a mean a wild indeterminate word of which none can tell whom it imply or how widely it may extend : a charge against the administration may be imagine a general censure of every officer in the whole subordination of government a general accusation of instrument and agent of master and slave : my charge my lord be against the minister against that man who be believe by every one in the nation and know by great number to have the chief and whenever he please to require it the sole direction of the publick measure he to whom all the other minister owe they elevation and by whose smile they hold they power they salary and they dignity that this appellation be not without sufficient reason bestow upon that man i have already prove to you lordship and as it have already be make appear that common fame be a sufficient ground of accusation it will easily be show that this man have a just claim to the title of minister for if any man be tell of a accusation of the minister he will not ask the name of the person accuse but there be in the motion one title confer upon he to which he have no pretension for there be no law for style he the first commissioner of the treasury the commissioner my lord who discharge in a collective capacity the office of lord high treasurer be constitute by the same patent invest with equal power and equal dignity and i know not why this man should be exalt to any superiority over he associate if we take my lord a review of we affair and examine the state of the nation in all its relation and all its circumstance we can not surely conceive that we be in a state of prosperity unless discontent at home and scorn abroad the neglect of we ally and insolence of we enemy the decay of trade and multitude of we impost be to be consider as proof of a prosperous and nourishing nation will it be allege my lord have this man one friend adventurous enough to assert in open day that the people be not starve by thousand and murmur by million that universal misery do not overspread the nation and that this horrid series of calamity be not universally among all condition imputed to the conduct of this man that great evil be feel my lord no briton i be certain who converse promiscuously with he countryman will attempt to dispute and until some other cause more proportion to the effect shall be assign i shall join the publick in they opinion and while i think this man the author of we misery shall conclude it necessary to comply with the motion lord hardwick speak next to the following effect : -- my lord though i very readily admit that crime ought to be punish that a treacherous administration of publick affair be in a very high degree criminal that even ignorance where it be the consequence of neglect deserve the severest animadversion and that it be the privilege and duty of this house to watch over the state of the nation and inform he majesty of any error commit by he minister yet i be far from be convince either of the justice or necessity of the motion now under consideration the most flagrant and invidious part of the charge against the right honorable gentleman appear to consist in this that he have engross a exorbitant degree of power and usurp a unlimited influence over the whole system of government that he dispose of all honor and preferment and that he be not only _ first _ but _ sole _ minister but of this boundless usurpation my lord what proof have be lay before you what beyond loud exaggeration pompous rhetorick and specious appeal to common fame common fame which at least may sometimes err and which though it may afford sufficient ground for suspicion and inquiry be never yet admit as conclusive evidence where the immediate necessity of the publick do not preclude the common form of examination where the power of the offender do not make it dangerous to attack he by a legal prosecution or where the conduct of the accuser do not plainly discover that they be more eager of blood than of justice and more solicitous to destroy than to convict i hope none of these circumstance my lord can at present obstruct a candid and deliberate inquiry : with regard to the publick i be not able to discover any press exigency that demand a more compendious method of proceeding than the established law of the land and the wisdom of we ancestor have prescribe i know not any calamity that will be aggravate nor any danger that will become move formidable by suffer this question to be legally try nor be there my lord in the circumstance of the person accuse any thing that can incite we to a hasty process for if what be allege by the noble lord be not exaggerate beyond the truth if he be universally detest by the whole nation and load with execration by the publick voice if he be consider as the author of all we misery and the source of all we corruption if he have ruin we trade and depress we power impoverish the people and attempt to enslave they there be at least no danger of a insurrection in he favor or any probability that he party will grow stronger by delay for my lord to find friend in adversity and assertor in distress be only the prerogative of innocence and virtue the gentleman against whom this formidable charge be draw up be i think not suspect of any intention to have recourse either to force or flight he have always appear willing to be try by the law of he country and to stand a impartial examination he neither oppose nor elude inquiry neither fly from justice nor defy it and yet less my lord can i suspect that those by whom he be accuse act from any motive that may influence they to desire a sentence not support by evidence or conformable to truth or that they can wish the ruin of any man whose crime be not notorious and flagrant that they persecute from private malice or endeavor to exalt themselves by the fall of another let we therefore my lord inquire before we determine and suffer evidence to precede we sentence the charge if it be just must be by its own nature easily prove and that no proof be bring may perhaps be sufficient to make we suspect that it be not just for my lord what be the evidence of common fame which have be so much exalted and so confidently produce do not every man see that on such occasion two question may be ask of which perhaps neither can easily be answer and which yet must both be resolve before common fame can be admit as a proof of fact it be first to be inquire my lord whether the report of fame be necessarily or even probably true a question very intricate and diffusive entangled with a thousand and involve a thousand distinction a question of which it may be say that a man may very plausibly maintain either side and of which perhaps after month or year waste in disputation no other decision can be obtain than what be obvious at the first view that they be often true and often false and therefore can only be grounds of inquiry not reason of determination but if it appear my lord that this oracle can not be deceive we be then to inquire after another difficulty we be to inquire _ what be fame _ be fame my lord that fame which can not err a report that fly on a sudden through a nation of which no man can discover the original a sudden blast of rumor that inflame or intimidate a people and obtain without authority a general credit no man verse in history can inquire whether such report may not deceive be fame rather a settle opinion prevail by degree and for some time establish how long then my lord and in what degree must it have be establish to obtain undoubted credit and when do it commence infallible if the people be divide in they opinion as in all publick question it have hitherto happen fame be i suppose the voice of the majority for if the two party be equal in they number fame will be equal then how great must be the majority before it can lay claim to this powerful auxiliary and how shall that majority be number these question my lord may be think perhaps with justice too ludicrous in this place but in my opinion they contribute to show the precarious and uncertain nature of the evidence so much confide in common fame my lord be to every man only what he himself commonly hear and it be in the power of any man 's acquaintance to vitiate the evidence which they report and to stun he with clamor and terrify he with apprehension of misery never feel and danger invisible but without such a combination we be to remember that most man associate with those of they own opinion and that the rank of those that compose this assembly naturally dispose such as be admit to they company to relate or to invent such report as may be favourably receive so that what appear to one lord the general voice of common fame may by another be think only the murmur of a petty faction despicable with regard to they number and detestable if we consider they principle so difficult be it my lord to form any solid judgment concern the extent and prevalence of any particular report and the degree of credit to be give to it the industry of a party may supply the defect of number and some concurrent circumstance may contribute to give credit to a false report but my lord we be ourselves appeal to as witness of the truth of fact which prove he to be sole minister of the number of he dependent the advancement of he friend the disappointment of he opponent and the declaration make by he follower of adherence and fidelity if it should be grant my lord that there be nothing in these representation exaggerate beyond the truth and that nothing be represent in a improper light what consequence can we draw but that the follower of this gentleman make use of those art which have always be practice by the candidate of preferment that they endeavor to gain they patron 's smile by flattery and panegyrick and to keep it by assiduity and a appearance of gratitude and if such application exalt any man to the authority and title of first minister the nation have never in my memory be without some man in that station for there be always some one to whom ambition and avarice have pay they court and whose regard have be purchase at the expense of truth nor be it to be wonder at my lord that post of honor and profit have be bestow upon the friend of the administration for who enrich or exalt he enemy who will increase the influence that be to be exert against he or add strength to the blow that be level at himself that the right honorable gentleman be the only disposer of honor have never yet appear it be not pretended my lord that he distribute they without the consent of he majesty nor even that he recommendation be absolutely necessary to the success of any man 's application if he have gain more of he majesty 's confidence and esteem than any other of he servant he have do only what every man endeavor and what therefore be not to be imputed to he as a crime it be impossible my lord that king like other man should not have particular motion of inclination or dislike it be possible that they may fix they affection upon object not in the highest degree worthy of they regard and overlook other that may boast of greater excellency and more shine merit but this be not to be suppose without proof and the regard of the king as of any other man be one argument of desert more than he can produce who have endeavor after it without effect this imputed usurpation must be prove upon he either by he own confession or by the evidence of other and it have not be yet pretend that he assume the title of _ prime minister _ or indeed that it be apply to he by any but he enemy and it may easily be conceive how weakly the most uncorrupted innocence would be support if all the aspersion of its enemy be to be receive as proof against it nor do it appear my lord that any other evidence can be bring against he on this head or that any man will stand forth and affirm that either he have be injure himself by this gentleman or know any injury do by he to another by the exertion of authority with which he be not lawfully invest such evidence my lord the law of we country require to be produce before any man can be punish censure or disgrace no man be oblige to prove he innocence but may call upon he prosecutor to support they accusation and why this honorable gentleman whatever may have be he conduct should be treat in a different manner than any other criminal i be by no means able to discover though there have be no evidence offer of he guilt you lordship have hear a attestation of he innocence from the noble duke who speak first against the motion of whom it can not be suspect that he would voluntarily engage to answer for measure which he pursue in blind compliance with the direction of another the same testimony my lord can i produce and affirm with equal truth that in the administration of my province i be independent and leave entirely to the decision of my own judgment in every government my lord as in every family some either by accident or a natural industry or a superior capacity or some other cause will be engage in more business and treat with more confidence than other but if every man be willing to answer for the conduct of he own province there be all the security against corruption that can possibly be obtain for if every man 's regard to he own safety and reputation will prevent he from betray he trust or abuse he power much more will it incite he to prevent any misconduct in another for which he must himself be accountable man be usually sufficiently tenacious of power and ready to vindicate they separate rights when nothing but they pride be affect by the usurpation but surely no man will patiently suffer he province to be invade when he may himself be ruin by the conduct of the invader thus my lord it appear to I to be not only without proof but without probability and the first minister can in my opinion be nothing more than a formidable illusion which when one man think he have see it he show to another as easily fright as himself who join with he in propagate the notion and in spread terror and resentment over the nation till at last the panick become general and what be at first only whisper by malice or prejudice in the ear of ignorance or credulity be adopt by common fame and echo back from the people to the senate i have hitherto my lord confine myself to the consideration of one single article of this complicated charge because it appear to I to be the only part of it necessary to be examine for if once it be acknowledge that the affair of the nation be transact not by the minister but the administration by the council in which every man that sit there have a equal voice and equal authority the blame or praise of all the measure must be transfer from he to the council and every man that have advise or concur in they will deserve the same censure or the same applause as it be unjust to punish one man for the crime of another it be unjust to choose one man out for punishment from among many other equally guilty but i doubt not my lord when all those measure be equitably consider there will be no punishment to be dread because neither negligence nor treachery will be discover for my lord with regard to the treaty of vienna let we suppose we minister deceive by ignorant or corrupt intelligence let we admit that they be cautious where there be no danger and neglect some opportunity which if they have receive better information they might have improve to the advantage and security of the nation what have they do even under all these disadvantageous supposition but follow the light which they judge most clear and by which they hope to be conduct to honor and to safety policy my lord be very different from prescience the utmost that can be attain be probability and that for the most part in a low degree it be observe that no man be wise but as you take into consideration the weakness of another a maxim more eminently true of political wisdom which consist very often only in discover design which could never be know but by the folly or treachery of those to whom they be trust if we enemy be wise enough to keep they own secret neither we minister nor we patriot would be able to know or prevent they design nor would it be any reproach to they sagacity that they do not know what nobody would tell they if therefore my lord the prince whose interest be contrary to we own have be at any time serve by honest and wise man there be a time when we minister could act only by conjecture and might be mistake without a crime if it be always in we power to penetrate into the intention of we enemy they must necessarily have the same means of make themselves acquaint with we project and yet when any of they be discover we think it just to impute it to the negligence of the minister thus my lord every man be incline to judge with prejudice and partiality when we suffer by the prudence of we enemy we charge we minister with want of vigilance without consider that very often nothing be necessary to elude the most penetrate sagacity but obstinate silence if we inquire into the transaction of past time shall we find any man however renown for he ability not sometimes impose upon by falsehood and sometimes betray by he own reasoning into measure destructive of the purpose which he endeavor to promote there be no man of whose penetration higher idea have be justly form or who give more frequent proof of a uncommon penetration into futurity than cromwell and yet succeed time have sufficiently discover the weakness of aggrandize france by depress spain and we wonder now how so much policy could fall into so gross a error as not rather to suffer power to remain in the distant enemy than transfer it to another equally divide from we by interest and far more formidable by the situation of he dominion cromwell my lord suffer himself to be hurry away by the near prospect of present advantage and the apprehension of present danger and every other man have be in the same manner sometimes delude into a preference of a smaller present advantage to a greater which be more remote let it not be urge my lord that politick be advance since the time of cromwell and that error which might then be commit by the wisest administration be now gross and reproachful we be to remember that every part of policy have be equally improve and that if more method of discovery have be strike out there have be likewise more art invent of elude it when therefore we inquire into the conduct or examine the ability of a minister we be not to expect that he should appear never to have be deceive but that he should never be find to have neglect any proper means of information nor ever to have willingly give up the interest of he country but we be not to impute to he weakness what be only to be ascribe to the wisdom of those whom he oppose if this plea my lord be reasonable it will be necessary for those who support the motion to prove not only that the treaty of vienna be never make but that the falsehood of the report either be or might have be know by we minister otherwise those who be incline to retain a favourable opinion of they integrity and ability may conclude that they be either not mistaken or be lead into error by such delusion as would no less easily have impose on they accuser and that by exalt they enemy to they station they shall not much consult the advantage of they country this motion therefore my lord found upon no acknowledge no indisputable fact nor support by legal evidence this motion which by appeal to common fame as the ultimate judge of every man 's action may bring every man 's life or fortune into danger this motion which condemn without hearing and decide without examine i can not but reject and hope you lordship will concur with I lord carlisle speak next to the follow purport : -- my lord the state of the question before we have in my opinion not be rightly apprehend by the noble lord who speak last nor be the innocence or guilt of the minister the chief question before we because a minister may possibly mean well and yet be in some particular circumstance unqualified for he station he may not only want the degree of knowledge and ability requisite to make he good intention effectual but my lord however skilful sagacious or diligent he may be so unfortunate in some part of he conduct as to want the esteem and confidence of the people that a very able and honest minister may be misinform by he intelligence disappoint by he agent or baffle by other man of equal capacity and integrity with himself can not be controvert but it must surely be own likewise that when this have happen so often and in case of such importance as to deprive he entirely of the regard and affection of the people when he be reduce to intrench himself behind he privilege to employ all the influence of the crown for he own security and make it he daily endeavor to create new dependency he ought to be pity and discard that this be the state of the minister whose removal be desire by the motion can not be deny the exaltation of he adherent to place and preferment the noble lord have be so far from question that he have endeavor to justify it and have in plain term inquire who would have act otherwise every man my lord would have act otherwise whose character have not be blast by general detestation every man would have act otherwise who prefer the publick good to he own continuance in power and every man have act otherwise who have distinguish himself as a friend to the publick it be the interest of the nation my lord that every office should be fill by that man who be most capable of discharge it whatever may be he sentiment with regard to the minister and that he attention should be confine to he employment rather than distract by various concern and opposite relation it be therefore a injury to the publick to thrust a skilful commissioner into the senate or to embarrass a industrious senator with a post or commission yet my lord that multitude have obtain place who have no acquaintance with the duty of they office nor any other pretension to they than that they have seat in the other house and that by distinguish himself in that assembly any man may most easily obtain the preferment of the crown be too obvious for controversy this practice my lord be a sufficient foundation for the motion a practice so injurious to the nation so long continue and so openly avowed require to be vigorously oppose lest it should become establish by long custom and entangle itself with we constitution if the minister my lord have make it necessary to employ none but he adherent and blind follower this necessity be alone a sufficient proof how little he confide in he own prudence or integrity how apprehensive he be of the censure of the senate and how desirous of continue he authority by avoid it and surely my lord it be we duty as well as we right to address the throne that a minister should be remove who fear the people since few man fear without hate and nothing so much contribute to make any man a enemy to he country as the consciousness that he be universally abhor but my lord if this be do by he without necessity if the general preference of he friend be only the consequence of mistaken judgment or corrupt gratitude this address be equally necessary because the effect be equally pernicious when a minister suspect of ill intention be continue in employment discontent must naturally spread over the nation and if the end of government be the happiness of the people if suspicion and jealousy be contrary to a state of happiness and if this suspicion which generally prevail this discontent which fill the whole nation can only be appease by the removal of the minister prudence justice and the example of we ancestor ought to influence we to endeavor that the affair of the nation may be transfer to such whose greater integrity or wisdom have recommend they to the affection of the people in this motion therefore we need not be suppose to imply that the minister be either ignorant or corrupt but that he be dislike by the people dislike to such a degree my lord that it be not safe for he majesty to employ he it be doubtless we duty my lord to guard both the rights of the people and the prerogative of the throne and with equal ardor to remonstrate to he majesty the distress of he subject and he own danger we be to hold the balance of the constitution and neither to suffer the regal power to be overborne by a torrent of popular fury nor the people to be oppress by a illegal exertion of authority or the more insupportable hardship of unreasonable law by this motion my lord the happiness of the people and the security of he majesty be at once consult nor can we suppress so general a clamor without fail equally in we duty to both to what my lord be the untimely end of so many king and emperor to be imputed but to the cowardice or treachery of they counsellor of those to whom they trust that intercourse which be always to be preserve between a monarch and he people be king honestly inform of the opinion and disposition of they subject they would never or at least rarely persist in such measure as by exasperate the people tend necessarily to endanger themselves it be the happiness of a british monarch that he have a standing and hereditary council compose of man who do not owe they advancement to the smile of caprice or the intrigue of a court who be therefore neither under the influence of a false gratitude nor of a servile dependence and who may convey to the throne the sentiment of the people without danger and without fear but my lord if we be either too negligent or too timorous to do we duty how be the condition of we sovereign more safe or more happy than that of a emperor of turkey who be often ignorant of any complaint make against the administration till he hear the people thunder at the gate of he palace let we therefore my lord whatever may be we opinion of the conduct of the minister inform he majesty of the discontent of he subject since whether it be just or not the danger be the same and whenever any danger threaten the king we ought either to enable he to oppose or caution he to avoid it lord cholmondeley speak next to the following effect : -- my lord i can not but observe in this debate a ambition of popularity in my opinion not very consistent with the freedom of debate and the dignity of this assembly which ought to be influence by no other motive than the force of reason and truth it have be a common method of elude the efficacy of argument to charge the opponent with blind adherence to interest or corrupt compliance with the direction of a court nor have it be less frequent to prevent inquiry into publick measure by represent they as the clamor of faction the murmur of disobedience and the prelude to rebellion so necessary my lord have it be always think to be uninfluenced in we examination by dependence or interest that the most irrefragable reason have lose the power of conviction by the condition and character of those by whom they be produce and so much be it expect from innocence and justice to despise all foreign assistance and to stand the test of inquiry without ask the support of power that every man have be conclude guilty that have flee for shelter to the throne and surely my lord if that man 's suffrage be of little weight who appear determine to subscribe to the dictate of a minister no greater credit can be assign to another who profess himself only the echo of the clamor of the populace if it be a proof of a weak cause and consciousness of misconduct to apply to the crown for security and protection it may be account a acknowledgment of the insufficiency of argument when the people be call in to second they and they be only to expect success from the violence of multitude that all government be institute for the happiness of the people that they interest ought to be the chief care of the legislature that they complaint ought patiently to be hear and they grievance speedily redress be truth well know generally acknowledge and i hope always predominant in the mind of every lord in this assembly but that the people can not err that the voice of fame be to be regard as a oracle and every murmur of discontent to be pacify by a change of measure i have never before hear or hear it only to disregard it true tenderness for the people my lord be to consult they advantage to protect they liberty and to preserve they virtue and perhaps example may be find sufficient to inform we that all these effect be often to be produce by mean not generally agreeable to the publick it be possible my lord for a very small part of the people to form just idea of the motive of transaction and the tendency of law all negotiation with foreign power be necessarily complicate with many different interest and vary by innumerable circumstance influence by sudden exigency and defeat by unavoidable accident law have respect to remote consequence and involve a multitude of relation which it require long study to discover and how difficult it be to judge of political conduct or legislative proceedings may be easily discover by observe how often the most skilful statesman be mistaken and how frequently the law require to be amend if then my lord the people judge for themselves on these subject they must necessarily determine without knowledge of the question and they decision be then of small authority if they receive implicitly the dictate of other and blindly adopt the opinion of those who have gain they favor and esteem they applause and complaint be with respect to themselves empty sound which they utter as the organ of they leader nor be the desire of the people gratify when they petition be grant nor they grievance overlook when they murmur be neglect as it be no reproach to the people that they can not be the proper judge of the conduct of the government so neither be they to be censure when they complain of injury not real and tremble at the apprehension of severity unintended unjust complaint my lord and unreasonable apprehension be to be imputed to those who court they regard only to deceive they and exalt themselves to reputation by rescue they from grievance that be never feel and avert danger that be never near he only who make the happiness of the people he endeavor love they with a true affection and a rational tenderness and he certainly consult they happiness who contribute to still all groundless clamor and appease all useless apprehension who employ he care not only to preserve they quiet and they liberty but to secure they from the fear of lose it who not only promote the means of happiness but enable they to enjoy it thus it appear my lord that it be possible to be a friend at the same time to the people and the administration and that no man can more deserve they confidence and applause than he that dissipate they unreasonable terror and contribute to reconcile they to a good government that most of the clamor against the present government arise from calumny and misrepresentation be apparent from the sanction of the senate which have be give to all the measure that be charge as crime upon the administration that the army be support by the consent of the senate that the senate have approve the convention and that we tax be all impose and continue by the senate can not be deny what then be demand by those that censure the conduct of publick affair but that they opinion should be consider as a overbalance to the wisdom of the senate that no man should be allow to speak but as they dictate nor to vote but as they shall influence they by they rhetorick or example to repeat the particular topick of accusation and recapitulate the argument which have be produce to confute it would be a tedious and unnecessary labor unnecessary because it be well know that they once have the power of convince this house and that nothing have since happen to lessen they force and because many of they now have be already repeat by the noble lord that have oppose the motion to search far backward for past error and to take advantage of later discovery in censure the conduct of any minister be in a high degree disingenuous and cruel it be a art which may be easily practice of perplexing any question by connect distant fact and entangle one period of time with another the only candid method of inquiry be to recur back to the state of affair as it then appear to consider what be openly declare and what be keep impenetrably secret what be discoverable by human sagacity and what be beyond the reach of the most piercing politician with regard to the hanover treaty it be not my lord requisite that we should engage ourselves in a very minute examination for it be not only not transact by the right honorable gentleman whose behavior be the subject of this debate but can not be prove to have be know by he till it be formally ratify if he afterwards approve it either in the council or the senate he can not justly how destructive or ridiculous soever that treaty may be think be charge with more than he share of the guilt the bare guilt of a single vote but there be one accusation yet more malicious a accusation not only of crime which this gentleman do not commit but which have not yet be commit a accusation form by prying into futurity and exaggerate misfortune which be yet to come and which may probably be prevent well may any man my lord think himself in danger when he hear himself charge not with high crime and misdemeanor not with accumulative treason but with misconduct of publick affair past present and future the only charge against this gentleman which seem to relate more to he than to any other man engage in the administration be the continuance of the harbor of dunkirk which say the noble duke he must be acquaint with as commissioner of the treasury but if the title of first commissioner be deny if he authority be but the same with that of he associate whence come it my lord that he be more particularly accuse than they why be he guilt suppose greater if he power be only equal but my lord i believe it will appear that no guilt have be contract on this account and that dunkirk be always intend even by those that demand the demolition of it to continue a harbor for small trading vessel and that if larger ever arrive from thence they lay at a distance from the shore and be load by small vessel from the town with regard to other affair my lord they be all transact by the council not by he direction but with he concurrence and how it be consistent with justice to single he out for censure i must desire the noble lord to show who approve the motion if the people my lord have be by misrepresentation industriously propagate exasperate against he if the general voice of the nation condemn he we ought more cautiously to examine he conduct lest we should add strength to prejudice too powerful already and instead of reform the error and regulate the heat of the people inflame they discontent and propagate sedition the utmost claim of the people be to be admit as accuser and sometimes as evidence but they have no right to sit as judge and to make we the executioner of they sentence and as this gentleman have yet be only condemn by those who have not the opportunity of examine he conduct nor the right of judge he i can not agree to give he up to punishment lord halifax speak next in substance as follow : -- my lord though i do not conceive the people infallible yet i believe that in question like this they be seldom in the wrong for this be a question not of argument but of fact of fact discoverable not by long deduction and accurate ratiocination but by the common power of see and feel that it be difficult to know the motive of negotiation and the effect of law and that it require long study and intense meditation to discover remote consequence be indubitably true and with regard to the people in general it can not be deny that neither they education qualify they nor they employment allow they to be much verse in such inquiry but my lord to refer effect to they proper cause and to observe when consequence break forth from whence they proceed be no such arduous task the people of the lowest class may easily feel that they be more miserable this year than the last and may inquire and discover the reason of the aggravation of they misery they may know that the army be increase or we trade diminish that the tax be heavier and penal law become more grievous nor be it less easy for they to discover that these calamity be not bring upon they by the immediate hand of heaven or the irresistible force of natural cause that they town be not ruin by a invasion nor they trade confine by a pestilence they may then easily collect that they be only unhappy by the misconduct of they governor they may assign they infelicity to that cause as the only remain cause that be adequate to the effect if it be grant my lord that they may be mistake in they reasoning it must be own that they be not mistake without probability on they side : it be probable that the ministry must injure the publick interest when it decay without any other visible cause it be still more probable when it appear that among those whose station enable they to enter into national inquiry every man impute he calamity to the minister who be not visibly dependent on he favor it become more probable yet when it appear that it be the great business of the minister to multiply dependency to list accomplice and to corrupt he judge at least my lord if it be grant which surely can not be deny that the people may be sensible of they own misery it be they part to declare they suffering and to apply to this house for relief and it be we business to discover the author of they and bring they to punishment that the people be very loud and importunate in they complaint be daily evident nor be it less apparent that they complaint be just if therefore they misery must have a author let the defender of this gentleman point out the man whom they may more properly accuse but my lord nothing be more evident than that the crime and the criminal be equally know that there be one man predominant in he majesty 's council and that it have long be the practice of that man at once to oppress and ridicule the people to plunder they and set they at defiance nothing be more known than that this man pretend to a superior knowledge and exert a superior power in the management of the publick revenue and that they have be so ill manage for many year that the expense of peace have be almost equal to those of a most vigorous and extensive war nothing be more probable than that most of the foreign negotiation be conduct by he direction nor more certain than that they have generally tend only to make we contemptible that the excise be project in he own head that it be recommend by he upon he own conviction and press upon the legislature by he influence can not be question and if this be he only crime if this be the only scheme of oppression that ever he plan out it be such a declaration of war upon the publick liberty such a attack of we natural and constitutional rights as be never perhaps pardon by any nation nor be it less notorious that the late infamous convention be transact by one of he own dependent that he palliate or conceal the loss of we merchant that he oppose the declaration of war and have since obstruct its operation on this occasion my lord it may be useful to remark the apparent partiality of this gentleman 's vindicator who declare that measure be not to be censure as imprudent only because they be unsuccessful and yet when other instance of he conduct fall under we examination think it a sufficient defense to exclaim against the unreasonableness of judge before the event to deny that in the conduct both of civil and military affair he have obtain i know not by what mean a authority superior to that of any other man a authority irresistible uncontroulable and regal be to oppose not only common fame but daily experience if as commissioner of the treasury he have no more power than any of he associate whence be it that to oppose or censure he to doubt of he infallibility to suspect he integrity or to obstruct he influence be a crime punish with no lighter penalty than forfeiture of employment as appear my lord from the late dismission of a gentleman against whom nothing can be allege but a obstinate independence and open disregard of this arbitrary minister but happy would it be my lord for this nation if he endeavor not to extend he authority beyond the treasury or the court if he would content himself with tyrannise over those whose acceptance of salary and preferment have already subject they to he command without attempt to influence election or to direct the member of the other house how much the influence of the crown have operate upon all publick council since the advancement of this gentleman how zealously it have be support and how industriously extend be unnecessary to explain since what be see or feel by almost every man in the kingdom can not reasonably be suppose unknown to you lordship nothing can be more contrary to the true notion of the british constitution than to imagine that by such measure he majesty 's real interest be advance the true interest my lord of every monarch be to please the people and the only way of please briton be to preserve they liberty they reputation and they commerce every attempt to extend the power of the crown beyond the limit prescribe by we law must in effect make it weaker by divert the only source of its strength the affection of he subject it be therefore my opinion my lord that we ought to agree to this motion as a standing memorial not only of we regard for the nation but of we adherence to we sovereign that he council may be no longer influence by that man whose pernicious advice and unjustifiable conduct have add new hope and new strength to he enemy impoverished and exasperate he subject inflamed the discontent of the seditious and almost alienate the affection of the loyal the bishop of salisbury speak next to the follow purport : -- my lord after all the exaggeration of the error and all the representation of the malconduct of the right honorable gentleman after the most affect rhetorick and the most acute inquiry nothing have appear of weight sufficient to prevail with I to agree to the present motion a motion if not of a unprecedented yet of a very extraordinary kind which may extend in its consequence to futurity and be perhaps more dangerous to innocence than guilt i can not yet discover any proof sufficient to convict he of have usurp the authority of _ first _ minister or any other power than that accidental influence which every man have whose address or service have procure he the favor of he sovereign the usurpation my lord of regal power must be make evident by somewhat more than general assertion must appear from some publick act like that of one of the prelate leave regent of the kingdom by richard the first who as soon as the king be go too far to return in the first elevation of he heart begin he new authority by imprison he colleague to charge this gentleman with the dismission of any of he colleague can after the strongest aggravation rise no higher than to a accusation of have advise he majesty to dismiss he and even that my lord stand at present unsupported by evidence nor could it however uncontestably prove discover either wickedness or weakness or show any other authority than every man would exercise if he be able to attain it if he have discharge this gentleman by he own authority if he have transact singly any great affair to the disadvantage of the publick if he have impose either upon the king or the senate by false representation if he have set the law at defiance and openly trample on we constitution and if by these practice he have exalt himself above the reach of a legal prosecution it have be worthy of the dignity of this house to have overleap the common boundary of custom to have neglect the standing rule of procedure and to have bring so contemptuous and powerful a offender to a level with the rest of he fellow-subject by expeditious and vigorous method to have repress he arrogance break he power and overwhelm he at once by the resistless weight of a unanimous censure but my lord we have in the present case no provocation from crime either openly avowed or evidently prove and certainly no incitement from necessity to exert the power of the house in any extraordinary method of prosecution we may punish whenever we can convict and convict whenever we can obtain evidence let we not therefore condemn any man unheard nor punish any man uncondemn the duke of bedford speak next in substance as follow : -- my lord it be easy to charge the most blameless and gentle procedure with injustice and severity but it be not easy to support such a accusation without confound measure widely different and disguise the nature of thing with fallacious misrepresentation nothing be more evident than that neither condemnation nor punishment be intend by the motion before we which be only to remove from power a man who have no other claim to it than the will of he master and who as he have not be injure by never obtain it can not justly complain that it be take from he the motion my lord be so far from inflict punishment that it confer reward it leave he in the possession of immense wealth however accumulate and enable he to leave that office in security from which most of he predecessor have be precipitate by national resentment or senatorial prosecution there be no censure my lord make of he conduct no charge of weakness or suspicion of dishonesty nor can any thing be equitably infer from it than that in the opinion of this house he majesty may probably be serve by some other person more to the satisfaction of the british nation though it be not just to punish any man without examination or to censure he conduct merely because it have be unpleasing or unsuccessful though it be not reasonable that any man should forfeit what he possess in he own right without a crime yet it be just to withdraw favor only to confer they on another more deserving it be just in any man to withhold he own only to preserve he right or obviate a injurious prescription and it be therefore just to advise such a conduct whenever it appear necessary to those who have the right of offer advice to advise he majesty my lord be not only we right but we duty we be not only justifiable in practise but criminal in neglect it that we should declare we apprehension of any impending danger and we disapprobation of publick misconduct be expect both by we sovereign and the people and let we not by omit such warning lull the nation and we sovereign into a dangerous security and from tenderness to one man prolong or increase the misery of we country and endanger or destroy the honor of we sovereign lord hervey speak next in effect as follow : -- my lord this be surely a day destine by the noble lord who defend the motion for the support of paradoxical assertion for the exercise of they penetration and ostentation of they rhetorick they have attempt to maintain the certainty of common fame in opposition to daily observation the existence of a sole minister in contradiction to the strongest evidence and have by these gradation arrive at the highest degree of controversial temerity be endeavor to make it appear that the publick censure of the house of lord be no punishment if we take the liberty my lord of use known word in a new sense in a meaning reserve to ourselves only it will indeed be difficult to confute as it will be impossible to understand we but if punishment be now to be understand as imply the same idea which have hitherto be convey by it it will not be easy to show that a man thus publickly censure be not severely punish and if he crime be not clearly prove punish in opposition to law to reason and to justice it have be hitherto imagine my lord that no punishment be heavier than that of infamy and shame have by generous mind be avoid at the hazard of every other misery that such a censure as be propose by the motion must irreparably destroy the reputation of the person against whom it be direct that it must confirm the report of he enemy impair the esteem of he friend mark he out to all europe as unworthy of he sovereign 's favor and represent he to latest posterity as a enemy to he country be indisputably certain these my lord be the evident consequence of the address move for by the noble lord and if such consequence be not penal it will be no longer in we power to enforce we law by sanction of terror to condemn a man unheard be a open and flagrant violation of the first law of justice but it be still a wider deviation from it to punish a man unaccused no crime have be charge upon this gentleman proportion to the penalty propose by the motion and the charge that have be produce be destitute of proof let we therefore my lord reverence the great law of reason and justice let we preserve we high character and prerogative of judge without descend to the low province of accuser and executioner let we so far regard we reputation we liberty and we posterity as to reject the motion -lrb- several other lord speak in this debate which last eleven hour at length the question be put and on a division carry in the negative content 59 not content 108 -rrb- after the determination of the foregoing question the duke of marlborough rise up and speak as follow : -- my lord though you patience must undoubtedly be weary by the unusual length of this day 's debate a debate protracted in my opinion not by the difficulty of the question but by the obstinacy of prejudice the ardor of passion and the desire of victory yet i doubt not but the regard which this assembly have always pay to the safety and happiness of the state will incline you to support the fatigue of attention a little longer and to hear with you usual impartiality another motion the proposition which i be about to lay down my lord be not such as can admit of controversy it be such a standing principle as be always acknowledge even by those who have deviate from it such a known truth as never be deny though it appear sometimes to have be forget but my lord as it never can be forget without injury to particular person and danger to the state in general it can not be too frequently recollect or too firmly establish it ought not only to be tacitly admit but publickly declare since no man 's fortune liberty or life can be safe where he judge shall think themselves at liberty to act upon any other principle i therefore move that any attempt to inflict any kind of punishment on any person without allow he a opportunity to make he defense or without any proof of any crime or misdemeanor commit by he be contrary to natural justice the fundamental law of this realm and the ancient established usage of the senate and be a high infringement of the liberty of the subject he be second by the duke of devonshire : -- my lord though the motion make by the noble duke be of such a kind that no opposition can be expect or fear yet i rise up to second it lest it should be imagine that what can not be reject be yet unwillingly admit that where this maxim be not allow and adhere to rights and liberty be empty sound be uncontestably evident if this principle be forsake guilt and innocence be equally secure all caution be vain and all testimony useless caprice will in we court supply the place of reason and all evidence must give way to malice or to favor i hope therefore my lord that you regard to justice to truth and to you own safety will influence you to confirm this great and self-evident principle by a standing resolution that may not only restrain oppression in the present age but direct the judiciary proceedings of we successor lord lovel rise next and speak as follow : -- my lord liberty and justice must always support each other they can never long flourish apart every temporary expedient that can be contrived to preserve or enlarge liberty by means arbitrary and oppressive form a precedent which may in time be make use of to violate or destroy it liberty be in effect suspend whenever injustice be practice for what be liberty my lord but the power of do right without fear without control and without danger but my lord if any man may be condemn unheard if judgment may precede evidence what safety or what confidence can integrity afford it be in vain that any man mean well and act prudently it be even in vain that he can prove the justice and prudence of he conduct by liberty my lord can never be mean the privilege of do wrong without be accountable because liberty be always speak of as happiness or one of the means to happiness and happiness and virtue can not be separate the great use of liberty must therefore be to preserve justice from violation justice the great publick virtue by which a kind of equality be diffuse over the whole society by which wealth be restrain from oppression and inferiority preserve from servitude liberty general liberty must imply general justice for wherever any part of a state can be unjust with impunity the rest be slave that to condemn any man unheard be oppressive and unjust be beyond controversy demonstrable and that no such power be claim by you lordship will i hope appear from you resolution lord gower speak next : -- my lord to the principle lay down by those noble lord i have no objection and concur with they in hope that all we proceedings will contribute to establish it but why it should be confirm by a formal resolution why the house should solemnly declare they assent to a maxim which it would be madness to deny it be beyond my penetration to discover though the noble lord 's position can not be controvert yet he motion if it be design to imply any censure of the proceedings of this day may reasonably be reject and that some censure be intend we may conjecture because no other reason can be give why it be not make at some other time lord halifax then rise : -- my lord that a censure be intend will i suppose not be deny and that such a censure be unjust must doubtless be the opinion of all those who be suppose to have incur it and it will therefore not be wonder that the motion be oppose by they as indecent and calumnious : late as it be my lord i will not for my part suffer such a indignity without opposition and shall think my conscience and my honor require that i should not be overborne by perseverance or by number but that i should if i can not convince the noble lord by argument of the impropriety of the motion record my reason against it which may perhaps be more candidly receive by posterity lord talbot speak to this effect : -- my lord it be not without indignation that i hear a motion so injurious to my own honor and to that of the noble lord who have concur with I in the last debate nor without contempt that i observe the motion confound with the position contain in it the low subtilty of such conduct be no less to be despise than the malice to be abhor fifty-nine lord be here brand as stranger or enemy to the first principle of judicial equity for do what will entitle they to the general applause of every man in the kingdom that have the full possession of he understanding or the free use of he sens of every man that can distinguish truth or feel oppression they have endeavor to rescue they country from the rapine of pensioner and the tyranny of a army from perpetual tax and useless expense they have attempt to expose the error of arrogant ignorance and to depress the power of greatness found on corruption and swell beyond legal restraint that for such attempt they be vilify and reproach be not to be observe without indignation and astonishment astonishment which nothing could abate but the recollection of the situation of those lord who have unite to promote so unjust a censure let we my lord consider the circumstance of the three noble lord by whom this motion have be make and support let we take a view of they conduct and consider the visible motive to which it may be ascribe they place they dependence -- lord cholmondeley speak next in substance as follow : -- my lord i rise thus abruptly to preserve that order and decency which be essential to publick council and particularly suitable to the dignity of this assembly which can only become a scene of tumult and confusion by such method of debate and lose that respect which it have hitherto preserve not only by the justice of its determination but by the solemn grandeur of its procedure the motion my lord be allow to contain nothing but what every man avow in speculation and observe or ought to observe in publick transaction and yet those that offer and support it be represent as abettor of oppression and instrument of tyranny it be surely wonderful my lord that those who be solicitous for the preservation of they own honor and so diligent to obviate the most remote reflection that may glance upon it should not remember that the same delicacy may raise in other the same resentment when they reputation be openly attack and that while they be assert the right of the minority to a exemption from censure they shall not allow the greater number at least a equal claim to the same privilege lord talbot then resume : -- my lord whether any thing have escape from I that deserve such severe animadversion you lordship must decide for what i might intend to say since by the interruption of that noble lord i be hinder from proceed i hope i shall not be accountable not that i acknowledge myself to have assert any thing either contrary to law or to the privilege of the house or inconsistent with the character of a independent lord a character which i shall always endeavor to preserve and which i will not forfeit for the smile of a court the dignity of high employment or the affluence of a pension nor my lord whenever the necessity of my country require that i should speak my sentiment with freedom will i be awed into silence and submission but will set any power at defiance that shall dare to restrain I i pretend not my lord to be always in the right i claim no other merit than that of mean well and when i be convince after proper examination that i be engage on the side of truth i will trample on that insolence that shall command I to suppress my sentiment when i reflect my lord on the distress of my country when i observe the security and arrogance of those whom i consider as the author of the publick misery i can not always contain my resentment i may perhaps sometimes start out into unbecoming transport and speak in term not very ceremonious of such abandon such detestable -- but as this be perhaps not the language of the house i shall endeavor to repress it and hope that the bound of decency have never be so far transgress by I that i should be expose to the censure of you lordship lord abingdon next rose and say : -- my lord the present motion be undoubtedly just but by no means necessary or particularly adapt to the present time it contain a general principle uncontested and establish a principle which this assembly have never deny and from which i know not that it have ever depart as there be therefore no particular necessity of confirm it by a new resolution and as the present time seem less proper than any other i can not but declare my opinion that to resume it at some other time will be more prudent than to give the lord who think they conduct censure any occasion of resentment or discontent lord carteret speak to the following effect : -- my lord the maxim lay down in the present motion be in itself incontestable and so far from any inconsistency with the former that as there be no reason for make there be in my opinion none for oppose it as it may at any time be make it may at any time be properly pass and i hope that we unanimity on this occasion will show that truth however unseasonably advance will in this house be always receive but lest the noble lord who have oppose the motion should think they honor engage in continue the opposition i take the liberty my lord to move that the previous question may be put -lrb- other lord speak on each side at last the previous question be put by the president who demand be it you lordship ' pleasure that the question be now put those lord who be for it say content : those who be against it say not content there be accordingly a cry of both after which the president declare the contents have it and some lord reply the non-contents have it he lordship say the non-contents must go below the bar : which be the manner of divide the house those who remain be tell in they seat and those who go out be tell at come in again there be content 81 not content 54 : so that the resolution move for pass without a division -rrb- house of common feb 24 1740-1 -lrb- debate on cleanse the city of westminster -rrb- lord tyrconnel make a motion for bring in a bill for the better cleanse and pave the street of westminster and the liberty thereof in support of which motion he speak to the follow purpose : -- sir though the grievance which i be about to lay before the house be not of the most formidable or dangerous kind yet as it be such as grow every day greater and such as every day endanger the life of thousand i hope it will not be think useless or improper to propose it to the consideration of this assembly to offer my thought on the method by which it may be most easily remove and to endeavor to incite other to the same consideration it be impossible sir to come to this assembly or to return from it without observation on the present condition of the street of westminster observation force upon every man however inattentive or however engross by reflection of a different kind the warmest zeal for publick happiness the most anxious vigilance against general danger must i believe sometimes give way to object of immediate though of less importance nor will the most publick-spirited senator deny that they have often be in the street alarm with obstruction or shock with nuisance the filth sir of some part of the town and the inequality and ruggedness of other can not but in the eye of foreigner disgrace we nation and incline they to imagine we a people not only without delicacy but without government a herd of barbarian or a colony of hottentot the most disgusting part of the character give by traveller of the most savage nation be they neglect of cleanliness of which perhaps no part of the world afford more proof than the street of the british capital a city famous for wealth and commerce and plenty and for every other kind of civility and politeness but which abound with such heap of filth as a savage would look on with amazement if that be allow which be generally believe that putrefaction and stench be the cause of pestilential distemper the removal of this grievance may be press from motive of far greater weight than those of delicacy and pleasure and i might solicit the timely care of this assembly for the preservation of inuumerable multitude and intreat those who be watch against slight misfortune to unite they endeavor with mine to avert the greatest and most dreadful of calamity not to dwell sir upon danger which may perhaps be think only imaginary i hope that it will be at least consider how much the present neglect of the pavement be detrimental to every carriage whether of trade or pleasure or convenience and that those who have allow so much of they attention to petition relate to the road of the kingdom the repair of some of which be almost every session thought of importance sufficient to produce debate in this house will not think the street of the capital alone unworthy of they regard that the present neglect of cleanse and pave the street be such as ought not to be bear that the passenger be every where either surprised and endanger by unexpected chasm or offended or obstruct by mountain of filth be well know to every one that have pass a single day in this great city and that this grievance be without remedy be a sufficient proof that no magistrate have at present power to remove it for every man 's private regard to he own ease and safety would incite he to exert he authority on this occasion i humbly propose therefore that a bill may be bring into the house to enable he majesty 's justice of peace for the liberty of westminster to inspect the publick way of this city and punish the neglect of cleanse and pave they or that a new officer be appoint and vest with full authority for the same purpose mr sandy speak next to this effect : -- sir i believe the grievance so much complain of by the right honorable member be not difficult to be remove without a new act of the legislature be perhaps more properly to be imputed to the negligence of the justice than a defect of they authority for they have already sufficient power to regulate this disorder : and i may be allow to hope sir that they do not want leisure to observe it for they number be so great that if we suppose they to be wholly engage by the common business of they office a foreigner would have occasion of reproach we with defect more important than want of delicacy and might justly censure we as a people corrupt beyond the common rate of human wickedness a nation divide only into two class magistrate and criminal but they in reality abound so much among we that most of they be only nominal magistrate vest with authority which they never exert or exert to bad purpose and which it be well if they be oblige to employ in the real service of they country by superintend the pavier and the scavenger for this reason it be unnecessary to erect a new officer as a inspector of we street since every office that be not necessary be pernicious be the consequence of this grievance such as they have be represent i should perhaps willingly erect a new office though i should not be surprise to hear the wisest man declare rather for a pestilence than a increase of officer as i neither think the grievance insupportable nor the method propose for remove it necessary or proper i declare myself against the motion lord gage speak in the follow manner : -- sir as the grievance can not be deny to be real and the motion therefore may reasonably be imagine to have be make without any other intention than of benefit the publick by a useful law i can not discover any sufficient reason for a rejection so peremptory and contemptuous that every man be disgusted and almost every man daily endanger in we street have not be deny nor will any man i suppose question what if he have not yet experience it he may perhaps be fully convince of in he next visit or excursion those evil which every man feel though slight be worthy of the attention of the legislature and that danger that threaten multitude though distant ought to be avert : for a small disorder like a small expense when it extend to multitude become a national affair but though this motion may perhaps be liable to some objection there be certainly no such absurdity to be find in it as may justify we in reject it without examination to reject a motion when it be first offer be a proof of prejudice next to that of reject it unheard it be to determine a question before it be discuss or can be fully understand mr sandy reply in substance as follow : -- sir i can not but differ very widely in opinion from the right honorable member that speak last with regard to the propriety of oppose a motion when it be first make a practice which i can by no means think inconsistent with either decency or prudence and which would perhaps be of use to the publick if it be more frequent when any motion be make it be subject to the consideration of this assembly and every member be at full liberty to examine and discuss it if it appear to deserve farther attention it may be admit but if the subject be either improper or unseasonable or the measure propose injudicious or dangerous it be then to be reject and if it be at last to be reject it be apparent that no time ought to be throw away upon it the hour and day and week that have be improfitably spend upon bill which after all we endeavor could not be pass the delay of real benefit to the publick which have be produce by long pursuit of shadowy advantage have incline I to a more expeditious method of proceeding and determine I speedily to reject what i can not hope to amend -lrb- the question be put pass in the negative 142 against 109 -rrb- house of common feb 27 1740-1 debate on the second reading of a bill to prevent inconveniency arise from insurance of ship the bill be read sir john barnard speak thus : -- sir there can not be bring before this house any question more difficult in themselves more entangled with a multiplicity of relation or more perplexed with a endless diversity of circumstance than those which relate to commercial affair affair on which the most experienced often disagree and on which the most sagacious may deceive themselves with erroneous conjecture there be no question sir which require so much personal knowledge of the subject to which they relate nor be there any subject with which so few gentleman in this house have have opportunity of be acquaint there be no question sir which they variety of relation to different person expose to be so easily misrepresent without detection nor any in which the opposition of particular interest so much incite a false representation in all these case deceit be easy and there be a strong temptation to deceive nor be these question sir always perplex by intentional fraud or false assertion of which they that utter they be themselves conscious those who deceive we do not always suppress any truth of which they be convinced nor set fact before we in any other light than that in which themselves behold they they for the most part err with a honest intention and propagate no mistake but those which they have themselves admit of this kind sir be doubtless the measure propose in the bill before we which those by whom they be promote may easily think to be of benefit to the publick but which i believe will appear the result of imperfect view and partial consideration the great and fundamental error sir of the patron of this bill seem to be a opinion that the practice of insure be not know to other nation nor can be carry on in any other place and from this principle they deduce consequence which if they be inevitably certain might easily influence we to a immediate approbation of the bill as necessary to secure we commerce and distress we enemy they conclude sir with sufficient justness that very few merchant would hazard they fortune in long voyage or distant commerce or expose themselves to the danger of war without the security which insurance afford they and have persuade themselves that such security be to be obtain from no other nation they imagine that we might by prohibit it confine all the foreign vessel in they port and destroy by one resolution the trade of both we rival and we enemy that we east indium company may desire the ratification of this bill i can not deny because they might perhaps receive from it some temporary advantage by the short inconveniency which those whom they consider as the enemy of they commerce would feel from it they may desire it because the experiment if it fail as it must can not injure they and if it succeed may produce great advantage to they : they may wish it because they will feel the immediate benefit and the detriment will fall upon other i shall not inquire whether we merchant be incline to look with malevolence on all those who cultivate the same branch of commerce with themselves though they have neither the violation of natural rights nor the infringement of national treaty to complain of i should be unwilling to suspect a british merchant whose acquaintance with the constitution of he own country ought to show he the value of liberty who ought to be above narrow scheme by the knowledge which he profession enable he to gain of a desire to encroach upon the rights of other or to engross the general benefit of nature and shall only observe that several other nation can plead a claim to the east indium trade a claim of equal validity with we own that the dane have they settlement there and that the portuguese discover the way to those region of wealth from which some perhaps be incline to exclude they but nothing be more vain than to attempt to exclude they by refuse to ensure they ship because the opinion that they can be insure by no other nation be entirely without foundation there be at this time office of insurance along the whole coast of the midland sea among the dutch and even among the french nothing can debar any nation from the trade of insurance but the want of money and that money be not want by foreigner for this purpose appear from the great sum which they have deposit in we fund that this trade be now carry on chiefly by this nation though not solely be incontestable but what can be infer from that but that we ought not to obstruct we own gain that we ought not to make a law to deprive ourselves of that advantage of which either favourable accident or we own sagacity have put we in possession for this reason it appear that it would not contribute to the wealth of the publick to debar we from insure the ship even of those with whom we be at war for it be always to be remember that they will receive no detriment from such prohibition nor will feel any other consequence from they than a necessity of transfer to some other nation the profit which we receive from it what the profit be which arise to the nation from the trade of insurance it be not possible exactly to determine but that the trade be really advantageous may be reasonably conceive because after many year ' experience it be diligently follow and a law be never necessary to prohibit the pursuit of a business by which nothing be to be gain but could the gain of the insurer be a doubtful point there be a certain advantage to the nation by the money pay for commission brokerage stamp and the credit of the premium deposit here i might add sir another considerable sum yearly arise to the government from the additional letter occasion by this trade which increase the revenue of the post-office without any deduction for additional charge that the loss of this profit and the gain of insure will ensue upon the ratification of this bill can not be deny nor do it appear that this loss will be counterbalance by any advantage that will be gain over we rival or we enemy whether this bill sir would produce to the merchant of that city by which it be promote the advantage which they expect from it or remove any of the grievance of which they complain i be not able positively to determine but know that it be not uncommon for merchant as well as other man to confound private with publick grievance and to imagine they own interest the interest of the nation with regard sir to the practice of insure _ interest or no interest _ as the term be when a imaginary value be put upon the ship or cargo often much above its real worth it can not be deny that some opportunity may be give by it for wicked practice but there will always be circumstance in which there can be no security against fraud but common faith nor do i see how we can secure the insurer against the possibility of be defraud i can not indeed discover sir how this method of insure can be prevent for how can the value of a cargo be estimate which be to be collect in a long voyage at different port and where the success of the adventurer often depend upon lucky accident which be indeed always hope for but seldom happen a imaginary value must therefore be fix upon when the ship leave the port because the success of that voyage can not be foreknow and the contracting party may be safely trust to set that value without any law to direct or restrain they if the merchant be oppress by any peculiar inconveniency and can find means of redress they without injure the publick commerce any proposal for that purpose ought to be favourably receive but as the bill now before we propose general restraint and propose to remove grievance which be not feel by remedy which those upon whom they be to operate do not approve i think it ought not to be refer to a committee but reject mr southwell speak next in term to this purpose : -- sir when i first propose this bill to the house i lament the absence of that honorable gentleman from whose discussion and argument i expect great information and for whose judgment in all commercial question i have the highest esteem as he penetration not only enable he to discover the consequence of method which have not yet be try but as he extensive acquaintance with many branch of trade can not but have inform he of the success of many expedient try as well in other nation as we own for the advancement of it trade sir be a subject of which it have be justly observe that very few gentleman have attain knowledge sufficient to qualify themselves to judge of the propriety of any new regulation and i can not but confess that i have no uncommon skill in these question what i have to offer on this occasion have be suggest to I not so much by my own observation as by the intelligence which i have very industriously seek and by which as i endeavored to inquire of those whose opinion be least likely to be pervert by they interest i hope i have not be mislead the merchant sir to whom it have be my fortune to apply have generally concur in the opinion that the present practice of insure be prejudicial to we commerce nor have i find any disagreement between my constituent and the trader of this great metropolis i be unwilling to imagine that there can be any evil for which the wisdom of this assembly can not discover a remedy and be therefore of opinion that if the grievance be real some expedient may be discover for remove it and that it be real i can not but be convince by the declaration of so many man who can have no interest in complain when they suffer nothing and whose known ability exempt they from the suspicion of impute any part of they uneasiness to a cause which can not produce it the bill before we sir require in my opinion some amendment and in its present state might perhaps produce more detriment than advantage but since it be necessary at least to attempt something for the relief of man so useful to this nation it appear to I necessary to form a committee and to deliberate on this subject with more attention mr lockwood speak next to the following effect : -- sir though i be not of opinion that the bill in its present state ought to be pass into a law yet i be far from think it so imperfect as not easily to be amend and therefore be desirous that it should be consider in a committee i have not indeed sir often observe that bill injudiciously draw up at first have receive great improvement from a second consideration and have find it more easy to form a new bill than to make alteration in one that be lay before we for some original error will commonly remain and the sentiment of different man pursue different view can seldom be model into one consistent scheme but i be far from consider this bill as one of those that can not be amend for i can discover but few objection to the regulation propose in it and those not relate to any of the essential part but slight and circumstantial such as will easily be remove or perhaps answer the grievance sir for which this bill propose a remedy be so generally know and so universally lament that i believe there be not any thing more worthy of the attention of the legislature than a inquiry into the cause of it and the proper method of redress it in we inquiry into the cause of this obstruction of trade i be of opinion sir that the practice of insure _ interest or no interest _ will appear to be the foundation of this general uneasiness it will be find a practice of so natural a tendency to fraud and so easily susceptible of dishonest artifice that i believe every member of this house will desire its suppression to confirm my assertion sir and illustrate the question before we i shall mention some particular instance of fraud to which this custom have give occasion of fraud so evident and so detestable that it can not be relate without indignation the royal george be a large ship belong to the south sea company which have be a voyage to vera cruz put in at jamaica in she return and be there refit to proceed on she voyage homewards set sail and come within a week 's sailing of the port when upon a sudden the officer enter into a consultation and determine to go back a month 's voyage to antigua for what reason sir may easily be guess when it be tell that a ship be insure upon a suppose value of sixty thousand pound this resolution sir be no sooner form than order be give to change the course and steer to antigua in opposition to all the remonstrance of the carpenter who be the proper judge of the condition of a vessel and who declare with honesty and resolution against they whole procedure but they pursue they new scheme without any regard to he murmur or assertion and when they arrive at antigua find some method of influence the officer of that island to declare the ship unfit for the prosecution of the voyage they design sir be now happily complete to confirm the determination which have be pronounce in they favor they strand the ship upon a bank of sand force out the iron that grapple the timber together and have first take away the mast and rigging and whatever else could be use or sell throw the ballast to each end and so break the vessel in the middle by this well-contrived shipwreck have as they imagine raise they fortune they come home triumphantly from they prosperous voyage and claim the money for which the ship be insure the insurer startle at a demand so unexpected inquire into the affair with all the industry which its importance might naturally incite and after some consultation determine to try whether the ship might not be refit and bring to britain in pursuance of this resolution they send workman and material and without much expense or any difficulty bring it hither i believe sir this relation be sufficient at once to prove the practice and explain the nature of the fraud to which this method of insurance give occasion but as the frequency of they be such that many instance may be produce i shall offer another short narrative of the same kind a ship that belong to the east indium company insure after this method be run ashore by the captain in such a manner that he imagine none but himself able to recover it and therefore though it cost five thousand pound sell it for five hundred but the purchaser no less expert than the captain find means very speedily to disengage it to restore it to a proper condition with little expense and be much enrich by he fortunate bargain i can not but observe sir that this kind of fraud be more formidable as it may be practice without a possibility of detection : have the captain instead of strand destroy he vessel how could he wickedness ever have be discover or how could the south sea company 's ship have be bring home have it be sink in some distant corner of the world this practice sir and the fraud which it have occasion and the suspicion which the easy practice of fraud always create have produce so many trial and fill the court of justice with such intricate contention that the judge who know perhaps nothing of this practice but from its effect have often declare it to be so pregnant with contest and cheat that it ought not to be suffer and that a law for suppress it would much contribute to the establishment of peace and the security of property i be not insensible sir of the force of the argument make use of by the honorable gentleman who speak in favor of this practice and can not but allow it that regard which he reasoning always deserve it be the strongest and perhaps the only argument that can be produce he assertion of the impossibility of estimate the real value of a ship or of foreknow the success of a voyage be incontestable : but perhaps it will follow from thence not that a imaginary value ought to be admit but that no insurance ought to be allow where there be no rational method of ascertain it or at least that all such insurance ought to be rather below the probable value than above it if the grievance complain of have be prove not to be imaginary we ought doubtless to consult how it may be remedy nor do i believe that we consultation will be ineffectual if we engage in they not with a intention to perplex but to inform each other i be of opinion sir that the importance of the question require a committee nor can i discover any essential defect in the bill which should hinder it from pass into a law mr burrell speak to this effect : -- sir i be convince by experience as well as reason that so many inconveniency arise from this method of insurance that it afford so many opportunity of fraud and give such encouragement to negligence that i shall willingly concur in any measure that may effectually suppress it it be sir too well know to require proof that interest be the parent of diligence and that man attend to the performance of they duty in proportion as they must suffer by the neglect of it and therefore every practice that deprive honesty of its reward be injurious to the publick but that this be the consequence of estimate ship at a imaginary value in the office of insurance be to the highest degree evident when a ship be estimate above its real value how will the commander suffer by a wreck or what shall restrain he from destroy he vessel when it may be do with security to himself except that integrity which indeed ought to be generally diffuse but which be not always to be find and to which few man think it safe to trust upon occasion of far less importance to show sir that i do not indulge groundless suspicion or magnify the bare possibility of fraud into reality that i do not blacken human nature or propose law against wickedness that have not yet exist it may be proper to mention some letter in which i have be inform by my correspondent at leghorn of the state of the ship which have arrive there ship so weakly man and so penuriously or negligently store so much decay in the bottom and so ill fit with rig that he declare he astonishment at they arrival it may deserve we consideration sir whether the success of the spanish privateer may not be in great part attribute to this pernicious practice whether captain when they vessel be insure for more than they value do not rashly venture into known danger whether they do not wilfully miss the security of convoy whether they do not direct they course where privateer may most securely cruise whether they do not surrender with less resistance than interest would excite and whether they do not raise clamor against the government for they ill success to avoid the suspicion of negligence or fraud that other fraud be commit in the practice of insure be well know to the honorable gentleman : it be a common practice to take money upon bottomry by way of pledge for the captain 's fidelity and to destroy this security by insure above the real value so that the captain may gain by neglect the care of he vessel or at least secure himself from loss and indulge he ease or he pleasure without any interruption from the fear of diminish he fortune the whole practice of insurance sir be in its present state i believe so perplexed with fraud and of such manifest tendency to the obstruction of commerce that it absolutely require some legal regulation sir john barnard then speak to this purpose : -- of fraud in the practice of insurance with regard to which the honorable gentleman have appeal to I i can confidently affirm that i be totally ignorant : i know not of any fraudulent practice openly carry on or establish by custom which i suppose be mean : for with regard to single act of fraud commit by particular man it be not to be suppose but that they have be detect in this as in all other branch of traffick : nor can i conceive that any argument can be draw from they against the practice for if every part of commerce be to be prohibit which have furnish villain with opportunity of deceit we shall contract trade into a narrow compass with regard sir to the instance of the royal george though the proceedings of the officer be not wholly to be vindicate yet part of they conduct be less inexplicable than it have be represent they return to antigua when they be bind for britain and be within a week 's sailing of they port be easily to be defend if the wind be contrary to they intended course for it be not difficult to conceive that they might reach a distant port with a favourable wind much sooner than one much nearer with the wind against they i have always observe sir that the gentleman engage in the trade to the east indy assume a air of superiority to which i know not what claim they can produce and seem to imagine that they charter give they more extensive knowledge and more acute sagacity than fall to the lot of man not combine in they association but however these gentleman may disapprove my argument and however they may misrepresent they i shall be satisfy that they will have with the disinterested and impartial they just weight and that this affair will not be hastily determine upon a imperfect examination sir robert walpole reply to this effect : -- whether the merchant be satisfy with the present method of insure or what be the opinion of any separate body of man i think it absolutely unnecessary to inquire we be constitute for the publick advantage and be engage by we senatorial character to consider not the private interest of particular man but the general advantage of we country in we pursuit sir of national interest we shall be oblige frequently to oppose the scheme which private man or separate fraternity have form for they own advantage and which they may be expect to defend with all they art both because every man be unwilling to imagine that the publick interest and he own be opposite and because it be to be fear that many may consider the publick only in subordination to themselves and be very little solicitous about the general prosperity of they country provide none of the calamity which afflict it extend they influence to themselves we be in the discussion of this question sir to consider that we be engage in a war against a nation from which insult depredation oppression and cruelty have be long complain of and against which we be therefore to act with a resolution proportion to the injury which we have suffer and to we desire of vengeance we be to practice every method of distressing they and to promote the success of we arm even at the expense of present gain and the interest of private man it be well know sir to all who have either hear or read of the spaniard that they live in carelessness and indolence neglect all the natural advantage of they own country despise the gain of foreign commerce and depend wholly on they american settlement for all the convenience and perhaps for most of the necessaries of life this be the particular circumstance that make a war with britain so much to be dread by they a nation superior to they by sea hold they besiege like a garrison surround by a army preclude they from supplies intercept they succor and if it can not force they wall by attack can at least by a blockade starve they to a capitulation thus sir by a naval war with a enemy of superior strength they must at length be subdue and subdue perhaps without a battle and without the possibility of resistance against such a enemy they courage or they discipline be of no use they may form army indeed but which can only stand upon the shore to defend what they enemy have no intention of invade and see those ship seize in which they pay be treasured or they provision be store such sir be we natural superiority over the spaniard a species of superiority that must inevitably prevail if it be not defeat by we own folly and surely a more effectual method of defeat it the spaniard themselves could not have discover than that of insure they ship among we merchant when a ship thus insure be take which notwithstanding all precaution must sometimes happen we examine the cargo find it extremely valuable and triumph in we success we not only count the gain to ourselves but the loss to we enemy and determine that a small number of such capture will reduce they to offer we peace upon we own term such be the conclusion which be make and make with reason by man unacquainted with the secret practice of we merchant and who do not suspect we to be stupid enough to secure we enemy against ourselves but it be often find upon a more close examination that we ship of war have only plundered we merchant and that we privateer may indeed have enrich themselves but impoverish they country it be discover that the loss of the spaniard be to be repay and perhaps sometimes with interest by the british insurer if it be urge that we ought not to enact any law which may obstruct the gain of we fellow-subject may it not be ask why all trade with spain be prohibit may not the trade be equally gainful with the insurance and may not the gain be more generally distribute and therefore be more properly national but this trade be prohibit because it be more necessary to we enemy than to ourselves it be prohibit because the law of war require that a less evil should be suffer to inflict a greater it be upon this principle that every battle be fight and that we fire we own ship to consume the navy of the enemy for this reason sir it appear to I evident beyond contradiction that the insurance of spanish ship ought to be prohibit : we shall indeed lose the profit of the insurance but we shall be reimburse by the capture which be a argument that can not be produce for the prohibition of commerce it be urge sir that they may insure they ship in other country a assertion of which whether it be true or not i be not able to decide but it be acknowledge that the necessity of establish new correspondence will be at least a temporary obstruction of they trade and a obstruction of even a short continuance may lay they at we mercy but let we sir reflect upon the weakness of this argument -- _ they must be allow to insure here because they may insure in other place _ will it not be equally just to urge that _ they must trade with we because they may trade with other nation _ and may it not be answer that though we can not wholly suspend they commerce it be yet we business to obstruct it as far as we be able may it-not sir be farther affirm that by insure in other nation they may injure they ally by fall into we hand but do not the less benefit we that if they do not grow weaker we at least be strengthened but that by insure among we whatever step be take the equilibrium of the war be preserved always the same it be assert and i suppose with truth that we insure at a lower rate than other and it will therefore follow that the spaniard whenever they ship shall escape we will suffer more by having-insured amongst foreigner than if they have contract with we merchant thus it appear sir that there be stronger reason for prohibit the insurance of spanish ship than for put a stop to we commerce with they and that whether they ship be take by we or escape we it be the general interest of the nation that they shall be insure by foreign merchant with respect sir to the east indium company i have no regard to they interest consider as distinct from that of the rest of the nation nor have receive any solicitation from they to promote this bill or to espouse they interest but can not without conceal my real sentiment deny that as they have the grant of a exclusive trade to the east indy to insure the ship that be send thither without they permission be to invade they rights and to infringe they charter and that the practice if the validity of they charter be admit be illegal and ought to be discountenance the practice sir of insure _ interest or no interest _ or of assign to ship a imaginary value be nothing more than a particular game a mere solemn species of _ hazard _ and ought therefore to be prohibit for every reason that can be urge against game of chance with regard to this bill in general it be in my opinion highly necessary nor can i discover any important objection that can be make against it some law of this kind and to this purpose i have long intend to offer to the consideration of this assembly and since it be now before we i think we ought to consider it with the attention which may be justly expect from we lord baltimore speak thus : -- sir i know not how properly the practice of insure may be term a species of hazard nor do i think any thing more be to be consider than whether the game be gainful to the nation or not for i can not discover that there be any absurdity in enrich ourselves at the expense of other nation whether enemy or ally that we ought to prefer the general good to the advantage of individual be undoubted but i can not conceive that in this case there can be any opposition between private and publick interest if we insurer gain by secure the ship of we enemy the nation be benefit for all national gain must circulate through the hand of individual no man will assert that we ought to assist we enemy nor will any man imagine that we assist they by impoverish they and if we insurer gain by they practice the spaniard must undoubtedly be loser mr willimot speak next to the follow purpose : -- sir i have converse on the question to which this bill relate with man engage in various kind of traffick and who have no common interest but that of they country i have disperse among the merchant most eminent for they acquaintance with the whole extent of commerce and for they knowledge of the true interest of the nation copy of this bill and can not find any of they so sensible of the grievance of which we have so loud complaint as to desire that it should be redress by the measure now propose that fraud be practice on every side in this as well as in other trade the general corruption of we age give we sufficient reason to suspect but what be common to every sort of traffick can not be produce as a argument for the prohibition of any that the practice of insure a imaginary value may give opportunity for greater fraud than can be practice in common dealings be likewise evident but i can not discover such fraud to require the interposition of the legislature if they be practice only by those of we own nation the publick do not suffer for property be only transfer from one subject to another : the fraud ought indeed to be severely punish in the court of criminal justice but the custom which give the opportunity of practise it ought not to be restrain any more than any other profession not criminal in itself but liable to accidental abuse if we insurer be defraud by foreigner the nation be then indeed more nearly affect but even in that case it be to be remember that the private interest of the insurer who must be immediately ruin be a sufficient security for the publick for it can not sir be conceive that any man will obstinately carry on a business by which he become every day poorer or that when he desist he will be succeed by another who can not but know that he engage in that traffick to he certain ruin the true state of this affair be that fraud be indeed often committed and be for that reason always suspect and that the insurer when they insure the ship and cargo against accident reckon among other chance the probability of be cheat and proportion they demand not only to the length and danger of the voyage but to the character likewise of the man with whom they contract this sir be always the practice of those whom experience have make acquaint with the danger of implicit confidence and unsuspecting credulity nor do any but the young and unskilful suffer themselves to be so expose to fraud as that they fortune should be injure or the general gain of they business overbalance by a few deceit thus it appear that notwithstanding the ease and safety with which the present method of insurance admit fraud to be practice the insurer by a proportionate degree of caution secure themselves from be injure and by consequence the nation the insurance of foreign ship be now to be consider by which great profit arise to the nation we insure sir as it have be observe at lower rate than other nation because we have more business of this kind and the smallness of we profit be compensate by the frequency the cheapness of insurance and eagerness of foreigner to insure here reciprocally contribute to each other we be often apply to because we insure at a easy rate and we can insure at a easy rate because we be often apply to nor be the cheapness of british insurance the only motive to the preference which it preserve among foreigner who be induce to apply to this nation by the reputation which we merchant have deservedly gain for probity and punctuality superior to that of any other trader we merchant sir bargain without artifice pay without subterfuge and be ready on all occasion to preserve they character at the hazard of they profit from these two consideration we may draw unanswerable argument against any restraint upon the practice of insure : if foreigner be once disappoint in they application to we we business will in a great part cease and as we shall not then be able to insure at lower rate than other nation we shall never recover that branch of we trade and as the character of the british merchant exempt they from any suspicion of practice pernicious to the publick why should they be restrain why sir should they appear to be suspect by the legislature of they own country whom foreigner trust without hesitation it have be object to they with great warmth and urge with much rhetorical exaggeration that they assist the enemy of they country that they prolong the war and defeat those advantage which we situation and commerce have give we imputation sufficiently atrocious if they be found upon truth but let we sir examine the argument by which this accusation have be support and inquire whether this triumph of eloquence have be occasion by any real superiority of evidence or reason it be urge that we have already prohibit commerce with the spaniard and that therefore we ought likewise to prohibit the insurance of they ship it will not require sir a imagination very fertile or a knowledge very extensive to supply argument sufficient to refute the suppose demonstration in opposition to which it may be urge that this kind of commerce be of a peculiar nature that it subsist upon opinion and be preserve by the reputation of we insurer a reputation that the insurer of other nation may obtain by the same means and from whom we shall therefore never recover it it may be observe sir that other commodity be the peculiar product of different country and that there be no danger of lose we other trade by suspend it because it depend upon the excellence of we manufacture but that insurance may be the commodity of any country where money and common honesty be to be find this argument may perhaps be yet more effectually invalidate or perhaps entirely subvert by deny the expedience of that prohibition which be produce as a precedent for another restraint nor indeed do it appear why we should preclude ourselves from a gainful trade because the money be draw by it out of the hand of we enemy or why the product of we land should lie unconsumed or we manufacture stand unemployed rather than we should sell to we enemy what they will purchase at another place or by the intervention of a neutral power to sell to a enemy that which may enable he to injure we that which he must necessarily obtain and which he could buy from no other would indeed be to the last degree absurd but that may surely be sell they without any breach of morality or policy which they can want with less inconvenience than we can keep if we be besiege a town i should not advise we soldier to sell to the inhabitant ammunition or provision but can not discover the folly of admit they to purchase ornament for they house or brocade for they lady but without examine with the utmost accuracy whether the late prohibition be rational or not i have i hope suggest objection sufficient to make the question doubtful and to incline we to try the success of one experiment before we venture upon another more hazardous i be never willing sir to load trade with restraint trade be in its own nature so fugitive and variable that no constant course can be prescribe to it and those regulation which be proper when they be make may in a few month become difficulty and obstruction we well know that many of the measure which we ancestor pursue for the encouragement of commerce have be find of pernicious consequence and even in this age which perhaps experience more than wisdom have enlighten i have know few attempt of that kind which have not defeat the end for which they be make it be more prudent to leave the merchant at liberty to pursue those measure which experience shall dictate upon every occasion and suffer they to snatch the present opportunity of honest gain whenever it shall happen they will never injure they own interest by the use of this liberty and by preserve themselves they will preserve the nation from detriment nor will they need to be restrain by a law propose without they solicitation and of which they can not discover any beneficial consequence mr horace walpole speak next to this purpose : -- sir for the bill now before we i have no particular fondness nor desire that it should be promote by any other means than rational argument and the representation of indubitable fact i have no regard sir in this inquiry to any private interest or any other desire than that of secure the interest of my country which in my opinion evidently require that we should give no assistance to we enemy that we merchant should cooperate with we navy and that we should endeavor to withhold every thing that may make the war less burdensome to they and consequently of longer continuance it be observe sir in the beginning of the debate by a gentleman eminently skilled in mercantile affair that insurance be practice by many nation but he do not inform we of what one of the clause make it proper to inquire whether they allow the method of insure _ interest or no interest _ and rating ship at a imaginary value this be i know prohibit by the dutch a nation whose authority on commercial question will not be dispute nor do they allow they east indian ship to be insure at all the difficulty of estimate the value of any cargo have be urge in defense of this practice nor be the defense wholly without weight because the cargo in many voyage can not be ascertain i shall however take this opportunity of observe though i may somewhat digress from the present argument how necessary it be that some of we export cargo should be exactly specify i have be lately inform sir that six ship laden with british wool have enter at one time into a port of france nor do i know how this practice which be justly complain of as pernicious to we trade and threaten the ruin of we country can be prevent but by a constant and regular particularization of every cargo carry to france i admit sir that some cargo which be import can not be particularly register such be the gold with which we be daily supply by we commerce with the portuguese in opposition to they law and which we merchant be therefore under the necessity of conceal it be not indeed easy to foresee all the inconveniency that may arise from new regulation of commerce but the difficulty be not so great as have be represent nor can i conceive why all we consultation on trade should be without effect gentleman may obtain some knowledge of commerce from they own observation which they may enlarge by a unconfined and indifferent conversation with trader of various class and by inquiry into the different branch of commerce inquiry sir which be generally neglect by those whose employment confine they attention to particular part of commerce or whose application to business hinder they from attend to any opinion but those which they own personal experience enable they to form from these information impartially collect and diligently compare a man not engage in the profession of a merchant may form general principle and draw consequence more certain and more extensive in they relation than those which be strike out only from the observation of one subdivide species of commerce a member of this house sir thus enlighten by inquiry and whose judgment be not divert from its natural rectitude by the impulse of any private consideration may judge of any commercial debate with less danger of error or partiality than the merchant of whom nevertheless i have the highest esteem and whose knowledge or probity i do not intend to depreciate when i declare my fear that they may sometimes confound general maxim of trade with the opinion of particular branch and sometimes mistake they own gain for the interest of the publick the interest of the merchant ought indeed always to be consider in this house but then it ought to be regard only in subordination to that of the whole community a subordination which the gentleman who speak last seem to have forget he may perhaps not intend long to retain he senatorial character and therefore deliver he opinion only as a merchant he have distinguish between the conduct of experienced and unskilful insurer with how much justice i shall not determine i be afraid that a vigorous inquiry would discover that neither age nor youth have be able to resist strong temptation to some practice which neither law nor justice can support and that those whose experience have make they cautious have not be always equally honest but this be a subject upon which i be not incline to dwell and only mention as the reason which convince I of the propriety of the bill before we sir william yonge speak to this effect : -- sir there appear no probability that the different opinion which have be form of this bill will be reconcile by this debate nor indeed be there any reason for wonder at this contrariety of sentiment the several clause of the bill have relation and consequence so different that scarce any one man can approve they all and in we present deliberation a objection to a particular clause be consider as a argument against the whole bill it be therefore necessary to prevent a unprofitable expense of time to resolve the house into a committee in which the bill may be consider by single clause and that part which can not be defend may be reject and that only retain which deserve we approbation in the committee when we have consider the first clause and hear the objection against it we may mend it or if it can not be amend reject or postpone it and so proceed through the whole bill with much greater expedition and at the same time with a more diligent view of every clause than while we be oblige to take the whole at once into we consideration i shall for my part approve some clause and make objection to other but think it proper to reserve my objection and the reason of my approbation for the committee into which we ought to go on this occasion -lrb- the bill be refer to a committee but not forty member stay in the house it be drop -rrb- house of common march 2 1740-1 debate on the bill for the encouragement and increase of seaman the bill be order to be read the second time and to be print for the use of the member that it might be thoroughly examine and understand on the forty-fourth day the second reading of the bill be postpone to the fiftieth but the grand motion be debate on that day nothing else be hear on the fifty-first it be again put off but on the fifty-sixth day be read a second time it be after some opposition refer to a committee of the whole house to sit five day after in the meanwhile on the fifty-seventh it be order that the proper officer do lay before this house a account of what person be authorize by virtue of the act in the 4th of queen anne for the encouragement and increase of seaman and for the better and speedier man she fleet to conduct seaman or seafaring man take upon privy search make by application to justice and what number of seaman or seafaring man be return also the charge attend the same on the sixty-first day move that the say account should be read which be do the house resolve itself into a grand committee on the present bill and the first clause be read propose the blank to be fill thus : that every volunteer seaman after five year ' service be entitle to six pound per year during life sir john barnard rise and speak as follow : -- sir as it be we duty to provide law by which all fraud and oppression may be punish when they be detect we be no less oblige to obviate such practice as shall make punishment necessary nor be we only to facilitate the detection but take away as far as it be possible the opportunity of guilt it be to no purpose that punishment be threaten if they can be evade or that reward be offer if they may by any mean artifice be withhold for this reason sir i think it necessary to observe that the intent of this clause the most favourable and alluring clause in the bill may lose its effect by a practice not uncommon by which any man however incline to serve he country may be defraud of the right of a volunteer many man have voluntarily apply to the officer of ship of war and after have be reject by they as unfit for the service have be drag on board within a few day perhaps within a few hour afterwards to undergo all the hardship without the merit of volunteer when any man sir have be reject by the sea officer he ought to have a certificate give he which shall be a exemption from a impress that if any other commander shall judge more favourably of he qualification he may always have the privilege of a volunteer and be entitle to the reward which he deserve by he readiness to enter the service if such provision be not make this hateful practice a practice sir common and notorious and very discourage to such as would enter the service of the publick may so far prevail that no man shall be able to denominate himself a volunteer or claim the reward propose by the bill admiral wager speak next to the following effect : -- sir it be not common for man to receive injury without apply for redress when it may certainly be obtain if any proceedings like those which be now complain of have be mention at the board of admiralty they have be immediately censure and redress but as no such accusation be offer i think it may probably be conclude that no such crime have be commit for what purpose oppression of this kind should be practice it be not easy to conceive for the officer be not at all reward for impress sailor as therefore it be not probable that any man act wickedly or cruelly without temptation : as i have never hear any such injury complain of by those that suffer it i can not but imagine that it be one of those report which arise from mistake or be forge by malice to injure the officer and obstruct the service lord baltimore rise next and speak to the following effect : -- that the practice now complain of sir be very frequent and whatever may be the temptation to it such as every day produce some instance of i have reason for assert with great confidence i have within these few day as i be accidentally upon the river inform myself of two waterman ignominiously drag by force into the service to which they have voluntarily offer themselves a few day before the reason of such oppression it be the business of those gentleman to inquire whom he majesty intrust with the care of he fleet but to interrupt the course of wickedness to hinder it from frustrate the reward offer by the publick be the province of the representative of the people and i hope sir some proviso will be make in this case admiral norri rise and say : -- sir if any such practice have be frequent to what can it be imputed that those who employ they life in maritime business should be stranger to they why have no complaint be make by those that have be injure or why should officer expose themselves to the hazard of censure without advantage i can not discover why these hardship should be inflict nor how they could have be conceal and therefore think the officer of the navy may be clear from the imputation without farther inquiry sir john barnard speak again to the follow purpose : -- sir it be in vain that objection be make if the fact upon which they be found may be deny at pleasure : nothing be more easy than to deny because proof be not require of a negative but as negative require no proof so they have no authority nor can any consequence be deduce from they i might therefore suffer the fact to remain in they present state assert on one side by those that have reason to believe they and doubt on the other without reason for surely he can not be say to reason who question a assertion only because he do not know it to be true but as every question by which the liberty of a briton may be affect be of importance sufficient to require that no evidence should be suppress by which it may be clear i can not but think it proper that a committee should be form to examine the conduct of the officer in this particular and in confidence of the veracity of those from whom i receive my information i here promise to produce such evidence as shall put a end to controversy and doubt if this be not grant sir the fact must stand record and allow for to doubt and refuse evidence be a degree of prejudice and obstinacy without example nor be this the only objection to the clause before we which appear very imperfect with regard to the qualification specify as a title to the reward the reward ought not to be confine to those who shall hereafter be invite by the promise of it to engage in the service while those who enter into it without any such prospect be condemn to danger and fatigue without a recompense where merit be equal the reward ought to be equal and surely where there be greater merit the reward propose by the senate as a encouragement to bravery ought not to be less to be exclude from the advantage which other have obtain only by avoid the service can not but depress the spirit of those whose zeal and courage incite they at the beginning of the war to enter into the fleet and to deject those from whom we expect defense and honor be neither prudent nor just nor be it in my opinion proper to offer the same reward indiscriminately to all that shall accept it reward ought to be proportion to desert and no man can justly be pay for what he can not perform there ought therefore to be some distinction make between a seaman by profession one that have learn he art at the expense of long experience labor and hazard and a man who only enter the ship because he be useless on land and who can only incommode the sailor till he have be instruct by they it appear sir to I a considerable defect in we naval regulation that wages be not proportion to ability and i think it may not be now unseasonably propose that sailor should be pay accord to the skill which they have acquire a provision by which a emulation would be raise among they and that industry excite which now languish for want of encouragement and those capacity awaken which now slumber in ignorance and sloth from the despair of obtain any advantage by superiority of knowledge sir robert walpole then rise and speak as follow : -- that this charge sir however positively urge be generally unjust the declaration of these honorable gentleman be sufficient to evince since it be not probable that the injured person would not have find some friend to have represent these hardship to the admiralty and no such representation could have be make without they knowledge yet sir i be far from doubt that by accident or perhaps by malice some man have be treat in this manner for it be not in the power of any administration to make all those honest or wise whom they be oblige to employ and when great affair be depend minute circumstance can not always be attend to if the vigilance of those who be intrust with the chief direction of great number of subordinate officer be such that corrupt practice be not frequent and they justice such that they be never unpunished when legally detect the most strict inquirer can expect no more power will sometimes be abused and punishment sometimes be escape it be sir easy to be conceive that a report may become general though the practice be very rare the fact be multiply as often as it be related and every man who hear the same story twice imagine that it be tell of different person and exclaim against the tyranny of the officer of the navy but these in my opinion sir be question if not remote from the present affair yet by no means essential to it the question now before we be not what illegality have be commit in the execution of impress but how impress themselves may become less necessary how the nation may be secure without injury to individual and how the fleet may be man with less detriment to commerce sir the reward now propose be intend to excite man to enter the service without compulsion and if this expedient be not approve another ought to be suggest : for i hope gentleman be unite in they endeavor to find out some method of security to the publick and do not obstruct the proceedings of the committee that when the fleet lie inactive and useless they may have a opportunity to reproach the ministry admiral norri speak next in substance : -- sir though it be not necessary to enter into a accurate examination of the gentleman 's proposal yet i can not but observe that by make it he discover himself unacquainted with the disposition of seaman among whom nothing raise so much discontent as the suspicion of partiality should one man in the same rank receive larger wages than another he who think himself injure as he who be pay less will always think would be so far from exert he ability to attain a equality with he associate that he would probably never be prevail on to lay he hand upon the tackle but would sit sullen or work perversely though the ship be labor in a storm or sinking in a battle mr gore then speak as follow : -- sir the danger of introduce distinction among man in the same rank where every man that imagine he merit neglect may have a opportunity of resent the injury be doubtless such as no prudent commander will venture to incur every man in this case become the judge of he own merit and as he will always discover some reason for the preference of another very different from superiority of desert he will by consequence be either enraged or dispirited will either resolve to desert he commander or betray he to the enemy or not oppose they i remember sir though imperfectly a story which i hear in my travels of a army in which some troops receive a penny a day less than the rest a parsimony which cost dear in the day of battle for the disgusted troops lay down they arm before the enemy and suffer they general to be cut in piece general wade then speak to this effect : -- sir i can not but concur with the honorable gentleman in he opinion that those who be already engage in the service who have bear the fatigue of a long voyage and perhaps be at this hour expose they life in battle to defend the rights of they country ought to have the same claim to the reward propose with those who shall hereafter offer themselves nor in my opinion ought those who have hitherto be press into we fleet to be discourage from they duty by a exclusion from the same advantage for if they be compel to serve in the fleet they be compel when there be not this encouragement for volunteer which perhaps they would have accept if it have be then propose every man at least will allege that he would have accept it and complain he suffer only by the fault of the government a government which he will not be very zealous to defend while he be consider with less regard than other from whom no greater service be expect a prospect of new reward sir will add new alacrity to all the force and a equal distribution of favor will secure a unshaken and inviolable fidelity nothing but union can produce success and nothing can secure union but impartiality and justice mr sandy rise and speak as follow : -- sir the efficacy of reward and the necessity of a impartial distribution be no unfruitful subject for rhetorick but it may perhaps be more useful at present to consider with such a degree of attention as the question must be acknowledge to deserve to whom these reward be to be pay and from what fund they be expect to arise with regard to those who be to claim the reward sir they seem very negligently specify for they be distinguish only by the character of have serve five year a distinction unintelligible without explanation it be i suppose sir the intent of the bill that no man shall miss the reward but by he own fault and therefore it may be inquire what be to be the fate of he who shall be disabled in he first adventure whom in the first year or month of he service a unlucky shot shall confine for the remain part of he life to inactivity : as the bill be now form he must be miserable without a recompense and he wound which make he unable to support himself will though receive in defense of he country entitle he to no support from the publick nor be this the only difficulty that may arise from the specify of so long a service for how can any man that shall enter on board the fleet be inform that the war will continue for five year may we not all justly hope that alacrity unanimity and prudence may in a much shorter time reduce we enemy to beg for peace and shall we sailor lose the reward of they hazard and they labor only because they have be successful what will this be less than make they bravery a crime or folly and punish they for not protract the war by cowardice or treachery but let we suppose sir those defect supply by a more explicit and determinate specification there will yet arise a objection far more formidable a objection which the present state of we revenue will not suffer to be answer the consideration of the greatness of the annual payment which this proposal require ought to incite every man to employ all he sagacity in search of some other method equally efficacious and less expensive we have already sir forty thousand seaman in we pay to whom eight thousand more be speedily to be add : when each of these shall demand he stipend a new burden of two hundred and eighty-eight thousand pound must be lay upon the nation upon a nation whose land be mortgage whose revenue be anticipate and whose tax can not be bear without murmur nor increase without sedition the nation have find by experience that tax once impose for just reason and continue upon plausible pretence till they be become familiar be afterwards continue upon motive less laudable be too productive of influence and too instrumental towards facilitate the measure of the ministry to be ever willingly remit mr bladen speak next as follow : -- sir it be obvious that when the balance be unequal it may be reduce to a equilibrium as well by take weight out of one scale as add it to the other the wages offer by the merchant overbalance at present those which be propose by the crown to raise the allowance in the ship of war will be to lay new load upon the publick and will incommode the merchant whose wages must always bear the same proportion to the king 's the only method then that remain be to lighten the opposite scale by restrain the merchant from give wages in time of war beyond a certain value for as the service of the crown be then more immediately necessarv to the general advantage than that of the merchant it ought to be make more gainful sailor sir be not generally man of very extensive view and therefore we can not expect that they should prefer the general good of they country before they own present interest a motive of such power that even in man of curious research refine sentiment and generous education we see too often that it surmount every other consideration lord baltimore then speak again : -- sir to the expedient which the honorable gentleman who speak last have suggest and which he must be confess to have place in the strongest light many objection may be raise which i be afraid will not easily be remove the first sir which occur to I on this short reflection be not less than the impossibility of put he scheme in execution the prescription of wages which he propose may be elude by a thousand artifice by advanced money by gratuitous acknowledgment the payment of money for pretended service or by secret contract which it would be the interest of both party to conceal but if this objection could be surmount by severity and vigilance would not this expedient help to defeat the general intention of the bill a bill not design as a immediate resource a mere temporary project to supply we fleet for the present year but as a method for remove the only obstruction of the british power the difficulty of man we ship of war it be i hope sir the intention of every man who have offer he sentiment on this occasion to contrive some general encouragement for seaman which shall not only invite they to assist they country at the first summons but shall allure other to qualify themselves for the publick service by engage in the same profession this be only to be do by make the condition of sailor less miserable by entitle they to privilege and honor they with distinction but by limit the merchant 's wages if such limitation be indeed possible though we may palliate the present distress we shall diminish the number of sailor and thereby not only contract we commerce but endanger we country mr tracey speak next to the following effect : -- sir i know not for what reason the present method of advance reward at entrance be practice of which however specious it might appear the success by no means encourage the continuance the sailor though not a generation of man much dispose to reflection or qualify for ratiocination be not yet so void of think as not easily to perceive that a small increase of constant wages be of more value than several pound to be pay only at once and which be squander as soon as they be receive instead therefore of restrain the wages of the merchant it seem probable that by raise those of the king we may man the fleet with most expedition and one method of raise the wages will be to suppress the advanced money the attorney-general speak next : -- sir if the sum of money now pay by way of advance can be suppose to have any effect if it can be imagine that any number of seaman however inconsiderable be allure by it into the fleet it be more usefully employ than it can be suppose to be when sink into the current wages and divide into small payment the advance money be only pay to those that enter : if no volunteer present themselves no money be pay and the nation doth not suffer by the offer : but if the wages be raise the expense will be certain without the certainty of advantage for those that enter voluntarily into the fleet will receive no more than those that be force into it by a impress and therefore there will be no incitement to enter without compulsion thus every other inconvenience will remain with the addition of a new burden to the nation we force will be maintain at a greater expense and not raise with less difficulty lord baltimore say : -- sir i can not but concur in opinion with the honorable gentleman who speak last from my own acquaintance with the sentiment and habit that unalterably prevail among those who have be accustom to the sea a race of man to the last degree negligent of any future event and careless about any provision against distant evil man who have no thought at sea but how to reach the land nor at land but how to squander what they have gain at sea to man like these it may easily be imagine that no encouragement be equal to the temptation of present gain and the opportunity of present pleasure of this any man sir may convince himself who shall talk to a crew but half a hour for he shall find few among they who will not for a small sum of present money sell any distant prospect of affluence or happiness whether i be mistake in my opinion the honorable member who have long command in the naval service can easily determine and i doubt not but they will agree that no motive can be propose to a sailor equivalent to immediate reward sir william yonge speak next : -- sir that some distinction ought to be make to the advantage of volunteer if we intend to man we fleet without compulsion be obvious and incontestable and to avoid the necessity of compulsion ought to be the chief end of this bill for nothing can be less to the advantage of the nation than to continue the use of such ungrateful method and yet increase the publick expense we ought therefore in my opinion to determine upon some peculiar reward either to be advance upon they entrance into the service or pay at they dismission from it but as i see sir no reason for hope that all the encouragement which can be offer will raise volunteer in a sufficient number to secure we navigation and assert we sovereignty it seem not proper to confine we consultation to this part of the bill for since compulsion be on many occasion apparently necessary some method require to be consider in which it may be legal what new power ought to be place in the magistrate for what time and with what restriction i be far from assume the province of determine but that some measure must be take for compelling those who can not be persuade and discover those that will not offer themselves can not admit of doubt and as the magistrate be at present without any authority for this purpose it be evident that he power must be extend for the same reason as it be give in its present degree -- the general benefit of the whole community sir john barnard then speak to the following effect : -- sir if the intent of this bill be to enable one part of the nation to enslave the other if the plausible and invite profession of encouraging and increase seaman be to terminate in violence constraint and oppression it be unnecessary to dwell longer upon particular clause the intention of the bill be detestable and deserve not the ceremony of debate or the form of common regard if a man sir be liable to be force from the care of he own private affair from he favorite scheme of life from the engagement of domestick tenderness or the prospects of near advantage and subject without he consent to the command of one whom he hate or dread or perhaps despise it require no long argument to show that by whatever authority he be thus treat he be reduce to the condition of a slave to that abject to that hateful state which every englishman have be teach to avoid at the hazard of he life it be therefore evident that a law which tend to confer such a power subvert we constitution as far as its effect extend a constitution which be originally form as a barrier against slavery and which one age after another have endeavor to strengthen such a power therefore in whatever hand it may be lodge i shall always oppose it be dangerous sir to intrust any man with absolute dominion which be seldom know to be impartially exercise and which often make those corrupt and insolent whom it find benevolent and honest the bill propose only encouragement and encouragement may be give by he majesty without a new law let we therefore draw up a address and cease to debate where there be no prospect of agreement mr winnington speak as follow : -- sir the payment of a annual salary will in my opinion be to the last degree inconvenient and dangerous the yearly expense have be already estimate and arise to a sum very formidable in we present state nor be the necessity of add to the publick burden a burden which already be hard to be bear the only objection to this proposal nothing can more contribute to dispirit the nation than to protract the consequence of a war and to make the calamity feel when the pleasure of victory and triumph have be forget we shall be inclined rather to bear oppression and insult than endeavor after redress if we subject ourselves and we posterity to endless exaction the expense of the present provision for superannuated and disabled sailor be no inconsiderable tax upon the publick which be not less burden by it for the manner of collect it by a deduction from the sailor ' wages for whoever pay it immediately it be the ultimate gift of the nation and the utmost that can be allow for this purpose it must be confess sir the person entitle to the pension be not sufficiently distinguish in the bill by which as it now stand any of the worthless superfluity of a ship even the servant of the captain may after five year put in they demand and plunder that nation which they never serve nor do i think sir the efficacy of this method will bear any proportion to the expense of it for i be of opinion that few of the sailor will be much affect by the prospect of a future pension i be therefore for dazzling they with five pound to be give they at they entrance which will be but a single payment and probably fill we fleet with greater expedition than method which appear more refined and the effect of deeper meditation lord gage speak in the follow manner : -- sir nothing be more clear than that a yearly pension will burden the nation without any advantage and as it will give occasion to innumerable fraud it be a method which ought to be reject as to the new power sir which be propose to be place in the hand of the magistrate it undoubtedly reduce every sailor to a state of slavery and be inconsistent with that natural right to liberty which be confirm and secure by we constitution the bill therefore be in my opinion defective in all its part of a tendency generally pernicious and can not be amend but by reject it mr henry pelham speak next to this effect : -- sir i can not but think it necessary that on this occasion at least gentleman should remit the ardor of disputation and lay the art of rhetorick aside that they should reserve they wit and they satire for question of less importance and unite for once they endeavor that this affair may meet with no obstruction but from its natural difficulty we be now sir engage in a war with a nation if not of the first rank in power yet by no means contemptible in itself and by its alliance extremely formidable we be expose by the course of we trade and the situation of we enemy to many inevitable loss and have no means of prevent we merchant from be seize without any danger or expense to the spaniard but by cover the sea with we squadron nor be we sir to satisfy ourselves with barely defeat the design of the spaniard we honor demand that we should force they to peace upon advantageous term that we should not repulse but attack they not only preserve we own trade and possession but endanger theirs it be by no means certain sir that in the prosecution of these design we shall not be interrupt by the interest or jealousy of a nation far more powerful whose force we ought therefore to be able to resist a vigorous exertion of we strength will probably either intimidate any other power that may be incline to attack we or enable we to repel the injury that shall be offer : discord and delay can only confirm we open enemy in they obstinacy and animate those that have hitherto conceal they malignity to declare against we it be therefore sir in no degree prudent to aggravate the inconveniency of the measure propose for accomplish what every man seem equally to desire to declaim against the expedient offer in the bill as pernicious unjust and oppressive contribute very little to the production of better means that we affair will not admit of long suspense and that the present method of raise seaman be not effectual be universally allow it therefore evidently follow sir that some other must be speedily strike out i think it necessary to propose that the house be resolve into a committee to-morrow morning and hope all that shall assemble on this occasion will bring with they no other passion than zeal for they country -lrb- the speaker have take the chair the chairman of the committee report that they have make some progress and desire leave to sit again it be resolve to go into the committee again on the morrow -rrb- march 4 1740-1 on the sixty-second day the affair be put off but on the sixty-third the house resolve itself into a committee a clause be offer by which five pound be propose to be advance to a able seaman and three pound to every other man that should enter voluntarily into he majesty 's service after twenty day and within sixty after which mr winnington speak as follow : -- sir this be a clause in which no opposition can be apprehend as those gentleman who declare they disapprobation of the former be almost unanimous in propose this expedient as the least expensive and the most likely to succeed the time for the reception of volunteer upon this condition be sir in my opinion judiciously determine if it be extend to a greater length or left uncertain the reward would lose its efficacy the sailor would neglect that which they might accept at any time and would only have recourse to the ship of war when they could find no other employment yet i can not conceal my apprehension that this bounty will not alone be sufficient to man we fleet with proper expedition and that as allurement may be useful on one hand force will be find necessary on the other that the sailor may not only be incite to engage in the service by the hope of a reward but by the fear of have they negligence to accept it punish by be compel into the same service and forfeit they claim by stay to be compel lord baltimore then speak to the following effect : -- sir to the reward propose in this clause i have declare in the former conference on this bill that i have no objection and therefore have no amendment to propose except with regard to the time limited for the payment as we need of seaman sir be immediate why should not a law for they encouragement immediately operate what advantage can arise from delay or why be not that proper to be advance now that will be proper in twenty day that all the time between the enaction and operation of this law must be lose be evident for who will enter for two pound that may gain five by withhold himself from the service twenty day longer nor do i think the time now limited sufficient many sailor who be now in the service of the merchant may not return soon enough to lay claim to the bounty who would gladly accept it and who will either not serve the crown without it or will serve with disgust and complaint as the loss of it can not be imputed to they backwardness but to a accident against which they could not provide mr winnington reply : -- sir though i think the time now fix by the bill sufficient as i hope that we present exigency will be but of short continuance and that we shall soon be able to raise naval force at a cheaper rate yet as the reason allege for a alteration of the time may appear to other of more weight than to I i shall not oppose the amendment sir john barnard next rose and say : -- sir with regard to the duration of the time fix for the advancement of this bounty we may have leisure to deliberate but surely it must be readily grant by those who have expatiate so copiously upon the present exigency of we affair that it ought immediately to commence and if this be the general determination of the house nothing can be more proper than to address he majesty to offer by proclamation a advance of five pound instead of two which have be hitherto give that while we be concert other measure for the advantage of we country those in which we have already concur may be put in execution mr pulteney rise up next and speak as follow : -- sir i take this opportunity to lay before the house a grievance which very much retard the equipment of we fleet and which must be redress before any measure for reconcile the sailor to the publick service can be pursue with the least probability of success observation sir have inform I that to remove the detestation of the king 's service it be not necessary to raise the wages of the seaman it be necessary only to secure they it be necessary to destroy those hateful insect that fatten in idleness and debauchery upon the gain of the industrious and honest when a sailor sir after the fatigue and hazard of a long voyage bring he ticket to the pay-office and demand he wages the despicable wretch to whom he be oblige to apply look upon he ticket with a air of importance acknowledge he right and demand a reward for present payment with this demand however exorbitant the necessity of he family oblige he to comply in this manner sir be the wife of the sailor also treat when they come to receive the pay of they husband woman distressed friendless and unsupported they be oblige to endure every insult and to yield to every oppression and to such a height do these merciless exacter raise they extortion that sometimes a third part of the wages be deduct thus sir do the vilest the meanest of mankind plunder those who have the highest claim to the esteem the gratitude and the protection of they country this be the hardship which withhold the sailor from we navy and force they to seek for kinder treatment in other country this hardship sir both justice and prudence call upon we to remedy and while we neglect it all we deliberation will be ineffectual mr southwell then speak to this effect : -- sir of the hardship mention by the honorable gentleman who speak last i have myself know a instance too remarkable not to be mention a sailor in ireland after he voyage meet with so much difficulty in obtain he wages that he be at length reduce to the necessity of submit to the reduction of near a sixth part such be the grievance with which those be oppress upon whom the power security and happiness of the nation be acknowledge to depend sir robert walpole the prime minister then rise and speak as follow : -- sir it be not without surprise that i hear the disgust of the sailor ascribe to any irregularity in the payment of they wages which be never in any former reign so punctually discharge they receive at present twelve month ' pay in eighteen month without deduction so that there be never more than six month for which any demand remain unsatisfied but sir the punctuality of the payment have produce of late great inconveniency for there have be frequently a necessity of remove man from one ship to another and it be the state rule of the pay-office to assign every man so remove he full pay these man when the government be no longer indebted to they take the first opportunity of desert the service and engage in business to which they be more inclined this be not a chimerical complaint found upon rare instance and produce only to counterbalance a objection the fact and the consequence be well know so well that near fourteen hundred sailor be compute to have be lose by this practice the president of the common who always in a committee take he seat as another member rise here and speak to the following effect he honor be paymaster of the navy : -- mr chairman the nature of the employment with which i be intrust make it my duty to endeavor that this question may be clearly understand and the condition of the seaman with regard to the reception of they pay justly represent i have not be able to discover that any sailor upon produce he ticket be ever oblige to submit to the deduction of any part of he wages nor should any clerk or officer under my inspection escape for such oppression the severest punishment and most publick censure : i would give he up to the law without reserve and mark he as infamous and unworthy of any trust or employment but there be extortion sir by which those unhappy man after have serve they country with honesty and courage be deprive of they lawful gain of diligence and labor there be man to whom it be usual amongst the sailor to mortgage they pay before it become due who never advance they money but upon such term as can not be mention without indignation these man advance the sum which be stipulate and by virtue of a letter of attorney be reimburse at the pay-office this corruption be i fear not confine to particular place but have spread even to america where as in he own country the poor sailor be seduce by the temptation of present money to sell he labor to extortioner and usurer i appeal to the gentleman whether the instance which he mention be not of this kind i appeal to he without apprehension of receive a answer that can tend to invalidate what i have assert this sir be indeed a grievance pernicious and oppressive which no endeavor of mine shall be deficient in attempt to remove for by this the sailor be condemn notwithstanding he industry and success to perpetual poverty and to labor only for the benefit of he plunderer -lrb- the clause be then read empower the justice of the peace etc to issue warrant to the constable etc to make general privy search by day or night for find out and secure such seaman and seafaring man as lie hide or conceal themselves and make it lawful for the officer appoint to make such search to force open the door of any house where they shall _ suspect _ such seaman to be conceal if entrance be not readily admit and for punish those who shall harbor or conceal any seaman -rrb- sir john barnard upon this rise up and speak to the following effect : -- mr chairman we have be hitherto deliberate upon question in which diversity of opinion might naturally be expect and in which every man might indulge he own opinion whatever it might be without any dangerous consequence to the publick but the clause now before we be of a different kind clause which can not be read without astonishment and indignation nor defend without betray the liberty of the best the bravest and most useful of we fellow-subject if these clause sir should pass into a law a sailor and a slave will become term of the same signification every man who have devote himself to the most useful profession and most dangerous service of he country will see himself deprive of every advantage which he have labor to obtain and make the mere passive property of those who live in security by he valor and owe to he labor that affluence which harden they to insensibility and that pride that swell they to ingratitude why must the sailor alone sir be mark out from all the other order of man for ignominy and misery why must they be rank with the enemy of society stop like vagabond and pursue like the thief and the murderer by publick officer how or when have they forfeit the common privilege of human nature or the general protection of the law of they country if it be a just maxim sir that he who contribute most to the welfare of the publick deserve most to be protect in the enjoyment of he private right or fortune a principle which surely will not be controvert where be the man that dare stand forth and assert that he have juster claim than the brave the honest the diligent sailor i be extremely unwilling sir to engage in so invidious a undertaking as the comparison of the harmless inoffensive resolute sailor with those who think themselves entitle to treat he with contempt to overlook he merit invade he liberty and laugh at he remonstrance nor be it sir necessary to dwell upon the peculiar merit of this body of man it be sufficient that they have the same claim found upon the same reason with we own that they have never forfeit they by any crime and therefore that they can not be take away without the most flagrant violation of the law of nature of reason and of we country let we consider the present condition of a sailor let we reflect a little upon the calamity to which custom though not law have already make he subject and it will surely not be think that he unhappiness need any aggravation he be already expose to be force upon he return from a tedious voyage into new hardship without the intermission of a day and without the sight of he family he be liable after a contract for a pleasing and gainful voyage to be hurry away from he prospects of interest and condemn amidst oppression and insolence to labor and to danger almost without the possibility of a recompense he have neither the privilege of choose he commander nor of leave he when he be defraud and oppress these sir i say be the calamity to which he be now subject but there be now a possibility of escape they he be not yet deprive of the right of resistance or the power of flight he may now retire to he friend and be protect by he he may take shelter in he own cottage and treat any man as a robber that shall attempt to force he door when any crew be return home in time of war they be acquaint with the danger of a impress but they comfort themselves with contrive stratagem to elude it or with the prospect of obtain a exemption from it by the favor of they friend prospects which be often deceitful and stratagem frequently defeat but which yet support they spirit and animate they industry but if this bill sir should become a law the sailor instead of amusing himself on he return with the prospects of ease or of pleasure will consider he country as a place of slavery a residence less to be desire than any other part of the world he will probably seek in the service of some foreign prince a kinder treatment and will not fail in any country but he own to see himself at least on a level with other man nor will this bill sir only give the seaman new reason of disgust but it will tend likewise to aggravate those grievance which already have produce a detestation of the publick service scarcely to be conquer the officer of the navy sir will hardly be make less insolent by a increase of power they whose tyranny have already alienate they fellow-subject from the king 's service though they could only depend upon the character of probity and moderation for the prospect of man they ship in succeed expedition will probably when they be animated by a law like this and make absolute both by land and sea indulge themselves in the enjoyment of they new authority contrive new hardship and oppression and tyrannise without fear and without mercy thus sir will the bill not only be tyrannical in itself but the parent of tyranny it will give security to the cruel and confidence to the arrogant that any man at least any man breed from he infancy to change he residence and accustom to different climate and to foreign nation will fix by choice in that country where he find the worst reception be hardly to be imagine we see indeed that man unqualified to support themselves in other country or who have by long custom contract a fondness for particular method of life will bear very uncomfortable circumstance without endeavor to improve they condition by a change of they habitation but the temper of a sailor acquaint with all part and indifferent to all be of another kind such sir be he love of change arise either from wantonness or curiosity that he be hard to be retain by the kindest treatment and most liberal reward and will therefore never struggle with he habitual disposition only to continue in a state of slavery i think it therefore sir very evident that this new method of _ encouraging _ sailor will be so far from _ increase _ they that it may probably drive they out of the empire and at once ruin we trade and we navy at once beggar and disarm we let I now suppose sir for a moment the bill less pernicious in its consequence and consider only the difficulty of execute it every seafaring man be to be seize at pleasure by the magistrate but what definition be give of a seafaring man or by what characteristick be the magistrate to distinguish he i have never be able to discover any peculiarity in the form of a seaman that mark he out from the rest of the species there be indeed less servility in he air and less effeminacy in he face than in those that be commonly to be see in drawing-room in brothel and at review but i know not that a seaman can be distinguish from any other man of equal industry or use who have never enervate himself by vice nor polished himself into corruption so that this bill sir if it shall pass into a law will put it at once in the power of the magistrate to dispose of seaman at he pleasure and to term whom he please a seaman another expedient sir have be offer on this occasion not equally tyrannical but equally inadequate to the end in view it be propose to restrain the merchant from give wages beyond a certain rate on the supposition that the sailor have no motive but that of larger wages to prefer the service of the merchant to that of the crown this sir be a mistake which might easily arise from a partial and imperfect knowledge of the affair with which very few gentleman have opportunity of be well acquaint the wages sir be the smallest inducement which fix the seaman in they choice the prospect of kinder treatment the certainty of return home in a fixed time and the power of choose what voyage they will undertake can not but be acknowledge very reasonable motive of preference on the contrary sir when they be once engage in a ship of war they know neither whither they be go what danger they shall encounter what hardship they shall suffer nor when they shall be dismiss besides sir i do not think it possible by any law to limit the wages to be pay by merchant since they will change the term of wages into that of a present or admit the sailor to a small share in the freight and so all the precaution we can take will become ineffectual in the mean time sir how much shall we embarrass we own commerce and impair we natural strength -- the power of we fleet we shall terrify we sailor on the one hand and endeavor to starve they on the other we shall not only drive they from we by unheard-of severity but take away every motive that can induce they to expose themselves to the danger of suffer they if we consider sir with what effect method nearly approach these be practice in the reign of the late queen we shall find that not more than one thousand five hundred seaman be raise and those at the expense of more than four thousand pound so that the effect bear no proportion to the mean we law be infringe and we constitution violate to no purpose but what reason sir can be assign for which it must be more difficult to supply the fleet now with sailor than at any other time this war sir be demand by the publick voice in pursuance of the particular remonstrance of the merchant and it be not to be suppose that the sailor or any other body of man engage in it with a particular reluctance i be therefore incline to believe that the suspicion of great number hide in the country at a distance from the coast be merely chimerical and that if we should pass this bill we should do nothing more than grant a oppressive and unconstitutional power of search for what in reality be not to be find how oppressive this power may become in the hand of a corrupt or insolent magistrate any man may discover who remember that the magistrate be make judge without appeal of he own right to denominate any man a sailor and that he may break open any man 's door at any time without allege any other reason than he own suspicion so that no man can secure he house from be search or perhaps he person from be seize it may indeed be allege sir that this will be only a temporary law and be to cease with the exigence that make it necessary : but long experience have inform we that severe law be enact more readily than they be repeal and that most man be too fond of power to suffer willingly the diminution of it but sir though this law should not be perpetuate every precedent of a infringement of we constitution make way for its dissolution and the very cessation of a oppressive law may be a plea hereafter for the revival of it this bill therefore must be confess to be at once violent and ineffectual to be a transgression of the law of justice to particular man without any prospect of real benefit to the community and therefore can not be pass without deviate at once from prudence and we constitution captain cornwall then rise and speak to this effect : -- i have observe sir that every man be apt to think himself ill treat who be not treat accord to he own opinion of he desert and will endeavor to diffuse he own notion of the partiality and tyranny of the naval officer general clamor therefore be little to be regard i have have from my early year a command in the sea service and can assert that i never know more than one instance of injustice and that be punish with the severity which it deserve the prime minister rise next and speak to this effect : -- mr chairman it be with uncommon satisfaction that i see every clause of this bill regularly debate without unbecome impatience or passionate exclamation i be willing to collect from this conduct that the disposition of every gentleman be on this occasion the same with my own and that every expedient here propose will be diligently examine and either be seriously approve or be calmly reject such coolness and impartiality sir be certainly require by the importance of the present question a question which can not but influence the prosperity of the nation for many year it be not necessary to remind any gentleman of the importance of we trade of the power of the enemy against whom we have declare war in defense of it or of the necessity of show the world that we declaration of war be not empty noise or farce of resentment but it may be proper sir to remark that this be not the only enemy nor the most powerful whose attempt we have reason to provide against and who may oblige we to exert we whole power and practice every expedient to increase we force the war have be hitherto prosecute with the utmost vigor with all the attention that its importance require and with success not disproportion to we preparation nor will it ever be suffer to languish if the power necessary for carry it on be not deny nothing be more evident sir than that the natural power of the nation consist in its fleet which be now by the care of the government so numerous that the united power of many nation can not equal they but what be fleet unfurnished with man how will they maintain the dominion of the sea by lie unactive in we harbor that no method hitherto use have be sufficient to man we navy and that we preparation have therefore be little more than a expensive show of war the whole nation be sufficiently inform it be therefore not doubtful that some new measure must be take whether any better can be suggest than be offer in this bill must be inquire with regard sir to the clause now under we consideration it be to be remember that little more be propose by it than to add the sanction of legality to a power which have long be exercise by the admiralty without any other authority than that of long prescription the power of issue warrant of impress upon emergent occasion by which sailor be force into the publick service this power in its present state must be allow to have no foundation in any law and by consequence to be unlimited arbitrary and easily abused and upon the whole to be justifiable only by necessity : but that necessity be so frequent that it be often exercise and therefore ought to be regulate by the legislature and by make such regulation we may rather be say to remove than introduce a grievance the power of search for sailor however it have be represent be far from set they on a level with felon murderer or vagabond or indeed from distinguish they to they disadvantage from the rest of the community of which every individual be oblige to support the government those that possess estate or carry on trade transfer part of they property to the publick and those ought by parity of reason to serve the publick in person that have no property to transfer every man be secure by the constitution in the enjoyment of he life he liberty or he fortune and therefore every man ought reciprocally to defend the constitution to which he be himself indebted for safety and protection i be therefore sir unable to discover in what consist the hardship of a law by which no new duty be enjoin nor any thing require which be not already every man 's duty every man indeed who be desirous of evade the performance of any of the duty of society will consider every compulsion as a hardship by which he be oblige to contribute to the general happiness but he murmur will prove nothing but he own folly and ingratitude and will certainly deserve no regard from the legislative power there be in the bill before we sir encouragement sufficient for volunteer and a offer of greater reward than some gentleman think consistent with the present state of the national revenue and what remain to be do with respect to those who be deaf to all invitation and blind to all offer of advantage be they to sit at ease only because they be idle or to be distinguish with indulgence only for want of deserving it it seem generally grant sir that such drone be the proper object of a impress let we then suppose that every man who be willing to serve he country have lay hold of the reward propose and enter a volunteer the fleet be not yet sufficiently manned and more sailor must be procured warrant be issue out in the common form the negligent the imprudent the necessitous be take the vigilant the cunning and those that have more money find shelter and escape can it be say that those whose circumstance or good fortune enable they to secure themselves from the officer of the impress deserve any exemption from the publick service or from the hardship to which they companion be expose have they discharge they debt of gratitude to the publick so effectually by run away from its service that no search ought to be make after they it seem evident that if it be right to seize the one it be likewise right to pursue the other and if it be right to pursue he it be likewise right to hinder he from escape the pursuer it be then right to vest some person with the power of apprehend he and in whom be that power to be lodge but in the civil magistrate every man sir be oblige by compulsive method to serve he country if he can be prevail upon by no other if any man shall refuse to pay he rate or he tax will not he goods be seize by force and sell before he face if any particular method be propose for oblige seaman to contribute to the publick safety it be only because they service be necessary upon more press occasion than that of other upon occasion which do not admit of delay without the hazard of the whole community i must confess sir there be instance in which the hardship of the seafaring part of the nation be peculiar and truly calamitous a sailor after the danger and toil of a long voyage when he be now in the sight of the port where he hope to enjoy that quiet which he have deserve by so long a series of fatigue to repair the injury which he health have suffer by change of climate and the diet of the ship and to recover that strength which incessant vigilance have worn away when he be in expectation of be receive by he family with those caress which the succor that he bring they naturally produce and design to rest awhile from danger and from care in the midst of these please view he be on the sudden seize by a impress and force into a repetition of all he misery without any interval of refreshment let no man who can think without compassion on such a scene as this boast he zeal for freedom he regard for bravery or he gratitude to those who contribute to the wealth and power of they country let every man who declare himself touch with the pity which the slightest reflection upon such a disappointment must naturally produce sincerely endeavor to obviate the necessity of such oppressive measure which may at least in part be prevent by assign to magistrate the power of hunting out of they retreat those who neglect the business of they calling and linger at once in laziness and want there be great number who retire not from weariness but idleness or a unreasonable prepossession against the publick service and surely nothing be more unreasonable than that bad disposition should be gratify and that industry should expose any man to penalty upon the whole sir i be not able to discover that any man should be exempt from a impress merely because he find mean to escape it or because idleness or disinclination to the publick service prompt he to abscond if any man deserve indulgence in opposition to the demand of the publick they be rather those who have already in some degree discharge they duty to it by contribute to bring in that wealth which be the consequence of a prosperous and well-regulated commerce and without which war can not be support it be not without grief and regret that i be oblige to represent on this occasion the obstruction which the war have suffer from those at whose request it be undertake and to declare that the conduct of the merchant have afford proof that some law of this tendency be absolutely necessary the merchant sir who have so loudly complain of the decline of trade the interruption of navigation and the insolence rapacity and cruelty of the spaniard the merchant who fill the nation with representation of they hardship discouragement and misery and lament in the most publick manner that they be the only body for whom the legislature have no regard who be abandon to the caprice of other nation be plunder abroad and neglect at home the merchant after have at length by they importunity engage the state in a war of which they have themselves certainly not the least pretension to question either the justice or necessity now when by the natural consequence of a naval armament sailor become less numerous and ship more difficult to be equip contract in private with such sailor as they be incline to employ and conceal they in garret hire for that purpose till the freight be ready or the danger of a impress be past and thus secure they own private affair at the hazard of the publick and hinder the operation of a war which they and they only solicit the danger of have other enemy than the spaniard enemy sir more active more powerful and more ambitious have already be mention a danger so near and so formidable that he will not be think very solicitous for he country whom the bare mention of it do not alarm this danger we be therefore to obviate by vigorous preparation and unanimous resolution nor do i doubt but both we enemy if they find we unite will repent of attack we sir the most efficacious method of man we fleet which law or custom have yet put into we hand be that of suspend we commerce by a embargo and yet the whole nation know how much and by what mean it have be elude : no sooner be it know that a embargo be lay than the sailor fly away into the country or hide themselves in corner of this great city as from the most formidable danger and no sooner do the embargo cease than the bank of the river be again crowd with sailor and all the trading vessel be immediately supply as i can not doubt sir that every gentleman be equally zealous for the success of the war and the prosperity of he country and as the insufficiency of the present method of provide for they be apparent i hope that either the regulation propose by this bill to which i see no important objection or some other of equal use will be establish by a general concurrence lord baltimore speak next : -- though no gentleman in this assembly sir can more ardently wish the success of the british arm or shall more willingly concur in any measure that may promote it yet i can not agree to the clause now under we consideration i disapprove it both from moral and political motive i disapprove it as neither just nor prudent the injustice of so flagrant a invasion of the liberty of particular man have be already expose nor be it in my opinion less easy to discover the imprudence of exhaust all we supplies at once and sweep away all we sailor to supply a single exigency it have often be remark sir in favor of a standing army that it be requisite to have a number of regular force who though too weak to oppose a invasion might be able to establish discipline in a larger body a observation which may with much greater justness be apply to the seaman whose art be much more difficult to be attain and who be equally necessary in war and peace if we stock of seaman sir be destroy if there be not leave in we trading vessel a sufficient number of experienced artist to initiate novice and propagate the profession not only we ship of war must lie useless but we commerce sink to nothing nor have i reason to believe the naval power of france so formidable as that we ought to be terrify by the apprehension of it into any extraordinary method of procedure i be inform that they have now very few ship of force leave in they harbor and that they have exert they whole strength in the american fleet i be not therefore sir for provide against present danger without regard to we future security and think nothing more worthy of the consideration of this assembly than the means of encouraging and increase we seaman which will not be effect by the bill before we land force may be hire upon emergency but sailor be we own peculiar strength and the growth of we own soil we be therefore above all other regard to attend if i may use the term to the preservation of the species mr vyner next speak : -- mr chairman as there can be no stronger objection to any law than ambiguity or indeterminate latitude of mean i think it necessary to propose that some word of known and limited import be substitute in the place of _ seafaring man _ a expression which if i be ask the meaning of it i should find it difficult to explain be _ seafaring _ man those only who navigate in the _ sea _ the term be then superfluous for all such be evidently comprise in the word _ seaman _ be they bargemen or waterman who ply on river and transport provision or commodity from one inland town to another in that sense nobody will affirm that it be a proper word and impropriety in the expression of law produce uncertainty in the execution of they captain cornwall rise up : -- sir the term _ seafare man _ of which a explication be desire be intend to include all those who live by convey goods or passenger upon the water whether the sea or inland river : nor can we restrain it to a narrower sense without exempt from the publick service great number whose manner of life have qualify they for it and from whom they country may with equal justice expect assistance as from those who be engage in foreign traffick mr vyner reply : -- sir i be far from concur with the honorable gentleman in he opinion that the inland waterman be by they profession in any degree qualify for sea service or can properly be call _ seafaring man _ all qualification for the service must consist either in some knowledge of the art of navigation or in some familiarity with the danger of the sea with regard to any previous knowledge of naval business it be well know that they have no advantage over any common labourer for the manner of navigate a ship and a barge have for the most part nothing in common nor be these waterman sir more able to stand firm in the terror of the storm or the noise of a battle than those who follow any other occupation many of they never see the sea nor have less dread of its danger than the other inhabitant of the inland county they be therefore neither _ seafaring _ man nor peculiarly capable of be make _ seaman _ but the hardship upon particular man be not the strongest objection to this clause which by obstruct we inland navigation may make we river useless and set the whole trade of the nation at a stand for who will bring up he son a waterman who know he expose by that profession to be impress for a seaman it seem therefore necessary sir either to omit the term _ seafaring man _ -lrb- footnote : agree to be omit -rrb- or to explain it in such a manner that inland waterman may not be include lord gage speak next : -- sir so much have be urge against the compulsive method propose in this clause and so little produce in favor of they that it may seem superfluous to add any thing or to endeavor by a multiplicity of argument to prove what common reason must immediately discover but there be one consequence of this clause which have not yet be observe and which be yet too important not to be obviate by a particular proviso it be well know sir that many of those to whom this act will extend be freeholder and voter for elect the representative of the nation and it be therefore apparent that election may be influence by a ill-timed or partial execution of it how easy will it be when a election approach to raise a false alarm to propose some secret expedition or threaten we with a invasion from some unknown country and to seize on all the seafaring voter whose affection be suspect and confine they at spithead till the contest be over i can not therefore sir but think it necessary that if this clause be suffer to pass some part of its hateful consequence should be prevent by a exception in favor of freeholder and voter which surely be no less than what every man owe to he own security to the welfare of he country and to those by whom he have be honor with the care of they liberty mr henry pelham then say as follow : -- sir i do not rise in opposition to the proposal make by that right honorable member nor do i think this the proper time either for oppose or approve it method be of the highest importance in inquiry like these and if the order of the debate be interrupt by foreign question or incidental objection no man will be able to consider the clause before we with the attention necessary to he own satisfaction or to the conviction of other the mind will be dissipate by a multiplicity of view and nothing can follow but perplexity and confusion the great end sir for which we be now assemble be to strike out method of man the fleet with expedition and certainty it be therefore proper in the first place to agree upon some general measure to each of which there may undoubtedly be particular objection raise that may be afterwards remove by exception or provision but these provision should for the sake of order be insert in particular clause to be separately consider of this kind be the exception now offer to which i have no objection but its present impropriety and the interruption of the debate which it may now occasion for i see at present no reason against admit it in a particular clause when it be consider how much the success of the war may depend upon the determination of this day and how much we future happiness and security may depend upon the success of we present undertaking i hope my solicitude for regularity and expedition will be easily excuse sir hind cotton answer : -- i be not able sir to discover any imminent danger to the nation in suspend we attention to the clause before we for a few moment nor indeed do we cease to attend to it while we be endeavor to mollify it and adapt it to we constitution the exception propose be in the opinion of the honorable gentleman so reasonable that he declare himself ready to approve it in another place and to I no place seem more proper of its make part of this bill than this as a connexion between the clause and exception appear necessary and immediate i can not see why it should be postpone unless it be hope that it may be forget mr pulteney then speak : -- sir that this exception should be forget there be no danger for how long soever it be delay i will never agree to the act till i see it insert if we suffer the liberty of the freeholder to be infringe what can we expect but to be charge with betray we trust and give up to servitude and oppression those who depute we to this assembly as the guardian of they privilege and the asserter of they birthright a charge too just to be deny and too atrocious to be bear sir the right of a freeholder be independent on every other circumstance and be neither make more or less by wealth or poverty : the estate however small which give a right of voting ought to exempt the owner from every restraint that may hinder the exertion of he right a right on which we constitution be found and which can not be take away without subvert we whole establishment to overlook the distinction which the fundamental law of we country have make in respect to different order of man and to regard only the accident of affluence and necessity be surely unjust in itself and unworthy of this assembly a assembly sir institute principally to protect the weak against the strong and depute to represent those in a collective state who be not considerable enough to appear singly and claim a voice in the legislature to expose a honest a laborious and a useful man to be seize by the hand of a insolent officer and drag from the enjoyment of he right only because he will not violate he conscience and add he voice to those of sycophant dependent and prostitute the slave of power the drudge of a court and the hireling of a faction be the highest degree of injustice and cruelty let we rather sir sweep away with a impress the drone of large fortune the tyrant of village and the oppressor of the poor let we oblige those to serve they country by force whose fortune have have no other effect than to make they insolent and worthless but let such who by contribute to commerce make every day some addition to the publick wealth be leave in the full enjoyment of the rights which they deserve : let those by whose labor the expense of the war be furnished be excuse from contribute to it by personal service it be necessary sir to have we law establish by the representative of the people it be necessary that those representative should be freely elect and therefore every law that obstruct the liberty of voter be contrary to the fundamental law of we constitution and what multitude may by this law be either hinder from give they vote or be terrify into such a choice as by no means correspond with they judgment or inclination it be easy to foresee i be indeed of opinion sir that this clause can not be adapt to we constitution nor modify by any expedient into a law which will not lay insupportable hardship upon the nation and make way for absolute power but as it be necessary that a constant supply of seaman should be provide i think it not improper to observe that there be one expedient yet remain by which though it will not much assist we in we present exigence the fleet of this nation may hereafter be constantly support we have at present great number of charity school establish in this nation where the child of the poor receive a education disproportion to they birth this have often no other consequence than to make they unfit for they station by place they in they own opinion above the drudgery of daily labor a notion which be too much indulge as idleness cooperate with vanity can hardly fail to gain the ascendant and which sometimes prompt they to support themselves by practice not only useless but pernicious to society this evil sir can not be better obviate than by allot a reasonable proportion out of every school to the service of the sea in which by enter early they can not fail to become proficient and where they attainment which at present too frequently produce laziness and dishonesty might enable they to excel and entitle they to promotion mr winnington reply : -- sir notwithstanding the confidence with which some gentleman have propose this amendment and the easiness with which other have consent to it i declare without hesitation that i oppose it now and intend to oppose it whenever it shall be offer because it will defeat all the other provision which shall be make in the bill i will venture to say sir that if every man who have by whatever tenure the right of voting shall be exempt from the necessity of contribute to the publick safety by he personal service every man qualify for the sea will by some means acquire a vote sir a very small part of those who give they vote in this nation for representative in senate enjoy that right as the appendage of a freehold to live in some town and to be bear only in other give the unalienable privilege of vote any gentleman to secure he own interest or obstruct the publick service may by divide a small piece of barren ground among a hundred sailor exalt they all to freeholder and exempt they from the influence of this law however sir i be not less a friend to the freeholder than those who propose the exception in they favor but in my opinion the great interest of the freeholder be the preservation of they freehold which can only be secure by a vigorous exertion of the power of the nation in the war which be now declare against the spaniard mr barrington speak next : -- sir by the observation which i have opportunity of make at the place which i have the honor to represent i be convince of the influence that this law will have upon all the borough along the coast there most of the voter be in one sense or other sir seafaring man be almost all of they owner of vessel and in some degree acquaint with navigation they may therefore be hurry away at the choice of a officious or oppressive magistrate who may by partiality and injustice obtain a majority contrary to the general inclination of the people and determine the election by he own authority sir william yonge then say : -- sir if every freeholder and voter be to be exempt from the influence of the law the bill that we be with so much ardor endeavor to draw up and rectify and of which the necessity be so generally acknowledge will be no other than a empty sound and a determination without a object for while we be empower the government to call seaman into the service we be exempt almost all that be able to serve from the denomination of seaman : what be this but to dispute without a subject to raise with one hand and demolish with the other in the western part of the nation sir where i reside many who vote at election claim they privilege by no other title than that of boil a pot a title which he who have it not may easily obtain when it will either gratify he laziness or he cowardice and which though not occasionally obtain seem not sufficient to set any man out of the reach of a just and necessary law it be therefore sir undoubtedly requisite that the term of the exception should be explicit and definitive and that only those should be exempt who have such possession or qualification as this assembly shall think a just title to exemption for on the western coast from whence great supplies may be expect almost every sailor have a vote to which nothing be there require but to hire a lodging and boil a pot after which if this exception be admit in all its latitude he may sit at ease amidst the distress of he country ridicule the law which he have elude and set the magistrate at open defiance the prime minister speak next : -- as i think sir some exception may be just and proper so i suppose every gentleman will concur with I in reject one of such extent as shall leave no object for the operation of the law it be in my opinion proper to restrain the exemption to those freeholder who be possess of such a estate as give a vote for the representative of the county by which those whose privilege arise from they property will be secure and it seem reasonable that those who have privilege without property should purchase they by they service counsellor brown speak next : -- sir the exception propose will not only defeat the end of the bill by leave it few object but will obstruct the execution of it on proper occasion and involve the magistrate in difficulty which will either intimidate he in the exertion of he authority or if he persist in discharge he duty with firmness and spirit will perhaps oblige he sometimes to repent of he fidelity it be the necessary consequence sir of a seaman 's profession that he be often at a great distance from the place of he legal settlement or patrimonial possession and he may therefore assert of he own circumstance what be most convenient without danger of detection distance be a security that prompt many man to falsehood by which only vanity be gratify and few man will tell truth in opposition to they interest when they may lie without apprehension of be convict when therefore a magistrate receive direction to impress all the seaman within he district how few will he find who will not declare themselves freeholder in some distant county or freeman of some obscure borough it be to no purpose sir that the magistrate disbelieve what he can not confute and if in one instance in a hundred he should be mistaken and act in consequence of he error force a freeman into the service what reparation may not be demand i therefore propose it to the consideration of the committee whether any man ought to claim exemption from this law by a title that may so readily be procure or so safely usurp the attorney general speak next : -- sir the practice of impress which have be declaim against with such vehement exaggeration be not only found on immemorial custom which make it part of the common law but be likewise establish by we statute for i remember to have find it in the statute of queen mary and therefore can not allow that it ought to be treat as illegal and anti-constitutional that it be not inconsistent with we constitution may be prove from the practice of erect the royal standard upon great emergency to which every man be oblige immediately to repair this practice be as old as we constitution and as it may be revive at pleasure may be properly mention as equivalent to a impress mr vyner answer : -- this word sir which the learn member have by he wonderful diligence discover in the statute may perhaps be there but in a signification far different from that which it bear at present the word be without doubt originally french _ prt _ and imply what be now express by the term _ ready _ and to impress any man be in those day only to make he _ ready _ or engage he to hold himself in _ readiness _ which be bring about not by compulsion pursuit and violence but by the allurement of a pecuniary reward or the obligation of some ancient tenure house of common march 9 1740-1 on the sixty-sixth day the consideration of the bill for raise seaman be resume and a clause read by which every constable headborough tithingman or other person be liable to be examine upon oath by the justice of peace who be empower to lay a fine upon they for any neglect offence or connivance sir john barnard rise up and speak to the following effect : -- mr chairman it be the peculiar happiness of the briton that no law can be make without the consent of they representative and i hope no such infatuation can ever fall upon they as may influence they to choose a representative capable of concur in absurdity like this the folly the iniquity the stupidity of this clause can only be conceive by hear it repeat it be too flagrant to be extenuate and too gross to admit exaggeration : to oblige a man to make oath against himself to subject himself by he own voice to penalty and hardship be at once cruel and ridiculous a wild complication of tyranny and folly to call upon any man to accuse himself be only to call upon he to commit perjury and have therefore be always account irrational and wicked : in those country where it be practice the confession be extort by the rack which indeed be so necessary on such occasion that i should not wonder to hear the promoter of this clause openly declare for the expediency of torture nothing be more evident than that this bill however the importance of the occasion may be magnify be draw up without reflection and that the clause be never understand by those that offer they : error like these must arise only from precipitation and neglect for they be too gross to be commit either by ignorance or design to expose such absurdity be indeed easy but not please for what end be answer by point at folly or how be the publick service advance by show that the method propose be totally to be reject where a proposition be of a mixed kind and only erroneous in part it be a useful and no disagreeable task to separate truth from error and disentangle from ill consequence such measure as may be pursue with advantage to the publick but mere stupidity can only produce compassion and afford no opportunity for inquiry or dispute admiral wager reply : -- sir this clause however contemptuously treat have be already pass into a law by a senate which bring no dishonor upon the british nation by a senate which be court and dread by the greatest part of the universe and be draw up by a ministry that have give they posterity no reason to treat they with derision and contumely in the reign of the late great queen this method of proceeding be approve and establish and we may judge of the propriety of the measure follow in that war by the success which they procure those therefore by whom this bill be draw up have commit no new absurdity nor have propose any thing which be not enact by the wisest of we predecessor in one of the most illustrious period of we history mr gybbon answer : -- sir i be far from think a proposition sufficiently defend by a assertion that it be admit by we predecessor for though i have no inclination to vilify they memory i may without scruple affirm that they have no pretension to infallibility and that there be in many of we statute instance of such ignorance credulity weakness and error as can not be consider without astonishment in question of a abstruse and complicated nature it be certain sir that experience have teach we what could never have be discover previously by the wisdom of we ancestor and we have find by they consequence the impropriety of many practice which they approve and which we should have equally applaud in the same circumstance but to what purpose be observation if we must shut we eye against it and appeal for ever to the wisdom of we ancestor -- if we must fall into error merely because they be mistaken and rush upon rock out of veneration to those who be wreck against they in question easily to be examine and determination which comprise no perplexing contrariety of interest or multiplicity of circumstance they be equally liable with ourselves to be supine and negligent to sink into security or be surprise by haste that the clause now before we be enact by they must be ascribe merely to the hurry of the session in which it be bring before they a time in which so many inquiry of the highest importance be to be make and great diversity of view to be regard that it be no wonder that some absurdity should escape without detection in the fourth of the reign of the queen this bill be bring in as now at the latter end of a session when the attention of the senate be fatigue and distract and it be hurry through both house and ratify by the queen with very little consideration but then as this circumstance may be justly term a extenuation of they error it ought to be a lesson of caution to we that we may not be in the like manner betray into the same weakness mr henry pelham next rise up : -- sir the conduct of we predecessor seem not to stand in need of any excuse for it might be easy to vindicate it by argument but that it be more proper to approve it by imitation whenever the bill be pass or how hastily soever the law be enact it be i believe rather the effect of necessity than of inadvertency of the same necessity which now press and which be very ill consult by tedious debate they be then involve in a war and be not so distract by private interest as not to unite in the most vigorous opposition of they enemy they know that the publick good be often promote by the temporary inconveniency of individual and when affair of the highest importance demand they attention when the security of the whole nation and the happiness of they posterity be the subject of they inquiry they wisely suffer less consideration to pass without superfluous and unseasonable solicitude how justly they reason sir and what vigor they resolution give to the military operation we victory be a sufficient proof : and if experience be the surest guide it can not be improper to imitate those who in the same circumstance with ourselves find mean to raise the honor and improve the commerce of they country that we circumstance be the same with those of the senate by which this law be make be obvious beyond dispute or where they vary the difference be perhaps to we disadvantage we have sir the same enemy or at least have reason to apprehend the same but have little hope of the same ally the present war be to be carry on at a greater distance and in more place at the same instant we can not therefore supply we ship occasionally but must raise great number in a short time if therefore it be then conclude that the method under we examination be useful if measure not eligible in themselves may be authorize by necessity why may not we in compliance with the same exigency have recourse to the same expedient sir william yonge then speak : -- sir how much weight be add to the determination of the senate by the dignity of they procedure and the decency of they disputation a slight knowledge of mankind be sufficient to evince it be well know that government be support by opinion and that he who destroy the reputation destroy the authority of the legislative power nor be it less apparent that he who degrade debate into scurrility and destroy the solemnity of consultation endeavor to sink the senate into contempt it be therefore sir with indignation and surprise that i hear the clause before we censure with such indecency of language and the author of it treat with contumely and reproach that mere error do not deserve however apparent but which be now vent before any error be detect i know not sir why the gentleman who be thus indecently attack have suffer such reproach without censure and without reply i know not why they have omit to put the honorable gentleman in mind of the respect due to this assembly or to the character of those whom he oppose gentleman equally skilled with himself in the subject of we inquiry and whom he own attainment however large or he ability however comprehensive can not give he a right to charge with ignorance or folly to reproach man with incapacity be a cheap method of answer they argument but a method which the rule of this house ought to exclude from we debate as the general civility of the world have banish it from every other place of concourse or conversation i for my part sir shall always endeavor to confine my attention to the question before we without suffer my reason to be biass or my inquiry divert by low altercation or personal animosity nor when any other man deviate into reproachful and contemptuous language shall i be induce to think more highly of either he argument or capacity sir john barnard reply : -- sir i have always hear it represent as a instance of integrity when the tongue and heart move in concert when the word be representation of the sentiment and have therefore hitherto endeavor to explain my argument with perspicuity and impress my sentiment with force i have think it hypocrisy to treat stupidity with reverence or to honor nonsense with the ceremony of a confutation as knavery so folly that be not reclaimable be to be speedily despatch business be to be free from obstruction and society from a nuisance nor sir when i be censure by those whom i may offend by the use of term correspondent with my idea will i by a tame and silent submission give reason to suspect that i be conscious of a fault but will treat the accusation with open contempt and show no greater regard to the abettor than to the author of absurdity that decency be of great use in publick debate i shall readily allow it may sometimes shelter folly from ridicule and preserve villany from publick detection nor be it ever more carefully support than when measure be promote that nothing can preserve from contempt but the solemnity with which they be establish decency be a proper circumstance but liberty be the essence of senatorial disquisition : liberty be the parent of truth but truth and decency be sometimes at variance : all man and all proposition be to be treat here as they deserve and there be many who have no claim either to respect or decency mr winnington then rise : -- sir that it be improper in its own nature and inconsistent with we constitution to lay any man under a obligation to accuse himself can not be deny it be therefore evident that some amendment be necessary to the clause before we i have for this reason draw up a amendment sir which if approve by the committee will in my opinion remove all the objection to this part of the bill and by reconcile it with we natural and legal rights i hope induce those to approve it who have hitherto oppose it i therefore propose that these word should be substitute instead of those which be the subject of the debate or some other to this purpose : _ that no person shall be liable to be fine by virtue of this act unless a witness be examine shall make oath of the misdemeanor or neglect _ thus the necessity of examine man upon oath in they own cause will be entirely take away and as the clause will then stand there will remain no suspicion of injustice or oppression because none can be practice without the concurrence of many person of different interest -lrb- this clause though agree to in the committee be at last reject -rrb- mr horace walpole speak next to this effect : -- mr chairman it do not yet appear that the gentleman who have engage in this debate have sufficiently attend to the exigence of we affair and the importance of the question they have lavish they oratory in declaim upon the absurdity of the method propose and discover they sagacity by show how future navy may be supply from charity school but have substitute no expedient in the place of those which they so warmly condemn nor have condescend to inform we how we may now guard we coast or man we fleet for immediate service there be some circumstance sir of the present war which make we necessity of raise sea force greater than in those of william and anne that succeed he the chief advantage that we gain over the french in they war be the consequence of we victory by land at sea sir the balance be almost equal though the dutch fleet and ours be unite nor do they quit the sea because they fleet be destroy but because they be oblige to recruit they land force with they sailor should they now declare war against we they would be under no such necessity of defraud the sea service for they have now on foot a army of one hundred and sixty thousand man which be maintain at no greater expense than forty thousand by the british government as they be therefore sir so formidable by land we have no way of oppose they but by we sea force nor be they navy so contemptible as some have either by conjecture or misinformation represent it the fleet which they have despatch to america consist not of fewer than twenty ship of which the least carry sixty gun and they be fitting out now a equal number in they own port besides they east indium company be oblige to furnish ten ship of the line at the demand of the government thus it appear that we have neighbor sufficiently powerful to alarm we with the sense of immediate danger danger which be make more imminent by the expeditious method by which the french man they fleet and which we must imitate if we hope to oppose they with success i need not say how little we can depend upon any profession of neutrality which will be best observe when they can not be securely violate or upon the pacifick inclination of they minister which interest persuasion or caprice may alter and to which it be not very honorable to trust for safety how can that nation sink lower which be only free because it be not invade by its neighbor and retain its possession only because no other have leisure or inclination to take they away if it be ask what can provoke the french to interrupt we in the prosecution of we design and in the punishment of those who have plunder and insult we it be not only easy to urge the strict alliance between the two crown the tie of blood the conformity of interest and they equal hatred of the briton but another more immediate reason may be add it be suspect that under pretence of vindicate we own rights we be endeavor to gain the possession of the spanish dominion and engross the wealth of the new world and that therefore it be the interest of every power whose subject traffick to those country to oppose we thus whether we succeed or fail in we attempt upon america we have the french power to apprehend if we make conquest they may probably think it necessary to obviate the torrent of we victory and to hinder the increase of we dominion that they may secure they own trade and maintain they own influence if we should be defeat of which no man sir can deny the possibility the inclination of all to insult the depressed and to push down the fall be well know nor can it be expect that we hereditary enemy would neglect so fair a opportunity of attack we how they might ravage we coast and obstruct we trade how they might triumph in the channel and block we up in we own port bombard we town and threaten we with invasion i hope i need but barely mention to incite this assembly to such despatch in man we fleet as may secure we at once from insult and from terror it be undoubtedly sir in we power to raise a naval force sufficient to awe the ocean and restrain the most daring of we enemy from any attempt against we but this can not be effect by harangue objection and disputation there be nothing sir more frequently the subject of raillery or declamation than the uselessness or danger of a standing army to which i declare myself no otherwise inclined than by my concern for the common safety i willingly allow that not one soldier ought to be support by the publick whose service be not necessary but surely none of those who declare so warmly for the honor and privilege of they country would expose it to the insult of foreign power without defense if therefore they think the danger of land force more than equivalent to the benefit they ought unanimously to concur in the increase of we naval strength by which they may be protect but can not be oppress : they ought willingly to give they assistance to any proposition for make the fleet formidable that they declaration against the army may not be think to proceed from a resolution to obstruct the measure of the government rather than from zeal for the constitution for he that equally oppose the establishment of the army and the improvement of the navy declare in effect against the security of the nation and though perhaps without design expose he countryman to the mercy of they enemy mr pulteney speak next : -- sir i can not discover for what reason the bill before we be so vigorously support but must observe that i have seldom know such vehement and continued effort produce by mere publick spirit and unmingled regard for the happiness of the nation nothing sir that can be urge in favor of the measure now propose have be omit when argument be confute precedent be cite when precedent fail the advocate for the bill have recourse to terror and necessity and endeavor to frighten those whom they can not convince but perhaps sir these formidable phantom may soon be put to flight and like the other illusion of cowardice disappear before the light perhaps this necessity will be find only chimerical and these danger appear only the vision of credulity or the bugbear of imposture to arrive at a clear view of we present condition it will be necessary sir not to amuse ourselves with general assertion or overwhelm we reason by terrifying exaggeration : let we consider distinctly the power and the conduct of we enemy and inquire whether they do not affright we more than they be able to hurt we that the force of spain alone sir be much to be dread no man will assert for that empire it be well know have long be seize with all the symptom of decline power and have be support not by its own strength but by the interest of its neighbor the vast dominion of the spaniard be only a empty show they be land without inhabitant and by consequence without defense they be rather excrescence than member of the monarchy and receive support rather than communicate in the distant branch of they empire the government languish as the vital motion in a expire body and the struggle which they now make may be term rather agony than effort from spain therefore unassisted we have nothing to apprehend and yet from thence we have be threaten with insult and invasion that the condition of the french be far different can not be deny they commerce flourish they dominion be connect they wealth increase and they government operate with full vigor : they influence be great and they name formidable but i can not allow sir that they have yet attain such a height of power as should alarm we with constant apprehension or that we ought to secure ourselves against they by the violation of we liberty not to urge that the loss of freedom and the destruction of we constitution be the worst consequence that can be apprehend from a conquest and that to a slave the change of he master be of no great importance it be evident that the power of the french be of such kind as can only affect we remotely and consequentially they may fill the continent with alarm and ravage the territory of germany by they numerous army but can only injure we by means of they fleet we may wait sir without a panick terror though not without some degree of anxiety the event of they attempt upon the neighbouring prince and can not be reduce to fight for we altar and we house but by a second armada which even then the wind must favor and a thousand circumstance concur to expedite but that no such fleet can be fit out by the unite endeavor of the whole world that we navy in its present state be superior to any that can be bring against we we minister ought not to be ignorant : and therefore to dispirit the nation with apprehension of army hover in the air and of conqueror to be waft over by supernatural means be to destroy that happiness which government be ordain to preserve to sink we to tameness and cowardice and to betray we to insult and to robbery if we danger sir be such as have be represent to whom must we impute it upon whom be we weakness we poverty and we misery to be charge upon whom but those who have usurp the direction of affair which they do not understand or to which they solicitude for the preservation of they own power hinder they from attend that the spaniard sir be now enable to make resistance and perhaps to insult and depopulate we colony that the french have despatch a fleet into the american sea to obstruct as may be conjecture the progress of we arm and that we be in danger of meeting opposition which we do not expect be too evident to be conceal but sir be not the spirit of we enemy the consequence rather of we cowardice than of they own strength do not the opposition to we design by whatever nation it shall be make arise from the contempt which have be bring upon we by we irresolution forbearance and delay have we resent the first insult and repair we earliest loss by vigorous reprisal we merchant have long ago carry on they traffick with security we enemy would have court we with respect and we ally support we with confidence we negotiation treaty proposal and concession not only afford they leisure to collect they force equip they fleet and fortify they coast but give they likewise spirit to resist those who could not be conquer but by they own cowardice and folly by we ill-timed patience and linger preparation we encourage those to unite against we who would otherwise have only hate we in secret and deter those from declare in we favor whom interest or gratitude might have incline to assist we for who will support those from whom no mutual support can be expect and who will expect that those will defend they ally who desert themselves but sir however late we resentment be awaken have the war be prosecute vigorously after it be declare we might have be now secure from danger and free from suspense nor would any thing have remain but to give law to we enemy from the success of vernon with so inconsiderable force we may conjecture what would have be perform with a armament proportion to he undertaking and why he be not better supply no reason have yet be give nor can it be easily discover why we either do not begin the war before we enemy have concerted they measure or delay it till we have form we own notwithstanding some opportunity have be neglect and all the advantage of a sudden attack have be irrecoverably lose notwithstanding we friend sir have learn to despise and neglect we and we enemy be animated to confidence and obstinacy yet we real and intrinsick strength continue the same nor be there yet any preparation make against we by the enemy with view beyond they own security and defense it do not yet appear sir that we enemy however insolent look upon we as the proper object of a conquest or that they imagine it possible to besiege we in we own port or to confine we to the defense of we own country we be not therefore to have recourse to measure which if they be ever to be admit can be justify by nothing but the utmost distress and can only become proper as the last and desperate expedient the enemy sir ought to appear not only in we sea but in we port before it can be necessary that one part of the nation should be enslave for the preservation of the rest to destroy any part of the community while it be in we power to preserve the whole be certainly absurd and inconsistent with the equity and tenderness of a good government : and what be slavery less than destruction what greater calamity have that man to expect who have be already deprive of he liberty and reduce to a level with thief and murderer with what spirit sir will he draw he sword upon he invader who have nothing to defend or why should he repel the injury which will make no addition to he misery and will fall only on those to whom he be enslave it be well know that gratitude be the foundation of we duty to we country and to we superior whom we be oblige to protect upon some occasion because upon other we receive protection from they and be maintain in the quiet possession of we fortune and the security of we life but what gratitude be due to he country from a man distinguish without a crime by the legislature from the rest of the people and mark out for hardship and oppression from a man who be condemn to labor and to danger only that other may fatten with indolence and slumber without anxiety from a man who be drag to misery without reward and hunt from he retreat as the property of he master where gratitude sir be not the motive of action which may easily happen in mind not accustom to observe the end of government and relation of society interest never fail to preside which may be distinguish from gratitude as it regard the immediate consequence of action and confines the view to present advantage but what interest can be gratify by a man who be not master of he own action nor secure in the enjoyment of he acquisition why should he be solicitous to increase he property who may be tear from the possession of it in a moment or upon what motive can he act who will not become more happy by do he duty many of those to whom this bill be propose to extend have raise fortune at the expense of they ease and at the hazard of they life and now sit at rest enjoy the memory of they past hardship and incite other to the prosecution of the same adventure how will it be more reasonable to drag these man from they house than to seize any other gentleman upon he own estate and how negligently will we navigation and we commerce be promote when it be discover that either wealth can not be gain by they or if so gain can not be enjoy but it be still urge sir that there be a necessity of man the fleet a necessity which indeed can not totally be deny though a short delay would produce no frightful consequence would expose we to no invasion nor disable we from prosecute the war yet as the necessity at least deserve the regard of the legislature let we consider what motive have hitherto gain man over to the publick service let we examine how we land force be raise and how we merchant equip they ship how be all this to be effect without murmur mutiny or discontent but by the natural and easy method of offer reward it may be object sir that reward have be already propose without effect but not to mention the corrupt art which have be make use of to elude that promise by reject those that come to claim they we can infer from they inefficacy only that they be too small that they be not sufficient to dazzle the attention and withdraw it from the prospect of the distant advantage which may arise from the service of the merchant let the reward therefore be double and if it be not then sufficient double anew there be nothing but may be buy if a adequate price be offer and we be therefore to raise the reward till it shall be adjudge by the sailor equivalent to the inconveniency of the service let no man urge that this be profusion that it be a breach of we trust and a prodigality of the publick money sir the money thus pay be the price of liberty it be disburse to hinder slavery from encroach to preserve we natural rights from infraction and the constitution of we country from violation if we vote away the privilege of one class among we those of another may quickly be demand and slavery will advance by degree till the last remains of freedom shall be lose but perhaps sir it will appear upon reflection that even this method need not to be practice it be well know that it be not necessary for the whole crew of a ship to be expert sailor there must be some novice and many whose employment have more of labor than of art we have now a numerous army which burden we country without defend it and from whom we may therefore draw supplies for the fleet and distribute they amongst the ship in just proportion they may immediately assist the seaman and will become able in a short time to train up other it will doubtless sir be object to this proposal that the continent be in confusion and that we ought to continue such a force as may enable we to assist we ally maintain we influence and turn the scale of affair in the neighbouring country i know not how we be indebted to we ally or by what tie we be oblige to assist those who never assist we nor can i upon mature consideration think it necessary to be always gaze on the continent watch the motion of every potentate and anxiously attentive to every revolution there be no end sir of obviate contingency of attempt to secure ourselves from every possibility of danger i be indeed desirous that we friend if any there be that deserve that name should succeed in they design and be protect in they claim but think it ought always to be remember that we own affair affect we immediately theirs only by consequence and that the nearest danger be to be first regard with respect to the amendment offer to this clause i can not see that it will produce any advantage nor think any evidence sufficient to justify the breach of we constitution or subject any man to the hardship of have he dwelling enter by force and sir i be not entirely satisfied of the impartiality and equity with which it be promise that this law will be put in execution or what new influence be to cooperate with this law by which corruption and oppression will be prevent it be well know sir that many other law be make ineffectual by partiality or negligence which remarkably appear by the immense quantity of corn that be daily carry into foreign country by illegal exportation by which traffick i be inform that we obtain most of we foreign gold which in reality be pay we for corn by the dutch though it be studiously represent to the nation as gain by we traffick with portugal who can assure we that this law will not be pervert after the example of other and that there will not be wretch find that may employ it to the extortion of money or the gratification of revenge thus sir i have show by what mean we fleet may now be equip and how a supply of sailor may be perpetuate for i can not think how the boy which be educate in charity school can be more properly employ a proportion may be easily select for the service who will benefit the publick much more than by serve sharper and attorney and pilfer either at low gaming house or in the inn of court since therefore it be not pretended sir that this bill can be justified otherwise than by necessity and it appear that supplies may be raise by other means since instead of increase and encourage seaman nothing be propose that do not manifestly tend by depress and harass they to diminish they number i think it reasonable to declare that i shall continue to oppose it and hope that every friend of liberty or commerce will concur in the opposition sir robert walpole speak next to the following effect : -- sir i have consider the bill before we with the utmost impartiality and i can see no reason to apprehend that it will produce such universal discontent and give occasion to so many abuse as the honorable gentleman by whom it be oppose appear to suspect it be not uncommon sir in judge of future event and trace effect from cause for the most sagacious to be mistake the safest method of conjecture upon the future be to consider the past for it be always probable that from like cause like consequence will arise let we therefore sir examine what injustice or oppression have be hitherto produce by law of the same kind the power of search however it be now become the subject of loud exclamation and pathetick harangue be no new invasion of the rights of the people but have be already grant in its utmost extent for a end of no greater importance than the preservation of the game this formidable authority have be already trust to the magistrate and the nation have be already subject to this insupportable tyranny only lest the hare and partridge should be destroy and gentleman be oblige to disband they hound and dismiss they set dog yet sir even with regard to this power thus exorbitant and thus lightly grant i have hear no general complaint nor believe that it be look upon as a grievance by any but those whom it restrain from live upon the game and condemn to maintain themselves by a more honest and useful industry i hope sir those that think this law for the preservation of they amusement rational and just will have at least the same regard to the defense of they country and will not think they venison deserve greater solicitude than they fortune and they liberty nor be it difficult sir to produce instance of the exercise of this power for the end which be now propose without any consequence that should discourage we from repeat the experiment i have now in my hand a letter by which the mayor and alderman of bristol be empower to seize all the sailor within the bound of they jurisdiction which order be execute without any outcry of oppression or apprehension of the approach of slavery that this law sir will be always execute with the strictest impartiality and without the least regard to any private purpose can not indeed be demonstratively prove every law may possibly be abuse by a combination of profligate but it must i think be grant that it be draw up with all the caution that reason or justice or the corruption of the present age require i know not what can be contrived better than a association of man unlikely to concur in they view and interest -- a justice of the peace a lieutenant of a ship and a commissioner of the navy -- three man probably unknown to each other and of which no one will be at all solicitous to desire the rest to unite to commit a crime to which no temptation can be readily imagine this caution sir which can not but be approve and which surely be some proof of judgment and consideration ought in my opinion to have exempt the bill and those by whose assistance it be draw up from the reproachful and indecent charge of absurdity ignorance and incapacity term which the dignity of this assembly do not admit even when they be incontestably just and which surely ought not to be make use of when the question be of a doubtful nature the gentleman sir who be now intrust with publick employment have never yet discover that they be inferior to they predecessor in knowledge or integrity nor do they character suffer any diminution by a comparison with those who vilify and traduce they those sir that treat other with such licentious contempt ought surely to give some illustrious proof of they own ability and yet if we examine what have be produce on this question we shall find no reason to admire they sagacity or they knowledge we have be tell sir that the fleet might properly be man by a detachment from the army but it have not be prove that we have any superfluous force in the kingdom nor indeed will we army be find sufficiently numerous if by neglect to equip we fleet we give we enemy a opportunity of enter we country if it be inquire what necessity there be for we present force what expedition be design or what danger be fear i shall not think it my duty to return any answer it be sir the great unhappiness of we constitution that we determination can not be keep secret and that we enemy may always form conjecture of we design by know we preparation but surely more be not to be publish than necessity extort and the government have a right to conceal what it would injure the nation to discover nor can i sir approve the method of levy sailor by the incitement of a exorbitant reward a reward to be augment at the pleasure of those who be to receive it for what can be the consequence of such prodigality but that those to whom the largest sum be offer will yet refuse they service in expectation of a greater the reward already propose be in my opinion the utmost stretch of liberality and all beyond may be censure as profusion it be not to be imagine sir that all these objection be not make and answer in the reign of the late queen when a bill of the same nature be propose they be answer at least by the necessity of those time which necessity have now return upon we we do not find that it produce any consequence so formidable and destructive that they should for ever discourage we from attempt to raise force by the same mean it be then readily enact and execute without opposition and without complaint nor do i believe that any measure can be propose of equal efficacy and less severity mr sandy reply in substance as follow : -- sir whether the precedent produce in defense of this bill will have more weight than the argument must be show by a careful examination which will perhaps discover that the order send to the magistrate of bristol convey no new power nor such as be in any respect parallel to that which this bill be intend to confer they be only enjoin to inquire with more than usual strictness after stroller and vagabond such as the law have always subject to punishment and send they to the fleet instead of any other place of correction a method which may now be pursue without danger opposition or complaint but for my part i be not able upon the closest attention to the present scene of affair to find out the necessity of extraordinary method of any kind the fear of a invasion from france be in my opinion sir merely chimerical from they fleet in america the coast of britain have nothing to fear and after the numerous levy of seaman by which it be fit out it be not yet probable that they can speedily send out another we know sir that the number of seaman depend upon the extent of commerce and surely there be as yet no such disproportion between they trade and ours as that they should be able to furnish out a naval armament with much greater expedition than ourselves in america we force be at least equal to theirs so that it be not very probable that after the total destruction of we fleet by they they should be so little injured as to be able immediately to set sail for the channel and insult we in we own port to effect this sir they must not only conquer we but conquer we without resistance if they do not interrupt we in we attempt nor expose themselves to a engagement they may indeed return without suffer great damages but i know not how they can leave the shore of america unobserved or pour a unexpected invasion upon we if they continue there sir they can not hurt as and when they return we may prepare for they reception there be man i know sir who have reason to think highly of the french policy and whose idea may be exalt to a belief that they can perform impossibility but i have not yet prevail upon myself to conceive that they can act invisibly or that they can equip a fleet by sorcery collect a army in a moment and defy we on we own coast without any perceptible preparation then admiral wager speak thus : -- the calamity produce by discord and contention need not to be point out but it may be proper to reflect upon the consequence of a house divide against itself that we may endeavor to avoid they unanimity be produce by nothing more powerfully than by impend danger and therefore it may be useful to show those who seem at present in profound security that the power of france be more formidable than they be willing to allow my age sir enable I to remember many transaction of the war in the late reign to which many gentleman be stranger or of which they have only imperfect idea from history and tradition in the second year of the reign of william the french gain a victory over the unite fleet of the maritime power which give they for the summer follow the dominion of the channel enable they to shut up we merchant in they port and produce a total suspension of we commerce those sir to whom the importance of trade be so well know will easily apprehend the weight of this calamity and will i hope reject no measure that have a manifest tendency to prevent it we ship sir do not lie useless because there be any want of seaman in the nation but because any service be prefer to that of the publick there be now to my knowledge in one town on the west coast no fewer than twelve hundred sailor of which surely a third part may be justly claim by the publick interest nor do i know why they who obstinately refuse to serve they country should be treat with so much tenderness it be more reasonable that they should suffer by they refusal than that the general happiness should be endanger mr southwell speak next to the follow purpose : -- sir when any authority shall be lodge in my hand to be exercise for the publick benefit i shall always endeavor to exert it with honesty and diligence but will never be make the instrument of oppression nor execute any commission of tyranny or injustice as therefore the power of search be to be place in the hand of justice of the peace i think it necessary to declare that i will never perform so hateful a part of the office and that if this bill become a law i will retire from the place to which my authority be limited rather than contribute to the misery of my fellow-subject mr littleton speak as follow : -- sir all the argument which have be offer in support of this bill be reduce at last to one constant assertion of the necessity of pass it we have be tell sir with great acuteness that a war can not be carry on without man and that ship be useless without sailor and from thence it be infer that the bill be necessary that force be by some means necessary to be raise the warmest opponent of the bill will not deny but they can not therefore allow the inference that the method now propose be necessary they be of opinion sir that cruel and oppressive measure can never be justified till all other have be try without effect they think that the law when it be formerly pass be unjust and be convince by observe that it never be revive and that it be by experience discover to be useless necessity absolute necessity be a formidable sound and may terrify the weak and timorous into silence and compliance but it will be find upon reflection to be often nothing but a idle feint to amuse and to delude we and that what be represent as necessary to the publick be only something convenient to man in power necessity sir have heretofore be produce as a plea for that which could be no otherwise defend in the day of charle the first ship-money be declare to be legal because it be necessary such be the reasoning of the lawyer and the determination of the judge but the senate a senate of patriot without fear and without corruption and influence only by a sincere regard for the publick be of a different opinion and neither admit the lawfulness nor necessity it will become we on this occasion to act with equal vigor and convince we countryman that we proceed upon the same principle and that the liberty of the people be we chief care i hope we shall unite in defeat any attempt that may impair the rights which every briton boast as he birthright and reject a law which will be equally dreaded and detest with the inquisition of spain sir william yonge speak next to this effect : -- sir though many particular clause of this bill have be disapprove and oppose some with more and some with less reason yet the committee have hitherto agree that a bill for this purpose be necessary in the present state of we affair upon this principle we have proceed thus far several gentleman have propose they opinion contribute they observation and labor as in a affair universally admit to be of high importance to the general prosperity but now sir when some of the difficulty be surmount some expedient luckily strike out some objection remove and the great design bring nearer to execution we be on a sudden inform that all we labor be superfluous that we be amusing ourselves with useless consultation provide against calamity that can never happen and raise bulwark without a enemy that therefore the question before we be of no importance and the bill ought without farther examination to be totally reject i suppose sir i shall be readily believe when i declare that i shall willingly admit any argument that may evince we safety but in proportion as real freedom from danger be to be desire a supine and indolent neglect of it be to be dread and avoid and i can not but fear that we enemy be more formidable and more malicious than the gentleman that oppose this bill have represent they this bill can only be oppose upon the supposition that it give a sanction to severity more rigorous than we present circumstance require for nothing can be more fallacious or invidious than a comparison of this law with the demand of ship-money a demand contrary to all law and enforce by the manifest exertion of arbitrary power how have the conduct of he present majesty any resemblance with that of charle the first be any money levy by order of the council be the determination of the judge set in opposition to the decree of the senate be any man injure in he property by a unlimited extension of the prerogative or any tribunal establish superior to the law of the nation to draw parallel sir where there be no resemblance and to accuse by insinuation where there be no shadow of a crime to raise outcry when no injury be attempt and to deny a real necessity because it be once pretend for a bad purpose be surely not to advance the publick service which can be promote only by just reasoning and calm reflection not by sophistry and satire by insinuation without ground and by instance beside the purpose mr littleton answer : -- sir true zeal for the service of the publick be never discover by collusive subterfuge and malicious representation a mind attentive to the common good would hardly on a occasion like this have be at leisure to pervert a harmless illustration and extract disaffection from a casual remark it be indeed not impossible sir that i might express myself obscurely and it may be therefore necessary to declare that i intend no disrespectful reflection on the conduct of he majesty but must observe at the same time that obscure or inaccurate expression ought always to be interpret in the most inoffensive meaning and that to be too sagacious in discover conceal insinuation be no great proof of superior integrity wisdom sir be seldom captious and honesty seldom suspicious a man capable of comprehend the whole extent of a question disdain to divert he attention by trifling observation and he that be above the practice of little art or the motion of petty malice do not easily imagine they incident to another that in the question of ship-money necessity be pretend can not be deny and therefore all that i assert which be only that the nation have be once terrify without reason by the formidable sound of necessity be evident and uncontested when a fraud have once be practice it be of use to remember it that we may not twice be deceive by the same artifice and therefore i mention the plea of necessity that it may be inquire whether it be now more true than before that the senate sir and not the judge be now apply to be no proof of the validity of the argument which have be produce for in the day of ship-money the consent of the senate have be ask have there be any prospect of obtain it but the court have be convince by frequent experiment of the inflexibility of the senate and despaired of influence they by prospects of advantage or intimidate they by frown or menace may this and every future senate imitate they conduct and like they distinguish between real and pretend necessity and let not we be terrify by idle clamor into the establishment of a law at once useless and oppressive sir william yonge reply : -- sir that i do not intend to misrepresent the meaning of the honorable gentleman i hope it be not necessary to declare and that i have in reality be guilty of any misrepresentation i be not yet convince if he do not intend a parallel between ship-money and the present bill to what purpose be he observation and if he do intend it be it not proper to show there be no resemblance and that all which could be infer from it be therefore fallacious and inconclusive nor do i only differ sir in opinion with the honorable gentleman with relation to he comparison of measure which have nothing in common with each other but will venture to declare that he be not more accurate in he citation from history the king do not apply to the judge because the senate would not have grant he the money that he demand but because he chief ambition be to govern the nation by the prerogative alone and to free himself and he descendant from senatorial inquiry that this account sir be just i be confident the history of those time will discover and therefore any invidious comparison between that senate and any other be without foundation in reason or in truth mr bathurst speak as follow : -- sir that this law will easily admit in the execution of it such abuse as will overbalance the benefit may readily be prove and it will not be consistent with that regard to the publick expect from we by those whom we represent to enact a law which may probably become a instrument of oppression the servant by whom i be now attend may be term accord to the determination of the vindicator of this bill a seafaring man have be once in the west indy and he may therefore be force from my service and drag into a ship by the authority of a justice of the peace perhaps of some abandon prostitute dignified with a commission only to influence election and awe those whom excise and riot-act can not subdue i think it sir not improper to declare that i would by force oppose the execution of a law like this that i would bar my door and defend they that i would call my neighbor to my assistance and treat those who should attempt to enter without my consent as thief ruffian and murderer lord gage speak to this effect : -- sir it be well know that by the law of this nation poverty be in some degree consider as a crime and that the debtor have only this advantage over the felon that he can not be pursue into he dwelling nor be force from the shelter of he own house i think it be universally agree that the condition of a man in debt be already sufficiently miserable and that it would be more worthy of the legislative power to contrive alleviation of he hardship than addition to they and it seem therefore no inconsiderable objection to this bill that by confer the power of enter house by force it may give the harpy of the law a opportunity of enter in the tumult of a impress and of drag a debtor to a noisome prison under pretence of force sailor into the service of the crown mr tracey then say : -- sir that some law for the end propose by the bill before we be necessary i do not see how we can doubt after the declaration of the admiral who be fully acquaint with the service for which provision be to be make and of the ministry whose knowledge of the present state of we own strength and the design of we enemy be doubtless more exact than they can acquire who be not engage in publick employment if therefore the measure now propose be necessary though they may not be agreeable to the present disposition of the people for whose preservation they be intend i shall think it my duty to concur in they that the publick service may not be retard nor the safety of a whole nation hazard by a scrupulous attention to minute objection mr campbell speak as follow : -- sir i have often amidst my elogy on british liberty and my declaration of the excellence of we constitution the impartiality of we government and the efficacy of we law be reproach by foreigner with the practice of impress as a hardship which would raise a rebellion in absolute monarchy and kindle those nation into madness that have for many age know no other law than the will of they prince a hardship which include imprisonment and slavery and to which therefore no aggravation ought to be add but if justice and reason sir be to be overborne by necessity if necessity be to stop we ear against the complaint of the oppressed and harden we heart at the sight of they misery let it at least not destroy we memory nor deprive we of the advantage of experience let we inquire sir what be the effect of this hateful authority when it be formerly consign to the magistrate be we fleet man in a instant be we harbor immediately crowd with sailor do we surprise we enemy by we expedition and make conquest before a invasion could be suspect i have hear sir of no such consequence nor of any advantage which deserve to be purchase by tyranny and oppression we have find that very few be procure by the magistrate and the charge of seize and convey be very considerable and therefore can not but conclude that illegal measure which have be once try without success should for a double reason never be revive sir john barnard speak to this effect : -- sir it be not without regret that i rise so often on this occasion : for to dispute with those whose determination be not influence by reason be a ridiculous task a tiresome labor without prospect of reward but as a honorable gentleman have lately remark that by deny the necessity of the bill instead of make objection to particular clause the whole design of find expedient to supply the sea service be at once defeat i think it necessary to remind he that i have make many objection to this bill and support they by reason which have not yet be answer but i shall now no longer confine my remark to single error but observe that there be one general defect by which the whole bill be make absurd and useless for the foundation of a law like this sir the description of a seaman ought to be accurately lay down it ought to be declare what act shall subject he to that denomination and by what mean after have once enlist himself in this unhappy class of man he may withdraw into a more secure and happy state of life be a man who have once only lose sight of the shore to be for ever hunt as a seaman be a man who by traffick have enrich a family to be force from he possession by the authority of a impress be a man who have purchase a estate and build a seat to solicit the admiralty for a protection from the neighbouring constable such question as these sir may be ask which the bill before we will enable no man to answer if a bill for this purpose be truly necessary let it at least be free from such offensive absurdity let it be draw up in a form as different as be possible from that of the bill before we and at last i be far from imagine that a law will be contrived not injurious to individual nor detrimental to the publick not contrary to the first principle of we establishment and not load with folly and absurdity mr vyner then speak : -- sir a definition of a seaman be so necessary in a bill for this purpose that the omission of it will defeat all the method that can be suggest how shall a law be execute or a penalty inflict when the magistrate have no certain mark whereby he may distinguish a criminal and when even the man that be prosecute may not be conscious of guilt or know that the law extend to he which he be charge with have offend if in define a seaman on the present occasion it be think proper to have any regard to the example of we predecessor whose wisdom have in this debate be so much magnify it may be observe that a seaman have be formerly define a man who haunt the sea a definition which seem to imply habit and continuance and not to comprehend a man who have perhaps never go more than a single voyage but though this definition sir should be add to the amendment already propose and the bill thereby be bring somewhat nearer to the constitutional principle of we government i can not yet think it so much rectify as that the hardship will not outweigh the benefit and therefore shall continue to oppose the bill though to some particular clause i have no objection -lrb- the term _ seafaring man _ be leave out and the several amendment be admit in the committee but the clause themselves to the number of eleven be give up on the report -rrb- house of common march 10 1740-1 the common resolve they house into a committee to consider the bill for the encouragement of sailor when admiral wager offer a clause by which it be to be enact that no merchant or body corporate or politick shall hire sailor at higher wages than thirty-five shilling for the month on pain of forfeit the treble value of the sum so agree for which law be to commence after fifteen day and continue for a time to be agree on by the house : and then speak to the follow purpose : -- sir the necessity of this clause must be so apparent to every gentleman acquaint with naval and commercial affair that as no opposition can be apprehend very few argument will be requisite to introduce it how much the publick calamity of war be improve by the sailor to they own private advantage how generally they shun the publick service in hope of receive exorbitant wages from the merchant and how much they extort from the merchant by threaten to leave they service for that of the crown be universally know to every officer of the navy and every commander of a trading vessel a law therefore sir to restrain they in time of war from such exorbitant demand to deprive they of those prospects which have often no other effect than to lull they in idleness while they skulk about in expectation of higher wages and to hinder they from deceive themselves embarrass the merchant and neglect the general interest of they country be undoubtedly just it be just sir because in regard to the publick it be necessary to prevent the greatest calamity that can fall upon a people to preserve we from receive law from the most implacable of we enemy and it be just because with respect to particular man it have no tendency but to suppress idleness fraud and extortion mr henby fox speak next : -- sir i have no objection to any part of this clause except the day propose for the commencement : to make a law against any pernicious practice to which there be strong temptation and to give those whose interest may incite they to it time to effect they scheme before the law shall begin to operate seem not very consistent with wisdom or vigilance it be not deny sir that the merchant be betray by that regard to private interest which prevail too frequently over nobler view to bribe away from the service of the crown by large reward those sailor whose assistance be now so necessary to the publick and therefore it be not to be imagine that they will not employ they utmost diligence to improve the interval which the bill allow in make contract for the ensue year and that the sailor will not eagerly engage themselves before this law shall preclude they prospects of advantage as therefore to make no law and to make a law that will not be observe be in consequence the same and the time allow by the clause as it now stand may make the whole provision ineffectual it be my opinion that either it ought to begin to operate to-morrow or that we ought to leave the whole affair in its present state then sir robert walpole speak as follow : -- sir nothing have a greater appearance of injustice than to punish man by virtue of law with which they be not acquaint the law therefore be always suppose to be know by those who have offend it because it be the duty of every man to know it and certainly it ought to be the care of the legislature that those whom a law will affect may have a possibility of know it and that those may not be punish for fail in they duty whom nothing but inevitable ignorance have betray into offence but if the operation of this law should commence to-morrow what number may break it and suffer by the breach of it involuntarily and without design and how shall we vindicate ourselves from have be accessory to the crime which we censure and punish mr fox reply : -- sir i shall not urge in defense of my motion what be generally know and have be frequently inculcate in all debate upon this bill that private consideration ought always to give way to the necessity of the publick for i think it sufficient to observe that there be a distinction to be make between punishment and restraint and that we never can be too early in the prevention of pernicious practice though we may sometimes delay to punish they the law will be know to-morrow to far the greatest number of those who may be tempt to defeat it and if there be other that break it ignorantly how will they find themselves injure by be only oblige to pay less than they promise which be all that i should propose without longer warn the debate upon this particular will be at length reduce to a question whether a law for this purpose be just and expedient if a law be necessary it be necessary that it should be execute and it can be execute only by commence to-morrow lord baltimore speak thus : -- sir it appear to I of no great importance how soon the operation of the law commence or how long it be delay because i see no reason for imagine that it will at any time produce the effect propose by it it have be the amusement sir of a great part of my life to converse with man whose inclination or employment have make they well acquaint with maritime affair and amidst innumerable other scheme for the promotion of trade have hear some for the regulation of wages in trading ship scheme at the first appearance plausible and likely to succeed but upon a nearer inquiry evidently entangled with insuperable difficulty and never to be execute without danger of injure the commerce of the nation the clause sir now before we contain in my opinion one of those visionary provision which however infallible they may appear will be easily defeat and will have no other effect than to promote cunning and fraud and to teach man those act of collusion with which they would otherwise never have be acquaint mr lodwick speak to this effect : -- sir i agree with the honorable gentleman by whom this clause have be offer that the end for which it be propose be worthy of the closest attention of the legislative power and that the evil of which the prevention be now endeavor may in some measure not only obstruct we traffick but endanger we country and shall therefore very readily concur in any measure for this purpose that shall not appear either unjust or ineffectual whether this clause will be sufficient to restrain all elusive contract and whether all the little artifice of interest be sufficiently obviate i be yet unable to determine but by a reflection upon the multiplicity of relation to be consider and the variety of circumstance to be adjust in a provision of this kind i be incline to think that it be not the business of a transient inquiry or of a single clause but that it will demand a separate law and engage the deliberation and regard of this whole assembly sir john barnard say : -- sir notwithstanding the impatience and resentment with which some man see they mistake and ignorance detect notwithstanding the reverence which negligence and haste be say to be entitle to from this assembly i shall declare once more without the apprehension of be confute that this bill be draw up without consideration and be defend without be understand that after all the amendment which have be admit and all the addition propose it will be oppressive and ineffectual a chaos of absurdity and a monument of ignorance sir robert walpole reply : -- sir the present business of this assembly be to examine the clause before we but to deviate from so necessary a inquiry into loud exclamation against the whole bill be to obstruct the course of the debate to perplex we attention and interrupt the senate in its deliberation upon question in the determination of which the security of the publick be nearly concern the war sir in which we be now engage and i may add engage by the general request of the whole nation can be prosecute only by the assistance of the seaman from whom it be not to be expect that they will sacrifice they immediate advantage to the security of they country publick spirit where it be to be find be the result of reflection refine by study and exalt by education and be not to be hope for among those whom low fortune have condemn to perpetual drudgery it must be therefore necessary to supply the defect of education and to produce by salutary coercion those effect which it be vain to expect from other cause that the service of the sailor will be set up to sale by auction and that the merchant will bid against the government be incontestable nor be there any doubt that they will be able to offer the highest price because they will take care to repay themselves by raise the value of they goods thus without some restraint upon the merchant we enemy who be not debar by they form of government from any method which policy can invent or absolute power put in execution will preclude all we design and set at defiance a nation superior to themselves sir john barnard then say : -- sir i think myself oblige by my duty to my country and by my gratitude to those by whose industry we be enriched and by whose courage we be defend to make once more a declaration not against particular clause not against single circumstance but against the whole bill a bill unjust and oppressive absurd and ridiculous a bill to harass the industrious and distress the honest to puzzle the wise and add power to the cruel a bill which can not be read without astonishment nor pass without the violation of we constitution and a equal disregard of policy and humanity all these assertion will need to be prove only by a bare perusal of this hateful bill by which the meanest the most worthless reptile exalt to a petty office by serve a wretch only superior to he in fortune be enable to flush he authority by tyrannise over those who every hour deserve the publick acknowledgment of the community to intrude upon the retreat of brave man fatigue and exhaust by honest industry to drag they out with all the wantonness of grovel authority and chain they to the oar without a moment 's respite or perhaps oblige they to purchase with the gain of a dangerous voyage or the plunder of a enemy lately conquer a short interval to settle they affair or bid they child farewell let any gentleman in this house let those sir who now sit at ease project law of oppression and confer upon they own slave such licentious authority pause a few moment and imagine themselves expose to the same hardship by a power superior to they own let they conceive themselves tear from the tenderness and caress of they family by midnight irruption drag in triumph through the street by a despicable officer and place under the command of those by whom they have perhaps be already oppress and insult why should we imagine that the race of man for whom those cruelty be prepare have less sensibility than ourselves why should we believe that they will suffer without complaint and be injure without resentment why should we conceive that they will not at once deliver themselves and punish they oppressor by desert that country where they be consider as felon and lay hold on those reward and privilege which no other government will deny they this be indeed the only tendency whatever may have be the intention of the bill before we for i know not whether the most refined sagacity can discover any other method of discourage navigation than those which be draw together in the bill before we we first give we constable a authority to hunt the sailor like thief and drive they by incessant pursuit out of the nation but lest any man should by friendship good fortune or the power of money find means of stay behind we have with equal wisdom condemn he to poverty and misery and lest the natural courage of he profession should incite he to assist he country in the war have contrived a method of preclude he from any advantage that he might have the weakness to hope from he fortitude and diligence what more can be do unless we at once prohibit to seamen the use of the common element or doom they to a general proscription it be just that advantage sir should be proportion to the hazard by which it be to be obtain and therefore a sailor have a honest claim to a advance of wages in time of war it be necessary to excite expectation and to fire ambition by the prospect of great acquisition and by this prospect it be that such number be daily allure to naval business and that we privateer be fill with adventurer the large wages which war make necessary be more powerful incentive to those whom impatience of poverty determine to change they state of life than the secure gain of peaceful commerce for the danger be overlook by a mind intent upon the profit war be the harvest of a sailor in which he be to store provision for the winter of old age and if we blast this hope he will inevitably sink into indolence and cowardice many of the sailor be breed up to trade or capable of any laborious employment upon land nor be there any reason for which they expose themselves to the danger of a seafaring life but the hope of sudden wealth and some lucky season in which they may improve they fortune by a single effort be it reasonable to believe that all these will not rather have recourse to they former calling and live in security though not in plenty than encounter danger and poverty at once and face a enemy without any prospect of recompense let any man recollect the idea that arise in he mind upon hearing of a bill for encouraging and increase sailor and examine whether he have any expectation of expedient like these i suppose it be never know before that man be to be encourage by subject they to peculiar penalty or that to take away the gain of a profession be a method of recommend it more generally to the people but it be not of very great importance to dwell longer upon the impropriety of this clause which there be no possibility of put in execution that the merchant will try every method of elude a law so prejudicial to they interest may be easily imagine and a mind not very fruitful of evasion will discover that this law may be elude by a thousand artifice if the merchant be restrain from allow man they wages beyond a certain sum they will make contract for the voyage of which the time may very easily be compute they may offer a reward for expedition and fidelity they may pay a large sum by way of advance they may allow the sailor part of the profit or may offer money by a third hand to fix the price of any commodity of which the quantity and the use may vary they proportion be the most excessive degree of ignorance no man can determine the price of corn unless he can regulate the harvest and keep the number of the people for ever at a stand but let we suppose these method as efficacious as they most sanguine vindicator be desirous of represent they it do not yet appear that they be necessary and to inflict hardship without necessity be by no mean the practice of either wisdom or benevolence to tyrannise and compel be the low pleasure of petty capacity of narrow mind swell with the pride of uncontroulable authority the wantonness of wretch who be insensible of the consequence of they own action and of whom candor may perhaps determine that they be only cruel because they be stupid let we not exalt into a precedent the most unjust and rigorous law of we predecessor of which they themselves declare they repentance or confess the inefficacy by never revive it let we rather endeavor to gain the sailor by lenity and moderation and reconcile they to the service of the crown by real encouragement for it be rational to imagine that in proportion as man be disgust by injury they will be win by kindness there be one expedient sir which deserve to be try and from which at least more success may be hope than from cruelty hunger and persecution the ship that be now to be fit out for service be those of the first magnitude which it be usual to bring back into the port in winter let we therefore promise to all seaman that shall voluntarily engage in they besides the reward already propose a discharge from the service at the end of six or seven month by this they will be release from they present dread of perpetual slavery and be certain as they be when in the service of the merchant of a respite from they fatigue the trade of the nation will be only interrupted for a time and may be carry on in the winter month and large sum will be save by dismiss the seaman when they can not be employ by add this to the other method of encouragement and throw aside all rigorous and oppressive scheme the navy may easily be man we country protect we commerce reestablish and we enemy subdue but to pass the bill as it now stand be to determine that trade shall cease and that no ship shall sail out of the river mr pitt speak to the follow purport : -- sir it be common for those to have the greatest regard to they own interest who discover the least for that of other i do not therefore despair of recall the advocate of this bill from the prosecution of they favorite measure by argument of greater efficacy than those which be found on reason and justice nothing sir be more evident than that some degree of reputation be absolutely necessary to man who have any concern in the administration of a government like ours they must either secure the fidelity of they adherent by the assistance of wisdom or of virtue they enemy must either be awed by they honesty or terrify by they cunning mere artless bribery will never gain a sufficient majority to set they entirely free from apprehension of censure to different temper different motive must be apply : some who place they felicity in be account wise be in very little care to preserve the character of honesty other may be persuade to join in measure which they easily discover to be weak and ill-concerted because they be convince that the author of they be not corrupt but mistaken and be unwilling that any man should be punish for natural defect or casual ignorance i can not say sir which of these motive influence the advocate for the bill before we a bill in which such cruelty be propose as be yet unknown among the most savage nation such as slavery have not yet bear or tyranny invent such as can not be hear without resentment nor thought of without horror it be sir perhaps not unfortunate that one more expedient have be add rather ridiculous than shocking and that these tyrant of the administration who amuse themselves with oppress they fellow-subject who add without reluctance one hardship to another invade the liberty of those whom they have already overborne with tax first plunder and then imprison who take all opportunity of heighten the publick distress and make the misery of war the instrument of new oppression be too ignorant to be formidable and owe they power not to they ability but to casual prosperity or to the influence of money the other clause of this bill complicate at once with cruelty and folly have be treat with become indignation but this may be consider with less ardor of resentment and fewer emotion of zeal because though perhaps equally iniquitous it will do no harm for a law that can never be execute can never be feel that it will consume the manufacture of paper and swell the book of statute be all the good or hurt that can be hope or fear from a law like this a law which fix what be in its own nature mutable which prescribe rule to the season and limit to the wind i be too well acquaint sir with the disposition of its two chief supporter to mention the contempt with which this law will be treat by posterity for they have already show abundantly they disregard of succeed generation but i will remind they that they be now venture they whole interest at once and hope they will recollect before it be too late that those who believe they to intend the happiness of they country will never be confirm in they opinion by open cruelty and notorious oppression and that those who have only they own interest in view will be afraid of adhering to those leader however old and practice in expedient however strengthen by corruption or elate with power who have no reason to hope for success from either they virtue or ability mr bathurst next speak to this effect : -- sir the clause now under we consideration be so inconsiderately draw up that it be impossible to read it in the most cursory manner without discover the necessity of numerous amendment no malicious subtilty or artful deduction be require in raise objection to this part of the bill they crowd upon we without be seek and instead of exercise we sagacity weary we attention the first error or rather one part of a general and complicated error be the computation of time not by day but by calendar month which as they be not equal one to another may embarrass the account between the sailor and those that employ they in all contract of a short duration the time be to be reckon by week and day by certain and regular period which have be so constantly the practice of the seafaring man that perhaps many of they do not know the meaning of a calendar month : this indeed be a neglect of no great importance because no man can be deprive by it of more than the wages due for the labor of a few day but the other part of this clause be more seriously to be consider as it threaten the sailor with greater injury : for it be to be enact that all contract make for more wages than be here allow shall be totally void it can not be deny to be possible and in my opinion it be very likely that many contract will be make without the knowledge of this law and consequently without any design of violate it but ignorance inevitable ignorance though it be a valid excuse for every other man be no plea for the unhappy sailor he must suffer though innocent the penalty of a crime must undergo danger hardship and labor without a recompense and at the end of a successful voyage after have enrich he country by he industry return home to a necessitous family without be able to relieve they it be scarcely necessary sir to raise any more objection to a clause in which nothing be right but to show how its imperfection multiply upon the slightest consideration i take the opportunity to observe that there be no provision make for regulate the voyage perform in less time than a month so that the greatest part of the abuse which have be represent as the occasion of this clause be yet without remedy and only those sailor who venture far and be expose to the greatest danger be restrain from receive a adequate reward thus much sir i have say upon the supposition that a regulation of the sailor ' wages be either necessary or just a supposition of which i be very far from discover the truth that it be just to oppress the most useful of we fellow-subject to load those man with peculiar hardship to whom we owe the plenty that we enjoy the power that yet remain in the nation and which neither the folly nor the cowardice of minister have yet be able to destroy and the security in which we now sit and hold we consultation that it be just to lessen we payment at a time when we increase the labor of those who be hire and to expose man to danger without recompense will not easily be prove even by those who be most accustomed to paradox and be ready to undertake the proof of any position which it be they interest to find true nor be it much more easy to show the necessity of this expedient in we present state in which it appear from the title of the bill that we chief endeavor should be the increase and encouragement of sailor and i suppose it have not often be discover that by take away the profit of a profession greater number have be allure to it the high wages sir pay by merchant be the chief incitement that prevail upon the ambitious the necessitous or the avaricious to forsake the ease and security of the land to leave easy trade and healthful employment and expose themselves to a element where they be not certain of a hour 's safety the service of the merchant be the nursery in which seaman be train up for he majesty 's navy and from thence we must in time of danger expect those force by which alone we can be protect if therefore it be necessary to encourage sailor it be necessary to reject all measure that may terrify or disgust they and as they number must depend upon we trade let we not embarrass the merchant with any other difficulty than those which be inseparable from war and which very little care have be hitherto take to alleviate mr hay reply : -- sir the objection which have be urge with so much ardor and display with such power of eloquence be not in my opinion formidable enough to discourage we from prosecute we measure some of they may be perhaps readily answer and the rest easily remove the computation of time as it now stand be allow not to produce any formidable evil and therefore do not require so rhetorical a censure : the inconveniency of calendar month may easily be remove by a little candor in the contracting party or that the objection may not be repeat to the interruption of the debate week or day may be substitute and the usual reckoning of the sailor be still continue that some contract may be annul and inconveniency or delay of payment arise be too evident to be question but in that case the sailor may have he remedy provide and be enable to obtain by a easy process what he shall be judge to _ have deserve _ for it must be allow reasonable that every man who labor in honest and useful employment should receive the reward of he diligence and fidelity thus sir may the clause however loudly censure and violently oppose be make useful and equitable and the publick service advance without injury to individual sir robert walpole next rose and speak as follow : -- sir every law which extend its influence to great number in various relation and circumstance must produce some consequence that be never foresee or intend and be to be censure or applaud as the general advantage or inconveniency be find to preponderate of this kind be the law before we a law enforce by the necessity of we affair and draw up with no other intention than to secure the publick happiness and produce that success which every man 's interest must prompt he to desire if in the execution of this law sir some inconveniency should arise they be to be remedy as fast as they be discover or if not capable of a remedy to be patiently bear in consideration of the general advantage that some temporary disturbance may be produce be not improbable the discontent of the sailor may for a short time rise high and we trade be suspend by they obstinacy but obstinacy however determine must yield to hunger and when no higher wages can be obtain they will cheerfully accept of those which be here allow they short voyage indeed be not comprehend in the clause and therefore the sailor will engage in they upon they own term but this objection can be of no weight with those that oppose the clause because if it be unjust to limit the wages of the sailor it be just to leave those voyage without restriction and those that think the expedient here propose equitable and rational may perhaps be willing to make some concession to those who be of a different opinion that the bill will not remove every obstacle to success nor add weight to one part of the balance without make the other lighter that it will not supply the navy without incommode the merchant in some degree that it may be sometimes evade by cunning and sometimes abuse by malice and that at last it will be less efficacious than be desire may perhaps be prove but it have not yet be prove that any other measure be more eligible or that we be not to promote the publick service as far as we be able though we endeavor may not produce effect equal to we wish sir john barnard then speak to this effect : -- sir i know not by what fatality it be that nothing can be urge in defense of the clause before we which do not tend to discover its weakness and inefficacy the warmest patron of this expedient be impel by the mere force of conviction to such concession as invalidate all they argument and leave they opponent no necessity of reply if short voyage be not comprehend in this provision what be we now controvert what but the expedience of a law that will never be execute the sailor however they be contemn by those who think they only worthy to be treat like beast of burden be not yet so stupid but that they can easily find out that to serve a fortnight for greater wages be more eligible than to toil a month for less and as the numerous equipment that have be lately make have not leave many more sailor in the service of the merchant than may be employ in the coast trade those who traffick to remoter part must shut up they book and wait till the expiration of this act for a opportunity of renew they commerce to regulate the wages for one voyage and to leave another without limitation in time of scarcity of seaman be absolutely to prohibit that trade which be so restrained and be doubtless a more effectual embargo than have be yet invent let any man but suppose that the east indium company be oblige to give only half the wages that other trader allow and consider how that part of we commerce could be carry on would not they goods rot in they warehouse and they ship lie for ever in the harbor would not the sailor refuse to contract with they or desert they after a contract upon the first prospect of more advantageous employment but it be not requisite to multiply argument in a question which may not only be decide without long examination but in which we may determine we conclusion by the experience of we ancestor scarcely any right or wrong measure be without a precedent and amongst other this expedient have be try by the wisdom of former time a law be once make for limit the wages of tailor and that it be totally ineffectual we be all convinced experience be a very safe guide in political inquiry and often discover what the most enlighten reason fail to foresee let we therefore improve the error of we ancestor to we own advantage and whilst we neglect to imitate they virtue let we at least forbear to repeat they folly mr perry speak to this purpose : -- sir there be one objection more which my acquaintance with foreign trade impress too strongly upon my mind to suffer I to conceal it it be well know that the condition of a seaman subject he to the necessity of spend a great part of he life at a distance from he native country in place where he can neither hear of we design nor be instruct in we law and therefore it be evident that no law ought to affect he before a certain period of time in which he may reasonably be suppose to have be inform of it for every man ought to have it in he power to avoid punishment and to suffer only for negligence or obstinacy it be quite unnecessary sir to observe to this assembly that there be now as at all time great number of sailor in every part of the world and that they at least equally deserve we regard with those who be under the more immediate influence of the government these seaman have already contract for the price of they labor and the recompense of they hazard nor can we in my opinion without manifest injustice dissolve a contract found upon equity and confirm by law it be sir a undisputed principle of government that no person should be punish without a crime but be it no punishment to deprive a man of what be due to he by a legal stipulation the condition of which be on he part honestly fulfil nothing sir can be imagine more calamitous than the disappointment to which this law subject the unhappy man who be now promote the interest of they country in distant place amidst danger and hardship in unhealthy climate and barbarous nation where they comfort themselves under the fatigue of labor and the misery of sickness with the prospect of the sum which they shall gain for the relief of they family and the respite which they wages will enable they to enjoy but upon they return they find they hope blast and they contract dissolve by a law make in they absence no human be i think can coolly and deliberately inflict a hardship like this and therefore i doubt not but those who have by inadvertency give room for this objection will either remove it by a amendment or what be in my opinion more eligible reject the clause as inexpedient useless and unjust sir william yonge speak next to this effect : -- sir this debate have be protracted not by any difficulty arise from the nature of the question which have be the subject of it but by a neglect with which almost all the opponent of the bill may be justly charge the neglect of distinguish between measure eligible in themselves and measure preferable to consequence which be apprehend from particular conjuncture between law make only to advance the publick happiness and expedient of which the benefit be merely occasional and of which the sole intention be to avert some national calamity and which be to cease with the necessity that produce they such be the measure sir which be now intend measure which in day of ease security and prosperity it would be the highest degree of weakness to propose but of which i can not see the absurdity in time of danger and distress such law be the medicine of a state useless and nauseous in health but preferable to a linger disease or to a miserable death even those measure sir which have be mention as most grossly absurd and represent as parallel to the provision make in this clause only to expose it to contempt and ridicule may in particular circumstance be rational and just to settle the price of corn in the time of a famine may become the wisest state and multitude might in time of publick misery by the benefit of temporary law be preserve from destruction even those mast to which with a prosperous gale the ship owe its usefulness and its speed be often cut down by the sailor in the fury of a storm with regard to the ship which be now in distant place whither no knowledge of this law can possibly be convey it can not be deny that they crew ought to be secure from injury by some particular exception for though it be evident in competition between publick and private interest which ought to be prefer yet we ought to remember that no unnecessary injury be to be do to individual even while we be provide for the safety of the nation mr fazakerly speak to this effect : -- sir though i can not be suppose to have much acquaintance with naval affair and therefore may not perhaps discover the full force of the argument that have be urge in favor of the clause now under consideration yet i can not but think myself under a indispensable obligation to examine it as far as i be able and to make use of the knowledge which i have acquire however inferior to that of other the argument sir the only real argument which have be produce in favor of the restraint of wages now propose appear to I by no means conclusive nor can i believe that the meanest and most ignorant seaman would if it be propose to he hesitate a moment for a answer to it let I suppose sir a merchant urge it as a charge against a seaman that he raise he demand of wages in time of war would not the sailor readily reply that harder labor require larger pay would he not ask why the general practice of mankind be charge as a crime upon he only inquire say he of the workman in the dock have they not double wages for double labor and be not they lot safe and easy in comparison with mine who at once encounter danger and support fatigue carry on war and commerce at the same time conduct the ship and oppose the enemy and be equally expose to captivity and shipwreck that this be in reality the state of a sailor in time of war i think sir too evident to require proof nor do i see what reply can be make to the sailor 's artless expostulation i know not why the sailor alone should serve they country to they disadvantage and be expect to encounter danger without the incitement of a reward nor will any part of the hardship of this clause be alleviate by the expedient suggest by a honorable member who speak some time ago of grant or allow to a sailor whose contract shall be void what we court of law should adjudge he to deserve a _ quantum meruit _ : for accord to the general interpretation of we statute it will be determine that he have forfeit he whole claim by illegal contract to instance sir the statute of usury he that stipulate for higher interest than be allow be not able to recover he legal demand but irrecoverably forfeit the whole thus sir a unhappy sailor who shall innocently transgress this law must lose all the profit of he voyage and have nothing to relieve he after he fatigue but when he have by he courage repel the enemy and by he skill escape storm and rock must suffer yet severer hardship in be subject to a forfeiture where he expect applause comfort and recompense the attorney general speak next to this purport : -- sir the clause before we can not in my opinion produce any such dreadful consequence as the learn gentleman appear to imagine : however to remove all difficulty i have draw up a amendment which i shall beg leave to propose that the contract which may be affect as the clause now stand _ shall be void only as to so much of the wages as shall exceed the sum to which the house shall agree to reduce the seaman 's pay _ and as to the forfeiture they be not to be levy upon the sailor but upon the merchant or trading company who employ they and who be able to pay greater sum without be involve in poverty and distress with regard sir to the reason for introduce this clause they be in my judgment valid and equitable we have find it necessary to fix the rate of money at interest and the rate of labor in several case and if we do not in this case what will be the consequence -- a second embargo on commerce and perhaps a total stop to all military preparation be it reasonable that any man should rate he labor accord to the immediate necessity of those that employ he or that he should raise he own fortune by the publick calamity if this have hitherto be a practice it be a practice contrary to the general happiness of society and ought to prevail no longer if the sailor sir be expose to greater danger in time of war be not the merchant 's trade carry on likewise at greater hazard be not the freight equally with the sailor threaten at once by the ocean and the enemy and be not the owner 's fortune equally impair whether the ship be dash upon a rock or seize by a privateer the merchant therefore have as much reason for pay less wages in time of war as the sailor for demand more and nothing remain but that the legislative power determine a medium between they different interest with justice if possible at least with impartiality mr horace walpole who have stand up several time but be prevent by other member speak next to this purport : -- sir i be unwilling to interrupt the course of this debate while it be carry on with calmness and decency by man who do not suffer the ardor of opposition to cloud they reason or transport they to such expression as the dignity of this assembly do not admit i have hitherto defer to answer the gentleman who declaim against the bill with such fluency of rhetorick and such vehemence of gesture who charge the advocate for the expedient now propose with have no regard to any interest but they own and with make law only to consume paper and threaten they with the defection of they adherence and the loss of they influence upon this new discovery of they folly and they ignorance nor sir do i now answer he for any other purpose than to remind he how little the clamor of rage and petulancy of invective contribute to the purpose for which this assembly be call together how little the discovery of truth be promote and the security of the nation establish by pompous diction and theatrical emotion formidable sound and furious declamation confident assertion and lofty period may affect the young and unexperienced and perhaps the gentleman may have contract he habit of oratory by converse more with those of he own age than with such as have have more opportunity of acquire knowledge and more successful method of communicate they sentiment if the heat of he temper sir would suffer he to attend to those whose age and long acquaintance with business give they a indisputable right to deference and superiority he would learn in time to reason rather than declaim and to prefer justness of argument and a accurate knowledge of fact to sound epithet and splendid superlative which may disturb the imagination for a moment but leave no lasting impression on the mind he will learn sir that to accuse and prove be very different and that reproach unsupported by evidence affect only the character of he that utter they excursion of fancy and flight of oratory be indeed pardonable in young man but in no other and it would surely contribute more even to the purpose for which some gentleman appear to speak that of depreciate the conduct of the administration to prove the inconveniency and injustice of this bill than barely to assert they with whatever magnificence of language or appearance of zeal honesty or compassion mr pitt reply : -- sir the atrocious crime of be a young man which the honorable gentleman have with such spirit and decency charge upon I i shall neither attempt to palliate nor deny but content myself with wish that i may be one of those whose folly may cease with they youth and not of that number who be ignorant in spite of experience whether youth can be imputed to any man as a reproach i will not sir assume the province of determine but surely age may become justly contemptible if the opportunity which it bring have pass away without improvement and vice appear to prevail when the passion have subside the wretch that after have see the consequence of a thousand error continue still to blunder and whose age have only add obstinacy to stupidity be surely the object of either abhorrence or contempt and deserve not that he gray head should secure he from insult much more sir be he to be abhor who as he have advance in age have recede from virtue and become more wicked with less temptation who prostitute himself for money which he can not enjoy and spend the remains of he life in the ruin of he country but youth sir be not my only crime i have be accuse of act a theatrical part -- a theatrical part may either imply some peculiarity of gesture or a dissimulation of my real sentiment and a adoption of the opinion and language of another man in the first sense sir the charge be too trifling to be confute and deserve only to be mention that it may be despise i be at liberty like every other man to use my own language and though i may perhaps have some ambition to please this gentleman i shall not lay myself under any restraint nor very solicitously copy he diction or he mien however mature by age or model by experience if any man shall by charge I with theatrical behavior imply that i utter any sentiment but my own i shall treat he as a calumniator and a villain nor shall any protection shelter he from the treatment which he deserve i shall on such a occasion without scruple trample upon all those form with which wealth and dignity intrench themselves nor shall any thing but age restrain my resentment : age which always bring one privilege that of be insolent and supercilious without punishment but with regard sir to those whom i have offend i be of opinion that if i have act a borrow part i should have avoid they censure the heat that offend they be the ardor of conviction and that zeal for the service of my country which neither hope nor fear shall influence I to suppress i will not sit unconcerned while my liberty be invade nor look in silence upon publick robbery i will exert my endeavor at whatever hazard to repel the aggressor and drag the thief to justice whoever may protect they in they villany and whoever may partake of they plunder and if the honorable gentleman -- here mr winnington call to order and mr pitt sit down he speak thus : -- it be necessary sir that the order of this assembly be observe and the debate resume without personal altercation such expression as have be vent on this occasion become not a assembly intrust with the liberty and welfare of they country to interrupt the debate on a subject so important as that before we be in some measure to obstruct the publick happiness and violate we trust : but much more heinous be the crime of expose we determination to contempt and incite the people to suspicion or mutiny by indecent reflection or unjust insinuation i do not sir undertake to decide the controversy between the two gentleman but must be allow to observe that no diversity of opinion can justify the violation of decency and the use of rude and virulent expression expression dictate only by resentment and utter without regard to -- mr pitt call to order and say : -- sir if this be to preserve order there be no danger of indecency from the most licentious tongue : for what calumny can be more atrocious or what reproach more severe than that of speak with regard to any thing but truth order may sometimes be break by passion or inadvertency but will hardly be reestablish by monitor like this who can not govern he own passion whilst he be restrain the impetuosity of other happy sir would it be for mankind if every one know he own province we should not then see the same man at once a criminal and a judge nor would this gentleman assume the right of dictate to other what he have not learn himself that i may return in some degree the favor which he intend I i will advise he never hereafter to exert himself on the subject of order but whenever he find himself incline to speak on such occasion to remember how he have now succeed and condemn in silence what he censure will never reform mr winnington reply : -- sir as i be hinder by the gentleman 's ardor and impetuosity from conclude my sentence none but myself can know the equity or partiality of my intention and therefore as i can not justly be condemn i ought to be suppose innocent nor ought he to censure a fault of which he can not be certain that it would ever have be commit he have indeed exalt himself to a degree of authority never yet assume by any member of this house that of condemn other to silence i be henceforward by he inviolable decree to sit and hear he harangue without daring to oppose he how wide he may extend he authority or whom he will proceed to include in the same sentence i shall not determine have not yet arrive at the same degree of sagacity with himself nor be able to foreknow what another be go to pronounce if i have give offence by any improper sally of passion i ought to have be censure by the concurrent voice of the assembly or have receive a reprimand sir from you to which i should have submit without opposition but i will not be doom to silence by one who have no pretension to authority and whose arbitrary decision can only tend to introduce uproar discord and confusion mr henry pelham next rise up and speak to this effect : -- sir when in the ardor of controversy upon interesting question the zeal of the disputant hinder they from a nice observation of decency and regularity there be some indulgence due to the common weakness of we nature nor ought any gentleman to affix to a negligent expression a more offensive sense than be necessarily imply by it to search deep sir for calumny and reproach be no laudable nor beneficial curiosity it must always be troublesome to ourselves by alarming we with imaginary injury and may often be unjust to other by charge they with invective which they never intend general candor and mutual tenderness will best preserve we own quiet and support that dignity which have always be account essential to national debate and seldom infringe without dangerous consequence mr lyttleton speak as follow : -- sir no man can be more zealous for decency than myself or more convinced of the necessity of a methodical prosecution of the question before we i be well convinced how near indecency and faction be to one another and how inevitably confusion produce obscurity but i hope it will always be remember that he who first infringe decency or deviate from method be to answer for all the consequence that may arise from the neglect of senatorial custom : for it be not to be expect that any man will bear reproach without reply or that he who wander from the question will not be follow in he digression and hunt through he labyrinth it can not sir be deny that some insinuation be utter injurious to those whose zeal may sometimes happen to prompt they to warm declaration or incite they to passionate emotion whether i be of importance enough to be include in the censure i despise it too much to inquire or consider but can not forbear to observe that zeal for the right can never become reproachful and that no man can fall into contempt but those who deserve it -lrb- the clause be amend and agree to -rrb- house of common march 13 1740-1 the seventieth day of the session be appoint for the report from the committee on the bill for the increase and encouragement of sailor sir john barnard present a petition from the merchant of london and speak as follow : -- sir this petition i be direct to lay before this house by many of the principal merchant of that great city which i have the honor to represent man too wise to be terrify with imaginary danger and too honest to endeavor the obstruction of any measure that may probably advance the publick good merely because they do not concur with they private interest man whose knowledge and capacity enable they to judge rightly and whose acknowledge integrity and spirit set they above the suspicion of conceal they sentiment i therefore present this petition in the name of the merchant of london in full confidence that it will be find to deserve the regard of this assembly though i be equally with the other member a stranger to what it contain for it be my opinion that a representative be to lay before the house the sentiment of he constituent whether they agree with he own or not and that therefore it would have be superfluous to examine the petition which though i might not wholly have approve it i have no right to alter the petition be read and be as follow : the humble petition of the merchant and trader of the city of london -- showeth that you petitioner be inform a bill be depend in this honorable house for the encouragement and increase of seaman and for the better and speedier man he majesty 's fleet in which be clause that should the bill pass into a law you petitioner apprehend will be highly detrimental to the trade and navigation of this kingdom by discourage person from enter into or be breed to the sea service and entirely prevent the better and speedier man he majesty 's fleet by give the seaman of great britain and of all other he majesty 's dominion a distaste of serve on board the royal navy that you petitioner conceive nothing can be of so bad consequence to the welfare and defense of this nation as the treat so useful and valuable a body of man who be its natural strength and security like criminal of the highest nature and so differently from all other he majesty 's subject and at the same time be persuade that the only effectual and speedy method of procure for the service of he majesty 's fleet a proportionable number of the sailor in this kingdom be to distinguish that body of man by bounty and encouragement both present and future and by abolish all method of severity and ill usage particularly that practice whereby they be deprive after long and hazardous voyage of enjoy for a short space of time the comfort of they family and equal liberty with other they fellow-subject in they native country that you petitioner believe it will not be difficult to have such method point out as will tend to supply the present necessity and at the same time effectually promote the increase of seaman when this honorable house shall think fit to inquire into a matter of such high importance to the naval power trade and riches of this kingdom that you petitioner be convince this bill will not only be ineffectual to answer the end propose by it but will be destructive of the liberty of all he majesty 's subject as it empower any parish officer accompany with a unlimited number of person at any hour by day or by night to force open the dwelling-houses warehouse or other place provide for the security and defense of they life and fortune contrary to the undoubted liberty of the people of great britain and the law of this land in consideration therefore of the premise and of the particular prejudice hardship and danger which must inevitably attend you petitioner and all other the merchant and trader of this kingdom should this bill pass into a law you petitioner most humbly pray this honorable house that they may be hear by they counsel against the say clause in the say bill mr bathurst then present a petition and speak as follow : -- sir the alarm which the bill now depend have raise be not confine to the city of london or to any particular province of the king 's dominion the whole nation be throw into commotion and the effect of the law now propose be dread far and wide as a general calamity every town which owe its trade and its provision to navigation apprehend the approach of poverty and scarcity and those which be less immediately affect consider the infraction of we liberty as a prelude to they destruction happy would it be if we who be intrust with they interest could find any argument to convince they that they terror be merely panick that these fear have already extend they influence to the county which i represent the petition which i now beg leave to lay before the house will sufficiently evince and i hope they remonstrance will prevail with this assembly to remove the cause of they disquiet by reject the bill this be entitle a petition of several gentleman freeholder and other inhabitant of the county of gloucester in behalf of themselves and all other the freeholder of the say county set forth in substance that the petitioner be inform that a bill be depend in this house for the encouragement and increase of seaman and for the better and speedier man he majesty 's fleet contain several clause which should the bill pass into a law would as the petitioner apprehend impose hardship upon the people too heavy to be bear and create discontent in the mind of he majesty 's subject would subvert all the rights and privilege of a briton and overturn magna charta itself the basis on which they be build and by these means destroy that very liberty for the preservation of which the present royal family be establish upon the throne of britain for which reason such a law could never be obey or much blood would be shed in consequence of it mr henry pelham then speak to this purport : -- sir i have attend to this petition with the utmost impartiality and have endeavor to affix to every period the most innocent sense but can not forbear to declare it as my opinion that it be far distant from the style of submission and request : instead of persuade they attempt to intimidate we and menace we with no less than bloodshed and rebellion they make themselves the judge of we proceedings and appeal from we determination to they own opinion and declare that they will obey no longer than they approve if such petition as these sir be admit if the legislature shall submit to receive law and subject resume at pleasure the power with which the government be vest what be this assembly but a convention of empty phantom whose determination be nothing more than a mockery of state every insult upon this house be a violation of we constitution and the constitution like every other fabrick by be often batter must fall at last it be indeed already destroy if there be in the nation any body of man who shall with impunity refuse to comply with the law plead the great charter of liberty against those power that make it and fix the limit of they own obedience i can not sir pass over in silence the mention of the king whose title to the throne and the reason for which he be exalt to it be set forth with uncommon art and spirit of diction but spirit which in my opinion appear not raise by zeal but by sedition and which therefore it be we province to repress that he majesty reign for the preservation of liberty will be readily confess but how shall we be able to preserve it if he law be not obey let we therefore in regard to the dignity of the assembly to the efficacy of we determination and the security of we constitution discourage all those who shall address we for the future on this or any other occasion from speak in the style of governor and dictator by refuse that this petition should be lay on the table -lrb- the question be put and it be agree by the whole house that it should not lie on the table -rrb- mr henry pelham rise up again and speak thus : -- sir i can not but congratulate the house upon the unanimity with which this petition a petition of which i speak in the softest language when i call it irreverent and disrespectful have be refuse the regard commonly pay to the remonstrance of we constituent whose rights i be far from desire to infringe when i endeavor to regulate they conduct and recall they to they duty this be a occasion on which it be in my opinion necessary to exert we authority with confidence and vigor as the spirit of opposition must always be proportion to that of the attack let we therefore not only refuse to this petition the usual place on we table but reject it as unworthy of this house -lrb- the question be put and the petition reject with scarcely any opposition -rrb- the house then enter upon the consideration of the bill and when the report be make from the committee and the blank fill up sir william yonge speak in the follow manner : -- sir the bill have be bring by steady perseverance and diligent attention to such perfection that much more important effect may be expect from it than from any former law for the same purpose if it be execute with the same calmness and resolution the same contempt of popular clamor and the same invariable and intrepid adherence to the publick good that have be show in form and defend it but what can we hope from this or any other law if particular man who can not be convince of its expedience shall not only refuse to obey it but declare they design of obstruct the execution of it shall determine to retire from the sphere of they authority rather than exercise it in compliance with the decree of the senate and threaten in plain term to call the country in to they assistance and to pour the rabble by thousand upon those who shall dare to do they duty and obey they governor such declaration as these sir be little less than sally of rebellion and if they pass without censure will perhaps produce such commotion as may require to be suppress by other means than form of law and senatorial censure nor do i think that by reject the petition we have sufficiently establish we authority for in my opinion we yield too much in receive it the bill before we whatever may be its title be in reality a money bill a bill by which aid be grant to the crown and we have therefore no necessity of reject petition on this occasion because the standing order of the house forbid we to admit they they then proceed to the amendment and when the clause for limit the wages of seaman be read sir john barnard rise up and speak to this effect : -- sir we be now to consider the clause to which the petition relate which i have now present a petition on a subject of so general importance and offer by man so well acquaint with every argument that can be offer and every objection which can be raise that they request of be hear by they council can not be deny without expose we to the censure of adhering obstinately to we own opinion of shut we ear against information of prefer expedition to security and disregard the welfare of we country it will not be necessary to defer we determination on this clause for more than three day though we should gratify this just and common request and will not this loss be amply compensate by the satisfaction of the people for whose safety we be debate and by the consciousness that we have neglect nothing which might contribute to the efficacy of we measure the merchant sir do not come before we with loud remonstrance and harass complaint they do not apply to we passion but we understanding and offer such information as will very much facilitate the publick service it have be frequent in the course of this debate to hear loud demand for better expedient and more efficacious than those which have be propose and be it to be conceive that those who call thus eagerly for new proposal intend not to inform themselves but to silence they opponent from whom sir be the best method for the prosecution of naval affair to be expect but from those whose life be spend in the study of commerce whose fortune depend upon the knowledge of the sea and who will most probably exert they ability in contrive expedient to promote the success of the war than they whom the miscarriage of we fleet must irreparably ruin the merchant sir be enable by they profession to inform we -- be deter by they interest from deceive we they have like all other subject a right to be hear on any question and a better right than any other when they interest be more immediately affect and therefore to refuse to hear they will be at once impolitick and cruel it will discover at the same time a contempt of the most valuable part of we fellow-subject and a inflexible adherence to we own opinion the expedient of assert this to be a money bill by which the just remonstrance of the merchant be intend to be elude be too trivial and gross to be adopt by this assembly : if this bill can be term a money bill and no petition be therefore to be admit against it i know not any bill relate to the general affair of the nation which may not plead the same title to a exemption from petition i therefore desire that the consideration of this clause may be defer for two day that the argument of the merchant may be examine and that this affair may not be determine without the clearest knowledge and exactest information sir robert walpole speak next to this effect : -- sir the petition whether justifiable or not with regard to the occasion on which it be present or the language in which it be express be certainly offer at a improper time and therefore can lay no claim to the regard of this assembly the time prescribe by the rule of this house for the reception of petition be that at which the bill be first introduce not at which it be to be finally determine the petition before we be say not to regard the bill in general but a particular clause and it be therefore assert that it may now properly be hear : but this plea will immediately vanish when it shall be make appear that the clause be not mention in it and that there be no particular relation between that and the petition which i shall attempt -- here sir john barnard remark that sir robert walpole have the petition in he hand rise and say : -- sir i rise thus abruptly to preserve the order of this assembly and to prevent any gentleman from have in this debate any other advantage above the rest than that of superior ability or more extensive knowledge the petition be not order by the house to be place in the right honorable gentleman 's hand but on the table nor have he a right to make use of any other means for he information than be in the power of any other member : if he be in doubt upon any particulars contain in it he may move that the clerk should read it to the house sir robert walpole lay down the paper mr pelham rise and say : -- sir i be so far from think the rule of the house assert that in my opinion the right of the member be infringe by this peremptory demand be it not in the highest degree requisite that he who be about to reason upon the petition should acquaint himself with the subject on which he be to speak what inconveniency can ensue from such liberty as this i be not able to discover and as all the order of the house be doubtless make for more easy and expeditious despatch if a order be contrary to this end it ought to be abrogate for the reason for which other be observe the confidence with which this petition be present will not suffer we to imagine that the person who offer it fear that it can suffer by a close examination and i suppose though he have speak so warmly in favor of it without peruse he do not expect that other should with equal confidence admit -- sir john barnard observe that sir robert walpole lean forward towards the table to read the petition as it lay rise and say : -- sir i rise once more to demand the observation of the order of the house and to hinder the right honorable gentleman from do by stratagem what he do more openly and honestly before it be to little purpose that he lay down the petition if he place it within reach of he inspection for i be only desirous sir to hinder he from read and be far from suspect that he would take it away i insist that henceforward he obey the rule of this assembly with he eye as well as with he hand and take no advantage of he seat which may enable he to perplex the question in debate then the president speak thus : -- sir it be undoubtedly require by the order of the house that the petition should lie upon the table and that any member who be desirous of any farther satisfaction should move that they be read by the clerk that every member may have the same opportunity of understanding and consider they and that no one may be exclude from information by the curiosity or delay of another but the importance of this affair seem not to be so very great as to require a rigorous observance of the rule and it be to be wish for the ease and expedition of we deliberation that gentleman would rather yield point of indifference to one another than insist so warmly on circumstance of a trivial nature sir robert walpole then desire that the clerk might read the petition which be immediately do he proceed in the follow manner : -- sir have sit above forty year in this assembly and never be call to order before i be somewhat disconcerted by a censure so new and unexpected and in my opinion undeserved so that i be somewhat at a loss with regard to the train of argument which i have form and which i will now endeavor to recover yet i can not but remark that those gentleman who be so solicitous for order in other ought themselves invariably to observe it and that if i have once give a unhappy precedent of violate the rule of this house i have in some measure atone for my inadvertence by a patient attention to reproof and a ready submission to authority i hope sir i may claim some indulgence from the motive of my offence which be only a desire of accuracy and a apprehension that i might by mistake or forget some passage in the petition lose my own time and interrupt the proceedings of the house to no purpose but have now accord to order hear the petition and find no reason to alter my opinion i shall endeavor to convince the house that it ought not to be grant the petition sir be so far from bear any particular relation to the clause now before we that it do not in any part mention the expedient propose in it but contain a general declaration of discontent suspicion apprehension of dangerous proceedings and dislike of we proceedings insinuation sir by no means consistent with the reverence due to this assembly and which the nature of civil government require always to be pay to the legislative power to suspect any man sir in common life be in some degree to detract from he reputation which must suffer in proportion to the suppose wisdom and integrity of he who declare he suspicion to suspect the conduct of this senate be to invalidate they decision and subject they to contempt and opposition such and such only appear to be the tendency of the petition which have now be read a petition sir very unskilfully draw if it be intend against the clause under we consideration for it have not a single period or expression that do not equally regard all the other clause if any particular objection be make or any single grievance more distinctly point at it be the practice of impress a hardship i own peculiar to the sailor but it must be observe that it be a practice establish by immemorial custom and a train of precedent not to be number and it be well know that the whole common law of this nation be nothing more than custom of which the beginning can not be trace impress sir have in all age be issue out by virtue of the imperial prerogative and have in all age be obey and if this exertion of the authority have be consider as a method of severity not compensate by the benefit which it produce we can not imagine but former senate amidst all they ardor for liberty all they tenderness for the people and all they abhorrence of the power of the crown would have obviate it by some law at those time when nothing could have be refuse they the proper time for new scheme and long deliberation for amend we constitution and remove inveterate grievance be the day of prosperity and safety when no immediate danger press upon we nor any publick calamity appear to threaten we but when war be declare when we be engage in open hostility against one nation and expect to be speedily attack by another we be not to try experiment but apply to dangerous evil those remedy which though disagreeable we know to be efficacious and though sir the petitioner have be more particular i can not discover the reasonableness of hear they by they council for to what purpose be the lawyer to be introduce not to instruct we by they learning for they employment be to understand the law that have be already make and support the practice which they find established but the question before we relate not to the past but the future nor be we now to examine what have be do in former age but what it will become we to establish on the present occasion a subject of inquiry on which this house can expect very little information from the professor of the law perhaps the petitioner expect from they counsel that they should display the fecundity of they imagination and the elegance of they language that they should amuse we with the illusion of oratory dazzle we with bright idea affect we with strong representation and lull we with harmonious period but if it be only intend that just fact and valid argument should be lay before we they will be receive without the decoration of the bar for this end sir it would have be sufficient have the merchant inform they representative of the method which they have to propose for the ability of the gentleman whom the city have depute to this assembly be well know to be such as stand in need of no assistance from occasional orator nor can it be expect that any man will be find more capable of understand the argument of the merchant or better qualify to lay they before the senate that every petitioner have except on money bill a right to be hear be undoubtedly true but it be no less evident that this right be limit to a certain time and that on this occasion the proper time be elapse justice be due both to individual and to the nation if petition may at any time be offer and be whenever offer to be hear a small body of man might by unseasonable and importunate petition retard any occasional law till it should become unnecessary petition sir be to be offer when a new bill be bring into the house that all useful information may be obtain but when it have pass through the examination of the committee have be approve by the collective wisdom of the senate and require only a formal ratification to give it the force of a law it be neither usual nor decent to offer petition or declare any dislike of what the senate have admit we be not when we have proceed thus far to suffer pleader to examine we conduct or vary we determination accord to the opinion of those whom we ought to believe less acquaint with the question than ourselves should we once be reduce to ask advice and submit to dictator what would be the reputation of this assembly in foreign court or in we own country what could be expect but that we enemy of every kind would endeavor to regulate we determination by bribe we instructer nor can i think it necessary that lawyer should be employ in lay before we any scheme which the merchant may propose for supply the defect and redress the inconveniency of the law by which sailor be at present levy for the royal navy for how should lawyer be more qualified than other man to explain the particular advantage of such expedient or to answer any objection which may happen to rise it be well know that it be not easy for the most happy speaker to impress he notion with the strength with which he conceive they and yet harder be the task of transmit impart knowledge of convey to other those sentiment which we have not strike out by we own reflection nor collect from we own experience but receive merely from the dictate of another yet such must be the information that lawyer can give we who can only relate what they have implicitly receive and weaken the argument which they have hear by a imperfect recital nor do i only oppose the admission of lawyer to we bar but think the right of the merchant themselves in the present case very questionable for though in general it must be allow that every petitioner have a claim to we attention yet it be to be inquire whether it be likely that the publick happiness be he chief concern and whether he private interest be not too much affect to suffer he to give impartial evidence or honest information scarcely any law can be make by which some man be not either impoverished or hinder from grow rich and we be not to listen to complaint of which the foundation be so easily discover or imagine a law less useful because those who suffer some immediate inconvenience from it do not approve it the question before we be require by the present exigence of we affair to be speedily decide and though the merchant have with great tenderness compassion and modesty condescend to offer we they advice i think expedition preferable to any information that can reasonably be expect from they and that as they will suffer in the first place by any misconduct of we naval affair we shall show more regard to they interest by man we fleet immediately than by wait three or four day for farther instruction mr sandy answer to this effect : -- sir the merchant of london whether we consider they number they property they integrity or they wisdom be a body of too much importance to be thus contemptuously reject reject when they ask nothing that can be justly deny to the meanest subject of the empire when they propose to speak on nothing but what they profession enable they to understand to no purpose be it urge that the bill be far advance for if we have not proceed in the right way we ought to be in more haste to return in proportion as we have go farther nor can i discover why we should expedite with so much assiduity measure which be judge ineffectual by those who know they consequence best and for whose advantage they be particularly design that we have already spend so much time in consider method for man the fleet be surely one reason why we should endeavor at last to establish such as may be effectual nor can we hope to succeed without a patient attention to they opinion who must necessarily be well experience in naval affair it be surely therefore neither prudent nor just to shut out intelligence from we assembly and ridicule the good intention of those that offer it to consult upon the best expedient for encouraging and increase sailor and when the merchant offer they scheme to treat they as saucy impertinent idle meddler that assume -- here the attorney general call he to order and speak after this manner : -- sir it be not very consistent to press the despatch of business and to retard it at the same time by invidious insinuation or unjust representation of argument or expression : whenever any expression be censure it ought to be repeat in the same word for otherwise do not the animadverter raise the phantom that he encounter do he not make the stain which he endeavor with so much officious zeal to wipe away that no epithet of contempt or ridicule have in this debate be apply to the merchant nor any violation of decency attempt it be unnecessary to prove and therefore it be neither regular nor candid to represent any man as aggravate the refusal of they petition with reproach and insult but not to dwell longer on this incident i will take the liberty of remind the gentleman that personal invective be always at least superfluous and that the business of the day require rather argument than satire mr sandy then speak as follow : -- sir i be by no means convince that the learn gentleman who charge I with irregularity be better acquaint than myself with the rule and custom of this house which i have study with great application assist by long experience i hope therefore it will be no inexcusable presumption if instead of a tacit submission to he censure i assert in my own vindication that i have not deviate from the established rule of the senate that i have speak only in defense of merit insult and that i have condemn only such injurious insinuation i do not sir attempt to repeat expression as ought not to be hear without reply then the president say : -- i believe the gentleman either hear imperfectly or misunderstand these expression which he so warmly condemn for nothing have be utter that could justly excite he indignation my office oblige I on this occasion to remark that the regard due to the dignity of the house ought to restrain every member from digression into private satire for in proportion as we proceed with less decency we determination will have less influence mr pelham speak next in substance as follow : -- sir the reputation which the honorable gentleman have acquire by he uncommon knowledge of the usage of the senate be too well found to be shake nor be any attack upon he character intend when he be interrupt in the prosecution of he design to censure any indecent expression by whomsoever utter be doubtless consistent with the strictest regularity nor be it less proper to obviate any misrepresentation which inattention or mistake may produce i be far sir from think that the gentleman 's indignation be excite rather by malice than mistake but mistake of this kind may produce consequence which can not be too cautiously avoid how unwillingly would that gentleman propagate through the nation a opinion that the merchant be insult in this house they interest neglect and they intelligence despise at a time when no aspersion be throw upon they nor any thing intend but tenderness and regard and yet such have be the representation of this day 's debate which this numerous audience would have convey to the populace have not the mistake be immediately rectify and the rumor crush in the birth nothing sir can be more injurious to the character of this assembly by which the people be represent than to accuse they of treat any class of man with insolence and contempt and too much diligence can not be use in obviate a report which can not be spread in the nation without give rise to discontent clamor and sedition those who shall be incline to reject the petition may perhaps act with no less regard to the merchant and may promote they interest and they security with no less ardor than those who most solicitously labor for its reception : for if they be not allow to be hear it be only because the publick interest require expedition and because every delay of we preparation be a injury to trade that this be not a proper time for petition against the bill to be hear be universally know and i can discover nothing in the petition that restrain it to this particular clause which be so far from be specify that it appear to be the only part of the bill of which they have have no intelligence let the warmest advocate for the petition point out any part of it that relate to this single clause and i will retract my assertion but as it appear that there be only general declaration of the inexpediency of the measure propose and the pernicious tendency of the method now in use what be the petition but a complaint against the bill and a request that it should be lay aside the practice of impress sir be particularly censure as severe and oppressive a charge which however true have no relation to this clause which be intend to promote the voluntary engagement of sailor in the service of the crown yet it may not be improper to observe that as the practice of impress be in itself very efficacious and well adapt to sudden emergency as it have be establish by a long succession of age and be therefore become almost a part of we constitution and as it be at this time necessary to supply the navy with the utmost expedition it be neither decent nor prudent to complain too loudly against or to heighten the discontent of the people at a necessary evil we have sir examine every part of this bill with the attention which the defense of the nation require we have soften the rigor of the method first propose and admit no violence or hardship that be not absolutely necessary to make the law effectual which like every other law must be execute by force if it be obstruct or oppose we have insert a great number of amendment propose by those who be represent as the most anxious guardian of the privilege of the people and it be not surely to no purpose that the great council of the nation have so long and so studiously labor those who be choose by the people to represent they have undoubtedly sir some claim as individual to they confidence and respect for to imagine that they have commit the great charge of senatorial employment that they have trust they liberty and they happiness to those whose integrity they suspect or whose understanding they despise be to imagine they much more stupid than they have be represent by those who be censure as they enemy but far different be the regard due to the determination form by the collective wisdom of the senate a regard which ought to border upon reverence and which be scarcely consistent with the least murmur of dissatisfaction if we be to hear the present petitioner be it not probable that before we have despatch they we shall be solicit by other who will then plead the same right support by a new precedent and be it not possible that by one interruption upon another we measure may be delay till they shall be ineffectual it seem to I to be of much more importance to defend the merchant than to hear they and i shall therefore think no concession at this time expedient which may obstruct the great end of we endeavor the equipment of the fleet mr pulteney then speak as follow : -- sir notwithstanding the art and eloquence with which this grant of the merchant ' petition have be oppose i be not yet able to discover that any thing be ask unreasonable unprecedented or inconvenient and i be confident that no real objection can have be overlook by the gentleman who have speak against it i have spend sir thirty-five year of my life in the senate and know that information have always upon important question be willingly receive and it can not surely be doubt that the petitioner be best able to inform we of naval business and to judge what will be the right method of reconcile the sailor to the publick service and of supply we fleet without injure we trade they ability and importance have be hitherto so generally acknowledge that no senate have yet refuse to attend to they opinion and surely we ought not to be ambitious of be the first assembly of the representative of the people that have refuse a audience to the merchant with regard to the expedience of delay the bill at the present conjuncture he must think very contemptuously of the petitioner who imagine that they have nothing to offer that will counterbalance a delay of two day and must entertain a elevated idea of the vigilance and activity of we enemy enemy never before eminent for expedition if he believe that they can gain great advantage in so short a time the chief reason of the opposition appear indeed not to be either the irregularity or inexpediency of hear they but the offence which some have receive from a irreverent mention of the power of impress a power which never can be mention without complaint or detestation it be not indeed impossible that they may intend to represent to the house how much the sailor be oppress how much we commerce be impede and how much the power of the nation be exhaust by this cruel method they may propose to show that sailor not have the choice of they voyage be often hurry through a sudden change of climate from one extreme to another and that nothing can be expect from such vicissitude but sickness lameness and death they may propose that to have just arrive from the south may be plead as a exemption from a immediate voyage to the north and that the seaman may have some time to prepare himself for so great a alteration by a residence of a few month in a temperate climate if this should be they intention it can not in my opinion sir be call either unreasonable or disrespectful nor will they allegation be easily disprove but it be insinuate that they grievance be probably such as affect they only as distinct from the rest of the community and that they have nothing to complain of but a temporary interruption of they private advantage i have indeed no idea of the _ private advantage _ of a legal trader : for unless sir we neglect we duty of provide that no commerce shall be carry on to the detriment of the publick the merchant 's profit must be the profit of the nation and they interest inseparably combine it may however be possible that the merchant may like other man prefer they immediate to they greater advantage and may be impatient of a painful remedy though necessary to prevent a more grievous evil but let we not censure they by suspicion and punish they for a crime which it be only possible they may commit let we sir at least have all the certainty that can be obtain and allow they a audience let we neither be so positive as not to receive information nor so rigorous as not to listen to entreaty if the merchant have nothing to offer nothing but complaint and can propose no better measure than those which they lament if they argument should be find to regard only they present interest and to be form upon narrow view and private purpose it will be easy to detect the imposture and reject it with the indignation it shall deserve nor will we proceedings be then censure by the nation which require not that the merchant should be implicitly believe though it expect that they should be hear let we at least have a _ convention _ though we should not be able to conclude a treaty i know not sir why we have not take care to obviate all these difficulty and to remove the necessity of petition debate search and impress by the plain and easy method of a voluntary register by retain such a number of seaman as may probably be requisite upon sudden emergency would not the nation with more cheerfulness contribute half-pay to those who be daily labor for the publick good than to the caterpillar of the land service that grow old in laziness and be disabled only by vice let ten thousand man receive daily a small salary upon condition that they shall be ready whenever call upon to engage in the service of the crown and the difficulty of we naval preparation will be at a end that it be necessary to exert ourselves on this occasion and to strike out some measure for secure the dominion of the ocean can not be deny by any one who consider that we have now no other pretension to maintain that all we influence on the continent at whatever expense gain and support be now in a manner lose and only the reputation of we naval strength remain to preserve we from be trample on and insult by every power and from find spaniard in every climate sir william yonge speak in substance as follow : -- sir the violence and severity of impress so often and so pathetically complain of appear to be now nothing more than a punishment inflict upon those who neglect or refuse to receive the encouragement offer with the utmost liberality by the government and decline the service of they country from a spirit of avarice obstinacy or resentment that such man deserve some severity can not be doubt and therefore a law by which no penalty should be enact would be imperfect and ineffectual the observation sir of all law be to be enforce by reward on one side and punishment on the other that every passion may be influence and even we weakness make instrumental to the performance of we duty in the bill before we no punishment be indeed expressly decree because the sailor who shall disregard it be only leave to they former hardship from which those who engage voluntarily in the service of the navy be exempt why so many reward and so much violence should be necessary to allure or force the sailor into the publick service i be unable to comprehend : for except the sudden change of climate which may doubtless sometimes bring on distemper the service of the king have no disadvantage which be not common to that of the merchant the wages in the navy be indeed less : but then it be to be remember that they be certainly pay and that the sailor be in less danger of lose by a tempest or a wreck the whole profit of he voyage because if he can preserve he life he receive he pay but in trading voyage the seamen mortgage they wages as a security for they care which if the ship be lose they be condemn to forfeit thus sir the hardship of the navy appear not so great when compare with those of the merchant ' service as they have be hitherto represent and i doubt not that if counsellor be to be hear on both side the measure take for supply the fleet would be find to be reasonable and just sir john barnard rise to speak when mr fox call to order and proceed : sir it be well know to be one of the standing and unvariable order of this house that no member shall speak twice in a debate on the same question except when for greater freedom we resolve ourselves into a committee upon this question the honorable gentleman have already speak and can not therefore be hear again without such a transgression of we order as must inevitably produce confusion sir john barnard speak thus : -- sir i know not for what reason the honorable gentleman apprehend any violation of the order of the house for as i have not yet speak upon the present question i have a undoubted right to be hear a right which that gentleman can not take away sir william yonge next speak to this effect : -- sir i know not by what secret distinction the gentleman support in he own mind this declaration which to the whole house must appear very difficult to be defend for we must before we can admit it allow we memory to have forsake we and we eye and ear to have be deceive do he not as soon as the clause before we be read rise and assert the character of the petitioner and they right to the attention of the house do he not dwell upon they importance they ability and they integrity and enforce with he usual eloquence every motive to the reception of the petition how then can he assert that he have not speak in the present debate and how can he expect to be hear a second time since however he eloquence may please and he argument convince that pleasure and conviction can not now be obtain without infringe the standing order of the house then the president rise and speak to this purport : it be not without uneasiness that i see the time of the house and of the publick waste in fruitless cavil and unnecessary controversy every gentleman ought now to consider that we be consult upon no trivial question and that expedition be not less necessary than accuracy it can not be deny sir -lrb- to sir john barnard -rrb- that you have already speak on this question and that the rule of the house do not allow you to speak a second time sir robert walpole say : -- sir i be far from think the order of the house so sacred as that it may not be neglect on some important occasion and if the gentleman have any thing to urge so momentous that in he own opinion it outweigh the regard due to we rule i shall willingly consent that he shall be hear sir john barnard speak as follow : -- sir i be far from be incline to receive as a favor what in my own opinion i may claim as a right and desire not to owe the liberty of speak to the condescension of the right honorable gentleman what i have to urge be no less against the bill in general than the particular clause now immediately under we consideration and though the petition should relate likewise to the whole bill i can not discover why we should refuse to hear it petition from man of much inferior rank and whose interest be much less closely connect with that of the publick have be think necessary to be hear nor be the meanest individual to be injure or restrain without be admit to offer he argument in he own favor even the journeyman shoemaker one of the lowest class of the community have be permit to bring they counsel to we bar and remonstrate against the inconveniency to which they be afraid of be subject mr winnington speak thus : -- sir i be always willing to hear petition when respectfully draw up and regularly subscribe but can by no means discover that this be a real petition for i have hear of no name affix to it it be therefore a request from nobody and by reject it no man be refuse it may so far as can be discover be draw up by the gentleman who offer it and perhaps no other person may be acquaint with it mr hay speak to the follow purport : -- sir it be in my opinion necessary that a petition in the name of the merchant of london should be subscribe by the whole number for if only a few should put they name to it how do it appear that it be any thing more than a apprehension of danger to they own particular interest which perhaps the other part they rival in trade may consider as a advantage or at least regard with indifference this suspicion be much more reasonable when a petition be subscribe by a smaller number who may easily be imagine to have partial view and design not wholly consistent with the interest of the publick admiral wager then speak thus : -- sir if i be rightly inform another petition be prepare by several eminent merchant that this clause may stand part of the bill and certainly they ought to be hear as well as the present petitioner which will occasion great and unnecessary delay and therefore i be against the motion advocate campbell answer to this effect : -- sir i agree with that honorable gentleman that if the merchant be divide in opinion upon this point one side ought to be hear as well as the other and hope the house will come to a resolution for that purpose : for i shall invariably promote every proposal which tend to procure the fullest information in all affair that shall come before we -lrb- then the question be put that the farther consideration of the report be adjourn for two day in order to hear the merchant and it pass in the negative aye 142 no 192 -rrb- -lrb- on the report this day the eleven clause of severity be give up without any division and a clause be add viz provide that nothing in this bill shall be construe to extend to any contract or agreement for the hire of seaman -lrb- or person employ as such -rrb- in voyage from part beyond the sea to any other part beyond the sea or to great britain -rrb- the engrossed bill for the increase and encouragement of seaman be read accord to order when mr digby rise and speak as follow : -- sir i have a clause to be offer to the house as necessary to be insert in the bill before we which be put into my hand by a member whom a sudden misfortune have make unable to attend he duty and which in he opinion and mine be of great importance and i shall therefore take the liberty of read it be it enact that every seaman offering himself to serve he majesty shall upon be refuse receive from such captain lieutenant or justice of the peace a certificate setting forth the reason for which he be refuse which certificate may be produce by he as a exemption from be seize by a warrant of impress i hope the reasonableness and equity of this clause be so incontestably apparent that it will find no opposition for what can be more cruel unjust or oppressive than to punish man for neglect of a law which they have endeavor to obey to what purpose be reward offer if they be deny to those who come to claim they what be it less than theft and fraud to force a man into the service who would willingly have enter and subject he to hardship without the recompense which he may justly demand from the solemn promise of the legislature admiral wager next speak to this effect : -- sir to this clause which the gentleman have represent as so reasonable and just objection may in my opinion be easily make of which he will himself acknowledge the force the great obstruction of publick measure be partiality whether from friendship bribery or any other motive against partiality alone the clause which be now offer be level and indeed it be so dangerous a evil that it can not be obviate with too much caution but this clause instead of prevent private correspondence and illegal combination have a evident tendency to produce they by incite man to apply with pretended offer of service to those who be before suborn to refuse they then make a merit of they readiness and demand a certificate by such artifice multitude may exempt themselves from the impress who may be know to be able sailor even by those that conduct it and may under the protection of a certificate fallaciously obtain laugh at all endeavor to engage they in the publick service mr digby speak thus : -- sir if this authority lodge in the hand of those who be propose in the clause to be intrust with it be in danger of be execute without due regard to the end for which it be grant let it be place where there be neither temptation nor opportunity to abuse it let the admiralty alone have the power of grant such certificate the officer of which will be able to judge whether the sailor be really unfit for the service and deliver those whom age or accident have disable from the terror of impress for surely he that be fit to serve when take by violence be no less qualify when he enter voluntarily and he who could not be admit when he tender himself ought not to be drag away when perhaps he have contract for another voyage mr wager reply : -- sir it be doubtless more proper to place such authority in the officer of the admiralty than in any other but it do not appear that the benefit which the sailor may receive from it to whatever hand it be intrust will not be overbalance by the injury which the publick will probably suffer sailor be frequently levy in remote part of the kingdom in port where the admiralty can not speedily be inform of the reason for which those that may petition for certificate have be refuse and therefore can not grant they without danger of be deceive by fraudulent account the grievance for which the remedy be propose can not frequently occur for it be not probable that in a time of naval preparation any man qualify for the service should be reject since the officer gain nothing by they refusal mr hay speak as follow : -- sir it be very possible that those instance which may be produce of man who have be impress by one officer after they have be reject by another may be only the consequence of the high value which every man be ready to set upon he own ability : for he that offer himself no doubt demand the highest premium though he be not a able sailor and if reject and afterwards impressed as a novice think himself at liberty to complain with the most importunate vehemence of fraud partiality and oppression -lrb- the question be put be resolve in the negative almost unanimously -rrb- mr southwell offer a clause import that all sailor who should take advance-money of the merchant should be oblige to perform they agreement or be liable to be take up by any magistrate or justice of the peace and deem deserter except they be in he majesty 's ship of war he be second by lord gage : -- sir as this clause have no other tendency than to promote the interest of the merchant without obstruct the publick preparation as it tend only to confirm legal contract and facilitate that commerce from whence the wealth and power of this nation arise i hope it will readily be admit as we may by add this sanction to the contract make between the merchant and sailor in some degree balance the obstruction wherewith we have embarrass trade by the other clause admiral wager reply : -- this clause be unquestionably reasonable but not necessary for it be to be find already in a act make for the encouragement of the merchant which be still in force and ought whenever any such fraud be commit to be rigorously observe sir robert walpole then desire that the clerk might read the act in which the clause be accordingly find and mr southwell withdraw he motion -lrb- then the question be put whether the bill for the increase and encouragement of sailor do pass which be resolve in the affirmative 153 against 79 -rrb- house of common march 13 1740-1 -lrb- debate on the bill for the punishment of mutiny and desertion -rrb- the house be resolve into a committee for the consideration of the bill for the punishment of mutiny and desertion and for the better payment of the army and they quarter etc sir william yonge desire that the twentieth and twenty-sixth clause of the late act might be read which be read as follow : xx it be hereby enact that the officer and soldier so quarter and billet shall be receive by the owner of the inn livery-stables ale-house victualling-house and other house in which they be allow to be quarter and billet by this act and shall pay such reasonable price as shall be appoint from time to time by the justice of the peace in they general and quarter-session of each county city or division within they respective jurisdiction : and the justice of the peace aforesaid be hereby empower and require to set and appoint in they general or quarter-sessions aforesaid such reasonable rate for all necessary provision for such officer and soldier for one or more night in the several city town village and other place which they shall come to in they march or which shall be appoint for they residence and quarter xxvi that the quarter both of officer and soldier in great britain may be duly pay and satisfy be it enact that every officer to whom it belong to receive the pay or subsistence-money either for a whole regiment or particular troops and company shall immediately upon each receipt of every particular sum on account of pay or subsistence give publick notice thereof to all person keep inn or other place where officer or soldier be quarter by virtue of this act : also appoint they and other to repair to they quarter within four day at the farthest after the receipt of the same to declare the account or debt -lrb- if any shall be -rrb- between they and the officer and soldier quarter in they respective house : which account the say officer or officer be hereby require immediately to discharge before any part of the say pay or subsistence be distribute to the officer or soldier : provide the say account exceed not for a commission officer of horse under a captain for _ one day 's diet and small beer _ two shilling for one commission officer of dragoon under a captain one shilling for one commission officer of foot under a captain one shilling and for hay and straw for one horse sixpence for one dragoon or light horseman 's diet and small beer each day sixpence and hay and straw for he horse sixpence and also not to exceed _ fourpence _ a-day for one _ foot soldier 's diet and small beer _ he then speak to the following effect : -- sir whether there be any real difficulty in the clause which you have now hear read or whether there be such passage as may be easily understand by those who have no interest to mistake they and which be only cloud by a artificial obscurity whether they be in themselves capable of different meaning or whether avarice or poverty have produce unreasonable interpretation and find ambiguity only because they be determine not to be disappoint in they search whether this law be disobey because it be misunderstand or only misunderstand by those who have resolve to disobey it the committee must determine it have be for many year understand that innholder and keeper of publick-house be oblige by this law to supply soldier quarter upon they with diet and small beer and hay and straw for they horse at such rate as be mention in the act nor can i discover that these clause admit of any other interpretation or that any other could be intend by the senate by which it be enact the pay of the soldier sir be well know to those who give they consent to this law it be intend by they that the soldier should be supply with necessaries and it could not be mean that they should pay for they more than they receive they therefore establish the rate at which they be to be furnish and fix the highest rate which the wages of a soldier allow he to pay this interpretation be as i suppose from its apparent consonance to reason universally allow till the inhabitant of ledbury whither soldier have be send to suppress a riot and enforce the law find they apprehension so sharpen by they malice that they discover in the act a ambiguity which have till that time escape the penetration of the most sagacious and upon comparison of one circumstance with another find themselves under no obligation to give any assistance to the soldier they therefore sir not only refuse to afford they victuals at the accustomed rate but proceed from one latitude of interpretation to another at length deny they not only the privilege of diet but the use of kitchen utensil to dress the provision which they buy for themselves and at last deny they claim to the fire itself the soldier exasperate not only at the breach of they establish and uncontested privilege but at the privation of the necessaries of life begin to think of method more speedy and efficacious than those of argument and remonstrance and to form resolution of procure by force what in they opinion be only by force withhold from they what might have be the event of this controversy to what extremity a contest about thing so necessary might have be carry how wide the contest might have spread or how long it might have last we may imagine but can not determine have not a speedy decision be procure its consequence might have be fatal to multitude and a great part of the nation be throw into confusion have receive a account of the affair from the officer who command at that place i consult the attorney-general what be the design of the law and the extent of the obligation enforce by it and be answer by he that the sum which be to be pay for the diet of the man and the hay and straw for the horse be specify it must necessarily be intend by the legislature that no higher rate should be demand -- that the power grant to the justice of peace be wholly in favor of the soldier and that they might lessen the payment at discretion in place of uncommon cheapness or year of extraordinary plenty but could not increase it on any occasion another dispute sir of the like nature be occasion by the late scarcity at wakefield where the justice upon the application of the innkeeper make use of the authority which they suppose to have be repose in they by the act and raise the price of hay and straw to eight-penny which the soldier be not able to pay without suffer for want of victuals on this occasion likewise i be apply to and upon consult the present attorney-general receive the same answer as before and transmit he opinion to the place from whence i receive the complaint it have so much regard pay to it that the additional demand be thence-forward remit the letter which those two learn lawyer send to I on this subject i have now in my hand and hope they opinion will be think sufficient authority for the interpretation of a act of the senate nor be they authority sir however great so strong a proof of the justness of this interpretation as the reasonableness or rather necessity of admit it the only argument that can be produce against it be the hardship impose by it on the innholder who as it be object must be oblige by the law so understand to furnish the soldier with provision for a price at which he can not afford they but let it be consider how much more easily the landlord can furnish they at this price than they can provide for themselves and the difficulty will immediately vanish if soldier be necessary they must necessarily be support and it appear upon reflection that they pay will not support they by any other method if they be oblige to buy they victuals they must likewise buy fire and implement to dress they and what be still a greater hardship they must sell they and buy new at every change of they quarter if this be impossible it will be allow not to be the meaning of the senate upon whose wisdom it would be a censure too severe to suppose they capable of enact impossibility but to the innholder sir whose utensil be always in use and whose fire be always burn the diet of a soldier cost only the original price pay to the butcher and in year of common plenty may be afford without loss at the price mention in the act it can not indeed be deny that at present every soldier be a burden to the family on which he be quarter in many part of the kingdom but it may be reasonably hope that the present scarcity will quickly cease and that provision will fall back to they former value and even amidst all the complaint with which the severity and irregularity of the late season have fill the nation there be many place where soldier may be maintain at the state rate with very little hardship to they landlord however sir as this interpretation of the act though thus support both by authority and reason have be dispute and deny as some lawyer may be of a different opinion from those whom i have consult and as it be not likely that the practice thus interrupted will now be comply with as a prescription i think it necessary to propose that the price of a soldier 's diet be more explicitly ascertain that no room may remain for future controversy mr sandy then rise and speak as follow : -- sir i be very far from think the authority of these learn gentleman whose letter be produce incontrovertible proof of the justness of a interpretation of a act of the senate where that interpretation be not in itself warrant by reason nor consistent with the preservation or enjoyment of property much less shall i agree to support they interpretation by a new law or establish by a act of the legislature a kind of oppression for which however tacitly submit to nothing could be plead hitherto but custom the burden sir of a standing army be already too heavy to be much longer support nor ought we to add weight to it by new imposition it surely much better become the representative of the nation to attend to the complaint of they constituent and where they be find to arise from real grievance to contrive some expedient for alleviate they calamity a heavy and dreadful calamity sir lie now in a particular manner upon the people the calamity of famine one of the severest scourge of providence have fill the whole land with misery and lamentation and surely nothing can be more inhuman than to choose out this season of horror for new encroachment on they privilege and new invasion of the rights of nature the dominion of they own house and the regulation of they own table the honorable gentleman sir have mention place where provision as he say be still to be buy at easy rate for my part i be fix in no such happy corner of the kingdom i see nothing but scarcity and hear nothing but complaint and shall therefore be very far from admit now such method of support the army as be think too burdensome in time of plenty nor will combine in lay a new tax upon any class of my countryman when they be sink under a enormous load of impost and in want of the necessaries of life sir william yonge reply in the manner following : -- sir nothing be more easy than outcry and exaggeration nor any thing less useful for the discovery of truth or the establishment of right the most necessary measure may often admit of very florid exclamation against they and may furnish very fruitful topick of invective when we liberty sir be endanger or we country invade it may be very easy when it be propose that we should have recourse to we sword for security to bewail in pathetick language the misery of war to describe the desolation of city the waste of kingdom the insolence of victory and the cruelty of power inflamed by hostility yet to what will those representation contribute but to make that difficult which yet can not be avoid and embarrass measure which must however be pursue such sir appear to I to be the objection make to the method now propose of provide necessaries for the soldier method not eligible for they own sake but which ought not to be too loudly condemn till some better can be substitute for why should the publick be alarm with groundless apprehension or why should we make those law which we affair oblige we to enact less agreeable to the people by partial representation in the discussion of this question sir be to be consider whether soldier be to be support and whether it will be more proper to maintain they by the method of ascertain the rate at which they be to be supply or by increase they pay one of these two way it be necessary to take the provision be already fix at as high a price as they pay will allow if therefore they be expect to pay more they wages must be increase for my part i shall comply with either method though i can not but think it my duty to declare that in my opinion it be safer to fix the price of provision which must sink in they value than to raise the pay of the army which may never afterwards be reduce mr gybbon then speak to this effect : -- sir i agree with the honorable gentleman that if soldier be necessary we must make provision for they support this be indisputably certain but it be no less certain that where soldier be necessary restraint and regulation be necessary likewise to preserve those from be insult and plunder by they who maintain they for the sake of protection the usefulness sir of this caution seem not to be know or not regard by the gentleman whose proposal give occasion to this debate for by enact law in general term as he seem to advise we should leave the unhappy innkeeper wholly at the mercy of he guest who might plunder and insult he under the protection of the legislature might riot as in a conquered country and say to this treatment you be subject by the determination of the senate the unhappy man sir could have no prospect either of quiet or safety but by gratify all the expectation of he master return civility for insolence and receive they command with the same submission that be pay in capitulate town to the new garrison if it be necessary to ascertain the price be it not necessary at the same time to ascertain the species and quantity of provision to be allow for it be a soldier to fatten on delicacy and to revel in superfluity for fourpence a-day ought not some limit to be set to he expectation and some restraint prescribe to he appetite be he to change he fare with all the capriciousness of luxury and relieve by variety the squeamishness of excess such demand as these sir may be think ludicrous and trifling by those who do not reflect on the insolence of slave in authority who do not consider that the license of a military life be the chief inducement that bring volunteer into the army a inducement which would indeed make all impress superfluous be this proposal to be adopt : for how readily would all the lazy and voluptuous engage in a state of life which would qualify they to live upon the labor of other and to be profuse without expense we army may by this method be increase but the number of those by whom they be to be maintain must quickly diminish : for by exaction and oppression the poorer innkeeper must quickly become bankrupt and the soldier that lose they quarter must be add to the dividend allot to the more wealthy who by this additional burden will soon be reduce to the same state and then we army must subsist upon they pay because they will no longer have it in they power to increase it by plunder it will then be inevitably necessary to divide the army from the rest of the community and to build barracks for they reception a expedient which though it may afford present ease to the nation can not be put in practice without danger to we liberty the reason for which so many nation have be enslave by stand army be nothing more than the difference of a soldier 's condition from that of other man soldier be govern by particular law and subject to particular authority authority which in the manner of its operation have scarcely any resemblance of the civil power thus they soon learn to think themselves exempt from all other law of which they either do not discover the use and therefore easily consent to abolish they or envy the happiness of those who be protect by they and so prevail upon themselves to destroy those privilege which have no other effect with regard to they but to aggravate they own dependence these sir be the natural consequence of a military subjection and if these consequence be not always speedily produce by it they must be retard by that tenderness which constant intercourse with the rest of the nation produce by the exchange of reciprocal act of kindness and by the frequent inculcation of the wickedness of contribute to the propagation of slavery and the subversion of the rights of nature inculcation which can not be avoid by man who live in constant fellowship with they countryman but soldier shut up in a barrack exclude from all conversation with such as be wiser and honester than themselves and teach that nothing be a virtue but implicit obedience to the command of they officer will soon become foreigner in they own country and march against the defender of they constitution with the same alacrity as against a army of invader ravage the coast they will lose all sense of social duty and of social happiness and think nothing illustrious but to enslave and destroy so fatal sir will be the effect of a establishment of barracks or petty garrison in this kingdom and therefore as barracks must be build when innkeeper be ruin and we concurrence with this proposal must produce they ruin i hope it-will not be necessary to prove by any other argument that the motion ought to be reject mr pelham speak next in term to this purpose : -- sir though i be not incline by loud exaggeration and affect expression of tenderness to depress the courage or inflame the suspicion of the people to teach they to complain of misery which they do not feel or ward against ill design which be never form yet no man be more really solicitous for they happiness or more desirous of remove every real cause of fear and occasion of hardship this affection to the people a affection steady regular and unshaken have always prompt I to prefer they real to they seeming interest and rather to consult the security of they privilege than the gratification of they passion it have hitherto determine I to vote for such a body of troops as may defend we against sudden inroad and wanton insult and now incite I to propose that some efficacious method may be strike out for they support without exasperate either the soldier or they landlord by perpetual wrangle or add to the burden of a military establishment the necessity of contention in court of law i know not with what view those have speak by whom the proposal first make have be oppose they have indeed produce objection some of which be such as may be easily remove and other such as arise from the nature of thing and ought not therefore to be mention because they have no other tendency than to inflame the mind of those that hear they against a army at a time when it be allow to be necessary and prove only what be never deny that no human measure be absolutely perfect and that it be often impossible to avoid a greater evil but by suffer a less the question before we sir be in its own nature so simple so little connected with circumstance that may distract we attention or induce different man to different consideration that when i reflect upon it i can not easily conceive by what art it can be make the subject of long harangue or how the most fruitful imagination can expatiate upon it it be already admit that a army be necessary the pay of that army be already establish the accidental scarcity of forage and victuals be such that the pay be not sufficient to maintain they how then must the deficiency be supply it have be propose either to fix the price of provision with respect to they or to advance they wages in some proportion to the price of provision both these method seem to meet with disapprobation and yet the army be to be support those who reason thus do surely not expect to be answer or at least expect from a reply no other satisfaction than that of see the time of the session waste and the administration harass with trivial delay for what can be urge with any hope of success to he who will openly deny contradictory proposition who will neither move nor stand still who will neither disband a army nor support it whether these gentleman conceive that a army may subsist without victuals till the time of scarcity be over or whether they have raise those force only to starve they i be not sagacious enough to conjecture but shall venture to observe that if they have such a confidence in the moderation and regularity of the soldier as to imagine that they will starve with weapon in they hand that they will live within the sight of full table and languish with hunger and perish for want of necessaries rather than diminish the superfluity of other they ought for ever to cease they outcry about the licentiousness insolence and danger of a standing army but not to sink into levity unworthy of this assembly may i be permit to hint that these art of protract we debate be by no means consistent with the reason for which we be assemble and that it be a much better proof both of ability and integrity to remove objection than to raise they and to facilitate than to retard the business of the publick the proposal make at first be only to elucidate a law which have be regularly observe for fifty year and to remove such ambiguity as tend only to embarrass the innholder not to relieve they to this many objection have be make and much declamation have be employ to display the hardship of maintain soldier but no better method have be yet discover nor do i expect that any will be start not attend with greater difficulty in all political question question too extensive to be fully comprehend by speculative reason experience be the guide which a wise man will follow with the least distrust and it be no trivial recommendation of the present method that it have be so long pursue without any formidable inconvenience or loud complaint hardship even when real be alleviate by long custom we bear any present uneasiness with less regret as we less remember the time in which we be more happy : at least by long acquaintance with any grievance we gain this advantage that we know it in its whole extent that it can not be aggravate by we imagination and that there be no room for suspect that any misery be yet behind more heavy than that which we have already bear such be the present state of the practice now recommend to this assembly a practice to which the innkeeper have long submit and find it at least tolerable to which they know themselves expose when they take out a license for the exercise of that profession and which they consider as a tax upon they to be balance against the advantage which they expect from they employment this tax can not be deny at present to be burdensome in a very uncommon degree but this weight have not be of long continuance and it may be reasonably hope that it will now be make every day lighter it be indeed true that no unnecessary imposition ought to be lay upon the nation even for a day and if any gentleman can propose a method by which this may be take off or alleviate i shall readily comply with he proposal and concur in the establishment of new regulation with regard to barracks i can not deny that they be justly name of terror to a free nation that they tend to make a army seem part of we constitution and may contribute to infuse into the soldier a disregard of they fellow-subject and a indifference about the liberty of they country but i can not discover any connexion between a provision for the support of soldier in publick-house in a state of constant familiarity with they countryman and the erection of barracks by which they will be perhaps for ever separate from they nor can discover any thing in the method of support they now recommend that do not tend rather to the promotion of mutual good office and the confirmation of friendship and benevolence the advocate campbell next speak in substance as follow : -- sir whence the impropriety of raise objection to any measure that be propose be imagine to arise i be unable to discover have hitherto admit as a incontrovertible opinion that it be the duty of every member of this assembly to deliver without reserve he sentiment upon any question which be bring before he and to approve or censure accord to he conviction if it be he duty sir to condemn what he think dangerous or inconvenient it seem by no means contrary to he duty to show the reason of he censure or to lay before the house those objection which he can not surmount by he own reflection it certainly be not necessary to admit implicitly all that be assert and to deny or disapprove without reason can he no proof of duty or of wisdom and how shall it be know that he who produce no objection act from any other motive than private malevolence discontent or caprice nor be it sir to be imputed as a just reason for censure to those who have oppose the motion that no other measure have be offer by they to the consideration of the committee it be necessary to demolish a useless or shattered edifice before a firm and habitable building can be erect in its place : the first step to the amendment of a law be to show its defect for why should any alteration be make where no inconveniency be discover to the chief objection that be offer no answer have yet be make nor have the assembly be inform how the innkeeper shall be able to discover when he have pay the tax which this law lay upon he this be indeed a tax of a very particular kind a tax without limit and to be levy at the discretion of he for whose benefit it be pay soldier quarter upon these term be more properly raise contribution in a enemy 's country than receive wages in they own be it intend by this motion that the innkeeper shall judge what ought to be allow the soldier for he money i do not see then that any alteration be propose in the present condition of we army for who have ever refuse to sell they food for they money at the common price or what necessity be there for a law to enforce a practice equally to the advantage of all party if it be propose that the soldier shall judge for himself that he shall set what value he shall think fit on he own money and that he shall be at once the interpreter and executioner of this new law the condition of the innkeeper will then be such as no slave in the mine of america can envy and such as he will gladly quit for better treatment under the most arbitrary and oppressive government nor will the insolence of the soldier thus invest with unlimited authority thus entitle to implicit obedience and exalt above the rest of mankind by see he claim only bound by he own moderation be confine to he unhappy landlord every guest will become subject to he intrusion and the passenger must be content to want he dinner whenever the lord of the inn shall like it better than he own that these apprehension sir be not groundless may be prove from the conduct of these man even when the law be not so favourable to they design some of they have already claim the sole dominion of the house in which they have be quarter and insult person of very high rank and whom we ancient law have intend to set above the insult of a turbulent soldier they have see the provision which they have order take away by force partly perhaps to please the appetite of the invader and partly to gratify he insolence and give he a opportunity of boast among he comrade how successfully he bluster if it be necessary sir to insert a new clause in the act to prevent lawsuit which however advantageous they may sometimes be to I i shall always be ready to obviate it be surely proper to limit the claim of one party as well as that of the other for how else be the ambiguity take away the difficulty may be indeed transfer but be by no means remove and the innkeeper must wholly repose himself upon the lenity and justice of the soldier or apply to the court of law for the interpretation of the act the question before we be say to be so free from perplexity that it can scarcely give occasion for harangue or disputation and indeed it can not but be allow that the controversy may soon be bring to a single point and i think nothing more be necessary than to inquire if innholder shall be oblige to provide victuals for soldier at a state price what and how much the soldier shall demand the power of raise money at pleasure have be hitherto deny to we king and surely we ought not to place that confidence in the lowest that have be refuse to the most exalted of mankind or invest we soldier with power which neither the most warlike of we monarch could constrain we nor the most popular allure we to grant the power now propose to be grant be nothing less than the power of levy money or what be exactly equivalent the power of raise the money in they own hand to any imaginary value a soldier may if this motion be comply with demand for a penny what another man must purchase at forty time that price while this be the state of we property it be surely not very necessary to raise army for the defense of it for why should we preserve it from one enemy only to throw it into the hand of another equally rapacious equally merciless and only distinguish from foreign invader by this circumstance that he receive from we own hand the authority by which he plunder we have thus evince the necessity of determine the soldier 's privilege and the innkeeper 's rights i think it necessary to recommend to this assembly a uncommon degree of attention to the regulation of we military establishment which be become not only more burdensome to we fellow-subject by the present famine but by the increase of we force a increase which the nation will not behold without impatience unless they be enable to discern for what end they have be raise the people of this nation be for very just reason displeased even with the appearance of a standing army and surely it be not prudent to exasperate they by augment the troops in a year of famine and give they at the same time new power of extortion and oppression mr winnington speak to this purpose : -- sir i have hear nothing in this debate but doubt and objection which afford no real information nor tend to the alleviation of those grievance which be so loudly lament it be not sufficient to point out inconveniency or to give striking representation of the hardship to which the people be expose for unless some better expedient can be propose or some method discover by which we may receive the benefit without suffer the disadvantage of the present practice how do it appear that these hardship however severe be not inseparable from we present condition and such as can only be remove by expose ourselves to more formidable evil as no remedy sir have be propose by those who appear dissatisfy with the present custom it be reasonable to imagine that none will be easily discover and therefore i can not but think it reasonable that the motion should be comply with by it no new imposition be intend nor any thing more than the establishment of a practice which have continue for more than fifty year and never except on two occasion be deny to be legal it be only propose that the senate should confirm that interpretation of the act which have be almost universally receive that they should do what can produce no disturbance because it will make no alteration but may prevent they because it may prevent any attempt of innovation or diversity of opinion sir john barnard speak next to the following effect : -- sir whether the interpretation of the act which be now contend for have be universally admit it be impossible to know but it be at least certain that the practice which be found upon it have in many place never be follow nor indeed can it be make general without great impropriety many of those sir who be style keeper of publick-house and on whom soldier be quarter under that denomination have no conveniency of furnish provision because they never sell they such be many of the keeper of livery stable among whom it be the common method to pay soldier a small weekly allowance instead of lodge they in they house a lodging be all which they conceive themselves oblige to provide and all that the soldier have hitherto require nor can we make any alteration in this method without introduce the license and insolence of soldier into private house into house hitherto unacquainted with any degree of riot incivility or uproar the reason for which publick-house be assign for the quarter of soldier be partly the greater conveniency of accommodate they in family that subsist by the entertainment of stranger and partly the nature of they profession which by expose they to frequent encounter with the rude and the debauched enable they either to bear or repress the insolence of a soldier but with regard sir to the person whom i have mention neither of these reason have any place they have not from they daily employment any opportunity of furnishing soldiery with bed or victuals nor by they manner of life be adapt to support intrusion or struggle with perverseness nor can i discover why any man should force soldier into they house who would not willingly admit they into he own mr cock speak to this effect : -- sir the practice mention by the honorable gentleman i know to be generally follow by all those that keep alehouse in the suburb of this metropolis who pay the soldier billet on they a composition for they lodging nor ever see they but when they come to receive it so far be they from imagine that they can claim they whole subsistence at any state price it be apparent therefore that by admit this motion we should not confirm a law already receive but establish a new regulation unknown to the people that we should lay a tax upon the nation and send we soldier to collect it general wade rose and speak to this purpose : -- sir i have be long conversant with military affair and therefore may perhaps be able to give a more exact account from my own knowledge of the antiquity and extent of this practice than other gentleman have have from they way of life a opportunity of obtain it be sir in the reign of king william the constant method by which the army be support as may be easily imagine by those who reflect that it be common for the soldier to remain for eight or ten month unpaid and that they have therefore no possibility of provide for themselves the necessaries of life they pay never be receive in those time by themselves but issue in exchequer bill for large sum which the innkeeper procure to be exchange and divide among themselves in proportion to they debt such be the practice sir in that reign which have be generally follow to this time and the rate then fix have not since be change and as no inconveniency have arise from this method i can discover no reason against confirm and continue it mr pultkney speak next in the manner following : -- sir those that have speak in defense of the motion have accuse they opponent with great confidence of declaim without argument and of waste the time of the session in a useless repetition of objection i do not indeed wonder that the objection which have be raise should have give some disgust for who can be please with hear he opponent produce argument which he can not answer but surely the repetition may be excuse for a objection be to be urge in every debate till it be answer or be discover to be unanswerable but what sir have those urge in defense of they own opinion who so freely animadvert upon the reasoning of other what proof sir have they give of the superiority of they own ability of the depth of they research or the acuteness of they penetration they have not produce one argument in favor of they motion but that it be found on custom they have not discover however wise and sagacious that it be always necessary to inquire whether a custom be good or bad for surely without such inquiry no custom ought to be confirm the motion which they would support be indeed useless in either case for a good custom will continue of itself and one that be bad ought not to be continue it be the business of the legislature to reform abuse and eradicate corruption not to give they new strength by the sanction of a law it have be urge sir that the law in reality exist already in that the act have be interpret in this sense by the attorney general and that he interpretation be generally receive this be then the state of the question : if the practice found upon this sense of the act generally prevail there be no need of a new clause to enforce what be already comply with if it do not prevail all that have be urge in defense of the motion fall to the ground i do not doubt sir that this custom have be receive without many exception and therefore think it ought still to remain a custom rather than be change into a law because it will be comply with as a custom where there be no obstacle to the observation of it and it ought not to be enforce by law where it be inconvenient and oppressive while the soldier sir be moderate in he demand and peaceable and modest in he behavior the innkeeper will cheerfully furnish he even more than he can afford at the state price and certainly rudeness insolence and unreasonable expectation may justly be punish by the forfeiture of some conveniency thus sir the innkeeper will preserve some degree of authority in he own house a place where the law of nature give every man dominion and the soldier will continue a regular and inoffensive member of civil society the absurdity of leave the soldier at large in he demand and limit the price which the innkeeper be to require have be already expose beyond the possibility of reply nor indeed have the least attempt be make to invalidate this objection for it have be pass in silence by those who have most zealously espouse the motion the account give by the honorable gentleman of the reason for which this regulation be first introduce in the reign of king william be undoubtedly just but it prove sir that there be no necessity of continue it for the soldier be now constantly pay and therefore need not that assistance from the innkeeper which be absolutely requisite when they be sometimes six month without money it have be urge sir with great importunity and vehemence that some expedient should be propose in the place of this which so many gentleman who have speak on this occasion seem incline to reject and which indeed can not be mention without contempt or abhorrence that the soldier should know as well as they landlord they own rights be undoubtedly just as well as that they should have some certain means of procure the necessaries of life it may therefore be proper to enact that the innkeeper shall either furnish they with diet at the established rate or permit they to dress the victuals which they shall buy for themselves with he fire and utensil and allow they candle salt vinegar and pepper by this method the soldier can never be much injure by the incivility of they landlord nor can the innkeeper be subject to arbitrary demand the soldier will still gain by decency and humanity greater conveniency than he can procure for himself by he pay alone and all opportunity of oppression on either side will in a great measure be take away i can not but express my hope that this method will be generally approve those that have oppose the establishment of a army will be please to see it make less grievous to the people and those that have declare in its favor ought surely to adopt without opposition any measure by the pursuit of which it may be bear with fewer complaint and less reluctance -lrb- the consideration of this question be defer and the chairman have move for leave to sit again it be resolve to proceed on this business upon the next day but one in a committee of the whole house -rrb- house of common march 15 1740-1 the order of the day be read for the house to resolve itself into a committee of the whole house to consider the bill for punish mutiny and desertion and the better pay the army and they quarter sir william yonge speak in substance as follow : -- sir the last day which be assign to the consideration of this bill be spend in long altercation in vague and unnecessary disquisition in retrospective reflection upon event long past and in aggravate of grievance that may never happen much sagacity be exert and much eloquence display but no determination be attain nor even that expedient examine by which those objection might be remove which appear so important or those danger obviate which be represent so formidable and so near i hope sir part of the time which have intervene between that debate and the present day have be employ by the gentleman whose scruple be so numerous and whose caution be so vigilant in contrive some method of maintain the army without oppress the victualler and of provide for we defense against foreign enemy without subject we to the evil of discontent and disaffection which they impute to the present state of the military establishment to object for ever and to advance nothing be a easy method of disputation upon any question but contribute very little to the increase of knowledge : a artful and acute objector may confound and darken and disturb but never assist inquiry or illustrate truth in political question sir it be still more easy and less ingenuous for all political measure be in some degree right and wrong at the same time : to benefit some they very frequently bear hard upon other and be therefore only to be approve or reject as advantage appear to overbalance the inconveniency or the inconveniency to outweigh the advantage it be sir the proper province of a senator to promote not to obstruct the publick counsel and when he declare he disapprobation of any expedient to endeavor to substitute a better : for how can he be say to sustain he part of the general burden of publick affair who lay other under the necessity of form every plan and invent every expedient and contents himself with only censure what he never endeavor to amend that every man who be call forth by he country to sit here as the guardian of the publick happiness be oblige by the nature of he office to propose in this assembly whatever he penetration or experience may suggest to he as advantageous to the nation i doubt not but all that hear I be sufficiently convinced and therefore can not but suppose that they have so far attend to they duty as to be able to inform we how the present inconveniency of this bill may be remedy and its defect supply to show sir at least my inclination to expedite a affair so important i shall lay before the house a amendment that i have make to the clause pursuant to a hint offer the last day by a honorable member that all innholder victualler etc shall be oblige to furnish soldier with salt vinegar small beer candle fire and utensil to dress they victuals and so do shall not be oblige to supply the troops with provision except on a march i be far sir from think the clause as it will stand after this amendment complete and unexceptionable be conscious that some article in it may require explanation the quantity of small beer to be allow to each soldier must necessarily be ascertain in order to prevent endless and indeterminable dispute for one man sir may demand a greater quantity than another and a man may be prompt by malice or wantonness to demand more than health require it will therefore be proper to limit the quantity which must be furnish that neither the soldier may suffer by the avarice of he landlord nor the landlord be oppress by the gluttony of the soldier with regard to this question sir i expect to find different opinion in this assembly which every man be at liberty to offer and to vindicate and i shall take this opportunity of propose on my part that every man may have a daily allowance of three quart one quart to each meal may be allow in my opinion to be sufficient and sure no gentleman can imagine that by this limitation much superfluity be indulge there be some part sir of this kingdom in which cider be more plentiful and cheaper than small beer consequently it may be for the ease of the victualler to have the choice allow he of furnish one or the other it will therefore be a very proper addition to this clause that the innkeeper shall allow the soldier every day three quart of either small beer or cider that penal sanction sir be essential to law and that no man will submit to any regulation inconvenient to himself but that he may avoid some heavier evil require not to be prove and therefore to complete this clause i propose that the victualler who shall neglect or refuse to observe it shall be subject to some fine for he non-compliance mr pelham speak to this effect : -- sir i can not omit this opportunity of observe how much the burden of the army be diminish by the judicious regulation invariably observe in the late reign and how little the assignment of troops be to be dread by the victualler in the reign of king william sir before fund be establish while the credit of the government be low the measure of the court be often obviate or defeat by the superiority of the discontented party and the supplies deny which be necessary to support they and in expectation of which they have be undertake it be not uncommon for the town in which the troops be station to murmur at they guest nor could they be charge with complain without just reason : for to quarter soldier upon a house be in those day little less than to send troops to live at discretion as all supplies sir be then occasional and temporary and nothing be grant but for the present exigence the prevalence of the opposition for a single session embarrass all the measure of the court in the highest degree they design be at a stand the force be unpaid and they be oblige to wait till another session for a opportunity of prosecute they scheme thus sir the soldier be sometimes five month without they pay and be necessarily support by the innkeeper at he own expense with how much reluctance and discontent i need not mention it can not but be immediately consider upon hear this account of the soldier 's condition with how many reproach he would receive he victuals how roughly he would be treat how often he would be insult as a idler and frown upon as a intruder nor can it be imagine that such affront however they might be provoke would be bear without return by those who know themselves not the author of the provocation and who think themselves equal suf-ferer with those who complain when the innkeeper growl at the soldier the soldier it may be suppose seldom fail to threaten or to plunder the innkeeper and to rise in he demand as he allowance be retrench thus sir the landlord and he guest be the constant enemy of each other and spend they life in mutual complaint injury and insult but by the present regularity of we military establishment this great evil be take away as the soldier require no credit of the victualler he be consider as no great incumbrance on he trade and be treat without indignity like any other member of the community he inhabit he quarter without violence insolence or rapacity and endeavor to recommend himself by officiousness and civility in the present method of payment sir the troops have always one month 's pay advance and receive they regular allowance on the state day so that every man have it in he power to pay he landlord every night for what he have have in the day or if he imagine himself able to procure he own provision at more advantage he can now go to market with he own money it appear therefore to I sir that the amendment now propose be the proper mean between the different interest of the innkeeper and soldier by which neither be make the slave of the other and by which we shall leave to both opportunity of kindness but take from they the power of oppression mr carew next speak as follow : -- sir the amendment now offer be not in my opinion so unreasonable or unequitable as to demand a warm and strenuous opposition nor so complete as not to be subject to some objection objection which however may be easily remove and which would perhaps have be obviate have they be foresee by the gentleman who propose it the allowance sir of small liquor propose i can not but think more than sufficient three quart a-day be surely more than the demand of nature make necessary and i know not why the legislature should promote or confirm in the soldiery a vice to which they be already too much incline the habit of tipple the innkeeper sir will be heavily burden by the obligation to supply the soldier with so many of the necessaries of life without payment and therefore it may be justly expect by he that no superfluity should be enjoy at he expense but there remain another objection sir of far more importance and which must be remove before this clause can be reasonably pass into a law it be not declare or not with sufficient perspicuity that it be to be leave to the choice of the innkeeper whether he will furnish the soldier with provision at fourpence a-day or with the necessaries enumerate in the clause for nothing if it be to be leave to the choice of the soldier the victualler receive no relief from the amendment to whose option since he must suffer in either case it ought to be refer because he only can tell by which method he shall suffer least mr cornwall speak in the manner following : -- sir it be not without the greatest diffidence that i rise to oppose the gentleman who offer the amendment for he ability be so far superior to mine that i object without hope of be able to support my objection and contend with a absolute certainty of be overcome i know not whether it may be allow I to observe that the difference between we faculty be with regard to strength and quickness the same as between the cider of he county and that of mine except that in one part of the parallel the advantage be on we side and in the other on he the cider sir of we county be one of we most valuable commodity so much esteem in distant place that we merchant often sell it by the bottle for more than the soldier have to give for the provision of a day and of such strength that i who be accustom to the use of it never be able to drink three quart in any single day if therefore sir the soldier be to have three quart of this cider when small beer be not easily to be procure not only the innkeeper but the army will be injure for what greater harm can be do to any man than to initiate he in a habit of intemperance and what outrage and insolency may not be expect from man trust with sword and keep from day to day and from month to month in habitual drunkenness by a decree of the senate sir william yonge reply to this purpose : -- sir i know not why the gentleman have think this a proper opportunity for display he eloquence in the praise of he own cider that he love he own county can not be wonder for no passion be more universal and few less to be censured-but he be not to imagine that the produce of he native soil will be generally allow to excel that of other county because early habit have endear it to he and familiarize it to he particular palate the native of every place prefer they own fruit and they own liquor and therefore no inference can be draw from approbation so apparently partial from this prejudice i be far from suspect myself free nor be desirous or industrious to overcome it : neither be i afraid of expose myself to all the censure that so innocent a prepossession may bring upon I by declare that in my opinion the cider of my native county be of equal excellence with that which this gentleman have so liberally extol mr cornwall answer to the following effect : -- sir how little i expect victory in this controversy i have already declare and i need not observe of how small importance it be what soil produce cider of the greatest excellence and value since if there be other place where the cider be equally esteem and purchase at the same rate it be yet more necessary to provide by some exception that the soldier shall not be entitle to demand of the victualler liquor to more than thrice the value of he pay nor be allow to revel in continual drunkenness and to corrupt he moral and enervate he limb by incessant debauchery but since sir the preference due to the cider of my county have be deny in my opinion with great partiality and injustice i think myself oblige by all the law of honor and gratitude to stand up once more to vindicate its superiority and assert its value the law of honor sir require this from I as they oblige every man to stand forth a vindicator of merit slight and oppress and gratitude call loudly upon I to exert myself in the protection of that to which i have be often indebted for a please suspense of care and a welcome flow of spirit and gaiety the cider sir which i be now rescue from contemptuous comparison have often exhilarated my social hour enliven the freedom of conversation and improve the tenderness of friendship and shall not therefore now want a panegyrist it be one of those few subject on which a encomiast may expatiate without deviate from the truth would the honorable gentleman sir who have thus vilify this wonder-working nectar but honor my table with he company he would quickly be force to retract he censure and as many of he countryman have do confess that nothing equal to it be produce in any other part of the globe nor will this confession be the effect of he regard to politeness but of he adherence to truth of liquor like this sir two quart be undoubtedly sufficient for a daily allowance in the lieu of small beer nor ought even that to be determine by the choice of the soldier but of the innkeeper for whose benefit this clause be say to be insert and from whose grievance i hope we shall not suffer we attention to be divert by any incidental question or ludicrous dispute mr gore then speak to the following effect : -- sir that the allowance of two quart a-day be sufficient and that to demand more be a wanton indulgence of appetite be experimentally know and therefore no more ought to be impose upon the innkeeper nor be this sir the only part of the clause that require we consideration for some of the other particulars to be provide by the victualler may easily furnish perverse temper with a opportunity of wrangling : vinegar be not to be have in every part of the kingdom and where it can not be procure ought not to be require for neither reason nor experience will inform we that vinegar ought to be rank among the necessaries of life sir william yonge make the following reply : -- sir by the alteration now make in the clause the innkeeper be effectually relieve from a great part of the burden which in my opinion this act have hitherto lay upon they the necessity of furnish the soldier quarter upon they with provision at the state price whatever might be the scarcity of the season or of the country that this be the intention of the act be assert by those whose reputation and promotion be sufficient evidence of they ability in the interpretation of we law the innkeeper may now either accept or refuse the limited price as it shall appear to he most consistent with he interest nor will there be for the future any room for murmur at unreasonable demand since he may oblige that soldier whom he can not satisfy to please himself better at he own expense the choice of the liquor be likewise wholly refer to the innkeeper for the word in the clause require that he shall furnish three quart of small beer or cider he comply indisputably with the law by supply either and therefore the value of cider in any particular county be not of much importance in the question before we if cider be more valuable than small beer it may be withhold if it be cheaper it may be substitute in its place so that the innkeeper have nothing to consult but he own interest that this be the meaning of the clause be i suppose obvious to every man that hear it read and therefore i see no reason for any alteration because i know not any effect which they can possibly have except that of obscure the sense which be now too clear to be mistaken sir john barnard speak next to the effect follow : -- sir though it should be grant that the clause before we be intelligible to every member of this assembly it will not certainly follow that there be no necessity of farther elucidation for a law very easily understand by those who make it may be obscure to other who be less acquaint with we general intention less skilled in the nicety of language or less accustomed to the style of law it be to be consider that this law will chiefly affect a class of man very little instruct in literature and very unable to draw inference man to whom we often find it necessary in common case to use long explanation and familiar illustration and of whom it maybe not unreasonably suspect that the same want of education which make they ignorant may make they petulant and at once incline they to wrangle and deprive they of the means of decide they controversy that both innholder and soldier be for the greatest part of this rank and temper i suppose sir every gentleman know from daily observation and therefore it will i hope be think necessary to descend to they understanding and to give they law in term of which they will know the meaning we shall otherwise more consult the interest of the lawyer than the innholder and only by one alteration produce a necessity of another i be therefore desirous sir that all the difficulty which have be mention by every gentleman on this occasion should be remove by clear familiar and determinate expression for what they have find difficult may easily be to a innholder or soldier absolutely inexplicable i can not but declare while i be speak on this subject that in my opinion two quart of liquor will be a sufficient allowance if we consider the demand of nature more can not be require if we examine the expense of the innholder he ought not to supply soldier with a greater quantity for nothing it be to be remember that small beer like other liquor be charge with a excise in publick-house and that two quart will probably cost the landlord a penny and as we can not suppose that fire candle vinegar salt pepper and the use of utensil and lodging can be furnish for less than threepence a-day every soldier that be quarter upon a publick-house may be consider as a tax of six pound a-year -- a heavy burden which surely ought not to be aggravate by unnecessary imposition -lrb- the committee have go through the bill and settle the amendment the chairman be order to make he report the next day -rrb- house of common march 16 1740-1 the report be read and the amendment to the clause in debate which then run thus : -- that the officer and soldier to be quarter and billet as aforesaid shall be receive and furnish with diet and small beer by the owner of the inn livery stable alehouse victualling-house etc pay and allow for the same the several rate mention provide that in case the innholder on whom any non-commission officer or soldier shall be quarter by virtue of this act -lrb- except on a march -rrb- shall be desirous to furnish such officer or soldier with candle vinegar and salt and with either small beer or cider not ex-ceeding three quart for each man _ a-day grati _ and to allow they the use of fire and the necessary utensil for dress and eat they meat and shall give notice of such he desire to the commanding officer and shall furnish and allow they the same accordingly then and in such case the non-commission officer and soldier so quartered shall provide they own victuals and the officer to whom it belong to receive or that do actually receive the pay and subsistence of such non-commission officer and soldier shall pay the several sum payable out of the subsistence-money for diet and small beer to the non-commission officer and soldier aforesaid and not to the innholder or other person on whom such non-commission officer or soldier be quarter the question be put whether this clause should stand thus mr carew speak to this effect : -- sir though it may perhaps be allow that the circumstance of we present situation oblige we to support a more numerous army than in former year surely no argument can be draw from they that can show the necessity of a profuse allowance to we soldier or of gratify they desire by the oppression of the innholder if sir the design of we enemy be so malicious and they power so formidable as to demand augmentation of we troops and addition to we natural security they ought surely to impress upon we the necessity of frugal measure that no useless burden may be impose upon the people to furnish two quart of beer sir every day for nothing be undoubtedly a imposition sufficiently grievous and i can therefore discover no reason for which a allowance of three should be establish a proposal injurious to the victualler because it exact more than he can afford to allow and of no benefit to the soldier because it offer he more than he can want sir william yonge speak next to this purpose : -- sir if it be a instance of misconduct to spend upon any affair more time than the importance of it deserve i be afraid that the clause to which we attention be now recall may expose we to censure and that we may be charge with neglect weighty controversy and national question to debate upon trifle of waste we spirit upon subject unworthy of contention of defeat the expectation of the publick and divert we enemy rather than oppose they but sir as nothing have a more immediate tendency to the security of the nation than a proper establishment of we force and the regulation of they quarter be one of the most necessary and difficult part of the establishment it be requisite that we think no question of this kind too trivial for we consideration since very dangerous disturbance have often be produce by petty dispute the quantity sir of small beer to be allow by the victualler to those soldier who shall provide they own victuals be dispute yesterday and as i think agree upon but since this question be revive i must take the opportunity to declare that we ought not to assign less than three quart a-day to each man for it be to be remember by those who estimate the demand by they own how much they way of life be different from that of a common soldier and how little he can be charge with wantonness and superfluity for drink more small liquor than themselves there be few member of this house who do not more than once a-day drink tea coffee chocolate or some other cooling and dilute infusion delicacy which the soldier can not purchase to which he be entirely a stranger and of which the place must be supply by some other cheap and wholesome liquor if sir those gentleman whose close attention to the interest of the innholder have perhaps abstracted they in some degree from any regard to the necessity of a soldier will consent to allow he five pint a-day i shall contend no longer for though i can not agree that it be a sufficient provision yet as other gentleman equally able to judge in this subject with myself be of a different opinion i shall show my regard for they sentiment by desist from opposition lord baltimore speak in substance as follow : -- sir i be not able to discover any necessity of compromise this debate by take the mean between the two different opinion or for deny to the soldier what every labourer or serving-man would murmur to be refuse for a single day i believe sir every gentleman who examine the expense of he family will find that each of he servant consume daily at least three quart of small beer and surely it be not to be require that a soldier should live in a perpetual state of war with he constitution and a constant inability to comply with the call of nature general handasyd speak to the follow purpose : -- sir the inclination show by several gentleman for a penurious and scanty provision for the soldier must in my opinion proceed from a inattentive consideration of they pay and will therefore be remove by lay before they a account of he condition and compare he daily pay with he daily expense the whole pay of a foot soldier sir be sixpence a-day of which he be to pay fourpence to he landlord for he diet or what be very nearly the same to carry fourpence daily to the market for which how small a supply of provision he can bring to he quarter especially in time of scarcity i need not mention there remain then only twopence sir to be disburse for thing not immediately necessary for the preservation of life but which no man can want without be despicable to other and burdensome to himself twopence a-day be all that a soldier have to lay out upon cleanliness and decency and with which he be likewise to keep he arm in order and to supply himself with some part of he clothing if sir after these deduction he can from twopence a-day procure himself the means of enjoy a few happy moment in the year with he companion over a cup of ale be not he economy much more to be envy than he luxury or can it be charge upon he that he enjoy more than he share of the felicity of life be he to be burden with new expense lest he should hoard up the publick money stop the circulation of coin and turn broker or usurer with twopence a-day i have be so long acquaint sir with the soldier 's character that i will adventure to secure he from the charge of avarice and to promise that whatever he shall possess not necessary to life he will enjoy to the advantage of he landlord then the advocate campbell speak in substance as follow : -- sir i be far from intend to oppose this proposal of five pint though upon a rigorous examination it might appear more than the mere want of nature require for i can not but declare that this question have too long engage the attention of the house and that the representative of a mighty nation beset with enemy and encumber with difficulty seem to forget they importance and they dignity by wrangle from day to day upon a pint of small beer i conceive the bill which we be now consider sir not as a perpetual and standing law to be interweave with we constitution or add to the principle of we government but as a temporary establishment for the present year a expedient to be lay aside when we affair cease to require it a experimental essay of a new practice which may be change or continue accord to its success to allow sir five pint of small beer a-day to we soldier for a single year can produce no formidable inconveniency and may though it should not be entirely approve be of less disadvantage to the publick than the waste of another day -lrb- a alteration be make to five pint instead of three quart and the bill thus amend be order to be engross and a few day afterwards be read a third time be pass and order to the lord where it occasion no debate -rrb- house of common April 12 1741 -lrb- debate on address the king -rrb- a copy of he majesty 's speech be read mr clutterbuck-buck rise and speak as follow : -- sir the present confusion in europe the known design of the french the numerous claim to the austrian dominion the army which be levy to support they and the present inability of the queen of hungary to maintain those rights which descend to she from she ancestor and have be confirm by all the solemnity of treaty evidently require a uncommon degree of attention in we consultation and of vigor in we proceedings whatever may be the profession of the french they real design be easily discover design which they have carry on either openly or in private for near a century and which it can not be expect that they will lay aside when they be so near to success they view sir in all they war and treaty alliance and intrigue have be the attainment of universal dominion the destruction of the rights of nature and the subjection of all the rest of mankind nor have we any reason to imagine that they be not equally zealous for the promotion of this pernicious scheme while they pour troops into germany for the assistance of they ally as when they waste kingdom lay city in ash and plunge million into misery and want without any other motive than the glory of they king but the french be not the only nation at this time labor for the subversion of we common liberty we liberty sir be endanger by those equally interested with ourselves in they preservation for in what degree soever any of the prince who be now endeavor to divide among themselves the dominion of austrium may be please with the acquisition of new territory and a imaginary increase of influence and power it must be evident to all who be not dazzle by immediate interest that they be only fight for france and that by the destruction of the austrian family they must in a short time fall themselves it be well know sir though it be not always remember that political as well as natural greatness be merely comparative and that he only be a powerful prince who be more powerful than those with whom he can have any cause of contention that prince therefore who imagine he power enlarged by a partition of territory which give he some additional province may be at last disappointed in he expectation : for if this partition give to another prince already greater than himself a opportunity of increase he strength in a degree proportionate to he present superiority the former will soon find that he have be labor for nothing and that he danger be still the same such sir be the case of the king of prussium who when he have overrun that part of germany to which he now lay claim will only have weaken the house of austrium without strengthen himself he be at present secure in the possession of he dominion because neither the austrian would suffer the french nor the french permit the austrian to increase-their power by subdue he thus while the present equipoise of power be maintained jealousy and caution would always procure he a ally whenever he should be attack but when by he assistance the austrian family shall be ruin who shall defend he against the ambition of france while the liberty of mankind be thus equally endanger by folly and ambition attack on one side and neglect on the other it be necessary for those who foresee the calamity that threaten they to exert themselves in endeavor to avert it and to retard the fatal blow till those who be now lull by the contemplation of private advantage can be awaken into a just concern for the general happiness of europe and be convince that they themselves can only be secure by unite in the cause of liberty and justice for this reason sir we sovereign have assert the pragmatick sanction and promise to assist the queen of hungary with the force which former treaty have entitle she to demand from he for this reason he have endeavor to rouse the dutch from they supineness and excite they to arm once more for the common safety to intimidate by new augmentation those power whose ardor perhaps only subsist upon the confidence that they shall not be resist and to animate by open declaration in favor of the house of austrium those who probably be only hinder from offer they assistance by the fear of standing alone against the army of france that by this conduct he may expose he dominion on the continent to invasion ravages and the other misery of war every one who know they situation must readily allow nor can it be doubt by any man who have hear of the power of the prussian and french that they may commit great devastation with very little opposition the force of the electorate not be sufficient to give they battle for though the fortify town might hold out against they that consideration will very little alleviate the concern of those who consider the misery of a nation whose enemy be in possession of all the open country and who from they rampart see they harvest lay waste and they village in flame the fortification contain the strength but the field and the trading town comprise the riches of a people and the country may be ruin which be not subdue as therefore sir the electoral dominion of he majesty be now endanger not by any private dispute with the neighbouring prince but by he firmness in assert the general rights of europe as the consequence of he conduct on this occasion will be chiefly beneficial to britain we ought surely to support he in the prosecution of this design a design which we can not but approve since we ancestor have always carry it on without regard either to the danger or the expense in conformity to this maxim of politick so clearly found in equity and so often justified by the vote of the senate have he majesty be please to declare to we he resolution to adhere to he engagement and oppose all attempt that may be form in favor of any unjust pretension to the prejudice of the house of austrium ` tis for this end he desire the concurrence of he senate i hope every gentleman in this house will agree with I that we ought to declare we approbation of these measure in such term as may show the world that those who shall dare to obstruct they must resolve to incur the resentment of this nation and expose themselves to all the opposition which the senate of britain can send forth against they we ought to pronounce that the territory of hanover will be consider on this occasion as the dominion of britain and that any attack on one or the other will be equally resent i therefore move that a humble address be present by this house to he majesty to return we thanks for he speech to express we dutiful sense of he majesty 's just regard for the rights of the queen of hungary and for maintain the pragmatick sanction to declare we concurrence in the prudent measure which he majesty be pursue for the preservation of the liberty and balance of power in europe to acknowledge he majesty 's wisdom and resolution in not suffer himself to be divert from steadily persevere in he just purpose of fulfil he engagement with the house of austrium also further to assure he majesty that in justice to and vindication of the honor and dignity of the british crown we will effectually stand by and support he majesty against all insult and attack which any prince or power in resentment of the just measure which he have so wisely take shall make upon any of he majesty 's dominion though not belong to the crown of great britain and that in any future event which might make it necessary for he to enter into still larger expense this house will enable he to contribute in the most effectual manner to the support of the queen of hungary to the prevent by all reasonable mean the subversion of the house of austrium and to the maintain the pragmatick sanction and the liberty and balance of europe mr fox second the motion in this manner : -- sir the expediency if not the necessity of the address now move for will i believe be readily allow by those who consider the just measure which be pursue by he majesty the end which be intend by they and the power by which they be oppose how much it be we duty to support the house of austrium it be not necessary to explain to any man who have hear the debate of this assembly or read the history of the last war how much it be we duty to support it be evident as soon as it be know by whom it be attack by the ancient enemy of these nation by the general disturber of the universe by the formidable oppressor of liberty exult in new acquisition inflamed with the madness of universal monarchy and elate with a opportunity of subject germany by exalt to the supreme power a prince who shall hold he authority only by they permission the house of austrium which have so often stand forth in defense of we common rights which have pour army into the field in confederacy with britain to suppress the insolence of that family which nothing could satisfy but boundless power now demand the assistance which it have so often afford that assistance be demand from we by every claim which the law of society can enact or the dictate of nature can suggest by treaty maturely consider and solemnly confirm by the tie of ancient friendship and the obligation of common interest to violate the publick faith and to neglect the observation of treaty be to sink ourselves below barbarity to destroy that confidence which unite mankind in society to deny or evade we stipulation sir be to commit a crime which every honest mind must consider with abhorrence and to establish a precedent which may be use hereafter to we own destruction to forsake a ancient ally only because we can receive no immediate advantage from he friendship or because it may be in some degree dangerous to adhere to he to forsake he when he most want we good office when he be distressed by he enemy and desert by other from whom he have reason to hope for kinder treatment be the most despicable the most hateful degree of cowardice and treachery the obligation of interest sir it be not often needful to enforce but it may be observe on this occasion that a single year of neglect may never be retrieve we may sir now be able to support those whom when once dispossess it will not be in we power to restore and that if we suffer the house of austrium to be overborne we posterity through every generation may have reason to curse we injudicious parsimony we fatal inactivity and we perfidious cowardice with what view the king of prussium concur in the french measure or upon what principle of policy he promise to himself any security in the enjoyment of he new dominion it be not easy to conjecture but as it be easy to discover that whatever he may propose to himself he conduct evidently tend to the ruin of europe so he may in my opinion justly be oppose if he can not be divert or make easy nor can we sir if this opposition should incite he or any other power to a invasion of he majesty 's foreign dominion refuse they we protection and assistance : for as they suffer for the cause which we be engage to support and suffer only by we measure we be at least as ally oblige by the law of equity and the general compact of mankind to arm in they defense and what may be claim by the common right of ally we shall surely not deny they only because they be more closely unite to we because they own the same monarch with ourselves mr pulteney speak to the follow purpose : -- sir with what eagerness the french snatch every opportunity of increase they influence extend they dominion and oppress they neighbor the experience of many year have convince all europe and it be evident that unless some power be preserve in a degree of strength nearly equal to theirs they scheme pernicious as they be can not be defeat that the only power from which this opposition can be hope be the house of austrium a very superficial view of this part of the globe will sufficiently demonstrate of this we be long since so strongly convince that we employ all we force and all we politick to aggrandize this house we endeavor not only to support it in all its hereditary rights but to invest it with new sovereignty and extend its authority over new dominion why we afterwards vary in we council and we measure i have long inquire without any satisfaction have never sir with the utmost application be able to discover the motive to the memorable treaty of hanover by which we stipulate to destroy the fabrick that we have be so long and so laboriously endeavor to erect by which we abandon that alliance which we have so diligently cultivate which we have prefer to peace plenty and riches and for which we have cheerfully support a tedious a bloody and a expensive war this conduct sir raise a greater degree of admiration as the author of it have exhaust all they eloquence in censure the treaty of utrecht and have endeavor to expose those who transact it to the general hatred of the nation as they always express in the strongest term they dread and detestation of the french as they animated all they harangue and stun they opponent with declaration of they zeal for the liberty of europe by what impulse or what infatuation these asserter of liberty these enemy of france these guardian of the balance of power be on the sudden prevail on to declare in favor of the power whom they have so long think it they chief interest and highest honor to oppose must be discover by sagacity superior to mine but after such perplexity of council and such fluctuation of conduct it be necessary to inquire more particularly what be the present intention of the ministry what alliance have be form and what condition be require to be fulfil if we be oblige only to supply the queen of hungary with twelve thousand man we have already perform we engagement if we have promise any pecuniary assistance the sum which we have stipulate to furnish ought to be declare for i suppose at least we engagement have some limit and that we be not to exert all the force of the nation to fight as if fire and sword be at we gate or a invader be land army upon we coast i have sir from my earliest year be zealous for the defense and exaltation of the house of austrium and shall be very far from propose that any danger or distress should influence we to desert it but i do not easily discover by what mean we shall be able to afford any efficacious assistance : for the power of britain consist chiefly in naval armament which can be of very little use to the queen of hungary and i know not any state that will easily consent to unite with we on this occasion if there be sir any state remain in europe which the french can neither intimidate nor bribe we ought studiously to solicit and diligently to cultivate they friendship but whether any except the moscovite be now independent or sufficiently confident of they own strength to engage in such a hazardous alliance may be justly doubt the late grand alliance sir be support at the expense of this nation alone nor be it require from the other confederate to exhaust the treasure of they country in the common cause i hope the debt which that war have entail upon we will instruct we to be more frugal in we future engagement and to stipulate only what we may perform without involve the nation in misery which victory and triumph can not compensate the necessity sir of publick economy oblige I to insist that before any money shall be grant a account be lay before the senate in particular term of the use to which it be to be apply to ask for supplies in general term be to demand the power of squander the publick money at pleasure and to claim in softer language nothing less than despotick authority it have not be uncommon for money grant by the senate to be spend without produce any of those effect which be expect from it without assist we ally or humbling we enemy and therefore there be reason for suspect that money have sometimes be ask for one use and apply to another if we concurrence sir be necessary to increase he majesty 's influence on the continent to animate the friend of the house of austrium or to repress the disturber of the publick tranquillity i shall willingly unite with the most zealous advocate for the administration in any vote of approbation or assistance not contrary to the act of settlement that important and well-concerted act by which the present family be advance to the throne and by which it be provide that britain shall never be involve in war for the enlargement or protection of the dominion of hanover dominion from which we never expect nor receive any benefit and for which therefore nothing ought to be either suffer or hazard if it should be again necessary to form a confederacy and to unite the power of europe against the house of bourbon that ambitious that restless family by which the repose of the world be almost every day interrupted which be incessantly labor against the happiness of human nature and seek every hour a opportunity of new encroachment i declare sir that i shall not only with the greatest cheerfulness bear my share of the publick expense but endeavor to reconcile other to they part of the calamity of war this sir i have advance in confidence that sufficient care shall be take that in any new alliance we shall be party not principal that the expense of war as the advantage of victory shall be common and that those who shall unite with we will be we ally not we mercenary mr walpole then speak to the follow purpose : -- sir it be not without reason that the honorable gentleman desire to be inform of the stipulation contain in the treaty by which we have engage to support the pragmatick sanction for i find that he either never know they or have forget they and therefore those reasoning which he have form upon they fall to the ground we be oblige sir by this treaty to supply the house of austrium with twelve thousand man and the dutch who be engage in it by we example have promise a supply of five thousand this force join to those army which the large dominion of that family enable they to raise be conceive sufficient to repel any enemy by whom they rights should be invade but because in affair of such importance nothing be to be leave to hazard because the preservation of the equipoise of power on which the liberty of almost all mankind who can call themselves free must be acknowledge to depend ought to be rather certain than barely probable it be stipulate farther both by the french and ourselves that if the supplies specify in the first article shall appear insufficient we shall unite we whole force in the defense of we ally and struggle once more for independence with ardor proportion to the importance of we cause by these stipulation sir no engagement have be form that can be imagine to have be prohibit by the act of settlement by which it be provide that the house of hanover shall not plunge this nation into a war for the sake of they foreign dominion without the consent of the senate for this war be by no means enter upon for the particular security of hanover but for the general advantage of europe to repress the ambition of the french and to preserve ourselves and we posterity from the most abject dependence upon a nation exasperate against we by long opposition and hereditary hatred nor be the act of settlement only preserved unviolated by the reason of the present alliance but by the regular concurrence of the senate which he majesty have desire notwithstanding he indubitable right of make peace and war by he own authority i can not therefore imagine upon what pretence it can be urge that the law which require that no war shall be make on account of the hanoverian dominion without the consent of the senate be violate when it be evident that the war be make upon other motive and the concurrence of the senate be solemnly desire but such be the malevolence with which the conduct of the administration be examine that no degree of integrity or vigilance can secure it from censure when in the present question truth and reason be evidently on they side past transaction be recall to memory and those measure be treat with the utmost degree of contempt and ridicule of which the greatest part of the audience have probably forget the reason and of which the author of they do not always stand up in the defense because they be weary of repeat argument to those who listen with a resolution never to be convince how well sir those by whom the ministry be oppose have succeed in harden they mind against the force of reason be evident from they constant custom of appeal from the senate to the people and publishing in pamphlet those argument which they have find themselves in this assembly unable to support a practice which discover rather a obstinate resolution to obstruct the government than zeal for the prosperity of they country and which to speak of it in the softest term seem to be suggest more by the desire of popularity than the love of truth mr sandy speak to the effect follow : -- sir notwithstanding the confidence with which this motion have be offer and defend notwithstanding the specious appearance of respect to he majesty by which it be recommend i be not ashamed to declare that it appear to I inconsistent with the trust repose in we by we constituent who owe they allegiance to the king of britain and not to the elector of hanover it will be urge sir by the people whom we sit here to represent that they be already embarrass with debt contract in a late war from which after the expense of many million and the destruction of prodigious multitude they receive no advantage and that they be now load with tax for the support of another of which they perceive no prospect of a very happy or honorable conclusion of either security or profit either conquest or reprisal and that they be therefore by no means willing to see themselves involve in any new confederacy by which they may entail on they posterity the same calamity and oblige themselves to hazard they fortune and they happiness in defense of distant country of which many of they have scarcely hear and from which no return of assistance be expect mr walpole speak again to this purpose : -- sir though it be not necessary to refute every calumny that malice may invent or credulity admit or to answer those of whom it may reasonably be conceive that they do not credit they own accusation i will yet rise once more in vindication of the treaty of hanover to show with how little reason it be censure to repress the levity of insult and the pride of unreasonable triumph the treaty of hanover sir how long soever it have be ridicule and with whatever contempt those by whom it be negotiate have be treat be wise and just it be just because no injury be intend to any power no invasion be plan no partition of dominion stipulate nothing but we own security desire it be wise because it produce the end propose by it and establish that security which the austrian and spaniard be endeavor to destroy the emperor of germany sir have then enter into a secret treaty of alliance with spain by which nothing less be design than the total destruction of we liberty the diminution of we commerce the alienation of we dominion and the subversion of we constitution we be to have be expel from gibraltar and totally exclude from the mediterranean the pretender be to have be exalt to the throne and a new religion with the slavery that always accompany it to have be introduce amongst we and ostend be to have be make a port and to have share the poor remains of we commerce to foreign nation this unjust this malicious confederacy be then oppose with the utmost vehemence by the imperial general whose courage and military capacity be celebrate throughout the world and whose political ability and knowledge of the affair of europe be equal to he knowledge of war he urge with great force that such a confederacy would disunite the empire for ever from the maritime power by which it have be support and which be engage by one common interest in the promotion of its prosperity : but he remonstrance avail nothing and the alliance be conclude when we ancient ally who have be so often succoured with we treasure and defend by we arm have enter into such engagement when it be stipulate not only to impoverish but enslave we not only to weaken we abroad but to deprive we of every domestick comfort when a scheme be form that would have spread misery over the whole nation and have extend its consequence to the lowest order of the community it be surely necessary to frustrate it by some alliance and with whom could we then unite but with france this be not the only fact on which gentleman have venture to speak with great freedom without sufficient information the conduct of we ally in the late war have be no less misrepresent than that of we minister in they negotiation they have be charge with impose upon we the whole expense of the confederacy when it may be prove beyond controversy that the annual charge of the dutch be five million nor do they sir only contribute annually thus largely to the common cause but when we forsake the alliance and shamefully abandon the advantage we have gain they receive we mercenary into they own pay and expend nine million in a single year of the truth of these assertion it be easy to produce incontestable evidence which however can not be necessary to any man who reflect that from one of the most wealthy nation in the world the dutch with all they commerce and all they parsimony be reduce to penury and distress for who can tell by what means they have sink into they present low condition if they suffer nothing by the late war how this gentleman sir have be deceive and to whose insinuation he error be to be imputed i be at no loss to discover i hope he will by this confutation be warn against implicit credulity and remember with what caution that man be to be trust whose pernicious counsel have endanger he country mr vyner speak thus : -- sir it be in my opinion a incontestable maxim that no measure be eligible which be unjust and that therefore before any resolution be form we ought to examine not what motive may be suggest by expedience but what argument may be advance by equity on one part or the other if i do not mistake the true intent of the address now propose we be invite to declare that we will oppose the king of prussium in he attempt upon silesium a declaration in which i know not how any man can concur who know not the nature of he claim and the law of the empire it ought therefore sir to have be the first endeavor of those by whom this address have be so zealously promote to show that he claim so publickly explain so firmly urge and so strongly support be without foundation in justice or in reason and be only one of those imaginary title which ambition may always find to the dominion of another but no attempt have be yet make towards the discussion of this important question and therefore i know not how any man can call upon we to oppose the king of prussium when he claim may probably be just and by consequence such as if it be necessary for we to engage in the affair of those distant country we ought to join with he in assert lord gage speak next in substance as follow : -- sir as no member of this assembly can feel a greater degree of zeal for he majesty 's honor than myself none shall more readily concur in any expression of duty or adherence to he but i have be always teach that allegiance to my prince be consistent with fidelity to my country that the interest of the king and the people of great britain be the same and that he only be a true subject of the crown who be a steady promoter of the happiness of the nation : for this reason i think it necessary to declare that hanover be always to be consider as a sovereignty separate from that of britain and as a country with law and interest distinct from ours and that it be the duty of the representative of this nation to take care that interest so different may never be confound and that britain may incur no expense of which hanover alone can enjoy the advantage if the elector of hanover should be engage in war with any of the neighbouring sovereign who should be enable by a victory to enter into the country and carry the terror of war through all he territory it would by no means be necessary for this nation to interpose for the elector of hanover might lose he dominion without any disadvantage or dishonor to the king or people of britain house of common April 16 1741 debate on a motion for support the queen of hungary he majesty go this day to the house of lord and after he assent to several bill he in a speech from the throne to both house of the senate acquaint they that the war raise against the queen of hungary and the various claim on the late german emperor 's succession might expose the dominion of such prince as should incline to support the pragmatick sanction to imminent danger that the queen of hungary require the twelve thousand man stipulate by treaty and thereupon he have demand of the king of denmark and of the king of sweden as sovereign of hesse cassel they respective body of troops of six thousand man each to be in readiness to march to she assistance that he be concert such farther measure as may disappoint all dangerous design form to the prejudice of the house of austrium which might make it necessary for he to enter into still larger expense for maintain the pragmatick sanction he therefore in a conjuncture so critical desire the concurrence of he senate in enable he to contribute in the most effectual manner to the support of the queen of hungary the prevent by all reasonable mean the subversion of the house of austrium and to the maintain the liberty and balance of power in europe the house of common in they address upon this occasion express a dutiful sense of he majesty 's just regard for the rights of the queen of hungary and for the maintain the pragmatick sanction they declare they concurrence in the prudent measure which he majesty be pursue for the preservation of the liberty and balance of power in europe they assure he majesty that in justice to and vindication of the honor and dignity of the british crown they would effectually stand by and support he majesty against all insult and attack which any power in resentment of the just measure which he have so wisely take should make upon any of he majesty 's dominion though not belong to the crown of great britain they farther assure he majesty that in any future event which might make it necessary for he to enter into still larger expense they would enable he to contribute in the most effectual manner to the support of the design he propose he majesty in he answer to this address observe they readiness in enable he to make good he engagement with the queen of hungary and the assurance give he not to suffer he foreign dominion to be insult on account of the measure he be pursue for the support of the pragmatick sanction etc in consequence of this procedure the house pursuant to order resolve itself into a committee to consider of the supplies grant to he majesty upon this occasion a motion be make by sir robert walpole for a grant of three hundred thousand pound for the support of the queen of hungary on which arise the follow debate : sir robert walpole support he motion by a speech in substance as follow : -- sir the necessity of this grant appear so plainly from the bare mention of the purpose for which it be ask that i can scarcely conceive that its reasonableness will be dispute i can discover no principle upon which a objection to this motion can be found nor the least argument by which such objection can be support the indispensable obligation of publick faith the great tie by which nation be unite and confederacy form i can not suppose any man incline to invalidate a exact performance of national promise and inviolable adherence to treaty be enforce at once by policy and justice and all law both of heaven and earth publick perfidy sir like private dishonesty whatever temporary advantage it may promise or produce be always upon the whole the parent of misery every man however prosperous must sometimes wish for a friend and every nation however potent stand in need of a ally but all alliance subsist upon mutual confidence and confidence can be produce only by unlimited integrity by known firmness and approve veracity the use of alliance sir have in the last age be too much experienced to be contest it be by league well concerted and strictly observe that the weak be defend against the strong that bound be set to the turbulence of ambition that the torrent of power be restrain and empire preserve from those inundation of war that in former time lay the world in ruin by alliance sir the equipoise of power be maintain and those alarm and apprehension avoid which must arise from daily vicissitude of empire and the fluctuation of perpetual contest that it be the interest of this nation to cultivate the friendship of the house of austrium to protect its rights and secure its succession to inform it when mistaken and to assist it when attack be allow by every party every man sir know that the only power that can sensibly injure we by obstruct we commerce or invade we dominion be france against which no confederacy can be form except with the house of austrium that can afford we any efficacious support the firmest bond of alliance be mutual interest man easily unite against he whom they have all equal reason to fear and to hate by whom they have be equally injure and by whom they suspect that no opportunity will be lose of renew he encroachment such be the state of this nation and of the austrian we be equally endanger by the french greatness and equally animated against it by hereditary animosity and contest continue from one age to another we be convince that however either may be flatter or caress while the other be invade every blow be aim at both and that we be divide only that we may be more easily destroy for this reason we engage in the support of the pragmatick sanction and stipulate to secure the imperial crown to the daughter of austrium which be nothing more than to promise that we would endeavor to prevent we own destruction by oppose the exaltation of a prince who should owe he dignity to the french and in consequence of so close a alliance second all they scheme admit all they claim and sacrifice to they ambition the happiness of a great part of mankind such would probably be the consequence if the french should gain the power of confer the imperial crown they would hold the emperor in perpetual dependence would perhaps take possession of he hereditary dominion as a mortgage for they expense would awe he with the troops which they send under a pretence of assist he and leave he only the title of dominion and the shadow of empire in this state would he remain whilst he formidable ally be extend they dominion on every side he would see one power subdue after another and himself weaken by degree and only not deprive of he throne because it would be unnecessary to dethrone he or he would be oblige to solicit we assistance to break from he slavery and we should be oblige at the utmost hazard and at a expense not to be calculate to remedy what it be perhaps now in we power to prevent with very little difficulty that this danger be too near to be merely chimerical that the queen of hungary be invade and she right to the imperial dignity contest be well know it be therefore the time for fulfil we engagement engagement of the utmost importance to ourselves and we posterity and i hope the government will not be accuse of profusion if for three hundred thousand pound the liberty of europe shall be preserve we can not deny this grant without act in opposition to we late profession of support he majesty in he endeavor to maintain the pragmatick sanction and of assist he to defend he foreign dominion from any injury to which those endeavor should expose they for how can he without force defend he dominion or assist he ally or how can he maintain force without supplies mr shippen next rose and speak thus : -- sir as i have always endeavor to act upon conviction of my duty to examine opinion before i admit they and to speak what i have think the truth i do not easily change my conduct or retract my assertion nor be i deter from repeat my argument when i have a right to speak by the remembrance that they have formerly be unsuccessful every man when he be confident himself conceive himself able to persuade other and imagine that they obstinacy proceed from other motive than reason and that if he fail at one time to gain over he audience he may yet succeed in some happier moment when they prejudice shall be dissipate or they interest vary for this reason though it can not be suspect that i have forget the resentment which i have formerly draw upon myself by a open declaration of my sentiment with regard to hanover i stand up again with equal confidence to make my protestation against any interposition in the affair of that country and to avow my dislike of the promise lately make to defend it : a promise inconsistent in my opinion with that important and inviolable law the _ act of settlement _ -- a promise which if it could have be foreknow would perhaps have for ever preclude from the succession that illustrious family to which we owe such numberless blessing such continue felicity far be it from I to insinuate that we can be too grateful to he majesty or too zealous in we adherence to he only let we remember that true gratitude consist in real benefit in promote the true interest of he to whom we be indebted and surely by hazard the welfare of britain in defense of hanover we shall very little consult the advantage or promote the greatness of we sovereign it be well know how inconsiderable in the sight of those by whom the succession be establish hanover appear in comparison with britain those man to whom even they enemy have seldom deny praise for knowledge and capacity and who have be so loudly celebrate by many who have join in the last address for they honest zeal and the love of they country enact that the king of britain should never visit those important territory which we have so solemnly promise to defend at the hazard of we happiness it be evidently they design that we sovereign engross by the care of he new subject a care which as they reasonably imagine would arise from gratitude for dignity and power so liberally confer should in time forget that corner of the earth on which he ancestor have reside and act not as elector of hanover but as king of britain as the governor of a mighty nation and the lord of large dominion it be expressly determine that this nation should never be involve in war for the defense of the dominion on the continent and doubtless the same policy that have restrain we from extend we conquest in country from which some advantage might be receive ought to forbid all expensive and hazardous measure for the sake of territory from whence no benefit can be reap nor be the purpose sir for which this supply be demand the only objection that may be urge against it for the manner in which it be ask make it necessary at least to delay it the minister have be so little accustomed to refusal that they have forget when to ask with decency and expect the treasure of the nation to be pour upon they whenever they shall think it proper to hint that they have discover some new opportunity of expense it be necessary that when a supply be desire the house should be inform some time before of the sum that be require and of the end to which it be to be apply that every member may consider at leisure the expediency of the measure propose and the proportion of the sum to the occasion on which it be demand that he may examine what be the most proper method of raise it and perhaps inquire with what willingness he constituent will advance it whether any man be enable by he acuteness and experience to determine all these question upon momentaneous reflection i can not decide for my part i confess myself one of those on whom nature have bestow no such faculty and therefore move that the consideration of this supply may be defer for a few day for if it be now press upon we i shall vote against it because i do not yet fully discover all the reason for it nor all the consequence which it may produce and i think myself oblige to know for what purpose i give away the money which be not my own mr vyner speak as follow : -- sir whatever may be the necessity of maintain the pragmatick sanction or whatever the obligation of national pact of which i hope no man be desirous of countenance the neglect yet they can not oblige we to arm without a enemy to embarrass ourselves with watch every possibility of danger to garrison dominion which be not threaten or assert rights which be not invade the expediency of maintain the house of austrium on the imperial throne it be not at present necessary to assert because it do not appear that any other family be aspire to it there may indeed be whisper of secret design and artful machination whisper perhaps spread only to affright the court into treaty or the senate into grant or design which like a thousand other that every day produce innumerable accident may defeat which may be discover not only before they be execute but before they be fully form and which therefore be not worthy to engross much of we attention or to exhaust the wealth of the people the pragmatick sanction be nothing more than a settlement of the imperial dignity upon the eldest daughter of the late german emperor and she son and if she have no son upon the son of the second daughter nor have the crown of britain by engage to support that sanction promise any thing more than to preserve this order of succession which no power at present be endeavor to interrupt and which therefore at present require no defense the dispute sir between the king of prussium and the queen of hungary be of a different kind nor be it we duty to engage in it either as party or judge he lay claim to certain territory usurp as he allege from he ancestor by the austrian family and assert by force this claim which be equally valid whether the queen be emperess or not we have no right to limit he dominion or obligation to examine the justice of he demand if he be only endeavor to gain what have be forcibly withhold from he what right have we to obstruct he undertaking and if the queen can show a better title she be like all other sovereign at liberty to maintain it nor be we necessarily to erect ourselves into judge between sovereign or distributor of dominion the contest seem to have very little relation to the pragmatick sanction : if the king of prussium succeed he will contribute to support it and if the queen be able to frustrate he design she will be too powerful to need we assistance but though sir the pragmatick sanction be in danger of violation be we to stand up alone in defense of it while other nation equally engage with ourselves by interest and by treaty sit still to look upon the contest and gather those advantage of peace which we indiscreetly throw away be we able to maintain it without assistance or be we to exhaust we country and ruin we posterity in prosecution of a hopeless project to spend what can never be repay and to fight with certainty of a defeat the dutch whose engagement and whose interest be the same as we own have not yet make any addition to they expense nor augmentation of they troops nor do a single potentate of europe however unite by long alliance to the house of austrium or however endanger by revolution in the empire appear to rouse at the approach of alarm or think himself oblige to provoke enemy by whom he be not yet injure i can not therefore persuade myself that we be to stand up single in the defense of the pragmatick sanction to fight the quarrel of other or live in perpetual war that we neighbor may be at peace i shall always think it my duty to disburse the publick money with the utmost parsimony nor ever intend but on the most pressing necessity to load with new exaction a nation already overwhelm with debt harass with tax and plunder by a standing army for what purpose these numerous force be maintain who be now prey on the publick why we increase we army by land when we only fight by sea why we aggravate the burden of the war and add domestick oppression to foreign injury i be at a loss to determine surely some regard should be have to the satisfaction of the people who ought not during the present scarcity of provision to be starve by the increase of a army which seem support only to consume they as therefore part of we present expense be in my opinion unnecessary i shall not contribute to aggravate it by a new grant for purpose of which i can not discover that they will promote the advantage of the publick sir robert walpole reply to the following effect : -- sir the pragmatick sanction which we be engage to support be not confine to the preservation of the order of succession but extend to all the rights of the house of austrium which be now attack and by a very formidable enemy at a time of weakness and distraction and therefore require we assistance that other equally oblige by treaty and by interest to lend they help on this occasion sit reluctive either through cowardice or negligence or some prospect of temporary advantage may perhaps be true but be it any excuse of a crime that he who commit it be not the only criminal will the breach of faith in other excuse it in we ought we not rather to animate they by we activity instruct they by we example and awaken they by we representation perhaps the other power say to themselves and to one another why should we keep that treaty which britain be violate why should we expose ourselves to danger of which that mighty nation so celebrated for courage be afraid why should we rush into war in which we most powerful ally seem unwilling to support we thus the same argument a argument evidently false and make specious only by interest may be use by all till some one more bold and honest than the rest shall dare to rise in vindication of those rights which all have promise to maintain and why should not the greatest nation be the first that shall avow she solemn engagement why should not they be most diligent in the prosecution of a affair who have most to lose by its miscarriage i be always willing to believe that no member of this assembly make use in any solemn debate of argument which do not appear rational to himself and yet it be difficult to conceive that any man can imagine himself release from a promise because the same promise be break by another or that he be at liberty to desert he friend in distress because other desert he whose good office he have equal reason to expect and that the more he assistance be need the more right he have to deny it surely such argument as these deserve not need not a confutation before we regulate we conduct by that of other we must either prove that they have do right which proof will be a sufficient defense without the precedent or own that they be more capable of judge than we and that therefore we pay a implicit submission to they dictate and example a sacrifice which we shall not willingly make to the vanity of we neighbor in the present case it be evident that if other nation neglect the performance of they contract they be guilty of the breach of publick faith of a crime that if it should generally be imitate would dissolve society and throw human nature into confusion that would change the most happy region into desert in which one savage would be prey on another nor be they only propagate a example which in some distant time may be plead against themselves but they be expose themselves to more immediate danger they be forwarding design that have no tendency but to they ruin they be add strength to they inveterate enemy and beckon invasion to they own frontier let we therefore instead of harden ourselves in perfidy or lull ourselves in security by they example exert all we influence to unite they and all we power to assist they let we show they what they ought to determine by we resolution and teach they to act by we vigor that if the house of austrium be preserve we alliance may be strengthen by new motive of gratitude and that if it must be that the liberty of this part of the world be lose we may not reproach ourselves with have neglect to defend they mr pelham speak next to this purpose : -- sir it be not to be suppose that such member of this assembly as be not engage in publick affair should receive very exact intelligence of the disposition of foreign power and therefore i do not wonder that the conduct of the dutch have be misrepresent and that they be suspect of neglect they engagement at a time when they be endeavor to perform they the dutch have now under consideration the most proper method of assist the queen of hungary and maintain the pragmatick sanction it may be indeed justly suspect from the nature of they constitution that they motion will be slow but it can not be assert that they break they engagement or desert they confederate nor be there any reason for imagine that the other prince who have incur the same obligation will not endeavor to perform they promise it may be easily conceive that some of they be not able at a sudden summons to afford great assistance and that other may wait the result of we deliberation and regulate they conduct by we example not that we ought to neglect we engagement or endanger we country because other power be either perfidious or insensible for i be not afraid to declare that if that should happen which there be no reason to suspect if all the other power should desert the defense of the austrian line should consent to annul the pragmatick sanction and leave the queen of hungary to the mercy of she enemy i would advise that britain alone should pour she army into the continent that she should defend she ally against the most formidable confederacy and show mankind a example of constancy not to be shake and of faith not to be violate if it be therefore we duty to support the pragmatick sanction it be now the time for declare we resolution when the imperial crown be claim by a multitude of competitor among whom the elector of bavarium a very powerful prince have by he minister notify he pretension to the court of britain the ancient alliance between this prince and the french be well know nor can we doubt that he will now implore they assistance for the attainment of the throne to which he aspire and i need not say what may be expect from a emperor whose elevation be procure by the force of france nor be this the only prince that claim the imperial crown upon plausible pretence or whose claim other power may combine to support it be well know that even the spanish monarch believe himself entitle to it nor can we who have no communication with he know whether he have not declare to all the other prince of europe he resolution to assert he claim it be far from be impossible that the pretension of the house of bourbon may be revive and that though no single prince of that family should attempt to mount the imperial throne they may all conspire to dismember the empire into petty kingdom and free themselves from the dread of a formidable neighbor by erect a number of diminutive sovereign who may be always court the assistance of they protector for the sake of harass each other thus will the house by which europe have be hitherto protect sink into a empty name and we shall be leave to stand alone against all the power that profess a different religion and whose interest be opposite to that of britain we ought indeed to act with the utmost vigor when we see one of the most powerful of the reform prince so far forgetful of the interest of we religion as to cooperate with the design of france and so intent upon improve the opportunity of distressing the house of austrium as to neglect the common cause and expose himself or he posterity to the danger of become a dependant on the house of bourbon for this reason i can not agree that we army though numerous and burdensome be greater than the necessity of affair require : if we cast we eye on the continent nothing be to be see but general confusion powerful army in motion the dominion of one prince invade of another threaten the tumult of ambition in one place and a panick stillness in another what will be the event of these commotion who can discover and how can we know what may determine the course of that flood of power which be now in a state of uncertain fluctuation or seem drive to different point by different impulse how soon may the dutch see they barrier attack and call upon we for the ten thousand man which we be oblige to send they how soon may the house of austrium be so distressed as to require all we power for its preservation that we be to leave nothing unattempted for the security of we own religion and liberty will easily be grant and therefore unless it can be prove that we may be equally secure though the house of austrium be ruin it will necessarily follow that we be with all we power to enforce the observation of the pragmatick sanction this be not a act of romantick generosity but such as the closest attention to we own interest show to be necessary in defend the queen of hungary we defend ourselves and only extinguish that flame by which if it be suffer to spread we shall ourselves be consume the empire may be consider as the bulwark of britain which if it be throw down leave we naked and defenceless let we therefore consider we own danger and remember that while we be consider this supply we be deliberate upon nothing less than the fate of we country mr pulteney speak next to the effect follow : -- sir i be on this occasion of a opinion different from that of the honorable member who speak the second in this debate though on most question we judgment have be the same i be so far from second he proposal for delay the consideration of this supply that i think it may justly be inquire why it be not sooner propose for the support of the house of austrium and the assertion of the pragmatick sanction no man can be more zealous than myself i be convinced how closely the interest of this nation and that of the austrian family be unite and how much either must be endanger by the ruin of the other and therefore i shall not delay for a single moment my consent to any measure that may reestablish we interest on the continent and rescue germany once more from the jaw of france i be afraid that we have lose part of we influence in the neighbouring country and that the name of britain be less formidable than heretofore but if reputation be lose it be time to recover it and i doubt not but it may be recover by the same means that it be at first obtain we army may be yet equally destructive and we money equally persuasive we have not yet suffer amidst all we misconduct we naval force to be diminish we sailor yet retain they ancient courage and we fleet be sufficient to keep the dominion of the ocean and prescribe limit to the commerce of every nation while this power remain unimpaired while britain retain she natural superiority and assert the honor of she flag in every climate we can not become despicable nor can any nation ridicule we menace or scorn we alliance we may still extend we influence to the inland country and awe those nation which we can not invade to preserve this power let we watch over the disposal of we money money be the source of dominion those nation may be formidable for they affluence which be not considerable for they number and by a negligent profusion of they wealth the most powerful people may languish into imbecility and sink into contempt if the grant which be now demand will be sufficient to produce the end to which it be propose to be apply if we be assure of the proper application of it i shall agree to it without hesitation but though it can not be affirm that the sum now demand be too high a price for the liberty of europe it be at least more than ought to be squander without effect and we ought at least to know before we grant it what advantage may be expect from it may not the sum demand for the support of the queen of hungary be employ to promote very different interest may it not be lavish to support that power to which we grant have too long contribute that power by which ourselves have be awed and the administration have tyrannise without control if this sum be really intend to support the queen of hungary may we not inquire how it be to be employ for she service be it to be send she for the payment of she army and the support of she court should we not more effectually secure she dominion by purchase with it the friendship and assistance of the king of prussium a prince whose extent of dominion and numerous force make he not more formidable than he personal quality what may be hope sir from a prince of wisdom and courage at the head of a hundred and ten thousand regular troops with eight million in he treasury how much he must necessarily add to the strength of any party in which he shall engage be unnecessary to mention it be evident without proof that nothing could so much contribute to the reestablishment of the house of austrium as a reconciliation with this mighty prince and that to bring it to pass would be the most effectual method of serve the unfortunate queen that require we assistance why we should despair sir of such a reconciliation i can not perceive a reconciliation equally conducive to the real interest of both party it may be prove with very little difficulty to the king of prussium that he be now assist those with whom interest incompatible and religion irreconcilable have set he at variance whom he can never see prosperous but by the diminution of he own greatness and who will always project he ruin while they be enjoy the advantage of he victory we may easily convince he that they power will soon become by he assistance such as he can not hope to withstand and show from the example of other prince how dangerous it be to add to the strength of a ambitious neighbor we may show he how much the fate of the empire be now in he hand and how much more glorious and more advantageous it will be to preserve it from ruin than to contribute to its destruction if by such argument sir this potent monarch can be induce to act steadily in defense of the common cause we may once more stand at the head of a protestant confederacy of a confederacy that may contract the view and repress the ambition of the house of bourbon and alter they scheme of universal monarchy into expedient for the defense of they dominion but in transact these affair let we not engage in any intricate treaty nor amuse ourselves with display we ability for negotiation negotiation that fatal art which we have learn as yet very imperfectly and which we have never attempt to practice but to we own loss while we have be entangled in tedious disquisition and retard by artful delay while we commissary have be debate about what be only deny to produce controversy and inquire after that which have be hide from they only to divert they attention from other question how many opportunity have be lose and how often might we have secure by war what be at a much greater expense lose by treaty treaty sir be the artillery of we enemy to which we have nothing to oppose they be weapon of which we know not the use and which we can only escape by not come within they reach i know not by what fatality it be that to treat and to be cheat be with regard to briton word of the same signification nor do i intend by this observation to asperse the character of particular person for treaty by whomsoever carry on have end always with the same success it be time therefore to know at length we weakness and we strength and to resolve no longer to put ourselves voluntarily into the power of we enemy : we troops have be always we ablest negotiator and to they it have be for the most part necessary at last to refer we cause let we then always preserve we martial character and neglect the praise of political cunning a quality which i believe we shall never attain and which if we could obtain would add nothing to we honor let it be the practice of the briton to declare they resolution without reserve and adhere to they in opposition to danger let they be ambitious of no other elogy than those which may be gain by honesty and courage nor will they then ever find they ally diffident or they enemy contemptuous by recover and assert this character we may become once more the arbiter of europe and be court by all the protestant power as they protector : we may once more subdue the ambition of the aspiring french and once more deliver the house of austrium from the incessant pursuit of those restless enemy the defense of that illustrious family sir have always appear to I since i study the state of europe the unvariable interest of the british nation and we obligation to support it on this particular occasion have already be sufficiently explain whence it proceed sir that those who now so zealously espouse the austrian interest have be so plainly forgetful of it on other occasion i can not determine that treaty have be make very little to the advantage of that family and that its enemy have be suffer to insult it without opposition be well know nor be it long ago that it be debate in this house whether any money should be lend to the late emperor no publick or private character can be support no enemy sir can be intimidate nor any friend confirm in he adherence but by a steady and consistent conduct by propose in all we action such end as may be openly avowed and by pursue they without regard to temporary inconveniency or petty obstacle such conduct sir i would gladly recommend on the present occasion on which i should be far from advise a faint a irresolute or momentary assistance such supplies as declare diffidence in we own strength or a mean inclination to please contrary party at the same time to perform we engagement with the queen and continue we friendship with france it be in my opinion proper to espouse we ally with the spirit of a nation that expect she decision to be ratify that hold the balance of the world in she hand and can bestow conquest and empire at she pleasure yet sir it can not be deny that many powerful reason may be bring against any new occasion of expense nor be it without horror and astonishment that any man conversant in political calculation can consider the enormous profusion of the national treasure in the late dreadful confusion of the world when the ambition of france have set half the nation of the earth on flame when we send we army to the continent and fight the general quarrel of mankind we pay during the reign of king william and he great successor reign of which every summer be distinguish by some important action but four million yearly but we preparation for the present war in which scarcely a single ship of war have be take or a single fortress lay in ruin have bring upon the nation a expense of five million so much more be we now oblige to pay to amuse the weakest than formerly to subdue the most powerful of we enemy frugality which be always prudent be at this time sir indispensable when war dreadful as it be may be term the lightest of we calamity when the season have disappoint we of bread and a universal scarcity afflict the nation every day bring we account from different part of the country and every account be a new evidence of the general calamity of the want of employment for the poor and its necessary consequence the want of food he that be scarce able to preserve himself can not be expect to assist other nor be that money to be grant to foreign power which be want for the support of we fellow-subject who be now languish with disease which unaccustomed hardship and unwholesome provision have bring upon they while we be provide against distant danger and bewail the distress of the house of austrium let we not add to the misery of famine the mortification of insult and neglect let we countryman at least divide we care with we ally and while we form scheme for succour the queen of hungary let we endeavor to alleviate nearer distress and prevent or pacify domestick discontent if there be any man whom the sight of misery can not move to compassion who can hear the complaint of want without sympathy and see the general calamity of he country without employ one hour on scheme for its relief let not that man dare to boast of integrity fidelity or honor let he not presume to recommend the preservation of we faith or adherence to we confederate : that wretch can have no real regard to any moral obligation who have forget those first duty which nature impress nor can he that neglect the happiness of he country recommend any good action for a good reason it should be consider sir that we can only be useful to we ally and formidable to we enemy by be unanimous and mutually confident of the good intention of each other and that nothing but a steady attention to the publick welfare a constant readiness to remove grievance and a apparent unwillingness to impose new burden can produce that unanimity as the cause be therefore necessarily to precede the effect as foreign influence be the consequence of happiness at home let we first endeavor to establish that alacrity and security that may animate the people to assert they ancient superiority to other nation and restore that plenty which may raise they above any temptation to repine at assistance give to we ally no man sir can very solicitously watch over the welfare of he neighbor whose mind be depress by poverty or distract by terror and when the nation shall see we anxious for the preservation of the queen of hungary and unconcerned about the want of we fellow-subject what can be imagine but that we have some method of exempt ourselves from the common distress and that we regard not the publick misery when we do not feel it sir robert walpole reply to the following effect : -- sir it be always proper for every man to lay down some principle upon which he propose to act whether in publick or private that he may not be always waver uncertain and irresolute that he adherent may know what they be to expect and he adversary be able to tell why they be oppose it be necessary sir even for he own sake that he may not be always struggle with himself that he may know he own determination and enforce they by the reason which have prevail upon he to form they that he may not argue in the same speech to contrary purpose and weary the attention of he hearer with contrast and antithese when a man admit the necessity of grant a supply expatiate upon the danger that may be produce by retard it declare against the least delay however speciously propose and enforce the argument which have be already offer to show how much it be we duty and interest to allow it may it not reasonably be imagine that he intend to promote it and be endeavor to convince they of that necessity of which he seem himself convinced but when the same man proceed to display with equal eloquence the present calamity of the nation and tell to how much better purpose the sum thus demand may be apply when he dwell upon the possibility that a impolitick use may be make of the national treasure and hint that it may be ask for one purpose and employ to another what can be collect from he harangue however elegant entertaining and pathetick how can he true opinion be discover or how shall we fix such fugitive reasoning such variable rhetorick i be not able sir to discern why truth should be obscure or why any man should take pleasure in heap together all the argument that he knowledge may supply or he imagination suggest against a proposition which he can not deny nor can i assign any good purpose that can be promote by perpetual renewal of debate and by a repetition of objection which have in former conference on the same occasion be find of little force when the system of affair be not fully lay open and the scheme of the administration be in part unknown it be easy to raise objection formidable in appearance which perhaps can not be answer till the necessity of secrecy be take away when any general calamity have fall upon a nation it be a very fruitful topick of rhetorick and may be very pathetically exaggerated upon a thousand occasion to which it have no necessary relation such in my opinion sir be the use now make of the present scarcity a misfortune inflict upon we by the hand of providence alone not upon we only but upon all the nation on this side of the globe many of which suffer more but none less than ourselves if at such a time it be more burdensome to the nation to raise supplies it must be remember that it be in proportion difficult to other nation to oppose those measure for which the supplies be grant and that the same sum be of greater efficacy in time of scarcity than of plenty we present distress will i hope soon be at a end and perhaps a few day may produce at least some alteration it be not without reason that i expect the news of some successful attempt in america which will convince the nation that the preparation for war have not be idle show contrived to produce unnecessary expense in the mean time it be necessary that we support that power which may be able to assist we against france the only nation from which any danger can threaten we even though we fleet in america should be unsuccessful if we defeat the spaniard we may assist the house of austrium without difficulty and if we fail in we attempt they alliance will be more necessary the sum demand for this important purpose can not be censure as exorbitant yet will i hope be sufficient : if more should hereafter appear necessary i doubt not but it will be grant the question pass without opposition house of common December 1 1741 -lrb- debate on choose a speaker -rrb- the new house of common be meet the usher come from the house of lord with he majesty 's command for they immediate attendance when they be order to choose a speaker and be return mr pelham address himself in the follow manner to the clerk of the house : mr hardinge as we be here assemble in pursuance of the imperial summons it be necessary in obedience to he majesty 's command and the established custom of this house that we proceed immediately to the choice of a person qualify for the chair -- gentleman it be with no common degree of satisfaction that i observe this assembly so numerous on the first day because whatever be transact by we must necessarily be consider by the nation with more regard as it be approve by a greater number of they representative and because the present affair which relate particularly to this house must be more satisfactorily conduct as we number be greater since every man must willingly abide by he own choice and cheerfully submit to that authority of which he have himself concur to the establishment the qualification require in the person who shall fill the chair to he own reputation and the advantage of the house it be not necessary minutely to recount it be obvious to every gentleman who hear I that he must possess such a equality of temper as may enable he always to preserve a steady and impartial attention neither discompose by the irregularity into which some gentleman unacquainted with the form of this assembly may easily fall nor disconcerted by the heat and turbulence to which in former parliament some of those whose experience might have teach they the necessity of decency have be too often hurry by the eagerness of controversy that he must add to he perpetual serenity such a firmness of mind as may enable he to repress petulance and subdue contumacy and support the order of the house in whatever contrariety of counsel or commotion of debate against all attempt of infraction or deviation that to give efficacy to he interposition and procure veneration to he decision he must from he general character and personal quality derive such dignity and authority as may naturally dispose the mind of other to obedience as may suppress the murmur of envy and prevent the struggle of competition these qualification be eminently conspicuous in the gentleman who fill the chair in the earlier part of my life and who be now one of the ornament of the other house such be he ability and such he conduct that it would be presumptuous in any man however endowed by nature or accomplish by study to aspire to surpass he nor can a higher encomium be easily conceive than this house bestow upon that person who be think worthy to succeed he the office which we have now to confer be not only arduous with regard to the ability necessary to the execution of it but extremely burdensome and laborious such as require continual attendance and incessant application nor can it be expect that any man would engage in it who be not ready to devote he time and he health to the service of the publick and to struggle with fatigue and restraint for the advantage of he country such be the gentleman whom i shall propose to you choice one whose zeal for the present imperial house and the prosperity of the nation have be always acknowledge and of whom it can not be suspect that he will be deter by any difficulty from a province which will afford he so frequent opportunity of promote the common interest of the emperor and the people what success may be expect from he endeavor we can only judge from he present influence influence produce only by he private virtue but so extensive in that part of the nation which lie within the reach of he beneficence and the observation of he merit that it set he not only above the danger but above the fear of opposition and secure he a seat in this assembly without contest thus depute by he country to many successive senate he have acquire a unrivalled degree of knowledge in the method of we proceedings and a eminent dexterity in digest they with that order and perspicuity by which only the transaction of great affair can be make expeditious and the discussion of difficult question be disentangle from perplexity quality which be now make particularly necessary by the importance of the subject to be consider in this senate : so that i doubt not but you will unanimously concur with I in desire that the chair may be fill by a person eminently distinguish by he knowledge he integrity he diligence and he reputation and therefore i move without scruple that the right honorable arthur onslow esquire be call to the chair then mr clutterbuck second the motion in this manner : -- that i be not able to add any thing to the encomium of the right honorable gentleman nominate to the president 's chair give I no concern because i be confident that in the opinion of this assembly he name alone include all panegyrick and that he who recommend arthur onslow esquire will never be require to give the reason of he choice i therefore rise now only to continue the common method of the house and to second a motion which i do not expect that any will oppose -lrb- here the whole assembly cry out with a general acclamation onslow onslow -rrb- mr onslow then rise up and say : -- though i might allege many reason against this choice of which the strongest be my inability to discharge the trust confer upon I in a manner suitable to its importance yet i have too high a idea of the wisdom of this assembly to imagine that they form any resolution without just motive and therefore shall think it my duty to comply with they determination however opposite to my own opinion mr pelham and mr clutterbuck then lead he to the chair where before he go up to it he desire that the house would consider how little he be qualify for the office which they be about to confer upon he and fix they choice upon some other person who might be capable of discharge so important a trust the member call out the chair chair chair he ascend the step and then address himself thus to the house : -- gentleman since it be you resolution that i should once more receive the honor of be exalt to this important office for which it be not necessary to mention how little i be qualify since i may hope that those defect which have hitherto be excuse will still find the same indulgence my gratitude for a distinction so little deserve will always incite I to consult the honor of the house and enable I to supply by duty and diligence what be want in my knowledge and capacity December 4 1741 -lrb- debate on the address -rrb- the king come again to the house of lord and the common be send for he majesty approve they choice of a president and make a speech to both house in which he represent to they that they counsel be in a particular manner necessary as they be engage in a war with spain as the affair of all europe be in confusion by the confederacy of many formidable power for the destruction of the house of austrium that both house of the precede session have come to the strongest resolution in favor of the queen of hungary but that the other power who be equally engage to support she have not yet act accord to they stipulation that he have endeavor to assist she ever since the death of the emperor charle and hope that a just sense of common danger would induce other nation to unite with he but that in this uncertain situation it be necessary that britain should be in a condition of support itself and its ally as any exigency might require he therefore order the estimate for the ensue year to be lay before the common -- this speech be under the consideration of the house of lord lord milton speak in the follow manner : my lord though the present perplexity of we affair the contrariety of opinion produce by it and the warmth with which each opinion will probably be support might justly discourage I from propose any of my sentiment to this great assembly yet i can not repress my inclination to offer a motion in my opinion regular and seasonable and which if it should appear otherwise to you lordship will i hope though it should not be receive at least be forgive because i have never before wearied you patience or interrupted or retarded you consultation but i be very far from imagine that by this motion i can give any occasion to debate or opposition because i shall propose no innovation in the principle or alteration of the practice of this assembly nor intend any thing more than to lay before you lordship my opinion of the manner in which it may be proper to address he majesty to return he we humble thanks for he most gracious speech from the throne and at the same time to present unto he majesty we sincere and joyful congratulation on he safe and happy return into this empire to observe with the utmost thankfulness the great concern which he majesty have be please to express for carry on the just and necessary war against spain which we hope by the divine blessing upon he majesty 's arm will be attend with success equal to the justice of he cause and the ardent wish of he people that he majesty have so truly represent the impending danger to which europe be expose in the present critical conjuncture as must awaken in every one a attention suitable to the occasion : and we can not but be fully sensible of the evil consequence arise from the design and enterprise form and carry on for the subversion or reduction of the house of austrium which threaten such apparent mischief to the common cause to acknowledge he imperial goodness in express so earnest a desire to receive and so high a regard for the advice of he parliament : he majesty secure of the loyalty and affection of he people may rely upon that with the best-grounded confidence and to assure he majesty that we will not fail to take the important point which he have be please to mention to we into we most serious consideration and in the most dutiful manner to offer to he majesty such advice as shall appear to we to be most conducive to the honor and true interest of he crown and kingdom to assure he majesty that we have a due sense how much the present posture of affair call upon we for that unanimity vigor and despatch which he majesty have so wisely recommend to we and to give he majesty the strongest assurance that we will vigorously and heartily concur in all just and necessary measure for the defense and support of he majesty the maintenance of the balance and liberty of europe and the assistance of we ally that as duty and affection to he majesty be in we fix and unalterable principle so we feel the impression of they at this time so strong and lively in we breast that we can not omit to lay hold on this opportunity of approach he imperial presence to renew the most sincere profession of we constant and inviolable fidelity : and to promise he majesty that we will at the hazard of all that be dear to we exert ourselves for the defense and preservation of he sacred person and government and the maintenance of the protestant succession in he imperial house on which the continuance of the protestant religion and the liberty of britain do under god depend my lord as this address will not obstruct any future inquiry by any approbation of past measure either positive or implied i doubt not but you lordship will readily concur in it and be persuade that it will confirm he majesty 's regard for we council and confidence in we loyalty lord lovel speak next to this effect : -- my lord the danger which have be justly represent by he majesty ought to remind we of the importance of unusual circumspection in we conduct and deter we from any innovation of which we may not foresee the consequence at a time when there may be no opportunity of repair any miscarriage or correct any mistake there appear my lord not to be at this time any particular reason for change the form of we address no privilege of we house have be invade nor any design form against the publick he majesty have evidently not deviate from the practice of the wisest and most beloved of we british monarch he have upon this emergence of unexpected difficulty summon the senate to counsel and assist he and surely it will not be consistent with the wisdom of this house to increase the present perplexity of we affair by new embarrassment which may be easily imagine likely to arise from a address different from those which custom have establish the prospect which now lie before we a prospect which present we only with danger distraction invasion and revolution ought to engage we attention without leave we at leisure for disputation upon ceremony or form it ought to be the care of every lord in this house not how to address but how to advise he majesty how to assist the council of the publick and contribute to such determination as may avert the calamity that impend over mankind and stop the wild excursion of power and ambition we ought to reflect my lord that the expectation of all europe be raise by the convocation of this assembly and that from we resolution whole nation be wait for they sentence and how will mankind be disappoint when they shall hear that instead of declare war upon usurper or impose peace on the disturber of mankind instead of equip navy to direct the course of commerce or raise army to regulate the state of the continent we meet here in a full assembly and disagree upon the form of a address let we therefore my lord lay aside at least for this time all petty debate and minute inquiry and engage all in the great attempt of reestablish quiet in the world and settle the limit of the kingdom of europe then lord carteret speak in substance as follow : -- my lord there be i find at least one point upon which it be probable that those will now agree whose sentiment have hitherto be on almost every occasion widely different the danger of we present situation be generally allow but the consequence deduce from it be so contrary to each other as give little hope of that unanimity which time of danger particularly require it be allege by the noble lord who speak last that since we be now involve in difficulty we ought only to inquire how to extricate ourselves and therefore ought not to leave ourselves the right of inquire how we be entangled in they lest the perplexity of different consideration should dissipate we attention and disable we from form any useful determination or exert any vigorous effort for we deliverance but in my opinion my lord the most probable way of remove difficulty be to examine how they be produce and by consequence to whom they be to be imputed for certainly my lord it be not to be hope that we shall regain what we have lose but by measure different from those which have reduce we to we present state and by the assistance of other counsellor than those who have sink we into the contempt and expose we to the ravages of every nation throughout the world that this inquiry my lord may be free and unobstructed it be necessary to address the throne after the manner of we ancestor in general term without descend to particular fact which as we have not yet examine they we can neither censure nor approve it have be object by the noble lord that foreign nation will be disappoint by hear that instead of menace of vengeance and declaration of unalterable adherence to the liberty of europe we have waste we time at this important juncture in settle the form of a address that little time may be waste on this occasion i hope you lordship will very speedily agree to a address suitable to the dignity of those who make it and to the occasion upon which it be make for i can not but allow that the present state of affair call upon we for despatch : but though business ought at this time undoubtedly to be expedite i hope it will not be precipitated and if it be demand that the most important question be first determine i know not any thing of greater moment than that before we how we shall gratify the expectation of foreign power ought not my lord to be we first or chief consideration we ought certainly first to inquire how the people may be set free from those suspicion which a long train of measure evidently tend to impair they privilege have raise and how they may be confirm in they fidelity to the government of which they have for many year find no other effect than tax and exaction for which they have receive neither protection abroad nor encouragement at home but my lord if it be necessary to consult the inclination and cultivate the esteem of foreign power i believe nothing will raise more confidence in we ally if there be any who be not now ashamed of that name or more intimidate those whose design it be we interest to defeat than a open testimony of we resolution no longer to approve that conduct by which the liberty of half europe have be endanger and not to lavish praise on those man who have in twenty year never transact any thing to the real benefit of they country and of whom it be highly probable that they have in the present war stipulate for the defeat of all we attempt and agree by some execrable compact to facilitate the exaltation of the house of bourbon upon what fact i ground accusation so atrocious may justly be inquire by you lordship nor shall i find any difficulty in answer you demand for if we extend we view over the whole world and inquire into the state of all we affair we shall find nothing but defeat miscarriage and impotence with they usual consequence contempt and distrust we shall discover neither any token of that fear among we enemy which the power of the nation and the reputation of we former victory might naturally produce nor any proof of that confidence among those whom we still continue to term we ally which the vigor with which we have formerly support we confederacy give we a right to expect those whom we once trample insult we and those whom we once protect give we no credit how reasonably my lord all nation have withdraw from we they reverence and esteem will appear by a transient examination of we late conduct whether it regard europe in general or influence only the particular affair of the british nation for it will appear beyond possibility of doubt that whoever have trust the administration whether they own country or any foreign power have trust only to be betray there be among we ally none whom we be more oblige to support than the queen of hungary whose rights we be engage by all the solemnity of treaty to defend and in whose cause every motive operate that can warm the bosom of a man of virtue justice and compassion plead equally on she side and we be call upon to assist she by we own interest as well as the general duty of society by which every man be require to prevent oppression what have be the effect of all these consideration may easily be discover from the present state of the continent which be ravage without mercy by the army of spain and france why all succor have be deny the queen of hungary and why the inveterate and hereditary enemy of we nation be suffer to enlarge they dominion without resistance why the rival of we trade be leave at full liberty to equip they squadron and the persecutor of we religion suffer to overrun those country from whence only we can hope for assistance when the hatred which the difference of opinion produce shall threaten we with invasion and slavery the whole world have long ask to no purpose and therefore it be without prospect of receive satisfaction that i engage in the same inquiry yet since it be we duty to judge of the state of the publick and a true judgment can be the result only of accurate examination i shall proceed without be discourage by the ill success of former attempt to discover the motive of we late measure and the end intend to be produce by they why the queen of hungary be not assist with land-force i shall at present forbear to ask that she expect they be indeed evident from she solicitation and i suppose it be no less apparent from treaty that she have a right to expect they nor be i able to conceive why subsidy have be pay for troops which be never to be employ or why foreign prince should be enrich with the plunder of a nation which they can not injure and do not defend but i know my lord how easily it may be reply that the expense of a land war be certain and the event hazardous and that it be always prudent to act with evident advantage on we side and that the superiority of britain consist wholly in naval armament that the fleet of britain be equal in force and number of ship to the unite navy of the greatest part of the world that we admiral be man of known bravery and long experience and therefore formidable not only for they real ability and natural courage but for the confidence which they presence necessarily excite in they follower and the terror which must always accompany success and enervate those who be accustom to defeat that we sailor be a race of man distinguish by they ardor for war and they intrepidity in danger from the rest of the human species that they seem being superior to fear and delighted with those object which can not be name without fill every other breast with horror that they be capable of rush upon apparent destruction without reluctance and of standing without concern amidst the complicated terror of a naval war be universally know and confess my lord even by those whose interest it be to doubt or deny it upon the ocean therefore we be allow to be irresistible to be able to shut up the port of the continent imprison the nation of europe within the limit of they own territory deprive they of all foreign assistance and put a stop to the commerce of the world it be allow that we be place the sentinel at the barrier of nature and the arbiter of the intercourse of mankind these be appellation my lord which however splendid and ostentatious we ancestor obtain and preserve with less advantage than we possess by whom i be afraid they be about to be forfeit the dominion of the ocean be assert in former time in opposition to power far more able to contest it than those which we have so long submissively court and of which we be now evidently afraid for that we fear they my lord they be sufficiently convinced and it must be confess with whatsoever shame that they opinion be well found for to what motive but fear can it be imputed that we have so long support they insolence without resentment and they ravages without reprisal that we have fit out fleet without any design of dismiss they from we harbor or send they to the sea only to be gaze at from the shore by those whose menace or artifice have give occasion to they equipment and in whom they raise no other emotion than contempt of we cowardice or pity of we folly to what my lord can it be attribute that the queen of hungary have yet receive no assistance from ally thus powerful from ally whose fleet cover the sea whose commerce extend to the remotest part of the world and whose wealth may be justly expect to be proportionate to they commerce to what can we ascribe the confidence with which the house of bourbon threaten the ruin of a princess who number among she ally the emperor of britain nothing be more evident my lord than that the queen of hungary have be disappoint of the advantage which she expect from she friendship with this nation only by a degree of cowardice too despicable to be mention without such term as the importance of this debate and the dignity of this assembly do not admit nor be it less certain from the conduct of she enemy that they know what would be we measure and confide for security in that cowardice which have never yet deceive they it can not my lord be assert that we ally however distressed have yet receive the least assistance from we arm neither the justice of we cause have yet be able to awaken we virtue nor the inseparable union of she interest with we own to excite we vigilance but perhaps my lord we have have no opportunity of exert we force perhaps the situation both of we enemy and ally be such that neither the one could be protect nor the other oppose by a naval power and therefore we inactivity be the effect not of want of courage but want of opportunity though we minister my lord have hitherto give no eminent proof of geographical knowledge or of very accurate acquaintance with the state of foreign country yet there be reason to believe that they must at some time have hear or read that the house of austrium have territory in italy they must have be inform unless they disbursement for secret service be bestow with very little judgment that against these dominion a army have be raise by the spaniard and they must have discover partly by the information of they correspondent partly by the inspection of a map and partly by the sagacity which distinguish they from all past and present minister that this army be to be transport by sea from the coast of spain to that of italy this knowledge my lord however attain might have furnished mind which have always be find so fruitful of expedient with a method of hinder the descent of the spanish troops for which nothing more be necessary than that they should have order admiral haddock instead of retire before the spanish fleet of war and watch they only that they might escape to lie still before barcelona where the transport be station with a convoy of only three man of war and hinder they departure i hope it will be observe by you lordship that though the road of barcelona be open and indefensible though the fleet be unprotected by ship of force and though they lay as i be inform beyond the reach of the gun on the fortification upon the shore i do not require that haddock should have destroy the army and the ship i be too well acquaint my lord with the lenity of we minister to the enemy of they country and be too well convinced of the prudence and tenderness of the restriction by which the power of we admiral be limit to expect that we gun should be ever use but in salutation of respect or exultation on the conclusion of a peace i be convince that we minister would shudder at the name of bloodshed and destruction and that they have rather hear that a thousand merchant be make bankrupt by privateer or all we ally deprive of they dominion than that one spanish ship be sink or burn by the navy of britain but my lord though they be willing to spare the blood of they enemy yet surely they might have obstruct they enterprise they might have withhold those whom they be unwilling to strike and have endeavor to fright those whom they determine never to hurt to speak in term more adapt to the subject before we : that the fleet of spain a fleet of transport with such a convoy should lie three week in a open road professedly fit out against a ally unite to we by every tie of nature and of policy by the solemnity of treaty and conformity of interest that it should lie undisturbed almost within sight of a british navy that it should lie there not only without danger but without apprehension of danger have raise the astonishment of every nation in europe have blast the reputation of we arm impair the influence of we counsel and weaken the credit of we publick faith there may be some my lord that will impute this absurdity of we conduct this disregard of we interest this desertion of we alliance and this neglect of the most apparent opportunity of success not to cowardice but treachery a cause more detestable as more atrociously criminal this opinion my lord i think it not necessary to oppose both because it can not be charge with improbability and because i think it may be easily reconcile with my own assertion for cowardice abroad produce treachery at home and they become traitor to they country who be hinder by cowardice from the prosecution of she interest and the opposition of she enemy it may however be proper to declare my lord that i do not impute this fatal cowardice to those who be intrust with the command of we navy but to those from whom they be oblige to receive they instruction and upon whom they unhappily depend for the advancement of they fortune it be at least reasonable to impute miscarriage rather to those who be know to have give formerly such order as a brave admiral perish under the ignominious necessity of observe than to those of whom it can not be say that any former part of they life have be stain with the reproach of cowardice at least it be necessary to suspend we judgment till the truth shall be make apparent by a rigid inquiry and it be therefore proper to offer a address in general term by which neither the action or counsel of any man shall be condemn nor approve it would be more unreasonable to charge we soldier or we sailor with cowardice because they have show even in those action which have fail of success that they miscarry rather through temerity than fear and that whenever they be suffer to attack they enemy they be ready to march forward even where there be no possibility of return and that they be only to be withhold from conquest by obstacle which human prowess can not surmount such my lord be the state of those hero who die under the wall of carthagena that die in a enterprise so ill concerted that i venture with no great skill in war and without the least pretence to prescience to foretell in this house that it would miscarry that it would that it must miscarry that it be even intend only to amuse the nation with the appearance of a expedition without any design of weaken we enemy be easily discover for why else my lord be the army compose of man newly draw from the shop and from the plough unacquainted with the use of arm and ignorant of the very term of military discipline when we have among we large body of troops long keep up under the appearance of a regular establishment troops of whom we have long feel the expense but of which the time be not it seem yet come that we be to know the use these man my lord who have so long practice the motion of battle and who have give in the park so many proof of they dexterity and activity who have at least learn to distinguish the different sound of the drum and know the face and voice of the subaltern officer at least might have be imagine better qualify for a attempt upon a foreign kingdom than those who be necessarily stranger to every part of the military operation and might have be send upon we first declaration of war while the new-raised force acquire at home the same art under the same inspection but my lord whether it be imagine that new force would be long before they learn the implicit obedience necessary to a soldier whether it be imagine that it would not be easy on a sudden to collect troops of man so tall and well proportion or so well skilled in the martial art of curl and powder they hair or whether it would have be dangerous to have deprive the other house of the counsel and vote of many worthy member who have at the same time a seat in the senate and a commission in the army it be think necessary to send out raw force to attack we enemy and to keep we disciplined troops at home to awe the nation nor do the minister my lord think it sufficient to obstruct the expedition to america by employ new-raised troops unless they be likewise place under the command of a man who though of undoubted courage be with respect to the conduct of a army as ignorant as themselves it be therefore determine my lord that all those officer who have gain experience in former war and purchase military knowledge by personal danger should be disappointed and reject for the sake of advance a man who as he have less skill be less likely to be successful and be therefore more proper to direct a expedition propose only to intimidate the british nation that the event be such as might be expect from the means you lordship need not to be inform nor can it be question with what intention these means be contrived i be very far my lord from charge we minister with ignorance or upbraid they with mistake on this occasion for they whole conduct have be uniform and all they scheme consistent with each other : nor do i doubt they knowledge of the consequence of they measure so far as it be to be foresee by human prudence whether they have carry on negotiation or make war whether they have conduct we own affair or those of we ally the queen of hungary they have still discover the same intention and promote it by the same means they have suffer the spanish fleet to sail first for supplies from one port to another and then from the coast of spain to those of america they have permit the spaniard without opposition to land in italy when it be not necessary even to withhold they from it by any actual violence for have the fleet my lord be under my command i would have only send the spanish admiral a prohibition to sail and be sure it would have be observe they have neglect to purchase the friendship of the king of prussium which might perhaps have be obtain upon easy term but which they ought to have gain at whatever rate and to conclude we have be lately inform that the neutrality be sign such my lord be the conduct of the ministry by which it can not be deny that we be involve in many difficulty and expose to great contempt but from this contempt we may recover and disentangle ourselves from these difficulty by a vigorous prosecution of measure opposite to those by which we have be reduce to we present state if we consider without that confusion which fear naturally produce the circumstance of we affair it will appear that we have opportunity in we hand of recover we loss and reestablish we reputation those loss which have be suffer while we have two hundred ship of war at sea which have permit three hundred merchant-ship to be take and that reputation which have be destroy when there be no temptation either to a compliance with we enemy or to a desertion of we friend it be well know my lord that we make war at present rather with the queen than the people of spain and it be reasonable to conclude that a war carry on contrary to the general good and against the general opinion can not be last it be certain that the spaniard whenever they have be attack by man acquaint with the science of war and furnish with necessary store for hostile attempt have discover either ignorance or cowardice and have either flee meanly or resist unskilfully it be therefore probable my lord that either we enemy will desist from the prosecution of a war which few of they approve or that we shall by vigorous descent upon they coast and they colony the interruption of they trade and the diminution of they force soon compel they to receive peace upon we own term but these advantage my lord be only to be expect from a change of conduct which change can never be produce by a seeming approbation of the past measure i be therefore of opinion that we ought to address the throne in general term accord to the ancient practice of this house in consider the address propose i can not but conclude that it be too much diffused and that it would be more forcible if it be more concise : to shorten it will be no difficult task by the omission of all the clause that correspond with particular part of he majesty 's speech which i can not discover the necessity of repeat in the congratulation to he majesty upon he return to he once glorious dominion no lord shall concur more readily or more zealously than myself nor shall i even deny to extend my compliment to the ministry when it shall appear that they deserve they but i be never willing to be lavish of praise because it become less valuable by be prodigally bestow and on occasion so important as this i can never consent to praise before i have examine because inquiry come too late after approbation lord cholmondeley rise next and speak to this effect : -- my lord if the danger that threaten we happiness and we safety be such as they have be represent if ambition have extend she power almost beyond a possibility of resistance and oppression elate with success begin to design no less than the universal slavery of mankind if the power of europe stand aghast at the calamity which hang over they and listen with helpless confusion to that storm which they can neither avoid nor resist how ought we conduct to be influence by this uncommon state of affair ought we not to catch the alarm while it be possible to make preparation against the danger ought we not to improve with the utmost diligence the important interval to unite we counsel for the protection of liberty and exert all we influence against the common enemy of society the unwearied disturber of the tranquillity of mankind to what purpose my lord be the misery that the present distraction of europe may bring upon we so pathetically describe and so accurately enumerate if they be to produce no effect upon we counsel and what effect can be wish from they but unanimity with that vigor and despatch which be its natural consequence and that success with which steadiness and expedition be generally reward it might be hope my lord that those who have so clear a view of we present embarrassment and whose sagacity and acuteness expose they to a sensibility of future misery perhaps more painful than would be excite by any present and real calamity should not be thus tortured to no purpose every passion my lord have its proper object by which it may be laudably gratified and every disposition of mind may be direct to useful end the true use of that foresight of future event with which some great capacity be so eminently endowed be that of produce caution and suggest expedient what advantage my lord would it be to navigator that they pilot could by any preternatural power discover sand or rock if he be too negligent or too stubborn to turn the vessel out of the danger or how my lord to pursue the comparison would that pilot be treat by the crew who after have inform they of they approach to a shoal or whirlpool and set before they with all he rhetorick the horror of a shipwreck should instead of direct they to avoid destruction and assist they endeavor for they common safety amuse they with the miscarriage of past voyage and the blunder and stupidity of they former pilot whether any parallel can be form between such ill-timed satire and wild misconduct and the manner in which you lordship have be treat on this occasion it be not my province to determine nor have i any other design than to show that the only proper conduct in time of real danger be preparation against it and that wit and eloquence themselves if employ to any other purpose lose they excellence because they lose they propriety it do not appear my lord that the address now propose include any approbation of past measure and therefore it be needless to inquire on this occasion whether the conduct of we minister or admiral deserve praise or censure it do not appear my lord that by censure any part of we late conduct however detrimental to the publick it may at present be imagine any of we loss will be repair or any part of we reputation retrieve and therefore such proceedings would only retard we counsel and divert we thought from more important consideration consideration which he majesty have recommend to we and which can not be more strongly press upon we than by the noble lord who oppose the motion for he most powerfully incite to unanimity and attention who most strongly represent the danger of we situation of the good effect of publick consultation i need not observe my lord that they arise from the joint endeavor of many understanding cooperate to the same end from the reasoning and observation of many individual of different study inclination and experience all direct to the illustration of the same question which be therefore so accurately discuss so variously illustrated and so amply display that a more comprehensive view be obtain of its relation and consequence than can be hope from the wisdom or knowledge of any single man but this advantage my lord can only be expect from union and concurrence for when the different member of a national council enter with different design and exert they ability not so much to promote any general purpose as to obviate the measure and confute the argument of each other the publick be deprive of all the benefit that might be expect from the collective wisdom of assembly whatever may be the capacity of those who compose they the senate thus divide and disturb will perhaps conclude with less prudence than any single member as any man may more easily discover truth without assistance than when other of equal ability be employ in perplexing he inquiry and interrupt the operation of he mind thus my lord it might be safer for a nation even in time of terror and disorder to be deprive of the counsel of this house than to confide in the determination of a assembly not uniform in its view nor connect in its interest a assembly from which little can be hope by those who observe that it can not without a tedious debate prolong with all the heat of opposition despatch the first and most cursory part of publick business -- a address to he majesty it have be for a long time a practice too frequent to confound past with present question to perplex every debate by a endless multiplication of object and to obstruct we determination by substitute one inquiry in the place of another the only question my lord now before we be whether the address which the noble lord propose imply any commendation of past measure not whether those measure deserve to be commend which be a inquiry not at present to be pursue because we have not now before we the means of attain satisfaction in it and which ought therefore to be delay till it shall be you lordship ' pleasure to appoint a day for examine the state of the nation and to demand those letter instruction and memorial which be necessary to a accurate and senatorial disquisition in the mean time since it be at least as expedient for I to vindicate as for other to accuse those of whose conduct neither they nor i have yet any regular cognizance and i may justly expect from the candor of you lordship that you will be no less willing to hear a apologist than a censurer i will venture to suspend the true question a few moment to justify that conduct which have be so wantonly and so contemptuously deride that the preservation of the house of austrium my lord ought to engage the closest attention of the british nation be freely confess it be evident that by no other mean we commerce we liberty or we religion can be secure or the house of bourbon restrain from overwhelming the universe it be allow that the queen of hungary have a claim to we assistance by other tie than those of interest that it be promise upon the faith of treaty and it be demand by the loudest call of honor justice and compassion and do it not appear too juvenile and romantick i might add that she personal excellency be such as might call army to she assistance from the remotest corner of the earth that she constancy in the assertion of she rights might animate every generous mind with equal firmness and she intrepidity in the midst of danger and distress when every day bring account of new encroachment and every new encroachment discourage those from whom she may claim assistance from declare in she favor might inspire with ardor for she preservation all those in whom virtue can excite reverence or whom calamity unjustly inflict can touch with indignation nor be i afraid to affirm my lord that the condition of this illustrious princess raise all these emotion in the court of britain and that the vigor of we proceedings will appear proportion to we ardor for she success no sooner be the true state of affair incontestably know than twelve thousand auxiliary troops be hire and command to march to she assistance but she affair make it more eligible for she to employ she own subject in she defense and the want of money be the only obstacle that hinder she from raise army proportion to those of she enemy she require that instead of troops a supply of money might be send she with which he majesty willingly comply the british minister in the mean time endeavor by the strongest argument and most importunate solicitation to animate she ally to equal vigor or to procure she assistance from other power whose interest be more remotely affect by she distress : if the effect of they endeavor be not yet manifest it can not be imputed to the want either of sincerity or diligence and if any other power should be persuade to arm in the common cause it ought to be ascribe to the influence of the british counsel in the prosecution of the war with spain it do not appear my lord that any measure have be neglect which prudence or bravery or experience could be expect to dictate if we have suffer greater loss than we expect if we enemy have be sometimes favor by the wind or sometimes have be so happy as to conceal they design and elude the diligence of we commander who be to be censure or what be to be conclude but that which never be deny that the chance of war be uncertain that man be incline to make fallacious calculation of the probability of future event and that we enemy may sometimes be as artful as diligent and as sagacious as ourselves it be the general opinion of the british people my lord if the general opinion may be collect from the clamor and expectation which every man have have opportunity of observe that in declare war upon spain we only engage to chastise the insolence of a nation of helpless savage who might indeed rob and murder a defenceless trader but who could only hold up they hand and cry out for mercy or sculk in secret creek and unfrequented coast when ship of war should be fit out against they they imagine that the fortification of the spanish citadel would be abandon at the first sound of cannon and that they army would turn they back at the sight of the standard of britain it be not remembered my lord that the greatest part of we trade be carry on in sight of the spanish coast and that we merchant must be consequently expose to incessant molestation from light vessel which we ship of war could not pursue over rock and shallows it be not sufficiently consider that a trading nation must always make war with a nation that have fewer merchant under the disadvantage of be more expose to the rapacity of private adventurer how much we have to fear on this account be show we by the late war with france in which the privateer of a few petty port injure the commerce of this nation more than they mighty navy and celebrated admiral my lord it would very little become this August assembly this assembly so renowned for wisdom and for justice to confound want of prudence with want of success since on many occasion the wisest measure may be defeat by accident which could not be foresee since they may sometimes be discover by deserter or spy and sometimes elude by a enemy equally skilful with ourselves in the science of war that any of these apology be necessary to the administration i be far from intend to insinuate for i know not that we have fail of success in any of we design except the attack of carthagena of which the miscarriage can not at least be imputed to the ministry nor be it evident that any other cause of it be to be assign than the difficulty of the enterprise and when my lord do any nation make war without experience some disappointment these consideration my lord i have think myself oblige by my regard to truth and justice to lay before you to dissipate those suspicion and that anxiety which might have arise from a different representation of we late measure for i can not but once more observe that a vindication of the conduct of the ministry be by no mean a necessary preparative to the address propose the address which be so modestly offer to you lordship can not be say to contain any more than a general answer to he majesty 's speech and such declaration of we duty and affection as be always due to we sovereign and always expect by he on such occasion if we ally have be neglect or betray my lord we shall be still at liberty to discover and to punish negligence so detrimental and treachery so reproachful to the british nation if in the war against spain we have fail of success we shall still reserve in we own hand the right of inquire whether we be unsuccessful by the superiority of we enemy or by we own fault whether we commander want order or neglect to obey they for what clause can be produce in the address by which any of these inquiry can be suppose to be predetermine let we therefore remember my lord the danger of we present state and the necessity of steadiness vigor and wisdom for we own preservation and that of europe let we consider that publick wisdom be the result of unite counsel and steadiness and vigor of united influence let we remember that we example may be of equal use with we assistance and that both the ally and the subject of great britain will be conjoin by we union and distract by we division and let we therefore endeavor to promote the general interest of the world by a unanimous address to he majesty in the term propose by the noble lord lord talbot speak in the follow manner : -- my lord after the display of the present state of europe and the account of the measure of the british minister which the noble lord who speak against the motion have lay before you there be little necessity for another attempt to convince you that we liberty and the liberty of europe be in danger or of disturbing you reflection by another enumeration of folly and misfortune to mention the folly of we measure be superfluous likewise for another reason they who do not already acknowledge it may be justly suspect of suppress they conviction for how can it be possible that they who can not produce a single instance of wisdom or fortitude who can not point out one enterprise wisely concerted and successfully execute can yet sincerely declare that nothing have be omit which we interest require the measure my lord which be now pursue be the same which for twenty month have keep the whole nation in continual disturbance and have raise the indignation of every man whose private interest be not promote by they these measure can not be say to be rashly censure or condemn before they be see in they full extent or expand into all they consequence for they have be prosecute my lord with all the confidence of authority and all the perseverance of obstinacy without any other opposition than fruitless clamor or petition unregarded and what consequence have they produce what but poverty and distraction at home and the contempt and insult of foreign power what but the necessity of retrieve by war the loss sustain by timorous and dilatory negotiation and the miscarriage of a war in which only folly and cowardice have involve we nothing my lord be more astonishing than that it should be assert in this assembly that we have no ill success to complain of might we not hope for success if we have calculate the event of war and make a suitable preparation and how be this to be do but by compare we force with that of we enemy who must undoubtedly be more or less formidable accord to the proportion which he treasure and he troops bear to we own upon the assurance of the certainty of this practice upon the evidence my lord of arithmetical demonstration we be incline to believe that the power of britain be not to be resist by spain and therefore demand that we merchant should be no longer plunder insult imprison and tortured by so despicable a enemy that we do not foresee all the consequence of this demand we be now ready to confess we do not conjecture that new troops would be raise for the invasion of the spanish dominion only that we might be reduce to the level with we enemy we do not imagine that the superiority of we naval force would produce no other consequence than a inequality of expense and that the royal navy of britain would be equip only for show only to harass the sailor with the hateful molestation of a impress and to weaken the crew of we mercantile vessel that they might be more easily take by the privateer of spain we do not expect my lord that we navy would sail out under the command of admiral renown for bravery knowledge and vigilance and float upon the ocean without design or enter port and leave they equally inoffensive as a packet-boat or petty trader but not to speak any longer my lord in term so little suit to the importance of the question which i be endeavor to clear or to the enormity of the conduct which i attempt to expose the success of war be only to be estimate by the advantage which be gain in proportion to the loss which be suffer of which loss the expense occasion by the war be always the chief part and of which it be therefore usual at the conclusion of a peace for the conquer power to promise the payment let we examine my lord in consequence of this position the success of we present war against spain let we consider what each nation have suffer and it will easily appear how justly we boast of we wisdom and vigor it be not on this occasion necessary to form minute calculation or to compute the expense of every company of soldier and squadron of ship it be only necessary to assert what will i hope not be very readily deny even by those whom daily practice of absurd apology have render impregnable by the force of truth that such expense as have neither contribute to we own defense nor to the disadvantage of the spaniard have be throw away if this be grant my lord it will appear that no nation ever behold its treasure so profusely squander ever pay tax so willingly and so patiently see they pervert for it can not my lord be prove that any part of we preparation have produce a proportionate effect but it may be readily show how many fleet have be equip only that the merchant might want sailor and that the public store might be consume as to we ill success in america which have be imputed only to the chance of war it will be reasonable my lord to ascribe to other cause so much of it as might have be prevent by a more speedy reinforcement of vernon or may be suppose to have arise from the inexperience of we troops and the escape of the spaniard from ferrol if we fleet have be send more early into that part of the world the spaniard would have have no time to strengthen they garrison have we troops be acquaint with discipline the attack would have be make with greater judgment and have not the spaniard escape from ferrol we should have have no enemy in america to encounter have all we minister and all we admiral do they duty it be evident that not only carthagena have be take but that half the dominion of spain might now have own the sovereignty of the crown of britain this my lord may be observe of the only enterprise which it be reasonable to believe be in reality intend against the spaniard if even of this we minister have not before contrived the defeat but of all the rest of we armament it do not appear that any effect have be feel but by ourselves it can not be discover that they even raise any alarm or anxiety either in we enemy or they ally by whom perhaps it be know that they be only design as punishment for the merchant of britain that we merchant have already be severely chastise for they insolence in complain of they loss and they temerity in raise in the nation a regard for its commerce its honor and its rights be evident from a dreadful list of three hundred ship take by the spaniard some of which be abandon by they convoy and other seize within sight of the coast of britain it may be urge my lord that the spaniard have likewise lose a great number of vessel but what else could they expect when they engage in a war against the greatest naval power of the universe and it be to be remember that the spaniard have this consolation in they misfortune that of they ship none have be desert by they convoy or wilfully expose to capture by be rob of they crew to supply ship of war with idle hand the spaniard will likewise consider that they have not harass they subject for the protection of they trade that they have not fit out fleet only to amuse the populace they comfort themselves with the hope that the briton will soon be reduce to a state of weakness below themselves and wait patiently for the time in which the master of the sea shall receive from they the regulation of they commerce and the limit of they navigation nor can it be doubt my lord but that by adhering to these measure we minister will in a short time gratify they hope for whatsoever be the difference between the power of two contend nation if the richer spend its treasure without effect and expose its troops to unhealthy climate and impracticable expedition while the weaker be parsimonious and prudent they must soon be bring to a equality and by continue the same conduct the weaker power must at length prevail that this have be hitherto the state of the war between britain and spain it be not necessary to prove to you lordship it be apparent that the expense of the spaniard have be far less than those of britain and therefore if we should suppose the actual loss of war equal we be only wear out we force in useless effort and we enemy grow every day comparatively stronger but my lord let we not flatter ourselves that we actual loss have be equal let we before we determine this question accurately compare the number and the value of we ship and cargo with those of the spaniard and see on which side the loss will fall and let we not forget what in all the calculation which i have yet see on either part have be totally overlook the number of man kill or captive in the british and spanish dominion man my lord be at once strength and riches and therefore it be to be consider that the most irreparable loss which any nation can sustain be the diminution of its people : money may be repay and commerce may be recover even liberty may be regain but the loss of people can never be retrieve even the twentieth generation may have reason to exclaim how much more numerous and more powerful would this nation have be have we ancestor not be betray in the expedition to carthagena what loss my lord have the spaniard sustain which can be put in balance with that of we army in america a army give up to the vulture of a unhealthy climate and of which those who perish by the sword be in reality rescue from more linger torment what equivalent can be mention for the liberty of multitude of briton now languish in the prison of spain or oblige by hardship and desperation to assist the enemy of they country what have the spaniard suffer that can be oppose to the detriment which the commerce of this nation feel from the detention of we sailor these my lord be loss not to be parallel by the destruction of porto bello even though that expedition should be ascribe to the ministry these be loss which may extend they consequence to many age which may long impede we commerce and diminish we shipping it be not to be imagine my lord that in this time of peculiar danger parent will destine they child to maritime employment or that any man will engage in naval business who can exercise any other profession and therefore the death or captivity of a sailor leave a vacuity in we commerce since no other will be ready to supply he place thus by degree the continuance of the war will contract we trade and those part of it which we can not occupy will be snatch by the french or dutch from whom it be not probable that they will ever be recover this my lord be another circumstance of disadvantage to which the spaniard be not expose for they traffick be only from one part of they dominion to another can not be destroy but will after the short interruption of a war be again equally certain and equally profitable it appear therefore my lord that we have hitherto suffer more than the spaniard more than the nation which we have so much reason to despise it appear that we fleet have be useless and that we troops have be only send out to be destroy and it will therefore surely be allow I to assert that the war have not be hitherto successful i be therefore of opinion my lord that as the address now propose can not but be understand both by he majesty and the nation to imply in some degree a commendation of that conduct which can not be commend which ought never to be mention but with detestation and contempt it will be unworthy of this house offensive to the whole nation and unjust to he majesty he majesty my lord have summon we to advise he in this important juncture and the nation expect from we determination its relief or its destruction : nor will either have much to hope from we counsel if in we first publick act we endeavor to deceive they it seem therefore proper to change the common form of we address to the throne to do once at least what he majesty demand and the people expect and to remember that no character be more inconsistent than those of a counsellor of the king and a flatterer of the ministry then lord abingdon speak to this effect : -- my lord i have always observe that debate be prolonged and inquiry perplex by the neglect of method and therefore think it necessary to move that the question may be read that the noble lord who shall be incline to explain they sentiment upon it may have always the chief point in view and not deviate into foreign consideration -lrb- it be read accordingly -rrb- lord carteret speak next to the purpose following : -- my lord i be convince of the propriety of the last motion by the advantage which it have afford I of view more deliberately and distinctly the question before we the consideration of which have confirm I in my own opinion that the address now propose be only a flattering repetition of the speech and that the speech be draw up only to betray we into a encomium on the ministry who as they certainly have not deserve any commendation will i hope not receive they from you lordship for what have be the result of all they measure but a general confusion the depression of we own nation and we ally and the exaltation of the house of bourbon it be universally allow my lord and therefore it would be superfluous to prove that the liberty of europe be now in the utmost danger that the house of bourbon have arrive almost at that exalted pinnacle of authority from whence it will look down with contempt upon all other power to which it will henceforward prescribe law at pleasure whose dominion will be limit by its direction and whose army will march at its command that britain will be long exempt from the general servitude that we shall be able to stand alone against the whole power of europe which the french may then bring down upon we and preserve ourselves independent while every other nation acknowledge the authority of a arbitrary conqueror be by no means likely and might be perhaps demonstrate to be not possible how long we might be able to retain we liberty it be beyond the reach of policy to determine but as it be evident that when the empire be subdue the dutch will quickly fall under the same dominion and that all they port and all they commerce will then be in the hand of the french it can not be deny that we commerce will quickly be at a end we shall then lose the dominion of the sea and all we distant colony and settlement and be shut up in we own island where the continuance of we liberty can be determine only by the resolution with which we shall defend they that this my lord must probably in a few year be we state if the scheme of the house of bourbon should succeed be certain beyond all controversy and therefore it be evident that no man to whom such a condition do not appear eligible can look unconcerned at the confusion of the continent or consider the destruction of the house of austrium without endeavor to prevent it but my lord though such endeavor be the duty of all who be engage in the transaction of publick affair though the importance of the cause of the queen of hungary be acknowledge in the speech to which we be to return a address it do not appear that the minister of britain have once attempt to assist she or have even forborne any thing which might aggravate she distress the only effectual method by which any efficacious relief could have be procure be that of reconcile she with the king of prussium or that of prevail upon the muscovite to succor she a reconciliation with the king of prussium would have be my first care if the honor of advise on this occasion have fall to my lot to have mediate successfully between they could surely have be no difficult task because each party could not but know how much it be they common interest to exclude the french from the empire and how certainly this untimely discord must expose they both to they ancient enemy as in private life my lord when two friend carry any dispute between they to improper degree of anger or resentment it be the province of a third to moderate the passion of each and to restore that benevolence which a difference of interest or opinion have impair so in alliance or the friendship of nation whenever it unhappily fall out that two of they forget the general good and lay themselves open to those evil from which a strict union only can preserve they it be necessary that some other power should interpose and prevent the danger of a perpetual discord whether this be attempt my lord i know not but if any such design be in appearance prosecute it may be reasonably imagine from the event that the negotiator be defective either in skill or in diligence for how can it be conceive that any man should act contrary to he own interest to whom the state of he affair be truly represent but not to suppress what i can not doubt i be convinced my lord that there be in reality no design of assist the queen of hungary either we minister have not yet recover from they apprehension of the exorbitant power of the house of austrium by which they be fright some year ago into the bosom of france for shelter and which leave they no expedient but the treaty of hanover or they be now equally afraid of france and expect the _ pretender _ to be force upon they by the power whom they so lately solicit to secure they from he whatever be the motive of they conduct it be evident my lord that they be at present to the unfortunate queen of hungary either profess enemy or treacherous ally for they have permit the invasion of she italian dominion when they might have prevent it without a blow only by command the spaniard not to transport they troops to argue that we fleet in the mediterranean be not of strength sufficient to oppose they passage be a subterfuge to which they can only be drive by the necessity of make some apology and a absolute inability to produce any which will not immediately be discover to be groundless it be know my lord to all europe that haddock have then under he command thirteen ship of the line and nine frigate and that the spanish convoy consist only of three ship and yet they sail before he eye with a degree of security which nothing could have produce but a passport from the court of britain and a assure exemption from the danger of a attack it may be urge that they be protect by the french squadron and that haddock durst not attack they because he be unable to contend with the unite fleet but my lord even this be know to be false : it be know that they bear no proportion to the strength of the british squadron that they could not have make even the appearance of a battle and that we commander could have be only employ in pursuit and capture this my lord be well know to we minister who be afraid only of destroy the french squadron and be very far from apprehend any danger from it but be determine to purchase on any term the continuance of the friendship of they old protector consent to the invasion of italy and procure a squadron to sail out under pretence of defend the spanish transport that they compliance might not be discover all this my lord may reasonably be suspect at the first view of they proceedings for how could a inferior force venture into the way of a enemy unless upon security that they should not be attack but the late treaty of neutrality have change suspicion into certainty have discover the source of all they measure and show that the invasion of italy be permit to preserve hanover from the like calamity there be great danger my lord lest this last treaty of hanover should give the decisive blow to the liberty of europe how much it embarrass the queen of hungary by make it necessary for she to divide she force be obvious at the first view but this be not in my opinion its most fatal consequence the other power will be incite by the example of we ministry to conclude treaty of neutrality in the same manner they will distrust every appearance of we zeal for the house of austrium and imagine that we intend only a hypocritical assistance and that we general we ambassador and we admiral have in reality the same order nothing my lord be more dangerous than to weaken the publick faith when a nation can be no longer trust it lose all its influence because none can fear its menace or depend on its alliance a nation no longer trust must stand alone and unsupported and it be certain that the nation which be justly suspect of hold with its open enemy a secret intercourse to the prejudice of its ally can be no longer trust this suspicion my lord this hateful this reproachful character be now fix upon the court of britain nor do it take its rise only from the forbearance of we admiral but have receive new confirmation from the behavior of we ambassador who deny the treaty of neutrality when the french minister declare it to the dutch such now my lord be the reputation of the british court a reputation produce by the most flagrant and notorious instance of cowardice and falsehood which can not but make all we endeavor ineffectual and discourage all those power whose conjunction we might have promote from enter into any other engagement than such as we may purchase for state subsidy for who upon any other motive than immediate interest would form a alliance with a power which upon the first appearance of danger give up a confederate to purchase not a large extent of territory not a new field of commerce not a port or a citadel but a abject neutrality but however mean may be a supplication for peace or however infamous the desertion of a ally i wish my lord that the liberty of invade the queen of hungary 's dominion without opposition have be the most culpable concession of we illustrious minister of whom it be reasonable to believe that they have stipulate with the spaniard that they shall be repay the expense of the war by the plunder of we merchant that we commerce have be unnecessarily expose to the ravages of privateer from which a very small degree of caution might have preserve it that three hundred trading ship have be take and that three thousand british sailor be now in captivity be a consideration too melancholy to be long dwelt upon and a truth too certain to be suppress or deny how such havock could have be make have not we ship of war conclude a treaty of neutrality with the spaniard and leave the war to be carry on only by the merchant it be not easy to conceive for surely it will not be pretend that all these loss be the necessary consequence of we situation with regard to spain which if it expose the portugal trader to hazard do not hinder we from guard we own coast and yet on we own coast my lord have multitude of we ship be take by the spaniard they have be seize by petty vessel as they be enter we port and congratulating themselves upon they escape from danger in the late war with france a enemy much more formidable both for power and situation method be discover by which we trade be more efficaciously protect : by station a squadron at the mouth of the channel of which two or three ship at a time cruize at a proper distance on the neighbouring sea the privateer be keep in awe and confine to they own harbor or seize if they venture to leave they but of such useful regulation in the present war there be little hope for if the publick papers be of any credit the king of spain consider the capture of we merchant as a standing revenue and have lay a indulto upon they as upon other part of the spanish trade it be therefore to little purpose that measure be propose in this house or scheme present by the merchant for the preservation of we commerce for the merchant be consider as the determine enemy of we minister who therefore resolve that they should repent of the war into which he be force by they contrary to those favorite scheme and establish maxim which he have pursue till the liberty of mankind be almost extinguish there be indeed some hope my lord that new measure resolutely pursue might yet repair the mischief of this absurd and cowardly conduct and that by resolution and dexterity the ambition of france might once more be disappoint the king of prussium appear at length convince that he have not altogether pursue he real interest and that he own family must fall in the ruin of the house of austrium the king of sardinium appear firm in he determination to adhere to the queen of hungary and have therefore refuse a passage through he dominion to the spanish troops the state of holland seem to have take the alarm and nothing but they distrust of we sincerity can hinder they from unite against the house of bourbon this distrust my lord we may probably remove by revive on this occasion we ancient form of address and declare at once to he majesty and to all the power of europe that we be far from approve the late measure there be another reason why the short address of we ancestor may be prefer to the modern form in which a great number of particular fact be often comprehend it be evident that the address be present before there can be time to examine whether the fact contain in they be justly state and they must therefore lose they efficacy with the people who be sufficiently sagacious to distinguish servile compliance from real approbation and who will not easily mistake the incense of flattery for the tribute of gratitude with regard to the propriety of the address propose to you lordship which be like other only a repetition of the speech there be at least one objection to it too important to be suppress it be affirm in the speech in what particular word i can not exactly remember that since the death of the late german emperor the interest of the queen of hungary have be diligently and invariably promote a assertion which he majesty be too wise too equitable and too generous to have utter but at the persuasion of he minister he majesty well know that no important assistance have be hitherto give to that unhappy princess he know that the twelve thousand man who be say to have be raise for the defense of the empire those mighty troops by whose assistance the enemy of austrium be to be scatter never march beyond the territory of hanover nor leave that blissful country for a single day and be it probable that the queen would have prefer money for troops have she not be inform that it would be more easily obtain nor be even this pecuniary assistance though compatible with the security of hanover grant she without reluctance and difficulty of which no other proof be necessary than the distance between the promise and the performance of it the money my lord be not yet all pay though the last payment be very lately fix such be the assistance which the united influence of justice and compassion have yet procure from the court of britain we minister have be therefore hitherto my lord so far from act with vigor in favor of the house of austrium that they have never solicit the court of muscovy almost the only court now independent on france to engage in she defense how wisely that mighty power distinguish she real interest and how ardently she pursue it the whole world be convince in she alliance with the late emperor nor be it unlikely that she might have be easily persuade to have protect he daughter with equal zeal but we never ask she alliance lest we should obtain it and yet we boast of we good office we governor think it more nearly concern they to humble we merchant than to succor we ally and therefore admit the spaniard into italy by which prudent conduct they dexterously at once gratify the house of bourbon embarrass the queen of hungary and endanger the effect of the british merchant lie at leghorn effect which be lately value at six hundred thousand pound but which by the seasonable arrival of the spaniard be happily reduce to half they price i hope therefore i need not urge to you lordship the necessity of confine we address to thanks and congratulation because it be not necessary to say how inconsistent it must be think with the dignity of this house to echo falsehood and to countenance perfidy then the duke of newcastle speak to the following effect : -- my lord the manner in which the noble lord who speak last express he sentiment never fail to give pleasure even where he argument produce no conviction and he eloquence always receive its praise though it may sometimes be disappoint of its more important effect in the present debate my lord i have hear no argument by which i be incline to change the usual form of address or to reject the motion which have be make to we the address which have be propose be not in my opinion justly chargeable either with flattery to the minister or with disingenuity with respect to the people nor can i discover in it any of those position which have be represent so fallacious and dangerous it contain only a general declaration of we gratitude and a assertion of we zeal a declaration and assertion to which i hope no lord in this assembly will be unwilling to subscribe as a inquiry into the propriety of this address have produce whether necessarily or not many observation on the present state of europe and many animadversion upon the late conduct it can not be improper for I to offer to you lordship my opinion of the measure which have be pursue by we as well in the war with spain as with regard to the queen of hungary and to propose my conjecture concern the event which may probably be produce by the distraction on the continent this deviation from the question before we will at least be as easily pardon in I as in the noble lord who have exhibit so gloomy a representation of we approach condition who have lament the slavery with which they imagine all the state of europe about to be harass and describe the insolence and ravages of those oppressor to whom they apprehension have already give the empire of the world for surely my lord it be a endeavor no less laudable to dispel terror than to excite it and he who bring we such account as we desire to receive be generally listen to with indulgence however unelegant may be he expression or however irregular he narration that the power of the family of bourbon be arrive at a very dangerous and formidable extent that it never be hitherto employ but to disturb the happiness of the universe that the same scheme which we ancestor labor so ardently and so successfully to destroy be now form afresh and intended to be put in immediate execution that the empire be design to be hold henceforward in dependence on france and that the house of austrium by which the common rights of mankind have be so long support be now mark out for destruction be too evident to be contest it be allow my lord that the power of the house of austrium which there be once reason to dread lest it might have be employ against we be now almost extinguish and that name which have for so many age fill the history of europe be in danger of be forget it be allow that the house of austrium can not fall without expose all those who have hitherto be support by its alliance to the utmost danger and i need not add that they ought therefore to assist it with the utmost expedition and the most vigorous measure it may be suggest my lord that this assistance have be already delay till it be become useless that the utmost expedition will be too slow and the most vigorous measure too weak to stop the torrent of the conquest of france : that the fatal blow will be strike before we shall have a opportunity to ward it off and that we regard for the house of austrium will be only compassion for the dead but these my lord i hope be only the apprehension of a mind overborne with sudden terror and perplex by a confused survey of complicated danger for if we consider more distinctly the power which may be bring in opposition to france we shall find no reason for despair that we may once more stand up with success in defense of we religion and the liberty of mankind and once more reduce those troubler of the world to the necessity of abandon they destructive design the noble lord have already mention the present disposition of three powerful state as a motive for vigorous resolution and a consideration that may at least preserve we from despair and it be no small satisfaction to I to observe that he penetration and experience incline he to hope upon the prospect of affair as they now appear because i doubt not but that hope will be improve into confidence by the account which i can now give you lordship of the intention of another power yet more formidable to engage with we in the great design of repress the insolence of france a treaty of alliance my lord have be for some time concerted with the emperor of muscovy and have be negotiate with such diligence that it be now complete and i doubt not but the last ratification will arrive at this court in a few day by which it will appear to you lordship that the interest of this nation have be vigilantly regard and to we ally that the faith of britain have never yet be shake it will appear to the french that they have precipitate they triumph that they have imagine themselves master of nation by whom they will be in a short time drive back to they own confines and that perhaps they have parcel out kingdom which they be never likely to possess it be affirm and with just discernment that application ought to be make to this powerful court as the profess adversary of france and if it be not hitherto know that they assistance have be assiduously solicit we endeavor be keep secret only that they success might be more certain and that they might surprise more powerfully by they effect nor have the two other prince which be mention by the noble lord be forget whose concurrence be at this time so necessary to we : and i doubt not but that the representation which have be make with all the force of truth and all the zeal that be awaken by interest and by danger will in time produce the effect for which they be intend by convince those prince that they endanger themselves by flattering the french ambition that they be divest themselves of that defense of which they will quickly regret the loss and that they be only not attack at present that they may be destroy more easily hereafter but it be always to be remembered my lord that in publick transaction as in private life interest act with less force as it be at greater distance and that the immediate motive will generally prevail futurity impair the influence of the most important object of consideration even when it do not lessen they certainty and with regard to event only probable event which a thousand accident may obviate they be almost annihilate with regard to the human mind by be place at a distance from we wherever imagination can exert its power we easily dwell upon the most please view and flatter ourselves with those consequence which though perhaps least to be expect be most desire wherever different event may arise which be the state of all human transaction we naturally promote we hope and repress we fear and in time so far deceive ourselves as to quiet all we suspicion lay all we terror asleep and believe what at first we only wish this my lord must be the delusion by which some state be induce to favor and other to neglect the encroachment of france man be impolitick as they be wicked because they prefer the gratification of the present hour to the assurance of solid and permanent but distant happiness the french take advantage of this general weakness of the human mind and by magnificent promise to one prince and petty grant to another reconcile they to they design each find that he shall gain more by contract a alliance with they than with another state which have no view besides that of preserve to every sovereign he just rights and which therefore as it plunder none will have nothing to bestow this my lord be the disadvantage under which we negotiator labor against those of france we have no kingdom to parcel out among those whose confederacy we solicit we can promise they no superiority above the neighbouring prince which they do not now possess we assume not the province of adjust the boundary of dominion or of decide contest title : we promise only the preservation of quiet and the establishment of safety but the french my lord oppose we with other argument argument which indeed receive they force from folly and credulity but what more powerful assistance can be desire they promise not mere negative advantage not a exemption from remote oppression or a escape from slavery which as it be yet never feel be very little dreaded they offer a immediate augmentation of dominion and a extension of power they propose new tract of commerce and open new source of wealth they invite confederacy not for defense but for conquest for conquest to be divide among the power by whose union they shall be make let it not therefore be object my lord to we minister or we negotiator that the french obtain more influence than they that they be more easily listen to or more readily believe : for while such be the condition of mankind that what be desire be easily credit while profit be more powerful than reason the french eloquence will frequently prevail whether my lord we seem want of success in the war with spain admit of as easy a solution my degree of knowledge in military affair do not enable I to determine a account of this part of we conduct be to be expect from the commissioner of the admiralty by whom i doubt not but such reason will be assign for all the operation of we naval force and such vindication offer of all those measure which have be hitherto imputed too precipitately to negligence cowardice or treachery as will satisfy those who have be most vehement in they censure but because it do not seem to I very difficult to apologize for those miscarriage which have occasion the loudest complaint i will lay before you lordship what i have be able to collect from inquiry or to conjecture from observation and doubt not but it will easily appear that nothing have be omit from any apparent design of betray we country and that we minister and commander will deserve at least to be hear before they be condemn that great number of we trading vessel have be seize by the spaniard and that we commerce have therefore be very much embarrassed and interrupted be sufficiently manifest but to I my lord this appear one of the certain and necessary consequence of war which be always to be expect and to be set in we consultation against the advantage which we propose to obtain it be as rational to expect that of a army send against we enemy every man should return unhurt to he acquaintance as that every merchant should see he ship and cargo sail safely into port if we examine my lord the late war of which the conduct have be so lavishly applaud in which the victory which we obtain have be so loudly celebrated and which have be propose to the imitation of all future minister it will appear that we loss of the same kind be then very frequent and perhaps not less complain of though the murmur be now forget and the acclamation transmit to posterity because we naturally relate what have give we satisfaction and suppress what we can not recollect without uneasiness if we look farther backward my lord and inquire into the event of any other war in which we engage since commerce have constitute so large a part of the interest of this nation i doubt not but in proportion to we trade will be find we loss and in all future war as in the present i shall expect the same calamity and the same complaint for the escape of any number of ship raise no transport nor produce any gratitude but the loss of a few will always give occasion to clamor and discontent for vigilance however diligent can never produce more safety than will be naturally expect from we incontestable superiority at sea by which a great part of the nation be so far deceive as to imagine that because we can not be conquer we can not be molest nor do i see how it be possible to employ we power more effectually for the protection of we trade than by the method now pursue of cover the ocean with we fleet and station we ship of war in every place where danger can be apprehend if it be urge that the inefficacy of we measure be a sufficient proof of they impropriety it will be proper to substitute another plan of operation of which the success may be more probable to I my lord the loss of some of we mercantile vessel show only the disproportion between the number of we ship of war and the extent of the sea which be a region too vast to be completely garrison and of which the frequenter must inevitably be subject to the sudden incursion of subtle rover the disposition of we squadron have be such as be doubtless dictate by the most acute sagacity and the most enlighten experience the squadron which be appoint to guard we coast have be ridicule as a useless expense and its frequent excursion and return without any memorable attempt have give occasion to endless raillery and incessant exclamation of wonder and contempt but it be to be consider my lord that the enemy of this nation either secret or declare have powerful squadron in many port of the mediterranean which have they know that we coast be without defense might have issue out on a sudden and have appear unexpectedly in we channel from whence they might have lay we town in ruin enter we dock burn up all we preparation for future expedition carry into slavery the inhabitant of we village and leave the maritime province of this kingdom in a state of general desolation out of this squadron however necessary there be yet a reinforcement of five ship order to assist haddock that he might be enable to oppose the design of the spaniard though assist by they french confederate whom it be know that he be so far from favor that he be station before barcelona to block they up why he depart from that port and upon what motive of policy or maxim of war he suffer the spaniard to prosecute they scheme he only be able to inform we that the spaniard have not at least be spare by design be evident from they suffering in this war which have be much greater than ours many of we ship have indeed be snatch up by the rapacity of private adventurer whom the ardor of interest have make vigilant and whose celerity of pursuit as well as flight enable they to take the advantage of the situation of they own port and those of they friend but as none of we ship have be deny convoy i know not how the loss of they can be imputed to the ministry and if any of those who sail under the protection of ship of war have be lose the commander may be require to vindicate themselves from the charge of negligence or treachery but this inquiry my lord must be in my opinion reserve for another day when it may become the immediate subject of we consultation with which it have at present no coherence or to which at least it be very remotely related for i be not able upon the most impartial and the most attentive consideration of the address now propose to you lordship to perceive any necessity of a previous inquiry into the conduct of the war the transaction of we negotiation or the state of the kingdom in order to we compliance with this motion by which we shall be far from shelter any crime from punishment or any doubtful conduct from inquiry shall be far from obstruct the course of national justice or approve what we do not understand the chief tendency of he majesty 's speech be to ask we advice on this extraordinary conjuncture of affair a conduct undoubtedly worthy of a british monarch and which we ought not to requite with disrespect but what less can be infer from a alteration of we established form of address by a omission of any part of the speech for what will be imagine by he majesty by the nation and by the whole world but that we do not approve what we do not answer the duke of argyle speak to the follow purpose : -- my lord it be with great reason that the present time have be represent to we from the throne as a time of uncommon danger and disturbance a time in which the barrier of kingdom be break down in contempt of every law of heaven and of earth and in which ambition rapine and oppression seem to be let loose upon mankind a time in which some nation send out army and invade the territory of they neighbor in opposition to the most solemn treaty of which other with equal perfidy silently suffer or secretly favor the violation at a time like this when treaty be consider only as momentary expedient and alliance confer no security it be evident that the preservation of we rights we interest and we commerce must depend only on we natural strength and that instead of cultivate the friendship of foreign power which we must purchase upon disadvantageous condition and which will be withdraw from we whenever we shall need it we ought therefore to collect we own force and show the world how little we stand in need of assistance and how little we have to fear from the most powerful of we enemy we country my lord seem design by nature to subsist without any dependence on other nation and by a steady and resolute improvement of these advantage with which providence have bless it may bid defiance to mankind it might become by the extension of we commerce the general center at which the wealth of the whole earth might be collect together and from whence it might be issue upon proper occasion for the diffusion of liberty the repression of insolence and the preservation of peace but this glory and this influence my lord must arise from domestick felicity and domestick felicity can only be produce by a mutual confidence between the government and the people where the governor distrust the affection of they subject they will not be very solicitous to advance they happiness for who will endeavor to increase that wealth which will as he believe be employ against he nor will the subject cheerfully concur even with the necessary measure of they governor whose general design they conceive to be contrary to the publick interest because any temporary success or accidental reputation will only dazzle the eye of the multitude while they liberty be steal away this confidence my lord must be promote where it exist and regain where it be lose by the open administration of justice by impartial inquiry into publick transaction by the exaltation of those whose wisdom and bravery have advance the publick reputation or increase the happiness of the nation and the censure of those however elate with dignity or surround with dependant who by they unskilfulness or dishonesty have either embarrass they country or betray it for this reason my lord it be in my opinion necessary to gratify the nation at the present juncture with the prospect of those measure without which no people can reasonably be satisfied and to pacify they resentment of past injury and quiet they apprehension of future misery by a possibility at least that they may see the author of all we miscarriage call to a trial in open day and the merit of those man acknowledge and reward by whose resolution and integrity they imagine that the final ruin of themselves and posterity have be hitherto prevent that the present discontent of the british nation be almost universal that suspicion have infuse itself into every rank and denomination of man that complaint of the neglect of we commerce the misapplication of we treasure and the unsuccessfulness of we arm be to be hear from every mouth and in every place where man dare utter they sentiment i suppose my lord no man will deny for whoever should stand up in opposition to the truth of a fact so generally know would distinguish himself even in this age of effrontery and corruption by a contempt of reputation not yet know amongst mankind and indeed my lord it must be confess that these discontent and clamor be produce by such a appearance of folly or of treachery as few age or nation have ever know by such a obstinate perseverance in bad measure as shame have hitherto prevent in those upon whom nobler motive fidelity to they trust and love of they country have lose they influence other minister when they have form design of sacrifice the publick interest to they own have be compel to better measure by timely discovery and just representation they have be criminal only because they hope for secrecy and have vindicate they conduct no longer than while they have hope that they apology might deceive but we heroick minister my lord have set themselves free from the shackle of circumspection they have disburden themselves of the embarrassment of caution and claim a exemption from the necessity of support they measure by laborious deduction and artful reasoning they defy the publick when they can no longer delude it and prosecute in the face of the sun those measure which they have not be able to support and of which the fatal consequence be foresee by the whole nation when they have be detect in one absurdity they take shelter in another when experience have show that one of they attempt be design only to injure they country they propose a second of the same kind with equal confidence boast again of they integrity and again require the concurrence of the legislature and the support of the people when they have for a long time suffer we trading vessel to be seize in sight of we own port when they have despatch fleet into the mediterranean only to lie expose to the injury of the weather and to sail from one coast to another only to show that they have no hostile intention and that they be fit out by the friend of the spaniard only to amuse and exhaust the nation they at length think it necessary to lull the impatience of the people who begin to discover that they have hitherto be harass with tax and impress to no purpose by the appearance of a new effort for the subjection of the enemy and to divert by the expectation which a army and a fleet naturally raise any clamor at they past conduct ' for this end have enter into they usual consultation they project a expedition into america for which they raise force and procure transport with all the pomp of preparation for the conquest of half the continent not so much to alarm the spaniard which i conceive but a secondary view as to fill the people of britain with amusing prospects of great achievement of the addition of new dominion to this empire and a ample reparation for all they damages thus provide with force sufficient in appearance for this mighty enterprise they embark they after many delay and dismiss they to they fate have first disposed they regulation in such a manner that it be impossible that they should meet with success i can call you lordship to witness that this impossibility be not discover by I after the event for i foretold in this house that they design so conduct must evidently miscarry nor be this prediction my lord the effect of any uncommon sagacity or any accidental conjecture on future consequence which happen to be right for to any man who have have opportunity of observe that knowledge in war be necessary to success and experience be the foundation of knowledge it be sufficiently plain that we force must be repulse the force send into america my lord be newly raise place under the direction of officer not less ignorant than themselves and command by a man who never have command any troops before and who however laudable he might have discharge the duty of a captain be wholly unacquainted with the province of a general yet be this man my lord prefer not only to a multitude of other officer to whom experience must have be of small advantage if it do not furnish they with knowledge far superior to he but to five and forty general of whom i hope the nation have no reason to suspect that any of they would not gladly have serve it on a occasion of so great importance and willingly have conduct a expedition intend to retrieve the honor of the british name the terror of we arm and the security of we commerce when raw troops my lord with young officer be to act under the command of a unskilful general what be it reasonable to expect but what have happen -- overthrow slaughter and ignominy what but that cheap victory should heighten the insolence and harden the obstinacy of we enemy and that we should not only be weaken by we loss but dispirit by we disgrace by the disgrace of be overthrow by those whom we have despise and with whom nothing but we own folly could have reduce we to a level the other conjecture which i venture to propose to you lordship with regard to the queen of hungary be not found on fact equally evident with the former though experience have discover that it be equally true it be then assert both by other lord and myself that money would be choose by that princess as a assistance more useful than force a opinion which the lord who be engage in the administration vigorously oppose in consequence of they determination force be hire for what purpose -- let they now declare since none but themselves have yet know that at least they be not take into we pay for the service for which they be require the succor of the house of austrium be most evident unless the name of army be imagine sufficient to intimidate the french as the spaniard be to be subdue by the sight of fleet they never march towards she frontier never oppose she enemy or afford she the least assistance but stand idle and unconcerned in the territory of hanover nor be it know that they exist by any other proof than that remittance be make for they pay such my lord be the assistance ask with so much solicitude and levy with so much expedition for the queen of hungary such be the effect of the zeal of we illustrious minister for the preservation of that August house to whose alliance we be perhaps indebted for the preservation of we religion and we liberty and to which all europe must have recourse for shelter from the oppression of france when this formidable body of man be assemble my lord and review they be perhaps find too graceful and too well sort to be expose to the danger of a battle and the same tenderness that have so long preserved we own force from any other field than the park might rescue they from the fatigue of accompany the active hussar in they incursion or the steady austrian in they conflict whatever be the reason my lord it be certain that they have be reserve for other opportunity of signalize they courage and they sleep in quiet and fatten upon the wealth of britain while the enemy of we illustrious magnanimous and unfortunate ally enter she territory without opposition march through they uninterrupted and rather take possession than make conquest that in this condition of she affair the queen would refuse a offer of twelve thousand man that when she be drive from one country to another attend by a army scarcely sufficient to form a fly camp she would not gladly have accept a reinforcement so powerful let those believe my lord who have yet never be deceive by ministerial faith the real design of the ministry my lord be sufficiently obvious nor be any thing more certain than that they have in require this mock assistance for the queen of hungary no other design than that of raise she expectation only to deceive they and to divert she by confidence in they preparation from have recourse to more efficacious expedient that she might become without resistance the slave of france for this purpose they determine to succor she with force rather than with money because many reason might be pretend by which the march of the force might be retard but the money my lord when grant must have be more speedily remit at last the queen weary with delay and undoubtedly sufficiently inform of those design which be now however generally discover confidently deny desire a supply of money which might be grant without leave hanover expose to a invasion with this demand which they have no pretence to deny they have yet find expedient to delay they compliance for it do not appear that the whole sum grant have yet be pay and it would well become those noble lord whose office give they a opportunity of observe the distribution of the publick money to justify themselves from the suspicion of the nation by declare openly what have be remit and what yet remain to be disburse for some other purpose be it not therefore evident my lord that by promising assistance to this unhappy princess the ministry intend to deceive she that when they flatter she with the approach of auxiliary force they design only to station they where they might garrison the frontier of hanover and that when they force she to solicit for pecuniary aid they delay the payment of the subsidy that it might not be receive till it could produce no effect this my lord be not only evident from the manifest absurdity of they conduct upon any other supposition but from the general scheme which have always be pursue by the man whose dictatorial instruction regulate the opinion of all those that constitute the ministry and of whom it be well know that it have be the great purpose of he life to aggrandize france by apply to she for assistance in imaginary distress from fictitious confederacy and by sacrifice to she in return the house of austrium and the commerce of britain how then my lord can it be assert by we that the house of austrium have be vigilantly support how can we approve measure of which we discover no effect but the expense of the nation a double expense produce first by raise troops which though grant for the assistance of the austrian have be make use of only for the protection of hanover and by the grant of money in the place of these troops which be thus fallaciously obtain and thus unprofitably employ for what purpose these force be in reality raise i suppose no man can be ignorant and no man to whom it be know can possibly approve it how then my lord can we concur in a address by which the people must be persuade that we either be deceive ourselves or endeavor to impose upon they that we either dare not condemn any measure however destructive or that at least we be in haste to approve they lest inquiry should discover they tendency too plainly to leave we the power of applaud they without a open declaration of we own impotence or disregard for the welfare of the publick the complaint of the people be already clamorous and they discontent open and universal and surely the voice of the people ought at least to awake we to a examination of they condition and though we should not immediately condemn those whom they censure and detest as the author of they misery we ought at least to pay so much regard to the accusation of the whole community as not to reject it without inquiry as a suspicion merely chimerical whether these complaint and suspicion my lord proceed from real injury and imminent danger or from false accusation and groundless terror they equally deserve the attention of this house whose great care be the happiness of the people : people equally worthy of you tenderness and regard whether they be betray by one party or another whether they be plunder by the advocate of the administration under pretence of support the government or affright with unreasonable clamor by the opponent of the court under the specious appearance of protect liberty the people my lord be in either case equally miserable and deserve equally to be rescue from distress by what method my lord can this be effect but by some publick assurance from this house that the transaction of the nation shall no longer be conceal in impenetrable secrecy that measure shall be no longer approve without examination that publick evil shall be trace to they cause and that disgrace which they have hitherto bring upon the publick shall fall for the future only upon the author of they of give this assurance and of quiet by it the clamor of the people clamor which whether just or not be too formidable to be slight and too loud not to be hear we have now the most proper opportunity before we the address which the practice of we ancestor require we to make to he majesty may give we occasion of express at once we loyalty to the crown and we fidelity to we country we zeal for the honor of we sovereign and we regard for the happiness of the people for this purpose it be necessary that as we preserve the practice of we ancestor in one respect we revive it in another that we imitate those in just freedom of language whom we follow in the decent form of ceremony and show that as we preserve like they a due sense of the regal dignity so like they we know likewise how to preserve we own and despise flattery on one side as we decline rudeness on the other a practice my lord have prevail of late which can not but be allow pernicious to the publick and derogatory from the honor of this assembly a practice of retain in we address the word of the speech and of follow it servilely from period to period as if it be expect that we should always adopt the sentiment of the court as if we be not summon to advise but to approve and approve without examination by such address my lord all inquiry may be easily preclude for the minister by whom the speech be compile may easily introduce the most criminal transaction in such a manner as that they may obtain the approbation of this house which he may plead afterwards at we bar when he shall be call before it and either involve we in the disgrace of inconsistency and expose we to general contempt or be acquit by we former suffrage which it would be reproachful to retract and yet criminal to confirm it be not necessary my lord on this occasion to observe what all party have long since acknowledge when it do not promote they interest to deny it that every speech from the throne be to be consider as the work of the minister because it be generally write by he or if compose by the king himself must be draw up in pursuance of the information and counsel of the ministry to whom it be therefore ultimately to be refer and may consequently be examine without any failure of respect to the person of the prince this ought however to be observe my lord that it may appear more plainly how certainly this practice may be imputed to the artifice of minister since it do not promote the honor of the prince and manifestly obstruct the interest of the people since it be a practice irrational in itself because it be inconsistent with the great purpose of this assembly and can therefore serve no other purpose than that of procure indemnity to the minister by place they out of the reach of future animadversion let not my lord the uninterrupted continuance of this practice for some reign be plead in its defense for nothing be more worthy of the dignity of this house than to prevent the multiplication of dangerous precedent that a custom manifestly injurious to the publick have continue long be the strongest reason for break it because it acquire every year new authority and greater veneration : if when a nation be alarm and distract a custom of twenty year be not to be infringe it may in twenty year more be so firmly establish that many may think it necessary to be support even when those calamity be incontestably feel which perhaps now be only fear i shall therefore my lord propose that of the address move for all be leave out but the first paragraph it will then be more consistent with the honor of you lordship with we regard for the people and with we duty to the crown and hope no lord will refuse he concurrence lord hardwicke rise next and speak to the following effect : -- my lord upon a attentive consideration of the address now propose i be not able to discover any objection which can justly hinder the unanimous concurrence of this assembly since there be not any proposition contain in it either dangerous or uncertain the noble lord who have oppose this motion with the most ardent vehemence be very far from deny what be assert in it they readily grant that design be concerted by many formidable power against the house of austrium and that the consequence of the ruin of that family must extend to the utmost part of europe and endanger the liberty of britain itself that the power of france will then be without a rival and that she may afterwards gratify she ambition without fear and without danger nor be it my lord less obvious in itself or less generally allow that this be a time which demand the most active vigor the most invariable unanimity and the most diligent despatch that nothing can interrupt the course of we common enemy but the wisest counsel and the most resolute opposition and that upon we conduct at this great conjuncture may probably depend the happiness and liberty of ourselves we ally and we posterity all this my lord be allow to be apparently and indisputably true i be therefore at a loss to conceive what can be the occasion of the debate in which some of you lordship have engage as the cause of the calamity which be say to threaten we be not assign in the address we shall leave ourselves at full liberty to charge they upon those who shall appear from future inquiry to deserve so heavy a accusation if the minister of the court have by any inconstancy in they measure or folly in they negotiation give a opportunity to the enemy of europe to extend they influence or endanger either we own interest or that of we ally if they have by oppression or negligence alienate from he majesty the affection of he people or the confidence of he confederate nothing that be contain in the address now before we can be produce by they in justification of they conduct or secure they from accusation censure and punishment if the war my lord have be hitherto carry on with clandestine stipulation or treacherous compact if we admiral have receive order to retire from the coast of spain only to give we enemy a opportunity of invade the dominion of the queen of hungary or have without direction desert they station and abandon the protection of we commerce and we colony we shall notwithstanding this address retain in we hand the privilege of inquire into they conduct and the power if it be find criminal of inflict such penalty as justice shall require i know not therefore my lord upon what motive the debate be continue nor what objection they be which hinder we unanimity at a time when all petty controversy ought to be forget and all nominal distinction lay aside at a time when general danger may justly claim general attention and we ought to suspend the assertion of we particular opinion and the prosecution of we separate interest and regard only the opposition of france the support of we ally and the preservation of we country the noble lord who have offer they sentiment on this occasion have very diffusely expatiate on the misery that impend over we and have show uncommon dexterity and acuteness in trace they all to one source the weakness or dishonesty of the british ministry for my part my lord though perhaps i believe that many circumstance of the present distress be to be imputed to accident which could not be foresee and that the conduct of the ministry however sometimes disappointed of the effect intend by it be yet prudent and sincere i shall at present forbear to engage in they defense because the discussion of a question so complicated must necessarily require much time and because i think it not so useful to inquire how we be involve in we present difficulty as by what mean we may be extricate from they the method by which weak state be make strong and by which those that be already powerful be enable to exert they strength with efficacy be the promotion of union and the abolition of all suspicion by which the people may be incite to a distrust of they sovereign or the sovereign provoke to a disregard of he people with this view my lord all address ought to be draw up and this consideration will be sufficient to restrain we from any innovation at a time like this if it should be grant my lord that the ancient method be better adapt to the general intention of address more correspondent to the dignity of this house and liable to fewer inconveniency than that which later time have introduce yet it will not follow that we can now safely change it nothing in the whole doctrine of politick be better know than that there be time when the redress of grievance inveterate and customary be not to be attempt time when the utmost care be barely sufficient to avert extreme calamity and prevent a total dissolution and in which the consideration of lighter evil must not be suffer to interrupt more important counsel or divert that attention which the preservation of the state necessarily demand such my lord be the present time even by the confession of those who have oppose the motion and of whom therefore it may be reasonably demand why they waste these important hour in debate upon form and word for that only form and word have produce the debate must be apparent even to themselves when the fervor of controversy shall have slacken when that vehemence with which the most moderate be sometimes transport and that acrimony which candor itself can not always forbear shall give way to reflection and to reason that the danger be press and that press danger require expedition and unanimity they willingly grant and what more be assert in the address that any lord should be unwilling to concur in the customary expression of thankfulness and duty to he majesty or in acknowledgment of that regard for this assembly with which he ask we assistance and advice i be unwilling to suspect nor can i imagine that any part of the opposition to this proposal can be produce by unwillingness to comply with he majesty 's demand and to promise that advice and assistance which it be we duty both to we sovereign we country and ourselves to offer that those my lord who have express in term so full of indignation they resentment of the imaginary neglect of the queen of hungary 's interest have declare the house of austrium the only bulwark of europe and express they dread of the encroachment of france with emotion which nothing but real passion can produce should be unwilling to assert they resolution of adhering to the pragmatick sanction and of defend the liberty of the empire can not be suppose and yet my lord what other reason of they conduct can be assign either by the emperor or the people or the ally of britain those ally whose claim they so warmly assert and whose merit they so loudly extol will it not be imagine in foreign court that the measure now recommend by the emperor be think not consistent with the interest of the nation will it not be readily believe that we propose to abandon those design of which we can not be persuade to declare we approbation what will be the consequence of such a opinion artfully propagate by france and confirm by appearance so likely to deceive may easily be foresee and safely predict the french will prosecute they scheme with fresh ardor when they dread no longer any interruption from the only nation able to resist they and it be well know my lord how often confidence by exciting courage produce success nor indeed can the success of they endeavor thus animated and quicken be easily doubt since the same appearance that encourage they will intimidate they enemy we ally will then think no longer of union against the general enemy they must imagine they unite force insufficient and the only emulation amongst they will quickly be which shall first offer he liberty to sale who shall first pay he court to the master of the world and merit mercy by a speedy submission thus my lord will the house of austrium that house so faithful to britain and so steady in its opposition to the design of the french ambition be finally sink in irrecoverable ruin by those who appear to please themselves with declamation in its praise and resolution for its defense and who never speak of the french without rage and detestation if on this occasion my lord we should give any suspicion of unusual discontent what could be conclude but that we be unwilling any longer to embarrass ourselves with remote consideration to load this nation with tax for the preservation of the rights of other sovereign and to hazard army in the defense of the continent what can we ally think but that we be at present weary of the burdensome and expensive honor of hold the balance of power in we hand be content to resign the unquiet province of the arbiter of europe and propose to confine we care henceforward to we immediate interest and shut up ourselves in we own island that this be the real design of any of those noble lord who have oppose the motion i do not intend to insinuate for i doubt not but they believe the general interest both of this nation and its ally most likely to be promote by the method of address which they recommend since they declare that they do not think we state desperate and confess the importance of the affair on which we be require by he majesty to deliberate to be such that nothing ought to repress we endeavor but impossibility of success such be the knowledge and experience of those noble lord that the hope which i have form of see the destructive attempt of the french once more defeat and power restore again to that equipoise which be necessary to the continuance of tranquillity and happiness have receive new strength from they concurrence and i shall now hear with less solicitude the threat of france that the french my lord be not invincible the noble duke who speak last have often experienced nor be there any reason for imagine that they be now more formidable than when we encounter they in the field of blenheim and ramilly nothing be requisite but a firm union among those prince who be immediately in danger from they encroachment to reduce they to withdraw they force from the country of they neighbor and quit for the defense of they own territory they scheme of bestow empire and divide dominion that such a union be now cultivate we have be inform by he majesty whose endeavor will probably be successful however they may at first be thwart and obstruct because the near approach of danger will rouse those whom avarice have stupify or negligence intoxicated thus truth and reason will become every day more powerful and sophistry and artifice be in time certainly detect when therefore my lord we be engage in consultation which may affect the liberty of a great part of mankind and by which we posterity to many age may be make happy or miserable when the daily progress of the enemy of justice and of freedom ought to awaken we to vigilance and expedition and there be yet just hope that diligence and firmness may preserve we from ruin let we not waste we time in unnecessary debate and keep the nation of europe in suspense by the discussion of a question the decision of which may be delay for year without any manifest inconvenience let we not embarrass he majesty by a unusual form of address at a time when he he negotiate alliance and form plan for the rescue of the empire nothing my lord be more remote from the real end of address than a representation of they as make only to the minister for if there be any commerce between a prince and he subject in which he be the immediate agent if he personal dignity be interest in any act of government i think it be not to be deny that in receive the address of the two house he assume a peculiar and distinct character which can not be confound with he council or ministry the duke of argyle rise again and speak to this effect : -- my lord if there be now any contest amongst we for superiority of regard to he majesty of zeal for he honor or reverence of he person i should not doubt of prove that no lord in this house can boast of more ardor fidelity or respect than myself and if the chief question now amongst we related to the term in which he deserve to be address by we i should be unwilling that any man should propose language more submissive and reverend or more forcible and comprehensive than myself but address however they may for present purpose be represent as regard the personal character of the king be in reality nothing more than reply to a speech compose by the minister whose measure if we should appear to commend we panegyrick may in some future proceeding be cite against we every address therefore ought to be consider as a publick record and to be draw up to inform the nation not to mislead we sovereign the address now propose be indeed equally indefensible to whomsoever it may be suppose to relate if it respect the people it can only drive they to despair if it be confine to the sovereign we advice not we panegyrick be now require and europe be to be preserve from ruin not by we eloquence but we sincerity respect to he majesty my lord will be best show by preserve he influence in other nation and he authority in he own empire this can only be do by show he how the one have be impaired and how the other may be in time endanger by address like this which be now propose my lord have he majesty be betray into a inadvertent appro bation of measure pernicious to the nation and dishonourable to himself and will now be keep ignorant of the despicable conduct of the war the treacherous connivance at the descent of the spaniard upon the dominion of the queen of hungary and the contempt with which every nation of the continent have hear of the neutrality lately conclude by address like this my lord have the rights of the nation be silently give up and the invader of liberty and violator of we law preserve from prosecution by such address have we monarch be ruin at one time and we country enslave at another lord harrington speak next in the follow manner : -- my lord it be necessary to explain that treaty of neutrality which have be mention by some lord as a act to the last degree shameful a act by which the nation have be dishonour and the general liberty of europe have be betray a representation so distant from the truth that it can only be imputed to want of information this treaty of neutrality my lord be so far from be reproachful to this nation that it have no relation to it be make by he majesty not in the character of emperor of britain but elector of hanover nor be any thing stipulate by it but security of the dominion of hanover from the invasion of the french for a single year what part of this transaction my lord can be suppose to fall under the cognizance of this assembly or with what propriety can it be mention in we debate or produce a argument on either side that the dominion of britain and hanover be distinct and independent on each other have often be assert and assert with truth and i hope those who so studiously separate they interest on all other occasion will not now unite they only to reflect maliciously on the conduct of he majesty i do not indeed charge any lord with a design so malignant and unjust have already assert it as my opinion that these reproach be produce only by ignorance of the true state of the affair but can not with equal readiness allow that ignorance to be wholly blameless it be necessary my lord in common life to every man who would avoid contempt and ridicule to refrain from speak at least from speak with confidence on subject with which he have not make himself sufficiently acquaint this caution my lord be more necessary when he discourse tend to the accusation or reproach of another because he can then only escape contempt himself by bring it perhaps unjustly on he whom he condemn it be more necessary still to he who speak in the publick council of the nation and who may by false reflection injure the publick interest and be yet more indispensably require in he who assume the province of examine the conduct of he sovereign lord islay speak in substance as follow : -- ` my lord it appear that all those who have speak on either side of the present question however they may generally differ in they opinion agree at least in one assertion that the time which be spend in this debate might be far more usefully employ and that we in some degree desert the great cause of liberty by give way to trifling altercation this indeed be a argument of equal force for a concession on either side but as in affair of such importance no man ought to act in a manner contrary to the conviction of he own reason it can not be expect that we should be unanimous in we opinion or that the dispute should be determine otherwise than by the vote i have indeed hear no argument against the motion which require long consideration for little of what have be urge have in my opinion be very nearly connect with the question before we which be not whether the minister have pursue or neglect the interest of the nation whether the law have be violate or observe the war timorously or magnanimously conduct or we negotiation manage with dexterity or weakness but whether we shall offer to he majesty the address propose in this address my lord it have never yet be prove that any assertion be contain either false or uncertain in themselves or contrary to the dignity of this assembly that any act of cowardice or treachery any crime or any error will be secure by it from detection and from punishment that this my lord may appear more plainly i move that the motion may be read nor do i doubt but that the question will by a closer examination be speedily decide -lrb- the motion be again read in order to put the question -rrb- lord bathurst speak to the effect follow : -- my lord i know not why the noble lord should expect that by read the motion a more speedy determination of the question would be produce for if the repeated consideration of it operate upon the mind of the lord that have oppose it in the same manner as upon mine it will only confirm they opinion and strengthen they resolution we be require my lord to join in a address of thanks to he majesty for he endeavor to _ maintain _ the balance of power in a address that imply a falsehood open and indisputable and which will therefore only make we contemptible to we fellow-subjects we ally and we enemy what be mean my lord by the balance of power but such a distribution of dominion as may keep the sovereign power in mutual dread of each other and by consequence preserve peace such a equality of strength between one prince or one confederacy and another that the hazard of war shall be nearly equal on each side but which of you lordship will affirm that this be now the state of europe it be evident my lord that the french be far from imagine that there be now any power which can be put in the balance against they own and therefore distribute kingdom by caprice and exalt emperor upon they own term it be evident that the continuance of the balance of power be not now to be perceive by its natural consequence tranquillity and liberty the whole continent be now in confusion lay waste by the ravages of army subject to one sovereign to-day and to-morrow to another : there be scarcely any place where the calamity of war be not feel or expect and where property by consequence be not uncertain and life itself in continual danger one happy corner of the world indeed be to be find my lord secure from rapine and massacre for one year at least by a well-timed neutrality of which on what term it be obtain i would gladly hear and whether it be purchase at the expense of the honor of britain though the advantage of it be confine to hanover but as i be not of opinion my lord that the balance of power be preserve by the security of hanover or that those territory however important will be able to furnish force equivalent to the power of france i can not agree to promise in a address of this house to assist he majesty in _ maintain _ the balance of power though i shall cheerfully give my concurrence in every just and vigorous effort to _ restore _ it but as it may be urge that any direct expression of discontent may be too wide a deviation from the common form which for a long time have admit nothing but submission and adulation i shall only venture to propose that we may at least contract we address that if we do not in plain language declare all we sentiment we may however affirm nothing that we do not think and i be confident that all the praise which can be justly bestow on the late measure may be comprise in a very few word it have be insinuate that this change of we style may perhaps surprise he majesty and raise in he some suspicion of discontent and disapprobation that it may incline he to believe he measure either not understand by we or not applaud and divert he from he present scheme by the necessity of a inquiry into the reason of we dislike and for what other purpose my lord should such a change of we style be propose why should we deny on this occasion the encomiastick language which have be of late so profusely bestow but to show that we think this time too dangerous for flattery and the measure now pursue such as none but the most abject flatterer can commend i should hope that if it be ask by he majesty to what cause it be to be imputed that the address of this house be so much contract there would be find some amongst we honest enough to answer that all which can be say with truth be contain in it and that flattery and falsehood be not consistent with the dignity of the lord of britain i hope my lord some one amongst we would explain to he majesty the decency as well as the integrity of we conduct and inform he that we have hint we discontent in the most respectful manner and where there be sufficient room for the loudest censure have satisfy ourselves with modest silence with a mere negation of applause should we my lord in opposition to the complaint of we countryman to the representation of we ally and all the conviction which we reason can admit or we sens produce continue to act this farce of approbation what can he majesty conceive but that those measure which we applaud ought to be prosecute as the most effectual and safe and what consequence but total ruin can arise from the prosecution of measure by which we be already reduce to penury and contempt lord cholmondeley speak next to the follow purpose : -- my lord it be never without grief and wonder that i hear any suspicion insinuate of injustice or impropriety in he majesty 's measure of whose wisdom and goodness i have so much knowledge as to affirm with the utmost confidence that he be better acquaint than any lord in this assembly with the present state of europe so that he be more able to judge by what method tranquillity may be reestablish and that he pursue the best method with the utmost purity of intention and the most incessant diligence and application that the justest intention may be sometimes defeat and the wisest endeavor fail of success i shall readily grant but it will not follow that we ought not to acknowledge that wisdom and integrity which be exert in the prosecution of we interest or that we ought not to be grateful for the benefit which be sincerely intend though not actually receive the wisdom of he majesty 's counsel my lord be not sufficiently admire because the difficulty which he have to encounter be not know or not observe upon he majesty my lord lie the task of teach the power of the continent to prefer they real to they seeming interest and to disregard for the sake of distant happiness immediate acquisition and certain advantage he majesty be endeavor to unite in the support of the pragmatick sanction those power whose dominion will be enlarged by the violation of it and whom france bribe to she interest with the spoil of austrium and who can wonder that success be not easy in attempt like this in such measure we ought doubtless to endeavor to animate he majesty by a address at least not less expressive of duty and respect than those which he have be accustom to receive and therefore i shall concur with the noble lord who make and support the motion -lrb- the question on a division pass in the affirmative content 89 not content 43 -rrb- end of the project gutenberg ebook of the work of samuel johnson vol 10 by samuel johnson
