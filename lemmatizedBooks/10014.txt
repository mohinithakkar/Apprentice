certain supercilious consciousness that he be figure in a novel and that it will not do for he to thwart the eccentricity of mysterious fiction by any commonplace deference to the mere meteorological weakness of ordinary human nature do not allow the fact that late December be a rather bleak and cold time of year to deter he from take daily airing in the neighborhood of the ritualistic churchyard since the inscription of he epitaph on he late wife upon she monument therein the churchyard be to he a kind of ponderous work of imagination with marble leave to which he have contribute the most brilliant chapter and when he see any stranger hover about a part of the outer railing from whence the inscription may be read it be with all the swell pride of a author who have procure the publication of some dreary article in a magazine be throw into a ecstacy of vanity if he see but one person glance at that number of the periodical on a news-stand since he first meeting with mr bumstead on the evening of the epitaph-reading judge sweeney have cultivate that gentleman 's acquaintance and be receive at he lodgings several time with considerable cordiality and lemon-tea on such occasion mr bumstead in he musical capacity have sing so closely in judge sweeney 's ear as to tickle he a wild and slightly incoherent ritualistic stave to the effect that saint peter 's of rome with pontifical dome would by ballot infallible be but for make call sure and election secure saint repeater 's of rum beat the see with finger in ear to allay the tickle sensation judge sweeney declare that this young man smell of clove be a person of great intellectual attainment and understand the political genius of he country well enough to make a excellent judge of election walk slowly near the churchyard on this particular freezing December evening with he hand behind he bank and he eye intent for any envious husband who may be with a rush retire monumentally counsel after read the epitaph judge sweeney suddenly come upon father dean converse with smythe the sexton and mr bumstead bow to these three who like himself seem to find real luxury in open-air stroll on a bitter night in midwinter he notice that he model the ritual rector be wear a new hat like cardinal 's only black and be immediately lose in wonder where he can obtain one like it short of rome you look so much like a author mr bumstead in have no overcoat wear you paper collar upside down and carry a pen behind you ear father dean be say that i can almost fancy you be about to write a book about we well bumsteadville be just the place to furnish a nice dry inoffensive domestic novel in the sedative vein after two or three ineffectual effort to seize the end of it which he seem to think be a inch or two higher than its actual position mr bumstead finally withdraw from between he right ear and head a long and neatly cut hollow straw this be not a pen holy father he answer after a momentary glance of majestic severity at mr smythe who have laugh it be only a simple instrument which i use as a species of syphon in certain chemical experiment with slice tropical fruit and glass-ware in the precipitation of lemon-slice into cut crystal it be necessary for the liquid medium to be exhaust gradually and after use this cylinder of straw for the purpose about a hour ago i must have place it behind my ear in a moment of absent-mindedness ah i see say father dean although he do not but what be this judge sweeney respect you introduction of mclaughlin to mr bumstead which i have hear about why you reverence i consider john mclaughlin a character respond the judge and think we young friend of the organ-loft might like to study he the truth be explain mr bumstead that judge sweeney put into my head to do a few pauper grave with john mclaughlin some moonlight night for the mere oddity and dampness of the thing -- and i should regret to believe add mr bumstead raise he voice as saw that the judiciary be about to interrupt -- and i should really be loathe to believe that judge sweeney be not perfectly sober when he do so oh yes -- certainly -- i remember -- to be sure exclaim the judge in great haste alarm into speedy assent by the construction which he perceive would be put upon a denial i remember it very distinctly i remember put it into you head -- by the tumblerful if i remember rightly profit by you advice continue mr bumstead oblivious to the last sentence i be go out to-night in search of the moist and picturesque with john mclaughlin -- who be here say father dean old mortarity dinner-kettle in hand and more mortary than ever indeed see approach they with shuffling gait bow to the holy father he be about to pass on when judge sweeney stop he with -- you must be very careful with you friend bumstead this evening john mclaughlin and see that he do not fall and break he neck never you worry about mr bumstead judge growl old mortarity he can walk further off the perpendicklar without tumble than any gentleman i ever see of course i can john mclaughlin say mr bumstead check another unseemly laugh of mr smythe 's with a dreadful frown i often practice walk sideways for the purpose of develop the muscle on that side the left side be always the weaker and the hip a trifle lower if one do not counteract the difference by walk sideways occasionally a great deal of unnecessary cough which follow this physiological exposition cause mr bumstead to breathe hard at they all for a moment and tread with great malignity upon mr smythe 's nearest corn while yet the sexton be groan old mortarity whisper to the ritualistic organist that he will be ready for he at the appoint hour to-night and shuffle away after which mr bumstead with the i hollow straw stick out fiercely from he ear privately offer to see father dean home if he feel at all dizzy and be courteously refuse retire down the turnpike toward he own lodgings with military precision of step when night fall upon the earth like a drop of ink upon the word sun and the star glitter like the point of so many poise gold pen all ready to write the softer word moon above the blot the organist of st cow 's sit in he own room where he fire keeps-up a kind of aspenish twilight and execute upon he accordeon a series of wild and mutilate air the moistened towel which he often wear when at home be turban upon he head cause he to present a somewhat turkish appearance and as when turn a particularly complicated corner in a air it be he artistic habit to hold he tongue between he tooth twist he head in sympathy with the elaborate finger and involuntarily lift one foot higher and higher from the floor as some skittish note frantically dodge to evade he he general musical aspect at he own hearth be that of a partially oriental gentleman agonizingly labor to cast from he some furious animal full of strange sound thus engage in desperate single combat with what for make a ferocious fight before any recognizable tune can he rescue from it be perhaps the most exhausting instrument know to evening amateur and madden neighborhood mr bumstead pass three athletic hour at the end of that time after repeatedly tripping-up its exasperated organist over wrong key in the last bar the accordeon finally relinquish the conclude note with a dismal whine of despair and retire in complete collapse to its customary place of wait then the conquer performer change he towel for a hat which would look better if it have not be so often worn in bed place a antique black bottle in one pocket of he coat and a few clove in the other hang a unlighted lantern before he by a cord pass about he neck and with he umbrella under he arm go softly down stair and out of the house repair to the marble-yard and home of old mortarity which be on the outskirts of bumsteadville he wander through mortar-heap monument bring for repair and pile of brick toward a whitewashed residence of small demension with a light at the window john mclaughlin ahoy in response the master of the mansion promptly open the door and it be then perceptible that he basement parlor spare-bedroom and attic be all on one floor and that a couple of pig be spend the season with he show he visitor into this ingeniously condensed establishment he induce the pig to retire to a corner and then don he hat be you ready john mclaughlin please the pig i be mr bumstead answer mclaughlin take down from a hook a lantern which like he companion 's he hang from he neck by a cord my spirit be equal to any number of ghost to-night sir if we meet 'em spirit ejaculate the ritualistic organist shift he umbrella for a moment while he hurriedly draw the antique bottle from he pocket you be nervous to-night j mclaughlin and need a little of the venerable jame aker 's west indian restorative -- i 'll try it first to make sure that i have not mistake the phial he rest the elongate orifice of the diaphanous flask upon he lip for a brief interval of critical inspection and then apply it thoughtfully to the mouth of old mortarity some more some more plead the aged mclaughlin when the jamaican nervine be abruptly jerk from he lip silence com on be the stern response of the other who as he move from the house and restore the crystal antiquity to its proper pocket eat a few clove by stealth he manner plainly show that he be offend at the quantity the old man have manage to swallow already strange indeed be the ghastly expedition to the place of skull upon which these two go thus by night not strange perhaps for mr mclaughlin whose very youth in new york where he be a active politician find he a frequent nightly familiar of the tomb but strange for the organist who although often grave in he manner sepulchral in he tone and occasionally addict to coughin ' must be curiously eccentric to wish to pass into concert that evening with the dead head transfix by he umbrella which make he look like a walk cross between a pair of boot and a hat mr bumstead lead the way athwart the turnpike and several field until they have arrive at a low wall skirt the foot of gospeler 's gulch here they catch sight of the reverend octavius simpson and montgomery pendragon walk together near the former 's house in the moonlight and instantaneously mr bumstead open he umbrella over the head of old mortarity and drag he down beside himself under it behind the wall hallo what be all this gasp mr mclaughlin struggle affrightedly in he suffocating cage of whalebone and alpaca what be this here old lady 's hoop-skirt do on I peace wriggle dotard hiss bumstead jam the umbrella tighter over he if they see we they 'll want some of the west indian restorative mr simpson and montgomery have already hear a sound for they pause abruptly in they conversation and the latter ask : could it have be a ghost ask it if it be a ghost whisper the gospeler involuntarily cross himself be you there mr g quaver the raise voice of the young southerner respectfully address the inquiry to the stone wall no answer well mutter the gospeler it could not have be a ghost after all but i certainly think i see a umbrella to conclude what i be say then -- i have the confidence in you mr montgomery to believe that you will attend the dinner of reconciliation on christmas eve as you have promise depend on I sir i shall and have become surety for you punctuality to that excellent and unselfish healer of youthful wound mr bumstead more be say after this but the speaker have stroll to the other side of the gospeler 's house and they word can not be distinguish mr bumstead close he umbrella with such suddenness and violence as to nearly pull off the head of mclaughlin drive he own hat further upon he nose with a sound blow take several wild swallow from he antique flask eat two clove and chuckle hoarsely to himself for some minute here ` john mclaughlin he say at last try a little more west indian restorative

till you cuss in you vain attempt to prevent its take a shine to you the mosquito differ in most respects from all the larger variety of the winged tribe and upon the whole take after man more than any other live thing nevertheless it certainly bear a noticeable resemblance to some of the feathered race like the nightingale it sing darkling and like the woodpecker be much addict to tap the bark of limb and trunk for the purpose of obtain grub it may be mention as a amiable idiosyncracy of the mosquito that it be fond of baby if there be a child in the house it be sure to spot the playful innocent and by means of a ingenious contrivance combine the principle of the gimlet and the air-pump it soon relieve the little human bud of its superfluous juice it be in fact a bear surgeon a

habit of the mosquito in its undomesticated or nomad state may find it in angry cloud on the surface of the new jersey salt marsh at this season in company with its teeter long-billed congener the

tell you that it be on account of the admirable water-punch which john mcmakin serve up to be sure these mixture do not agree with mr p but he like to see people enjoy themselves even if he can not do it himself it be this unselfish disposition this love of he fellow-man that enable he to maintain that constant good humor so requisite to he call in fact though mr p often say sharp thing he never get angry when on Thursday of last week he be walk down the south side of jackson street and a man ask he do he want to buy a bag mr p be not enraged he know the man take he for a greenhorn but then the man himself be a jerseyman it be no shame to be a greenhorn to a jerseyman quite the reverse mr p would blush if he think there live a sand-spaniard who could not take advantage of he so mr p buy the bag and because it be make of very durable canvas and would last a great while he pay a dollar for it he do not ask what it be for he know it be to put cape may diamond in he put the bag in he pocket and walk along the beach for three mile you can not walk more than three mile here and if you hire a carriage you will find that you can not ride less than that distance which make it bad sometimes however when mr p have finish he three mile he do not want to go any further he stop and gaze carelessly around to see that no one notice he pull out he canvas bag and do shuffle a little in the sand with he foot he might find some diamond you know just as likely as any of the hundred of other people who in other sequestered part of the beach be pull out other canvas bag and shuffling in the sand with other foot at length mr p shuffle himself into a very sequestered nook indeed and there he see a man smoking he melancholy little boy be sit by he side perceive that it be only general grant mr p advance with he usual grace and suavity of manner why mr president say he i think you would be find at long branch this season long -- thunder ejaculate the general he face as black as the ace of spade -lrb- which by the way be blue -rrb- i might go to nova zemblum for a quiet smoke and some sneak politician would crawl out from the ice with a petition i go fishing in pennsylvanium and i find twenty of those fellow to every trout however i do not mind you take a seat and have a cigar -lrb- illustration -rrb- mr p take the seat -lrb- which be nothing to brag of -rrb- and a cigar -lrb- which would have be a great deal to brag of if he have succeed in smoking it -rrb- and after a whiff or two ask he companion how it be that he come to send such a message to congress about cuba what message say grant absently mr p explain oh say grant that one do not you like it caleb cushing write it and bring it to I and i sign it if you have write one and bring it to I i would have sign that ` tis not my fault if the thing 's wrong what would you expect of a man mr p conclude that in this case it be ridiculous to expect anything else and so he change the subject that afternoon mr p bath he go to sloan 's and fitted himself out in a bathing suit and very lovely he look in it when he emerge from the bathing house at high tide with a red tunic green pants and a very yellow hat he resemble a frog-legged garibaldian ready for the harvest when he hurry to the water 's edge he hesitate for a moment the roar surf be so full of head leg arm back-hair hat and foot that he fear there
