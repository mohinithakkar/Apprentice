-rrb- 1878 _ to sfa _ prefatory note after some deliberation and at the risk of offend the sensibility of scholar i have adopt the old english spelling of michael angelo 's name feeling that no orthographical accuracy can outweigh the association imply in that familiar title michael angelo have a place among the highest with homer and titian with virgil and petrarch with raphael and paul nor do i imagine that any alteration for the better would be effect by substitute for these time-honoured name homêros and tiziano vergilius and petrarca raffaello and paulus i wish here to express my heartiest thanks to signore pasquale villarus for valuable assistance kindly render in the interpretation of some difficult passage of campanellum and to signore v de tivoli for call my attention to the sonnet of michael angelo decipher by he on the back of a drawing in the taylor gallery at oxford portion both of the introduction and the translation form this volume have already appear in the ` contemporary review ' and the ` cornhill magazine ' davo platz : _ dec 1877 _ contents introduction proem michael angelo 's sonnet campanellum 's sonnet note to michael angelo 's sonnet note to campanellum 's sonnet appendix introduction i it be with diffidence that i offer a translation of michael angelo 's sonnet for the first time completely render into english rhyme and that i venture on a version of campanellum 's philosophical poem my excuse if i can plead any for so bold a attempt may be find in this -- that so far as i be aware no other english writer have deal with michael angelo 's verse since the publication of he autograph while campanellum 's sonnet have hitherto be almost utterly unknown something must be say to justify the issue of poem so dissimilar in a single volume michael angelo and campanellum represent widely sundered though almost contemporaneous moment in the evolution of the italian genius michael angelo be essentially a artist living in the prime of the renaissance campanellum be a philosopher bear when the counter-reformation be do all it could to blight the free thought of the sixteenth century and when the modern spirit of exact enquiry in a few philosophical martyr be open a new stage for european science the one devoted all he mental energy to the realisation of beauty : the other strove to ascertain truth the one clung to ficino 's dream of platonise christianity : the other construct for himself a new theology found on the conception of god immanent in nature michael angelo express the aspiration of a solitary life dedicate to the service of art at a time when art receive the suffrage and the admiration of all italy campanellum give utterance to a spirit exile and isolate misunderstand by those with whom he live at a moment when philosophy be hunt down as heresy and imprison as treason to the public weal the mark of this difference in the external and internal circumstance of the two poet might be multiply indefinitely yet they have much in common both stand above they age and in a sense aloof from it both approach poetry in the spirit of thinker bent upon extricate themselves from the triviality of contemporary literature the sonnet of both alike be contribution to philosophical poetry in a age when the italian have lose they ancient manliness and energy both be unite by the tie of study and affection to the greatest singer of they nation dante at a time when petrarch thrice dilute and emasculate be the phoebus of academy and coterie this common antagonism to the degenerate genius of italian literature be the link which bind michael angelo the veteran giant of the renaissance to campanellum the audacious titan of the modern age ii my translation of michael angelo 's sonnet have be make from signor cesare guastus 's edition of the autograph first give to the world in 1863 -lrb- 1 -rrb- this masterpiece of laborious and minute scholarship be base upon a collation of the various manuscript preserve in the casa buonarroti at florence with the vatican and other codex it adhere to the original orthography of michael angelo and omit no fragment of he indubitable composition -lrb- 2 -rrb- signor guastus preface the text he have so carefully prepare with a discourse upon the poetry of michael angelo and a description of the manuscript to the poem themselves he add a prose paraphrase and print upon the same page with each composition the version publish by michelangelo buonarrotus in 1623 -lrb- 3 -rrb- before the publication of this volume all study of michael angelo 's poetry all translation make of it and all hypothesis deduce from the sculptor 's verse in explanation of he theory or he practice as a artist be base upon the edition of 1623 it will not be superfluous to describe what that edition be and how its text differ from that now give to the light in order that the relation of my own english version to those which have precede it may be rightly understand -lrb- 4 -rrb- michael angelo seem to have entertain no thought of print he poem in he lifetime he distribute they freely among he friend of whom sebastiano del piombo luigi del riccio donato giannottus vittorium colonna and tommaso de ' cavalierus be in this respect the most favor in course of time some of these friend partly by the gift of the original and partly by obtain copy form more or less complete collection and it undoubtedly occur to more than one to publish they ascanio condivus at the close of he biography make this announcement : ' i hope ere long to make public some of he sonnet and madrigal which i have be long collect both from himself and other who possess they with a view to prove to the world the force of he inventive genius and the beauty of the thought produce by that divine spirit ' condivus 's promise be not fulfil with the exception of two or three piece print by vasarus and the extract quote by varchus in he ` lezione ' -lrb- 5 -rrb- the poem of michael angelo remain in manuscript for fifty-nine year after he death the most voluminous collection form part of the buonarrotus archive but a large quantity preserve by luigus del riccio and from he transfer to fulvio orsinus have pass into the vatican library when michelangelo the younger conceive the plan of publish he granduncle 's poetry michelangelo obtain leave to transcribe the vatican mss with he own hand and after take pain to collate all the autograph and copy in existence he set himself to compare they reading and to form a final text for publication here however begin what we may call the tragedy of he rifacimento the more he study he great ancestor 's verse the less he like or dare to edit they unaltered some of they express thought and sentiment offensive to the church in some the florentine patriot speak over-boldly other expose they author to misconstruction on the score of personal morality -lrb- 6 -rrb- all be ungrammatical rude in versification crabbed and obscure in thought -- the rough-hewn blockings-out of poem rather than finish work of art as it appear to the scrupulous decorous elegant and timorous academician of a feebler age while ponder these difficulty and compare the reading of he many manuscript the thought occur to michelangelo that between leave the poem unpublished and print they in all they rugged boldness lay the middle course of reduce they to smoothness of diction lucidity of meaning and propriety of sentiment -lrb- 7 -rrb- in other word he begin as signer guastus pithily describe he method ` to change half of line whole verse idea : if he find a fragment he complete it : if brevity involve the think in obscurity he amplify : if the obscurity seem incurable he amputate : for superabundant wealth of conception he substitute vacuity smooth asperity soften salient light ' the result be that a medley of garbled phrase addition alteration and sophistication be foist on the world as the veritable product of the mighty sculptor 's genius that michelangelo mean well to he illustrious ancestor be certain that he take the greatest pain in execute he ungrateful and disastrous task be no less clear -lrb- 8 -rrb- but the net result of he meddlesome benevolence have be that now for two century and a half the greatest genius of the italian renaissance have wear the ill-fitting disguise prepare for he by a literary ` breeches-maker ' in fact michael angelo the poet suffer no less from he grandnephew than michael angelo the fresco painter from he follower daniele da volterra nearly all michael angelo 's sonnet express personal feeling and by far the greater number of they be compose after he sixtieth year to whom they be address we only know in a few instance vittorium colonna and tommaso de ' cavalieri the two most intimate friend of he old age in rome receive from he some of the most pathetically beautiful of he love-poem but to suppose that either the one or the other be the object of more than a few well-authenticated sonnet would be hazardous nothing be more clear than that michael angelo worship beauty in the platonic spirit pass beyond its personal and specific manifestation to the universal and impersonal this thought be repeat over and over again in he poetry and if we bear in mind that he habitually regard the loveliness of man or woman as a sign and symbol of eternal and immutable beauty we shall feel it of less importance to discover who it be that prompt he to this or that poetic utterance that the love of he youth be not so tranquil as those of he old age appear not only from the regret express in he religious verse but also from one or two of the rare sonnet referable to he manhood the love of beauty the love of florence and the love of christ be the three main motive of he poetry this be not the place to discuss at length the nature of he philosophy he patriotism or he religion to enquire how far he retain the early teaching of ficino and savonarolum or to trace the influence of dante and the bible on he mind i may however refer my reader who be interested in these question to the discourse of signor guastus the learn essay of mr je taylor and the refined study of mr wh pater my own view will be find express in the third volume of my ` renaissance in italy ' and where i think it necessary i shall take occasion to repeat they in the note append to my translation iii michael angelo 's madrigal and sonnet be eagerly seek for during he lifetime they form the theme of learn academical discourse and win for he the poet 's crown in death upon he tomb the muse of song be carve in company with sculpture architecture and painting since the publication of the _ rifacimento _ in 1623 he verse have be use among the _ testus di lingua _ by italian and have be study in the three great language of europe the fate of campanellum 's philosophical poem have be very different it be owe to a fortunate chance that they survive they author and until the year 1834 they be wholly and entirely unknown in italy the history of they preservation be so curious that i can not refrain from give some account of it before proceed to sketch so much of campanellum 's life and doctrine as may be necessary for the understanding of he sonnet the poem be compose during campanellum 's imprisonment at naple and from internal evidence there be good reason to suppose that the greater part of they be write at interval in the first fourteen year of the twenty-five he pass in confinement -lrb- 9 -rrb- in the descriptive catalogue of he own work the philosopher mention seven book of sonnet and canzonus which he call ` le cantiche ' -lrb- 10 -rrb- whether any of these would have be print but for a mere accident be doubtful a german gentleman name tobium adamus who be suppose to have be a court-counsellor at weimar after travel through greece syrium and palestine in company with a young friend call rodolph von bunau visit campanellum in he dungeon a close intimacy spring up between they and adamus undertake to publish several work of the philosopher in testimony of he admiration among these be ` le cantiche ' instead however of print the poem _ in extenso _ he make a selection choose those apparently which take he fancy and which in he opinion throw most light on campanellum 's philosophical theory it be clear that he neglect the author 's own arrangement since there be no trace of the division into seven book what proportion the selection bear to the whole bulk of the m seem to I uncertain though the latest editor assert that it form only a seventh part -lrb- 11 -rrb- the manuscript itself be lose and adamus 's edition of the specimen be all that now remain as basis for the text of campanellum 's poem this first edition be badly print in germany on very bad paper without the name of press or place besides the poem it contain a brief prose commentary by the editor the value of which be still very great since we have the right to suppose that adamus 's explanation embody what he have receive by word of mouth from campanellum the little book bear this title : -- ` scelta d' alcune poesie filosofiche di settimontano squilla cavate da ' suo ' librus detti la cantica con l'esposizione stampato nell ' anno mdcxxii ' the pseudonym _ squillum _ be a pun upon campanellum 's name since both _ campana _ and _ squilla _ mean a bell while _ settimontano _ contain a quaint allusion to the fact that the philosopher 's skull be remarkable for seven protuberance -lrb- 12 -rrb- a very few copy of the unpretend little volume be print and none of these seem to have find they way into italy though it be possible that they have a certain circulation in germany at any rate there be reason to suppose that leibnitz be not unacquainted with the poem while herder in the renaissance of german literature publish free translation from a few of the sonnet in he ` adrastea ' to this circumstance we owe the reprint of 1834 publish at lugano by john gaspar orellus the celebrated zurich scholar early in he youth orellus be delighted with the german version make by herder and during he manhood while reside as protestant pastor at bergamo he use he utmost endeavor to procure a copy of the original in he preface to the reprint he tell we that these effort be wholly unsuccessful through a period of twenty-five year he apply to all he literary friend among whom he mention the ardent ugo foscolo and the learn mazzuchellus but none of these could help he he turn the page of crescimbenus quadrio gamba corniani tiraboschus weighty with enormous erudition -- and only those who make a special study of italian know how little have escape they scrutiny -- but find no mention of campanellum as a poet at last after the lapse of a quarter of a century he receive the long-coveted little quarto volume from wolfenbuttel in the north of germany the new edition which orellus give to the press at lugano have this title : -- ` poesie filosofiche di tommaso campanella pubblicate per la prima volta in italium da gio gaspare orellus professore all ' università di zurigo lugano 1834 ' the same text have be again reprint at turin in 1854 by alessandro d'ancona together with some of campanellum 's minor work and a essay on he life and writings this third edition profess to have improve orellus 's punctuation and to have rectify he reading but it still leave much to be desire on the score of careful editorship neither orellus nor d'ancona have do much to clear up the difficulty of the poem -- difficulty in many case obviously due to misprint and error of the first transcriber while in one or two instance they allow patent blunder to pass uncorrected in the sonnet entitle ' a dio ' -lrb- d'ancona vol i p 102 -rrb- for example _ bocca _ stand for _ buca _ in a place where sense and rhyme alike demand the restitution of the right word at no time could the book have hope for many reader least of all would it have find they among the italian of the seventeenth and eighteenth century to whom its energetic language and unfamiliar conception would have present insuperable difficulty between dante and alfierus no italian poet except michael angelo express so much deep thought and feeling in phrase so terse and with originality of style so daring and even michael angelo be monotonous in the range of he idea and uniform in he diction when compare with the indescribable violence and vigor of campanellum campanellum borrow little by way of simile or illustration from the outer world and he never fall into the commonplace of poetic phraseology he poem exhibit the exact opposite of the petrarchistic or the marinistic mannerism each sonnet seem to have be wrench alive and palpitating from the poet 's heart there be no smoothness no gradual unfold of a theme no rhetorical exposition no fanciful embroidery no sweetness of melodic cadence in he masculine art of poetry brusque rough violent in transition leap from the sublime to the ridiculous -- he poem owe they elevation to the intensity of they feel the nobleness and condensation of they think the energy and audacity of they expression they brevity sincerity and weight of sentiment campanellum have a essentially combative intellect he be both a poet and a philosopher militant he stand alone make war upon the authority of aristotle in science of machiavellus in state-craft and of petrarch in art take the fortress of phrase by storm and subdue the hardest material of philosophy to the tyranny of he rhyme plebeian saw salient image dry sentence of metaphysical speculation logical summary and fiery tirade be hurl together -- half crude and cindery scoria half molten metal and resplendent ore -- from the volcano of he passionate mind such be the nature of campanellum 's style when in addition it be remember that he text be sometimes hopelessly corrupt and he allusion obscure the difficulty offer by he sonnet to the translator will be readily conceive iv at the end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth century philosophy take a new point of departure among the italian and all the fundamental idea which have since form the staple of modern european system be anticipate by a few obscure thinker it be noticeable that the state of naple hitherto comparatively inert in the intellectual development of italy furnish the five writer who precede bacon leibnitz schelling and comte telesio of cosenza bruno of nolum campanellum of stilo vaninus and vico of naple be the chief among these _ novus homine _ or pioneer of modern think the characteristic point of this new philosophy be a unconditional return to nature as the source of knowledge combine with a belief in the intuitive force of the human reason : so that from the first it show two side or face to the world -- the one positive scientific critical and analytical the other mystical metaphysical subjective modern materialism and modern idealism be both contain in the audacious guess of bruno and campanellum nor have the time arrive for clearly separate the two strain of thought or for attempt a systematic synthesis of knowledge under one or the other head the man who lead this weighty intellectual movement burn with the passionate ardor of discoverer the fiery enthusiasm of confessor they stand alone sustained but little by intercourse among themselves and wholly misunderstand by the people round they italy sink in sloth priest-ridden tyrant-ridden exhaust with the unparalleled activity of the renaissance besot with the vice of slavery and slow corruption have no ear for spirit-thrilling prophecy the church terrify by the reformation when she chance to hear those strange voice sound through ` the bless mutter of the mass ' burn the prophet the state represent by absolute spain if it listen to they at all fling they into prison to both church and state there be peril in the new philosophy for the new philosophy be the first birth-cry of the modern genius with all the crudity and clearness the brutality and uncompromising sincerity of youth the church fear nature the state fear the people nature and the people -- those watchword of modern science and modern liberty -- be already on the lip of the philosopher it be a philosophy armed errant exile a philosophy in chain and solitary at war with society authority opinion self-sustained by the prescience of ultimate triumph and invincible through the sheer force of passionate conviction the man of whom i speak be conscious of pariahdom and eager to be martyr in the glorious cause ' a very proteus be the philosopher ' say pomponazzo : ` seek to penetrate the secret of god he be consume with ceaseless care he forget to thirst to hunger to sleep to eat he be deride of all man he be hold for a fool and irreligious person he be persecute by inquisitor he become a gazing-stock to the common folk these be the gain of the philosopher these be he guerdon pomponazzo 's word be prophetic of the five philosopher whom i mention vaninus be burn as a atheist bruno be burn and campanellum be imprison for a quarter of a century both bruno and campanellum be dominican friar bruno be persecute by the church and burn for heresy campanellum be persecute by both church and state and be imprison on the double charge of sedition and heresy _ dormitantium animarum excubitor _ be the self-given title of bruno _ nunquam tacebo _ be the favorite motto of campanellum giovannus domenico campanellum be bear in the year 1568 at stilo in calabrium one of the most southern township of all italy in he boyhood he show a remarkable faculty for acquire and retain knowledge together with no small dialectical ability he keen interest in philosophy and he admiration for the great dominican doctor thoma aquina and albertus magnus induce he at the age of fifteen to enter the order of s dominic exchange he secular name for tommaso but the old alliance between philosophy and orthodoxy draw up by scholasticism and approve by the mediaeval church have be succeed by mutual hostility and the youthful thinker find no favor in the cloister of cosenza where he now reside the new philosophy teach by telesio place itself in direct antagonism to the pseudo-aristotelian tenet of the theologian and found its own principle upon the interrogation of nature telesio say bacon be the prince of the _ novi homine _ or inaugurator of modern thought it be natural that campanellum should be draw towards this great man but the superior of he convent prevent he form the acquaintance of telesio and though the two man dwell in the same city of cosenza campanellum never know the teacher he admire so passionately only when the old man die and he body be expose in the church before burial do the neophyte of he philosophy approach the bier and pray beside it and place poem upon the dead from this time forward campanellum become a object of suspicion to he brethren they perceive that the fire of the new philosophy burn in he powerful nature with incalculable and explosive force he move restlessly from place to place learning and discuss draw man towards he by the magnetism of a noble personality and preach he new gospel with perilous audacity he papers be seize at bologna and at rome the holy inquisition condemn he to perpetual incarceration on the ground that he derive he science from the devil that he have write the book ` de tribus impostoribus ' that he be a follower of democritus and that he opposition to aristotle savor of gross heresy at the same time the spanish government of naple accuse he of have set on foot a dangerous conspiracy for overthrow the vice-regal power and establish a communistic commonwealth in southern italy though nothing be prove satisfactorily against he campanellum be hold a prisoner under the sentence which the inquisition have pronounce upon he he be in fact a man too dangerous too original in he opinion and too bold in they enunciation to be at large for twenty-five year he remain in neapolitan dungeon three time during that period he be tortured to the verge of die and at last he be release while quite a old man at the urgent request of the french court not many year after he liberation campanellum die the numerous philosophical work on metaphysics mathematics politics and aesthetics which campanella give to the press be compose during he long imprisonment how they come to be print i do not know but it be obvious that he can not have be strictly debar from write by he jailor in prison too he make both friend and convert we have see that we owe the publication of a portion of he poem to the visit of a german knight v the sonnet by campanellum translate in this volume might be rearrange under four heading -- philosophical political prophetic personal the philosophical group throw light on campanellum 's relation to he predecessor and he antagonism to the pseudo-aristotelian scholasticism of the middle age they furthermore explain he conception of the universe as a complex animated organism he conviction that true knowledge can only be gain by the interrogation of nature he doctrine of human life and action and he judgment of the age in which he live the political sonnet fall into two group -- those which discuss royalty nobility and the sovereignty of the people and those which treat of the several european state the prophetic sonnet seem to have be suggest by the misery and corruption of italy and express the poet 's belief in the speedy triumph of right and reason it be here too that he astrological opinion be most clearly manifest for campanellum be far from have outgrow the belief in planetary influence indeed he own metaphysical speculation involve the principle of immanent vitality in the material universe give a new value to the dream of the astrologer among the personal sonnet may be place those which refer immediately to he own suffering in prison to he friendship and to the ideal of the philosophic character i have think it best while indicate this fourfold division to preserve the order adopt by adamus since each of the reprint accessible to modern reader -- both that of orellus and that of d'ancona -- maintain the arrangement of the _ editio princep _ two sonnet of the prophetic group i have omit partly because they have no bearing on the world as it exist for we at present and partly because they be too studiously obscure for profitable reproduction -lrb- 13 -rrb- as in the case of michael angelo so also in that of campanellum i have leave the canzonus untouch except by way of illustration in the note append to my volume they be important and voluminous enough to form a separate book nor do they seem to I so well adapt as the sonnet for translation into english to give reason for my choice of certain reading in the case of either michael angelo 's or campanellum 's text to explain why i have sometimes prefer a strictly literal and sometimes a more paraphrastic rendering or to set forth my view in detail regard the compromise which be necessary in translation and which must vary accord to the exigency of each successive problem offer by the original would occupy too much space where i have think it absolutely necessary i have refer to such point in my note it be enough here to remark that the difficulty present to the translator by michael angelo and by campanellum be of different kind both indeed pack they thought so closely that it be not easy to reproduce they without either awkwardness or sacrifice of matter but while campanellum be difficult from the abruptness of he transition and the violence of he phrase michael angelo have the obscurity of a writer whose thought exceed he power of expression and who complicate the verbal form by he endeavor to project what can not easily be say in verse -lrb- 14 -rrb- a little patience will generally make it clear what campanellum mean except in case where the text itself be corrupt but it may sometimes be doubt whether michael angelo could himself have do more than indicate the general drift of he thought or have disengage he own conception from the tangled skein of elliptical and ungrammatical sentence in which he have envelop it the form of campanellum 's poetry though often grotesque be always clear michael angelo have leave too many of he composition in the same state as he marble -- unfinished and colossal _ abbozzus _ which lack the final touch to make they outline distinct under these circumstance it can hardly happen that the translator should succeed in reproduce all the sharpness and vivacity of campanellum 's style or should wholly refrain from soften simplify and prettify michael angelo in he attempt to produce a intelligible version in both case he be tempt to make he translation serve the purpose also of a commentary and have to exercise caution and self-control lest he impose a sense too narrow or too definite upon the original so far as this be possible i have adhere to the rhyming structure of my original feel that this be a point of no small moment in translation yet when the choice lay between a sacrifice of metrical exactitude and a sacrifice of sense i have not hesitate to prefer the former especially in deal with campanellum 's quatrain michael angelo and campanellum follow different rule in they treatment of the triplet michael angelo allow himself three rhyme while campanellum usually confines himself to two my practice have be to study in each sonnet the cadence both of thought and diction so as to satisfy a english ear accustom to the various form of termination exemplify by spenser milton wordsworth and rossettus -- the sweetest the most sublime the least artificial and the most artful sonnet-writer in we language the short title attach to each sonnet be intend to help the eye rather than to guide the understanding of the reader michael angelo and he editor supply no argument or motto for he poem while those print by adamus in he edition of campanellum be like mine mean obviously to serve as signpost to the student it may savor of impudence to ticket and to label little masterpiece each one of which like all good poem be a microcosm of very varied meaning yet i have some authority in modern time for this impertinence and when it be acknowledge that the title merely profess to guide the reader through a labyrinth of abstract and reflective composition without attempt to supply he with a comprehensive argument or to dogmatise concern the main drift of each poem i trust that enough will have be say by way of self-defence against the charge of arrogance the sonnet prefix as a proem to the whole book be generally attribute to giordano bruno in whose dialogue on the _ eroicus furorus _ it occur there seem however good reason to suppose that it be really write by tansillo who recite it in that dialogue whoever may have be its author it express in noble and impassioned verse the sense of danger the audacity and the exultation of those pioneer of modern thought for whom philosophy be a voyage of discovery into untravelled region its spirit be rather that of campanellum than of michael angelo yet the elevation at which michael angelo habitually live in thought and feeling be so far above the plain of common life that from the summit of he solitary watch-tower he might have follow even such high-flier as bruno or as campanellum in they icarian excursion with the eye of speculative interest davo platz _ nov 1877 _ footnote -lrb- 1 -rrb- ` le rime di michelangelo buonarroti pittore scultore e architetto cavate dagli autografi e pubblicate da cesare guastus accademico dellum crusca in firenze per felice le monmer mdccclxiii ' -lrb- 2 -rrb- see however page xlvii of signor guastus 's _ discorso _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- i have so fully express my admiration for signor guastus 's edition in the text that i may allow myself to point out in a note what seem to I its chief defect and why i think there be still perhaps room for another and more critical edition the material be amply and conscientiously supply by signor guastus indeed i suppose we be justified in believe that he single volume reproduce all the extant manuscript authority with the exception perhaps of the british museum codex but while it be so comprehensive we be still leave in some doubt as to the preference of one reading rather than another in the large type text present to we as the final version of each composition it be true that when this be possible signor guastus invariably select one of the autograph that be a copy in the poet 's own handwriting but when we consider that very frequently michael angelo 's own autograph give twice as many various reading as there be line in a sonnet when we reflect that we do not always possess the copy which he finally address to he friend and when moreover we find that they reading -lrb- _ eg _ those of the riccio m and those cite by varchus -rrb- differ considerably from michael angelo 's rough copy we must conclude that even the autograph do not invariably represent these poem in the final form which he adopt there be therefore much room leave for critical comparison and selection we be in fact still somewhat in the same position as michelangelo the younger whether any application of the critical method will enable we to do again successfully what he so clumsily attempt -- that be to reproduce a correct text from the _ debris _ offer to we selective faculty -- i do not feel sure meanwhile i be quite certain that he principle be a wrong one and that he deal most unjustifiably with he material for this reason i cordially accept signor guastus 's labor with the reservation i have attempt to express in this note they have indeed bring we far closer to michael angelo 's real text but we must be careful to remember that we have not even now arrive with certainty at what he would himself have print if he have prepare he own edition for the press -lrb- 4 -rrb- as far as i be aware no complete translation

have greater literary merit -- the merit of mere smoothness clearness grammatical coherence and intelligibility -- than the autograph and i can understand the preference of some student for the former

ill during the summer of 1544 and be nurse by luigus del riccio in he own house shortly after he recovery he quarrel with he friend and write he this sonnet as well as a very angry letter viii p 38 cecchino braccus be a boy of rare and surpassing beauty who die at rome January 8 1544 in he seventeenth year besides this sonnet which refer to a portrait luigus del riccio have ask he to make of the dead youth michael angelo compose a series of forty-eight quatrain upon the same subject and send they to he friend luigus michelangelo the younger thinking that _ ` l'ignoranzia degli uomini ha campo di mormorare ' _ suppress the name cecchino and change _ luus _ into _ lei _ date about 1544 ix line 4 : ` the archangel 's scale alone can weigh my gratitude against you gift ' line 5-8 : ` you

prove that it be address to vittorium colonna varchus call it ' _ un suo altissimo sonetto pieno di quella antica purezza e dantesca gravità _ ' xvi the thought of the fifteenth be repeat with some variation he lady 's heart hold for the lover good and evil thing accord as he have the art to draw they forth xviii in the terzet he describe the temptation of the artist-nature over-sensitive to beauty michelangelo the younger so altered these six line as to destroy the autobiographical allusion -- cp no xxviii note xix the lover 's heart be like a intaglio precious by be inscribe with he lady 's image xx a early composition write on the back of a letter send to the sculptor in bologna by he brother simone in 1507 ma be then work at the bronze statue of julius ii who the lady of he love be we do not know notice the absence of platonic _ concettus _ xxiii it be hardly necessary to call attention to michael angelo 's oft-recurring platonism the thought that the eye alone perceive the celestial beauty veil beneath the fleshly form of the beloved be repeat in many sonnet -- especially in xxv xxviii xxiv compose probably in the year 1529 xxv write on the same sheet as the foregoing sonnet and compose probably in the same year the thought be this : beauty pass from the lady into the lover 's soul be there spiritualise and become the object of a spiritual love xxvii to escape from he lady either by interpose another image of beauty between the thought of she and he heart or by flight be impossible xxviii compare madrigal vii in illustration of line 5 to 8 by the

_ conjecture that it be compose for tommaso cavalierus xxxi varchus assert without qualification that this sonnet be address to tommaso cavalierus the pun in the last line _ resto prigion d'un

forget that gold can not strike a spark from stone xxxv line 9 have the word _ signor _ it be almost certain that where ma use this word without further qualification in a love sonnet he mean he mistress i have sometimes translate it ` heart 's lord ' or ` love lord ' because i do not wish to merge the quaintness of this ancient tuscan usage in the more commonplace ` lady ' xxxvi line 3 : _ the lord etc _ this again be the poet 's mistress the drift of the sonnet be this : he soul can find no expression but through speech and speech be too gross to utter the purity of he feel he mistress again receive he tongue 's message with she ear and thus there be a element of sensuality false and alien to he intention both in he complaint and in she acceptation of it the last line be a version of the proverb : _ chus è avvezzo a dir bugie non crede a nessuno _ xxxvii at the foot of the sonnet be write _ mandato _ the two last line play on the word _ signor _ and _ signorium _ to whom it be send we do not know for certain but we may conjecture vittorium colonna xxxix the paper on which this sonnet be write have a memorandum with the date January 6 1529 ` on my return from venice i

score of reject or various reading for single line in the mss the platonic doctrine of anamnesis probably supply the key to the thought which the poet attempt to work out xli xlii xliii xliv there be nothing to prove that these four sonnet on night be compose in sequence on the contrary the personal tone of xli seem to separate this from the other three xliv may be accept as a palinode for xliii xlv xlvi both sonnet deal half humorously with a thought very prominent in ma 's composition -- the effect of love on one who be old in year cp xlviii l xlvii the platonic conception that the pure form of beauty or of truth if see would be overwhelming in its brilliancy xlix the _ dolcie pianto _ and _ eterna pace _ be the tear and peace of piety the _ doloroso riso _ and _ corta pace _ be the
