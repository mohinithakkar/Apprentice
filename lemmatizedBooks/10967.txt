four week in the trench by fritz kreisler to my dear wife harriet the best friend add stanchest comrade in all circumstance of life i dedicate this little book in humble token of everlasting gratitude and devotion preface this brief record of the fighting on the eastern front in the great war be the outcome of a fortunate meeting the writer chance to be dine with mr kreisler soon after he arrival in this country after he dismissal from the hospital where he recover from he wound for nearly two hour he listen thrill and move to the great violinist 's modest vivid narrative of he experience and adventure it seem in the highest degree desirable that the american public should have a opportunity of read this narrative from the pen of one in whose art so many of we take a profound interest it also be apparent that since so little of a authentic nature have be hear from the russo-austrian field of warfare this story would prove a important contribution to the contemporary history of the war after much persuasion mr kreisler reluctantly accede to the suggestion that he write out he personal memory of the war for publication he have complete he narrative in the midst of grave difficulty write it piecemeal in hotel and railway train in the course of a concert tour through the country it be offer by the publisher to the public with confidence that it will be find one of the most absorbing and inform narrative of the war that have yet appear f g four week in the trench i in try to recall my impression during my short war duty as a officer in the austrian army i find that my recollection of this period be very uneven and confuse some of the experience stand out with absolute clearness other however be blur two or three event which take place in different locality seem merge into one while in other instance recollection of the chronological order of thing be miss this curious indifference of the memory to value of time and space may be due to the extraordinary physical and mental stress under which the impression i be try to chronicle be receive the same state of mind i find be rather characteristic of most people i have meet who be in the war it should not be forget too that the gigantic upheaval which change the fundamental condition of life overnight and threaten the very existence of nation naturally dwarf the individual into nothingness and the exist interest in the common welfare leave practically no room for personal consideration then again at the front the extreme uncertainty of the morrow tend to lessen the interest in the detail of to-day consequently i may have miss a great many interesting happening alongside of I which i would have want to note under other circumstance one get into a strange psychological almost hypnotic state of mind while on the firing line which probably prevent the mind 's eye from observe and notice thing in a normal way this account perhaps for some blank space in my memory besides i go out completely resign to my fate without much thought for the future it never occur to I that i might ever want to write my experience and consequently i fail to take note or to establish certain mnemo-technical landmark by the aid of which i might now be able to reconstruct all detail i be therefore reduce to present a incoherent and rather piecemeal narrative of such episode as forcibly impressed themselves upon my mind and leave a ineradicable mark upon my memory the outbreak of the war find my wife and I in switzerland where we be take a cure on the 31st of July on open the paper i read that the third army corps to which my regiment -lrb- which be station in graz -rrb- belong have receive a order for mobilization although i have resign my commission as a officer two year before i immediately leave switzerland accompany by my wife in order to report for duty as it happen a wire reach I a day later call I to the color we go by way of munich it be the first day of the declaration of the state of war in germany intense excitement prevail in munich all traffic be stop no train be run except for military purpose it be only due to the fact that i reveal my intention of rejoin my regiment in austrium that i be able to pass through at all but by both the civil and military authority in bavarium i be show the greatest possible consideration and pass through as soon as possible we reach vienna on August first a startling change have come over the city since i have leave it only a few week before feverish activity everywhere prevail reservist stream in by thousand from all part of the country to report at headquarters auto fill with officer whiz past dense crowd surge up and down the street bulletin and extra edition of newspaper pass from hand to hand immediately it be evident what a great leveler war be difference in rank and social distinction have practically cease all barrier seem to have fall everybody address everybody else i see the crowd stop officer of high rank and well-known member of the aristocracy and clergy also state official and court functionary of high rank in quest of information which be impart cheerfully and patiently the imperial prince could frequently be see on the ring strasse surround by cheer crowd or mingle with the public unceremoniously at the cafe talk to everybody of course the army be idolize wherever the troops march the public break into cheer and every uniform be the center of a ovation while come from the station i see two young reservist to all appearance brother as they hurry to the barracks carry they small belongings in a valise along with they walk a little old lady cry presumably they mother they pass a general in full uniform up go they hand to they cap in military salute whereupon the old general throw he arm wide open and embrace they both say : go on my boy do you duty bravely and stand firm for you emperor and you country god willing you will come back to you old mother the old lady smile through she tear a shout go up and the crowd surround the general cheer he long after i have leave i could hear they shout a few street farther on i saw in a open cafe a young couple a reservist in field uniform and a young girl he bride or sweetheart they sit there hand link utterly oblivious of they surroundings and of the world at large when somebody in the crowd espy they a great shout go up the public rush to the table and surround they then break into applause and wave hat and handkerchief at first the young couple seem to be utterly take aback and only slowly do they realize that the ovation be mean for they they seem confuse the young girl blush and hide she face in she hand the young man rise to he foot salute and bow more cheer and applause he open he mouth as if want to speak there be a sudden silence he be vainly struggle for expression but then he face light up as if by inspiration standing erect hand at he cap in a pose of military salute he intone the austrian national hymn in a second every head in that throng be bare all traffic suddenly stop everybody passenger as well as conductor of the car join in the anthem the neighbor window soon fill with people and soon it be a chorus of thousand of voice the volume of tone and the intensity of feeling seem to raise the inspiring anthem to the uttermost height of sublime majesty we be then on we way to the station and long afterwards we could hear the singing swell like a human organ what impress I particularly in vienna be the strict order everywhere no mob disturbance of any kind in spite of the greatly increase liberty and relaxation of police regulation nor be there any runaway chauvinism noticeable aside from the occasional singing of patriotic song and demonstration like the one i just describe the keynote of popular feeling be quiet dignity join to determination with a undercurrent of solemn gravity and responsibility i have stop in vienna only long enough to bid good-bye to my father and leave for the headquarters of my regiment in graz i report there for duty and then go to join the fourth battalion which be station at leoben one hour away from graz my order be to take command of the first platoon in the sixteenth company my platoon consist of fifty-five man two bugler and a ambulance patrol of four in leoben my wife and i remain a week which be spend in organize equip requisition recruiting and preliminary drilling these be happy day as we officer meet for the first time friendship and bond be seal which subsequently be test in common danger and amidst privation and stress many of the officer have bring they wife and soon delightful intercourse utterly free from formality develop without any regard or reference to rank wealth or station in private life among the reserve officer of my battalion be a famous sculptor a well-known philologist two university professor -lrb- one of mathematics the other of natural science -rrb- a prince and a civil engineer at the head of one of the largest austrian steel corporation the surgeon of we battalion be the head of a great medical institution and a man of international fame among my man in the platoon be a painter two college professor a singer of repute a banker and a post official of high rank but nobody care and in fact i myself do not know until much later what distinguish man be in my platoon a great cloak of brotherhood seem to have envelop everybody and everything even difference in military rank not be so obvious at this time for the officer make friend of they man and in turn be worship by they my wife volunteer she service as red cross nurse insist upon be send to the front in order to be as near I as could be but it develop later that no nurse be allow to go farther than the large troop hospital far in the rear of the actual operation upon my urgent appeal she desist and remain in vienna after i have leave nursing in the barracks which be now use for hospital work in fact almost every third or fourth house both private and public as well as school be give to the use of the government and convert into red cross station the happy day in leoben come to a abrupt end my regiment receive order to start immediately for the front we proceed to graz where we join the other three battalion and be entrain for a unknown destination we travel via budapest to galicium and leave the train at strij a very important railroad center south of lemberg it must be understand that the only report reach we from the fight line at that time be to the effect that the russian have be drive back from we border and that the austrian army actually stand on the enemy 's soil strij be hundred of mile away from the russian frontier we could not but surmise that we be go to be station there some time for the purpose of training and maneuvering this belief be strengthen by the fact that we regiment belong to the landsturm or second line of reserve originally intend for home service we be however alarm that very same night and march out of strij for a distance of about twenty mile in conjunction with the entire third army corps after a short pause for the purpose of eating and feed the horse we march another twenty-two mile this first day 's march constitute a very strong test of endurance in consequence of we comparative softness and lack of training especially as in addition to he heavy rifle bayonet ammunition and spade each soldier be burden with a knapsack contain emergency provision in the form of tinned meat coffee extract sugar salt rice and biscuit together with various tin cooking and eat utensil furthermore a second pair of shoe extra blouse change of underwear etc on top of this heavy pack a winter overcoat and part of a tent be strap the entire weight of the equipment be in the neighborhood of fifty pound the day wear on sign of fatigue soon manifest themselves more and more strongly and slowly the man drop out one by one from sheer exhaustion no murmur of complaint however would be hear most of those who fall out of line after take a breathing space for a few minute stagger on again the few that remain behind join the regiment later on when camp be establish we wonder then at the necessity of such a forced march be unable to see a reason for it unless it be to put we in training night have fall when we reach a small monastery in the midst of a forest where the peaceful surroundings and the monastic life entirely untouched by the war fever seem strange indeed camp be establish tent erect fire be light and coffee make soon a life of bustling activity spring up in the wilderness in the midst of the forest which only a few hour before have be desert it make a weird and impressive picture in the wonderful starlight night these soldier sit around the camp fire softly singing in chorus the fantastic outline of the monastery half hide in the wood the dark figure of the monk move silently back and forth amongst the shadow of the tree as they bring refreshment to the troops the red glow of the camp fire illuminate the eager and enthusiastic face of the young officer group around the colonel the snort and stamp of the horse nearby a occasional melodic outcry of a sentinel out in the night all these thing merge into a unforgettable scene of great romanticism and beauty that night i lay for a long while stretch near the smolder ash of the camp fire with my cape as a blanket in a state of lassitude and somnolence my soul fill with exaltation and happiness over the beauty around I the rest however be of very short duration for at six o'clock in the morning we be arouse camp be break up and soon afterwards we start on a forced march of twenty-two mile without a halt during which we twice have to wade knee-deep through river by midday most of the man be so exhaust that they could hardly crawl along it be remarkable that the comparatively weaker and more refined city-bred people who have do little physical work in they life most of they be professional man withstand hardship better than the sturdy and to all appearance stronger peasant the only explanation for it be perhaps that the city-bred people in consequence of they better surroundings and by reason of they education have more will power and nervous strength than the peasant at half-past two we reach a clearing in the midst of a wood through which a river flow here camp be again establish and a half hour later all the hardship of the march be once more forget in the bustle of camp life this time we have a full rest until the next morning at four o'clock when suddenly order for march be give after we have be under way for about three hour we hear far-away repeat rumble which sound like distant thunder not for a moment do we associate it with cannonade be as we suppose hundred of mile away from the nearest place where russian could possibly be suddenly a mount ordnance officer come rush with a message to we colonel we come to a halt and all officer be summon to the colonel who address we in he usual quiet almost businesslike way say : gentleman accept my congratulation i have good news for you we may meet the enemy to-day and i sincerely hope to lead you to the fight before evening we be thunderstruck at the sudden realization that the russian have penetrate so deeply into galicium the despondency which follow this startling revelation however be quickly replace by the intense excitement of meet the enemy so soon we hurry back to we company impart the news to the man who break forth into shout of enthusiasm all the fatigue so plainly noticeable only a few minute before suddenly vanish as if by magic and every one seem alert springy and full of spirit we energetically resume the march in the direction of the distant rumble which indicate that the artillery of we advance guard have engage the enemy my regiment then be part of the main body of a division a second division advance on the road parallel to ours about a mile and a quarter to we left both column belong to the third army corps and keep up constant communication with each other through mount dispatch bearer and motor cycle the cannonading have meanwhile come perceptibly nearer and in the midst of the dense forest we again come to a short halt order be give to load rifle and upon emerge from the wood we fall into open formation the man march abreast the company at a distance of three hundred yard with the battalion at a distance of about a thousand yard we be slowly enter the range of the russian artillery about a mile ahead we could see number of harmless look round cloud look like ringlet of smoke from a huge cigar indicate the place where shrapnel have explode in mid-air we man not be familiar with the spectacle take no notice of it but we officer know its significance and i daresay many a heart beat as wildly as mine do we march on until the command be give for we to deploy and soon afterwards the first shrapnel whiz over we head it do no harm nor do the second and third but the fourth hit three man in the battalion in the rear of we we forward movement however be not interrupted and we do not see or hear anything beyond two or three startle cry the next shell burst right ahead of we send a shower of bullet and steel fragment around a man about twenty yard to the right of my company but not of my platoon leap into the air with a agonizing cry and fall in a heap mortally wound as we be advance very swiftly i only see it as in a dream while run by then come in rapid succession four or five terrific explosion right over we head and i feel a sudden gust of cold wind strike my cheek as a big shell fragment come howl through the air plough the ground viciously as it strike and send a spray of sand around we run on perhaps a quarter of a mile when from the rear come the sharp command down and the next second we lay on the ground panting and exhaust my heart almost burst with the exertion simultaneously the whizzing of a motor above we head could be hear and we know why the enemy 's shrapnel have so suddenly find we it be a russian aeroplane which presumably have signal we approach together with the range to the russian gunner and now be probably direct they fire and closely watch its effect for a chain of hill be hide we from the view of the enemy who consequently have to fire indirectly the air craft hover above we head but we be forbid to fire at it the extremely difficult almost vertical aim promising little success aside from the danger of we bullet fall back among we we reserve in the rear have apparently sight the air craft too for soon we hear a volley of rifle fire from that direction and simultaneously the aeroplane arise and disappear in the cloud just then we own artillery come thunder up occupy a little hill in the rear and open fire on the enemy the moral effect of the thundering of one 's own artillery be most extraordinary and many of we think that we have never hear any more welcome sound than the deep roaring and crash that start in at we rear it quickly help to disperse the nervousness cause by the first enter into battle and to restore self control and confidence besides by get into action we artillery be now focus the attention and draw the fire of the russian gun for most of the latter 's shell whine harmlessly above we be aim at the battery in we rear considerably relieve by this diversion we resume we forward movement after about fifteen minute of further rest we goal be the little chain of hill which we advance guard have previously occupy pend we arrival here we be order to take up position and dig trench any further advance be out of the question as the russian artillery overlook and command the entire plain stretch in front of we we start at once to dig we trench half of my platoon step forward abreast the man be place a arm 's length apart after lay they rifle down barrel point to the enemy a line be draw behind the row of rifle and parallel to it then each man would dig up the ground start from he part of the line backwards throw forward the earth remove until it form a sort of breastwork the second half of the platoon be meanwhile rest in the rear rifle in hand and ready for action after a half hour they take the place of the first division at work and vice versa within a hour work on the trench be so far advance that they could be deepen while stand in they such a open trench afford sufficient shelter against rifle bullet strike from the front and can be make in a measure shell proof by be cover with board if at hand and with sod in the western area of the theater of war in france and flander where whole army be deadlock face each other for week without shift they position a inch such trench become a elaborate affair with extensive underground working and wing connection of line which almost constitute little fortress and afford a certain measure of comfort but where we be in galicium at the beginning of the war with condition utterly unsteady and position shift daily and hourly only the most superficial trench be use in fact we think ourselves fortunate if we could requisition enough straw to cover the bottom that afternoon we have about half finish we work when we friend the aeroplane appear on the horizon again this time we immediately open fire it disappear but apparently have see enough for very soon we position be shell by this time however shrapnel have almost cease to be a source of concern to we and we scarcely pay any attention to it human nerve quickly get accustom to the most unusual condition and circumstance and i notice that quite a number of man actually fall asleep from sheer exhaustion in the trench in spite of the roaring of the cannon about we and the whizzing of shrapnel over we head i too soon get accustom to the deadly missile -- in fact i have already start to make observation of they peculiarity my ear accustom to differentiate sound of all kind have some time ago while we still advance note a remarkable discrepancy in the peculiar whine produce by the different shell in they rapid flight through the air as they pass over we head some sound shrill with a rise tendency and the other rather dull with a fall cadence a short observation reveal the fact that the passing of a dull-sounding shell be invariably precede by a flash from one of we own cannon in the rear on the hill which conclusively prove it to be a austrian shell it must be understand that as we be advance between the position of the austrian and russian artillery both kind of shell be pass over we head as we advance the difference between shrill and dull shell grow less and less perceptible until i could hardly tell they apart upon near the hill the difference increase again more and more until on the hill itself it be very marked after we trench be finish i crawl to the top of the hill until i could make out the flash of the russian gun on the opposite height and by time flash and actual passing of the shell find to my astonishment that now the russian missile have become dull while on the other hand the shrill shell be invariably herald by a flash from one of we gun now far in the rear what have happen be this : every shell describe in its course a parabolic line with the first half of the curve ascend and the second one descend apparently in the first half of its curve that be its course while ascend the shell produce a dull whine accompany by a fall cadence which change to a rise shrill as soon as the acme have be reach and the curve point downward again the acme for both kind of shell naturally be exactly the half distance between the russian and austrian artillery and this be the point where i have notice that the difference be the least marked a few day later in talk over my observation with a artillery officer i be tell the fact be know that the shell sound different go up than when come down but this knowledge be not use for practical purpose when i tell he that i could actually determine by the sound the exact place where a shell come from the oppose battery be reach its acme he think that this would be of great value in a case where the position of the oppose battery be hide and thus could be located he apparently speak to he commander about I for a few day later i be send on a reconnoitering tour with the object of mark on the map the exact spot where i think the hostile shell be reach they acme and it be later on report to I that i have succeed in give to we battery the almost exact range of the russian gun i have go into this matter at some length because it be the only instance where my musical ear be of value during my service to return to my narrative the loss which my battalion suffer that day seem extraordinarily small when compare with the accuracy of the russian artillery 's aim and the number of missile they fire i count seventy-four shrapnel that burst in a circle of half a mile around we in about two hour and yet we have no more than about eighteen casualty the most difficult part be to lie still and motionless while death be be deal all about we and it be then and there that i have my first experience of see death next to I a soldier of my platoon while digging in the trench suddenly lean back begin to cough like a old man a little blood break from he lip and he crumple together in a heap and lay quite still i could not realize that this be the end for he eye be wide open and he face wear the stamp of complete serenity apparently he have not suffer at all the man have be a favorite with all he fellow by reason of he good humor and that he be now stretch out dead seem unbelievable i see a great many man die afterwards some suffer horribly but i do not recall any death that affect I quite so much as that of this first victim in my platoon ii the artillery duel die out with the come of darkness and we settle down to rest half of the man take watch while the other sleep at five o'clock in the morning we regiment suddenly receive the order to fall in and together with two other regiment be draw out of the fight line we commanding general have receive news that a isolate detachment on the extreme right wing of we army about fifteen mile east of we have be entirely surround by a strong russian body and we be order to relieve they it must not be forget that we man have be under a most incredible strain for the last three day with barely any rest during the night and not more than one meal a day they have actually welcome enter the firing line as a relief from the fatigue of march with they heavy burden it be curious how indifferent one become to danger if one 's organism be wear down and brain and faculty of perception numb by physical exertion it be therefore with badly broken-down strength that we start on this relief expedition and it be good to see how unflinchingly the soldier undertake they unexpected new task all we have to say to we man be : boy you brother be need you they be cut off from all possible relief unless you bring it they life be at stake and as they be defend one of the most strategically important point -- the right wing of we army -- you can turn the tide of the whole battle in we favor so go on and on they go staggering and stumbling and at the end of a few hour almost crawl but ever forward suddenly we come up with another regiment which have be call to the same task and the colonel of the new regiment be older in rank than we colonel take command of the newly form brigade of two regiment my company happen to march at the head of the regiment and the new brigadier ride for some time alongside of I i be deeply impress by he firm military and yet unassuming bearing and he deep glowing enthusiasm for he army and he man he tell I with pride that two of he son be serve in the army too one as a artillery officer and the other one as a officer with the sapper we be then approach the point where we could hear distinctly the fire of we own battery and the answer from the russian and here and there a volley of rifle fire we colonel urge we on to renew energy and knowledge that we be near we goal seem to give new strength to we man already we be witness evidence of the first fight that have pass here for wound man constantly pass we on stretcher suddenly i see the face of the colonel ride next to I light up with excitement as a wounded man be bear past he address a few word to the stretcher-bearer and then turn to I say : the regiment of my son be fight on the hill it be one of they man they have bring by he urge we on again and it seem to I as if i notice -- or be it my imagination -- a new note of appeal in he face suddenly another stretcher be bring past the colonel at my side jump from he horse cry out my boy and a feeble voice answer father we all stop as if a command have be give to look at the young officer who lay on the stretcher he eye all aglow with enthusiasm and joy unmindful of he own wound as he cry out father how splendid that the relief should just come from you goon we hold out splendidly all we need be ammunition and a little moral support go on do not stop for I i be all right the old colonel stand like a statue of bronze he face have become suddenly ashen gray he look at the doctor and try to catch he expression the doctor seem grave but the young man urge we on say go on go on i 'll be all right to-morrow the whole incident have not last more than five minute barely longer than it take to write it the colonel mount he horse sternly command we to march forward but the light have die out of he eye within the next ten minute a hail of shrapnel be greet we but hardly any one of we be conscious of it so terribly and deeply be we affect by the scene of tragedy that have just be enact before we i remember foolishly mumble something to the silent man ride next to I something about the power of recuperation of youth about the comparative harmlessness of the pointed steelmantled rifle bullet which on account of they terrific percussion make small clean wound and rarely cause splintering of the bone or blood poisoning i remember say that i have quite a medical knowledge and that it seem to I that he son be not mortally wound but he know better he never say a word only a few minute later he be my only hope and i can not express how ominous that word be sound to I but just then the command to deploy be give and the excitement that follow drown for the time be all melancholy thought we quickly ascend the hill where the isolate detachment of austrian have keep the russian at bay for fully twenty-four hour and open fire on the enemy while the second regiment try to turn he left flank the russian slowly fall back but we follow they and a sort of run fight ensue during which my regiment lose about fifty -- dead and wound the russian temporarily resist again but soon the pressure from we other regiment on they flank begin to be feel and they flee rather disorderly leave two machine gun some ammunition and four carriage full of provision in we hand while the regiment which have execute the flanking movement take two hundred and forty prisoner around eight o'clock at night the fight be stop for want of light and we take up we newly acquire position entrench they well and begin to make ready for the night order for outpost duty be give and the officer be again call to the brigadier - colonel who in a few word outline the situation to we thank we for the pertinacity and bravery show by the troops and add that the success of the expedition lay in the fact that we have arrive in time to save the situation then the question of transport prisoner to the rear come up and while the brigadier 's eye be search we i feel that he be go to entrust I with that mission he look at I give I the order in a short measure way but he eye gaze searchingly and deeply into mine and i think i understand the unspoken message so tired as i be i immediately set out with a guard of twenty man to transport the two hundred and forty russian prisoner among whom be two officer back behind the fight line they seem not unhappy over they lot -- in fact be smoking and chat freely while we march back one of the russian officer have a wound in he leg and be carry on a stretcher but he too seem quite at ease converse with I in french and congratulating I upon the bravery we isolate detachment have show against the terrific onslaught as soon as i have deliver they safely into the hand of the commander of we reserve i inquire the way to the nearest field hospital in search of the young officer the son of we brigadier-colonel it be then about nine o'clock at night and on enter the peasant 's hut where the field hospital be establish i see at a glance that i have come too late he lay there still hand fold over he breast with as serene and happy a expression as if asleep he faithful orderly sit weep next to he and some kind hand have lay a small bunch of field flower on he breast from the doctor i get the full information he have receive a shot in the abdomen and a rifle bullet have graze he cheek he last word have be a fervent expression of joy over the relief bring by he father and the knowledge that the position would not be take by the russian he have die as simply as a child without regret and utterly happy i take the orderly with I ask he to carry all the belongings of the young officer with he in order to transmit they to he father when i return with the orderly the brigadier be issue order to he officer and confer with they about the military situation he see I come yet not a muscle move in he face nor do he interrupt he conversation i be overwhelm by the power this man show at that minute and admit i have not the courage to break the news to he but it be unnecessary for he understand the faithful orderly step forward as i have bid he present to the old man the pocketbook and small article that belong to he son while he do so he break forth into sob lament aloud the loss of he beloved lieutenant yet not a muscle move in the face of the father he take my report nod curtly dismiss I without a word and turn back to he ordnance officer resume the conversation i assume the command of my platoon which in the mean time have be assign to do some outpost duty under the command of the sergeant i inquire about they position and go out to join they about midnight we be relieved and when march back pass the place where the tent of the brigadier have be erect i see a dark figure lie on the floor seemingly in deep sleep and order my man to march on i creep silently forward then i see that he shoulder be convulsively shake and i know that the mask of iron have fall at last the night be chilly so i enter he tent in search of he overcoat and lay it around he shoulder he never notice it the next morning when i see he he face be as immovable as it have be the night before but he seem to have age by many year the next day be a comparatively restful one we fortify the entrenchment which we have take and as we battle line be extend to the right from be the extreme right we become almost the center of the new position which extend for perhaps ten mile from northwest to southeast about eighteen mile south of lemberg the next few day be give to repair provision and rest with occasional small skirmish and shift of position then one night a scout aeroplane bring news of a forward movement of about five russian army corps which seem to push in the direction of we center against this force we could muster only about two army corps but we strategical position seem a very good one both the extreme flank of we army be protect by large and impassable swamp evidently the russian have realize the impossibility of turn we flank and be endeavor to pierce we center by means of a vigorous frontal attack rely upon they great superiority in number every preparation have be make to meet the onslaught during the night we trench have be strengthen the artillery have be bring into position cleverly mask by means of transplant bush the field in front of we have be clear of object obstruct the view and the sapper have be feverishly busy construct formidable barbed-wire entanglement and carefully measure the shooting distance mark the different range by bundle of hay or other innocent-looking object which be place here and there in the field at nine o'clock in the morning everything be ready to receive the enemy the man take a short and well-deserved rest in they trench while we officer be call to the colonel who acquaint we with the general situation and give he order address we in a short business-like way appeal to we sense of duty and express he firm belief in we victory we all know that he martial attitude and abrupt manner be a mask to hide he inner self full of throb emotion and tender solicitude for he subordinate and we return to we trench deeply move the camp be absolutely quiet the only movement noticeable be around the field kitchen in the rear which be be remove from the battle line a half hour later any casual observer glancing over the desert field might have laugh at the intimation that the earth around he be harbor thousand of man arm to they tooth and that pandemonium of hell would break loose within a hour barely a sound be audible and a hush of expectancy descend upon we i look around at my man in the trench some be quietly asleep some write letter other converse in subdue and hushed tone every face i see bear the unmistakable stamp of the feeling so characteristic of the last hour before a battle -- that curious mixture of solemn dignity grave responsibility and suppress emotion with a undercurrent of sad resignation they be ponder over they possible fate or perhaps dream of they dear one at home by and by even the little conversation cease and they sit quite silent wait and wait perhaps awed by they own silence sometimes one would bravely try to crack a joke and they laugh but it sound strain they be plainly nervous these brave man that fight like lion in the open when lead to a attack heedless of danger and destruction they feel under a cloud in the security of the trench and they be conscious of it and ashamed sometimes my faithful orderly would turn he eye on I mute as if in quest of a explanation of he own feeling poor dear unsophisticated boy i be as nervous as they all be although try my best to look unconcerned but i know that the hush that hover around we like a dark cloud would give way like magic to wild enthusiasm as soon as the first shot break the spell and the exultation of the battle take hold of we all suddenly at about ten o'clock a dull thud sound somewhere far away from we and simultaneously we see a small white round cloud about half a mile ahead of we where the shrapnel have explode the battle have begin other shot follow shortly explode here and there but do no harm the russian gunner evidently be try to locate and draw a answer from we battery these however remain mute not care to reveal they position for a long time the russian fire at random mostly at too short a range to do any harm but slowly the harmless-looking white cloud come nearer until a shell whining as it whiz past we burst about a hundred yard behind we trench a second shell follow explode almost at the same place at the same time we notice a faint spinning noise above we soar high above we position look like a speck in the firmament fly a russian aeroplane watch the effect of the shell and presumably direct the fire of the russian artillery this explain its sudden accuracy one of we aeroplane rise give chase to the enemy and simultaneously we battery get into action the russians keep up a sharply concentrated well-directed fire against we center we gunner respond gallantly and the spirited artillery duel which ensue grow in intensity until the entrails of the earth seem fairly to shake with the thunder by one o'clock the incessant roaring crash and splinter of burst shell have become almost unendurable to we nerve which be already strain to the snapping-point by the lack of action and the expectancy suddenly there appear a thin dark line on the horizon which move rapidly towards we look not unlike a huge run bird with immense outstretched wing we look through we field glass there could be no doubt -- it be russian cavalry swoop down upon we with incredible impetus and swiftness i quickly glance at we colonel he stare open-mouthed this be indeed good fortune for we -- too good to believe no cavalry attack could stand before well-disciplined infantry provide the latter keep cool and well compose calmly wait until the rider come sufficiently close to take sure aim there be action for we at last at a sharp word of command we man scramble out of the trench for better view and aim shout with joy as they do so what a change have come over we all my heart beat with wild exultation i glance at my man they be all eagerness and determination hand at the trigger eye on the approach enemy every muscle strain yet calm they bronzed face harden into immobility wait for the command to fire every subaltern officer 's eye hang on we colonel who stand about thirty yard ahead of we on a little hill he figure well define in the sunlight motionless the very picture of calm assurance and proud bearing he scan the horizon with he glass shrapnel be hail around he but he seem utterly unaware of it for that matter we have all forget it though it keep up its terrible uproar spit here and there destruction into we midst by this time the avalanche of tramp horse have come perceptibly nearer soon they would sweep by the bundle of hay which mark the carefully measure range within which we fire be terribly effective suddenly the mad stampede come to a abrupt standstill and then the cossack scatter precipitately to the right and leave only to disclose in they rear the advance russian infantry the movement of which it have be they endeavor to veil the infantry move forward in loose line endlessly roll on like shallow wave overtake each other one line run forward then suddenly disappear by throw itself down and open fire on we to cover the advance of the other line and so on while they artillery keep up a hellish uproar spread destruction through we line simultaneously a russian aeroplane sweep down upon we with a noise like a angered bird of prey and pelt we with bomb the effect of which however be more moral than actual for we have regain the security of the trench and open fire on the approach enemy who in spite of heavy loss advance steadily until he reach we wire entanglement there he be greet by a deadly fire from we machine gun the first russian line be mow down as if by a gigantic scythe and so be the reserve as they try to advance the first attack have collapse after a short time however they come on again this time more cautiously arm with nipper to cut the barb wire and use the body of they own fall comrade as a rampart again they be repulse once more they cavalry execute a feigned attack under cover of which the russian infantry rally strongly reinforce by reserve and more determine than ever support by heavy artillery fire they line roll endlessly on and hurl themselves against the barbed-wire fence for a short time it almost seem as if they would break through by sheer weight of number at that critical moment however we reserve succeed in execute a flanking movement surprised and catch in a deadly cross-fire the russian line waver and finally they flee in disorder all these combine artillery infantry cavalry and aeroplane attack have utterly fail in they object of dislodge we center or shake its position each one be frustrate by the resourceful cool alertness of we commanding general and the splendid heroism and stoicism of we troops but the strain of the continuous fighting for nearly the whole day without respite of any kind or chance for food or rest in the end tell on the power of endurance of we man and when the last attack have be successfully repulse they lay mostly prostrate on the ground panting and exhaust we loss have be very considerable too stretcher-bearer be busy administer first aid and carry the wound back to the nearest field hospital while many a brave man lay stark and still by eight o'clock it have grow perceptibly cooler we now have time to collect we impression and look about we the russian have leave many dead on the field and at the barbed-wire entanglement which we sapper have construct as a obstacle to they advance they body lay heap upon each other look not unlike the more innocent bundle of hay lie in the field we could see the small red cross party in the field climb over the horribly grotesque tumulus of body try to disentangle the wound from the dead and administer first aid to they enthusiasm seem suddenly to disappear before this terrible spectacle life that only a few hour before have glow with enthusiasm and exultation suddenly pale and sicken the silence of the night be interrupt only by the low moaning of the wound that come regularly to we it be hideous in its terrible monotony the moon have rise throw fantastic light and shadow over the desolate landscape and the heaped-up dead these grotesque pile of human body seem like a monstrous sacrificial offering immolate on the altar of some fiendishly cruel antique deity i feel faint and sick at heart and near swoon away i lay on the floor for some time unconscious of what be go on around I in a sort of stupor utterly crush over the horror about I i do not know how long i have lie there perhaps ten minute perhaps half a hour when suddenly i hear a gruff deep voice behind I -- the brigadier who have come around to inspect and to give order about the outpost he calm quiet voice bring I to my sens and i report to he he self-assurance kindness and determination dominate the situation within five minute he have restore confidence give definite order for the welfare of every one man and beast alike show he solicitude for the wound for the sick and weak one and mingle praise and admonition in just measure as by magic i feel fortify here be a real man undaunt by nervous qualm or by over-sensitiveness the horror of the war be distasteful to he but he bear they with equanimity it be perhaps the first time in my life that i regret that my artistic education have over-sharpen and overstrung my nervous system when i see how manfully and bravely that man bear what seem to I almost unbearable he whole machinery of thinking be not complicate and not for a moment do qualm of weltschmerz or exaggerated altruism burden he conscience and interfere with he straight line of conduct which be wholly determine by duty and code of honor in he private life he be a unusually kind man he solicitude for he subordinate for prisoner and for the wound be touch yet he see the horror of the war unflinchingly and without weaken for be they not the consequence of the devotion of man to they cause the whole thing seem quite natural to he the man be clearly in he element and dominate it after have inspect the outpost i go back bed myself in a soft sand-heap cover myself up and be soon fast and peacefully asleep during the night the dew moisten the sand and when i awake in the morning i find myself encase in a plastering which could not be remove for day iii we hope of get a little rest and respite from the fighting be soon shatter for a scout aeroplane bring news that the russian be again advance in overwhelming strength we commanding general come to the conclusion that with the reduce and weaken force at he command he could not possibly offer any effective resistance to a renew onslaught have determine to fall back slowly before they pressure the consequence be a series of retreat battle for we which last about ten day and which constitute what be now call the battle of lemberg we be then terribly outnumber by the russian and in order to extricate we army and prevent it from be surround and cut off we constantly have to retreat one detachment take up position to resist the advance russian try to hold they at all cost in order to give the rest of the army sufficient time to retire to safety this maneuvering could not of course be carry out without the force guard the rear and cover the retreat suffering sometimes terrible loss these be depressing day with rain and storm add to the gloom the man tramp wearily hang they head ashamed and humiliate by the retreat the necessity of which they could not grasp have as they think successfully repulse the enemy it be difficult to make they understand that we regiment be only a cog in the huge wheel of the austrian fighting machine and that with a battle line extend over many mile it be quite natural that partial success could take place and yet the consideration of general strategy necessitate a retreat we argue make little impression on the man for they only shake they head and say we be victorious we should have go on the spirit of retreat troops be vastly different from that show by a advance army and it be probably in recognition of this well-known psychological state that we general staff have in the begin attack the russian wherever they could in spite of the overwhelming superiority of the foe but the reinforcement the russian be able to draw upon have swell they rank so enormously that any attack would have be little short of madness the real hardship and privation for we begin only now the few road of galicium which at best be in bad condition through the constant passing of heavy artillery and wagon of all kind follow each other in endless procession through constant rain have become well-nigh impassable the heavy mud constitute a additional impediment to the march of troops in order to get all of the train carry provision out of the possible reach of a sudden raid by the russian cavalry it have to be send mile back of we so as not to interfere with the movement of the troops this cause somewhat of a interruption in the organization of the commissary department and very little food reach the troops and that only at very long interval the distribution of food to a army even in peace and under the best condition be a very complicated and difficult undertaking provision be ship from the interior to the important railway center which serve as huge army depot and form the basis from which the different army corps draw they provision and from which they be constantly replenish they in turn supply the division and brigade wherefrom the regiment and battalion draw they provision so it be see that the great aorta which lead from the interior to the big depot slowly subdivide itself into smaller artery and feeder until they reach the ultimate destination the extreme front this distribution of food have now become a formidable task in consequence of the unforeseen movement and diversion which be force upon we by the unexpected development of the battle and it often happen that food supplies intend for a certain detachment would reach they destination only after the departure of that detachment my platoon have by this time shrink from fifty-five man to about thirty-four but those remain have become very hardened efficient and fit it be astonishing how quickly the human organism adjust itself if need be to the most difficult circumstance so far as i be concern for instance i adapt myself to the new life without any trouble at all respond to the unusual demand upon I automatically as it be my rather impaired eyesight improve in the open with only wide distance to look at i find that my muscle serve I better than ever before i leap and run and support fatigue that would have appal I under other circumstance in the field all neurotic symptom seem to disappear as by magic and one 's whole system be charge with energy and vitality perhaps this be due to the open-air life with its simplify standard free from all the complex exigency of society 's law and unhamper by conventionality as well as to the constant throb of excitement cause by the activity the adventure and the uncertainty of fate the very mass together of so many individual with every will merge into one that strive with gigantic effort toward a common end and the consequent simplicity and directness of all purpose seem to release and unhinge all the primitive aboriginal force store in the human soul and tend to create the indescribable atmosphere of exultation which envelope everything and everybody as with a magic cloak it be extraordinary how quickly suggestion of luxury culture refinement in fact all the gentler aspect of life which one have consider to be a integral part of one 's life be quickly forget and more than that not even miss century drop from one and one become a primeval man near the cave-dweller in a incredibly short time for twenty-one day i go without take off my clothes sleep on wet grass or in mud or in the swamp wherever need be and with nothing but my cape to cover I nothing disturb one one night while sleep we be drench to the skin by torrential rain we never stir but wait for the sun to dry we out again many thing consider necessity of civilization simply drop out of existence a toothbrush be not imaginable we eat instinctively when we have food with we hand if we have stop to think of it at all we should have think it ludicrous to use knife and fork we be all look like shaggy lean wolf from the necessity of subsist on next to nothing i remember have go for more than three day at a time without any food whatsoever and many a time we have to lick the dew from the grass for want of water a certain fierceness arise in you a absolute indifference to anything the world hold except you duty of fight you be eat a crust of bread and a man be shoot dead in the trench next to you you look calmly at he for a moment and then go on eat you bread why not there be nothing to be do in the end you talk of you own death with as little excitement as you would of a luncheon engagement there be nothing leave in you mind but the fact that horde of man to whom you belong be fight against other horde and you side must win my memory of these day be very much blur every day be pretty nearly the same as the precede one -- fatiguing march little rest and comparatively little fight it be quite possible that we commander try to divide the work of the troops in a just manner and that in consequence of my regiment have bear the brunt of two terrible attack and have suffer considerable loss we be now temporarily withdraw from the fight line and not once during these day be assign to the duty of a rear guard consequently we have only few and unimportant skirmish in these day twice while guard the flank through have to repulse attack of cossack and once be harass by a armored automobile but the movement of a automobile be confine to the road we have no difficulty in avoid its fire and as for the cossack with they eternal feigned attack we have reach the point where we almost ignore they we be in the first day of September and upon reach the swamp near grodeck south of lemberg a determine stand be decide upon by we commanding general it seem the most propitious place for a formidable defense there be only few road through otherwise impassable swamp on September sixth my battalion be order to take up a position command a defile which form one of the possible approach for the enemy here we await the russian and they be not long in come first they violently shell we position and silence one of we battery find they artillery fire do not draw any answer from we side they attempt to storm we position by means of frontal infantry attack combine with occasional raid of cossack which be always repulse finally the russian infantry succeed in establish a number of trench the one opposite we not more than five hundred yard away it be the first time we have come in close touch with the russian almost within hail distance and with the aid of we field glass we could occasionally even get a glimpse of they face and recognize they feature we stay four day opposite each other neither side gain a foot of ground it be there and then that i make a curious observation after the second day we have almost grow to know each other the russian would laughingly call over to we and the austrian would answer the salient feature of these three day ' fighting be the extraordinary lack of hatred in fact it be astonishing how little actual hatred exist between fight man one fight fiercely and passionately mass against mass but as soon as the mass crystallize itself into human individual whose feature one actually can recognize hatred almost cease of course fighting continue but somehow it lose its fierceness and take more the form of a sport each side be eager to get the best of the other one still shoot at he opponent but almost regret when he see he drop by the morning of the third day we know nearly every member of the oppose trench the favorite of my man be a giant red-bearded russian whose constant pastime consist in jump like a jack-in-the-box from the trench cry over to we as he do so he be frequently shoot at but never hit then he grow bolder show himself longer and longer until finally he jump out of the trench altogether shout to we wildly and wave he cap he good-humored jollity and bravado appeal to we boy and none of they attempt to shoot at he while he present such a splendid target finally one of we man who do not want to be second in bravery jump out of the trench and present himself in the full sunlight not one attempt be make to shoot at he either and these two man begin to gesticulate at each other invite each other to come nearer all fight have suddenly cease and both oppose party be look on laugh like boy at play finally the russian would draw a step nearer and we man boldly advance too then the russian urge on they man with shout and laughter and he make a big leap forward stand still whereupon the austrian also jump forward and so step by step they approach until they nearly touch each other they have leave they rifle behind and we think that they be go to indulge in a fist fight all of we be sorry for we champion for he be a small and insignificant-looking man who look as if he could be crush with one blow by he gigantic opponent but lo and behold the big russian hold out he hand which hold a package of tobacco and we austrian seize the tobacco grasp the hand of the russian and then reach in he pocket produce a long austrian cigar which he ceremoniously present to the russian it be indeed a funny sight to see the small wiry lean austrian talking in exaggerated term of politeness to the blond russian giant who listen gravely and attentively as if he understand every word by this time all precaution and even idea of fight have be forget and we be surprise to find ourselves out of the shelter of we trench and fully expose to the russian who in turn lean out of they own trench and show they head in full this unofficial truce have last about twenty minute and succeed more in restore good humor and joy of life among we soldier than a trainload of provision would have do it be one of the incident that help to relieve the monotony of trench life and be heartily welcome by all of we the fight however soon be resume with all its earnestness and fierceness but from this moment on a certain camaraderie be establish between the two oppose trench between skirmish a unofficial truce would frequently be call for the purpose of remove the wound during these time when the stretcher-bearer be busy no shot would be fire on either side nor be this a isolate case for similar intermittent truce sometimes accompany by actual intercourse between the opposing force be quite common all along the battle line that very night i be hurriedly summon to the trench of the 13th company about half a mile east of we in order to act as a interpreter between the major command that battalion and two singular guest he have just receive a russian officer and he orderly the pair carry a white flag have hail one of the numerous austrian outpost place during the night in front of the trench and have be send blindfold back to the major the russian officer speak only broken french he command one of the oppose trench and from he narrative it appear that he man have not receive any food supplies for some day and be actually on the point of starvation not be able to stand they misery any longer he have take the bull by the horn and with the utter confidence and straightforwardness of a fearless nature have simply come over to we the enemy for help offer a little barrel of water which he companion carry on he head and a little tobacco in exchange for some provision the major seem at first perhaps a little perplexed and undecided about this singular request but he generous nature and chivalry soon assert itself one single look at the emaciated and worn face of we guest sufficiently substantiate the truth of they story for both man be utterly exhaust and on the verge of collapse the next minute messenger be fly to the different trench of the battalion to solicit and collect contribution and the officer scramble over each other in they noble contest to deplete they own last and cherish reserve for the supper of the guest soon the latter be seat as comfortably as circumstance permit before a feast of can beef cheese biscuit and a slice of salami my own proud contribution consist of two tablet of chocolate part of a precious reserve for extreme case it be a strange sight to see these two russian in a austrian trench surround by cordiality and tender solicitude the big brotherhood of humanity have for the time envelop friend and foe stamp out all hatred and racial difference it be wonderful how the most tender flower of civilization can go hand in hand with the most brutal atrocity of grim modern warfare in the mean while the messenger have return almost stagger under the weight of a sack fill with the gift of we soldier to the enemy -- piece of bread and biscuit with here and there a slice of bacon or a lump of cheese all throw pele-mele together many a man must have part with he last piece of bread in order not to be outdo by the other in generosity for we own provision be run very low it be true that the bread and biscuit be mildew the cheese stale and the bacon as hard as stone but the boy give the best they could the very poverty and humbleness of the gift attest they own desperate plight and bearing proud witness to the extent of they sacrifice with tear in they eye and reiterate protestation of thanks we guest stagger back through the night to they line undoubtedly carry with they tender memory of austrian generosity and hospitality on the morning of the next day a russian detachment succeed in storm a hill on we flank command the strip of space between ourselves and we reserve in the rear thus cut we off from we main body they establish there a machine-gun battery and although we be under cover in we trench we be now in a very precarious position for no more provision or ammunition could reach we all attempt to do so break down under a terrific machine-gun fire but we have order to hold we position at all cost and to the last man unfortunately we ammunition be give out in spite of we husband it as much as possible and shooting only when we have a sure target the russian soon find that each shot mean a victim and take no chance on show even the tip of they cap neither could we move the least bit without be the target for a volley from they side up to this day i can not understand why they do not try to rush we but apparently they be unaware of we comparative weakness also for another reason we position have become more and more untenable we be on swampy ground and the water be constantly ooze in from the bottom of the trench so that we sometimes have to stand nearly knee-deep and be force to bail the water out with we cap it be difficult to imagine a more deplorable situation than to have to stay for four day in a foul trench half fill with swamp water constantly expose to the destructive fire of the enemy utterly isolate and hopeless soon we be completely without any food or water and we ammunition be almost exhaust during the night here and there daring man would rush through the space sweep by the russian gun fire which be keep up constantly try to bring we what scanty supplies they could procure from neighbor trench better provide than we be but the little they bring be nothing compare to we need on the evening of that third day know that we ammunition be give out we feel that the next day would bring the end and all we thought turn homewards and to the dear one we all write what we consider we parting and last farewell each one pledge himself to deliver and take care of the letter of the other if he survive it be a grave sad deeply touching moment when we resign ourselves to the inevitable and yet somehow we all feel relieved and satisfied that the end might come and grimly resolve to sell we life dearly never before have i as much reason to admire the wonderful power of endurance and stoicism of we soldier as on that night once resign to the worst all the old-time spirit return as if by magic they sit together play card in as much moonlight as would fall into the deep trench relate joke and bolster up one another 's courage the fourth day break gloomy with a drizzling rain at ten o'clock one of we man become suddenly insane jump out of the trench dance wildly and divest himself of every stitch of clothing while do so strange to say the russian must have realize that the man be insane for they never fire at he neither do they at the two man who jump out to draw he back we succeed in comforting and subdue he and he soon fall into a stupor and remain motionless for some time as soon as darkness fall we succeed in convey he back to the reserve and i understand that he get quite well again in a few day at five o'clock that afternoon we suddenly receive order through a run messenger who be brave the incessant machine-gun fire that we position be about to be abandon and that we be to evacuate we trench under the cover of darkness at eleven o'clock i can not but confess that we all breathe more freely on the receipt of that information but unfortunately the purpose could not be carry out the russian by this time evidently have realize we comparatively defenseless condition and utter lack of ammunition for that same night we hear two shot ring out be a signal from we sentinel that they be surprised and that danger be near i hardly have time to draw my sword to grasp my revolver with my left hand and issue a command to my man to hold they bayonet in readiness when we hear a tramp of horse and see dark figure swoop down upon we for once the cossack actually carry out they attack undoubtedly owe to they intimate knowledge of we lack of ammunition my next sensation be a crush pain in my shoulder strike by the hoof of a horse and a sharp knife pain in my right thigh i fire with my revolver at the hazy figure above I see it topple over and then lose consciousness this happen to the best of my recollection at about half past ten at night upon come to my sens i find my faithful orderly kneel in the trench by my side he fairly shout with delight as i open my eye accord to he story the austrian fall back under the cavalry charge have evacuate the trench without notice in the darkness that i be miss but soon discover my absence he start back to the trench in search of I it be a perilous undertaking for he for the cossack be still ride about and he show I with pride the place where a stray bullet have perforated he knapsack during the search he revive I give I first aid and succeed with great difficulty in help I out of the trench for more than three hour we stumble on in the night try to find we line again twice we encounter a small troop of cossack but upon hear the tramp we quietly lay down on the wayside without a motion until they have pass happily we be not notice by they and from then we stumble on without any further incident until we be hail by a austrian outpost and in safety by this time i be utterly exhaust and again lose consciousness when i open my eye i be in a little hut where we ambulance give first aid therefrom i be transport to the nearest field hospital this however have to be break up and the wound remove because of the russian advance we be hastily put on big ambulance wagon without spring the jolting of which over the bad road cause we such suffer that we should have almost prefer to walk or crawl we try to reach the railway station at komarno but find a russian detachment have intercept we in the street of the village a shell burst almost in front of we wagon make the horse shy and cause a great deal of confusion we have to turn back and after a long and wearisome detour reach we destination the troop hospital in sambor in a state of great exhaustion there i remain but a day the less seriously wound have to make place for the graver case and be among the former i be transfer by hospital train to miscolcy in hungary the same crowded condition prevail here as in sambor and after a night 's rest i again be put on board a red cross train en route to vienna we be meet at the station by a number of red cross nurse and assistant doctor to my great joy my wife be among the former have be assign to that particular duty a short official telegram to the effect that i be be send home wound on hospital train number 16 be the first news she have receive about I for fully four week none of my field postcard have arrive and she be suffer extreme nervous strain from the long anxiety and suspense which she have try in vain to numb by feverish work in she hospital i remain two week in vienna and then be transfer to the sulphur bath of baden near-by where large hospital have be establish to relieve the overcrowding of vienna there i remain until the first of November when i be order to appear before a mixed commission of army surgeon and senior officer for a medical examination two week later i receive formal intimation that i have be pronounced invalid and physically unfit for army duty at the front or at home and consequently be exempt from further service my military experience end there and with deep regret i bade good-bye to my loyal brother officer comrade and faithful orderly and discard my well-beloved uniform for the nondescript garb of the civilian grateful that i have be permit to be of any if ever so little service to my fatherland the end end of project gutenberg 's four week in the trench by fritz kreisler
