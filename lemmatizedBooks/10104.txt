here by the request of mr dibble i be not scorn and spurn anybody explain the startled orphan coyly accept the chair he push forward i be sure i do not feel any sectional hatred nor any other

come of the usher we continue to wait evidently the usher in common with he kind despise those who be not holder of reserved seat he welcome with a smile the owner of private box -- pew i mean -- and show they politely up the aisle but for we who have not even a order from the mana -- sexton i should say -- he have neither smile nor glance by and by i pluck up courage and pluck he by the sleeve so with a severe air of suppress indignation he show we to a couple of ineligible seat where the draft disarrange margaret 's hair and the charity child drop book of the op -- that be to say prayer-book and molasses candy in unpleasant proximity to we helpless foot neither margaret nor i possess a libret -- a prayer-book i mean however that be a matter of no consequence as we be both familiar with

recitative of the clerk be succeed by a contest in chant -- probably for the championship -- by two rival chorus of shrill-voiced boy who hurl alternate verse of the psalm at one another with the fiercest intensity margaret be betray into a inadvertent competition with they by read a verse aloud as have be she custom elsewhere but the charity child smile aloud at she and the usher frown so she sit down again with reddened cheek i say to she that this choir contest be a excellent feature one that be sure to draw but she answer nothing and busily read the libret -- the psalm to herself then come the litany and here again margaret betray she rural habit by repeat audibly the first response thus encroach on the province of the choir-boy who have now unite and form a fine and powerful

that soft sort the qualification of a voter may be state with severe and scientific accuracy as follow : -- _ ubiquity _ -- by this be to be understand the power not of _ be _ but of _ belong _ in from six to twelve ward at the same time analogous to this be the capacity of be at once a subject of victorium regina and a loyal citizen of the united state -- a talent most exquisitely develop in the hibernian nature _ receptivity _ -- this may be divide into two class as follow : -- 1 the material power which be that of receive from any candidate any sum of money which the say ass of a candidate may be willing to pay for a vote 2 the spiritual power which be that of imbibe at the expense of the aforesaid candidate any number of fluid pound of anything good to take whether the same may be punch cock-tail smash sling or plain drink _ pugnacity _ -- this be a quality by no means to be lightly speak of especially in a district represent by that eminent warrior the hon mr morrissey

height of mendacious talent be show in represent this paragon of virtue to be a brawler a blackguard a swindler a infidel and a bad husband and father if he mildly deny that he be any such person the

art will show he skill by the great number of time in which he will manage to say we in the course of he lucubration iii qualification of a candidate _ density _ -- this indicate the utter incapacity of a candidate to understand any public question it be a very safe quality for the more he know the less likely be he to commit himself it be a equally pleasant quality since it enable its possessor to take the fence and to maintain it while by a sort of optical delusion each party suppose he to be upon its own side it save regular out and out _ lie _ if mr greeley will allow we to use so strong a word for instance if ask be you in favor of a protective tariff the candidate may answer i be -lrb- for he do not know whether he be -rrb- or i be not -lrb- for he do not know but he may be a most cantankerous free trader -rrb- in this way he may with roman honesty satisfy everybody and promote peace and good-will and that sort of thing in the handsomest manner _ capillary attraction _ -- this be analogous to receptivity in the voter if the citizen drink hugely the candidate must be able to keep up with he and to have a sponge stomach equal to the absorption of quart and even of gallon be a piece of excellent good fortune for the man who be fool enough to want to go to congress instead of enjoy the delight of obscurity verily he have he reward he who suffer in the gin-mill of new york
