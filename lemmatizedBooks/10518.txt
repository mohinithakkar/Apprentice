produce by distribute proofreader poem by john hay note to revise edition the publisher of this volume desire to print it in a improved form have ask I to write something by way of preface or supplement to the new edition after some deliberation i have find myself unable to comply with this request these page be write in the first half of the year 1870 a time of intense interest and importance to spain i leave madrid in the memorable August of that year pass through pari when that beautiful city be lie in the torpor which follow the wild excitement of the declaration of war and precede the fury of despair that come with the catastrophe of sedan i then intend to return to spain before long and in fact few year have pass since that time in which i have not nourish the dream of revisit the peninsula and its scene of magic and romance but many care and duty have intervene i have never go back to spain and i have arrive at a age when i begin to doubt if i have any castle there require my attention i have therefore nothing to add to this little book read it again after the lapse of many year i find much that might be advantageously modify or omit but as its merit if it have any be merely those of youth so also be its fault and they be immanent and structural they can not be amend without tear the book to piece for this reason i have confine myself to the correction of the most obvious and flagrant error and can only hope the kindly reader will pass over with a indulgent smile the rapid judgment the hot prejudice the pitiless condemnation the lyric eulogy bear of a honest enthusiasm and unchecked by the reserve which come of age and experience i venture to hope though with some anxiety and uncertainty that the honest enthusiasm may itself be recognize as well as the candor which the writer try to preserve in speaking of thing which powerfully appeal to he love and he hate i therefore commit this book to the public once more with its imperfection on its head with its prophecy unfulfilled its hope baffle its observation in many instance render obsolete by the swift progress of event a changed europe -- far different from that which i traverse twenty year ago -- suffer in a new fever-dream of war and revolution north of the pyrenee and beyond those picturesque mountain the spanish monarchy enjoy a new lease of life by favor of circumstance which demand a chronicler of more leisure than myself i must leave what i write in the midst of the stir scene of the interregnum between the secular monarchy and the short-lived republic -- whose advent i foresaw but whose sudden fall be veil from my sanguine vision -- without defense or apology claim only that it be write in good faith from a heart fill with passionate conviction and a ardent love and devotion to what be best in spain i record what i saw and my eye be better then than now i trust i have not too often speak amiss of a people whose art whose literature whose language and whose character compel my highest admiration and with whom i enjoy friendship which be among the dearest recollection of my life john hay lafayette square washington _ April _ 1890 contents the pike county

shaft of dawn as they shoot o'er the tuilery early strike luxor 's cold gray spire and wild in the light of the morning with they marble mane on fire ramp the white horse of marly but the place of concord lie dead hushed ` neath the ashy sky and the city sit in council with sleep in they wide stone eye i see the mystic plain where the army of spectre slay in the emperor 's life-long war march on with unsounding tread to trumpet whose voice be dead they spectral chief still lead they -- the ghostly flash of he sword like a comet through mist shine far -- and the noiseless host be pour for the gendarme never heed they up the long dim road where thunder the army of italy onward through the great pale arch of the star the spectre army fade far up the glimmer hill but vaguely linger still a group of shudder shades infect the pallid air grow dimmer as day invade the hush of the dusky square there be one that seem a king as if the ghost of a crown still shadow he jail-bleached hair i can hear the guillotine ring as its regicide note ring there when he lay he tired life down and grow brave in he last despair and a woman frail and fair who weep at leave a world of love and revel and sin in the vast unknown to be hurl -lrb- for life be wicked and sweet with king at she small white foot -rrb- and one every inch a queen in life and in death a queen whose blood baptize the place in the day of madness and fear -- she shade have never a peer in majesty and grace murder and murderer swarm slayer that slew and be slay till the drench place smoke with the rain that pour in a torrent warm -- till red as the rider 's of edom be splash the white garment of freedom with the wash of the horrible storm and liberty 's hand be not clean in the day of she pride unchain she royal hand be stain with the life of a king and queen and darker than that with the blood of the nameless brave and good whose blood in witness cling more damning than queen ' and king ' have she not pay it dearly chained watch she choose nation grind late and early in the mill of usurpation have not she holy tear flow through shameful year wash the stain from she tortured hand we think so when god 's fresh breeze blow over the sleep land in ` forty-eight wake the world and the burgher-king be hurl from that palace behind the tree as freedom with eye aglow smile glad through she childbirth pain how be the mother to know that she woe and travail be vain a smirking servant smile when she give he she child to keep do she know he would strangle the child as it lay in he arm asleep liberty 's cruellest shame she be stunned and speechless yet in she grief and bloody sweat shall we make she trust she blame the treasure of ` forty-eight a lurk jail-bird steal she can but watch and wait as the swift sure season roll and when in god 's good hour come the time of the brave and true freedom again shall rise with a blaze in she awful eye that shall wither this robber-power as the sun now dry the dew this place shall roar with the voice of the glad triumphant people and the heaven be gay with the chime ringing with jubilant noise from every clamorous steeple the come of better time and the dawn of freedom waking shall fling its splendor far like the day which now be break on the great pale arch of the star and back o'er the town shall fly while the joy-bell wild be ring to crown the glory spring from the column of July the sphinx of the tuilery out of the latin quarter i come to the lofty door where the two marble sphinx guard the pavilion de flore two cockney stand by the gate and one observe as they turn to go no wonder he like that sort of thing -- he be a sphinx himself you know i think as i walk where the garden glow in the sunset 's level fire of the charlatan whom the frenchman loathe and the cockney all admire they call he a sphinx -- it please he -- and if we narrowly read we will find some truth in the flunkey 's praise the man be a sphinx indeed for the sphinx with breast of woman and face so debonair have the sleek false paw of a lion that could furtively seize and tear so far to the shoulder -- but if you take the beast in reverse you would find the ignoble form of a craven cur be all that lay behind she live by give to simple folk a silly riddle to read and when they fail she drink they blood in cruel and ravenous greed but at last come one who know she word and she perish in pain and shame -- this bastard sphinx lead the same base life and he end will be the same for a oedipus-people be come fast with swell foot limp on if they shout he true name once aloud he false foul power be go afraid to fight and afraid to fly he cower in a abject shiver the people will come to they own at last -- god be not mock forever the surrender of spain

kaiser 's sword and fetter-lock and the traitor stab of france till at last come glorious venice in storm and tempest home and now god madden the greedy king and give to she people rome lame lion of caprera red-shirt of the lose campaign not idly shed be the costly blood you pour from generous vein for the shame of aspromonte and the stain of mentana 's sod but forge the curse of king that spring from you break heart to god we lift we soul to thee o lord of liberty and of light let not earth 's king pollute the work that be do in they despite let not thy light be darken in the shade of a sordid crown nor pampered swine devour the fruit thou shake ` st with a earthquake down let the people come to they birthright and crosier and crown pass away like phantasm that flit o'er the marsh at the glance of the clean white day and then from the lava of aetna to the ice of the alp let there be one freedom one faith without fetter one republic in italy free the curse of hungary saloman look from he donjon bar where the danube clamor through sedge and sand and he curse with a curse he revolting land -- with a king 's deep curse of treason and war he say : may this false land know no truth may the good heart die and the bad one flourish and a greed of glory but live to nourish envy and hate in its restless youth in the barren soil may the ploughshare rust while the sword grow bright with its fatal labor and blacken between each man and neighbor -- the perilous cloud of a vague distrust be the noble idle the peasant in thrall and each to the other as unknown thing that with link of hatred and pride the king may forge firm fetter through each for all may a king wrong they as they wrong they king may he wring they heart as they wring mine till they pour they blood for he revel like wine and to woman and monk they birthright fling the mad king die but the rush river still brawl by the spot where he donjon stand and its swift wave sigh to the conscious sand that the curse of king saloman work forever for flow by pressbourg they hear the cheer ring out from the leal and cheated heart that be catch and chained by theresa 's art -- a man 's cool head and a girl 's hot tear and a star scarce rise they see decline where orsova 's hill look coldly down as kossuth bury the iron crown and flee in the dark to the turkish line and latest they see in the summer glare the magyar noble in pomp array to shout as they see with he unfleshed blade a hapsburg beat the harmless air but ever the same sad play they see the same weak worship of sword and crown the noble crush the humble down and moulding wrong to a monstrous law the donjon stand by the turbid river but time be crumble its battered tower and the slow light withers a despot 's power and a mad king 's curse be not forever the monk of basle i tear this weed from the rank dark soil where it grow in the monkish time i trim it close and set it again in a border of modern rhyme i long year ago when the devil be loose and faith be sorely try three monk of basle go out to walk in the quiet eventide a breeze as pure as the breath of heaven blow fresh through the cloister-shades a sky as glad as the smile of heaven blush rise o'er the minster-glade but scorn the lure of summer and sense the monk pass on in they walk they eye be abase they sens sleep they soul be in they talk in the tough grim talk of the monkish day they hammer and slash about -- dry husk of logic -- old scrap of creed -- and the cold gray dream of doubt -- and whether just or justified be the church 's mystic head -- and whether the bread be change to god or god become the bread but of human heart outside they wall they never pause to dream and they never think of the love of god that smile in the twilight gleam ii as these three monk go bicker on by the foot of a spreading tree out from its heart of verdurous gloom a song burst wild and free -- a wordless carol of life and love of nature free and wild and the three monk pause in the evening shade look up at each other and smile and tender and gay the bird sing on and coo and whistle and trill and the wasteful wealth of life and love from he happy heart be spill the song have power on the grim old monk in the light of the rosy sky and as they listen the year roll back and tear come into they eye the year roll back and they be young with the heart and hope of man they pluck the daisy and kiss the girl of dear dead summer again iii but the eldest monk soon break the spell ` tis sin and shame quoth he to be turn from talk of holy thing by a bird 's cry from a tree perchance the enemy of soul have come to tempt we so let we try by the power of the awful word if it be he or no to heaven the three monk raise they hand we charge thee speak they say by he dread name who shall one day come to judge the quick and the dead -- who art thou speak the bird laugh loud i be the devil he say the monk on they face fall the bird away through the twilight speed a horror fall on those holy man -lrb- the faithful legend say -rrb- and one by one from the face of earth they pine and vanish away iv so go the tale of the monkish book the moral who run may read -- he have no ear for nature 's voice whose soul be the slave of creed not all in vain with beauty and love have god the world adorn and he who nature scorn and mock by nature be mock and scorn the enchanted shirt

bosom as i gaze entranced transport and amaze for all the house be but one room and in its clear and grateful gloom fill with all odor strange and strong that to the wondrous east belong i see above around below a sight to make the warm heart glow and leave the eager soul no lack a endless wealth of bric-a-brac i see bronze statue old and rare fashion by no mere mortal skill with robe that flutter in the air blow out by art 's eternal will and delicate ivory netsuke richer in tone than cheddar cheese of saint and hermit cat and dog grim warrior and ecstatic frog and here and there those wondrous mask more live flesh than sandal-wood where the full soul in pleasure bask and dream of love the only good the wall be all with picture hang : gay villa bright in rain-washed air tree to whose bough brown monkey cling outlineless dab of fuzzy hair and all about the opulent shelf litter with porcelain beyond price : imarus pot array themselves beside ming dish grain-of-rice vie with the royal satsuma proud of its sallow ivory beam and kaga 's thousand hermit lay trance in some punch-bowl 's golden gleam over bronze censer black with age the five-clawed dragon strife engage a curl and insolent dog of foo sniff at the smoke aspire through in what old day in what far land what busy brain what cunning hand with what quaint speech what alien think strange fellow-men these marvel work as thus i mused i be aware there grow before my eager eye a little maid too bright and fair too strangely lovely for surprise it seem the beauty of the place have suddenly become concrete so full be she of orient grace from she slant eye and burnish face down to she little gold-bronze foot she be a girl of old japan she small hand hold a gilded fan which scatter fragrance through the room she cheek be rich with pallid bloom she eye be dark with languid fire she red lip breathe a vague desire she tooth of pearl inviolate sweetly proclaim she maiden state she garb be stiff with broidered gold twine with mysterious fold on fold that give no hint where hide well she dainty form might warmly dwell -- a pearl within too large a shell so quaint so short so lissome she it seem as if it well might be some jocose god with sportive whirl have take up a long lithe girl and tie a graceful knot in she i try to speak and find oh bliss i need no interpreter i know the japanese for kiss -- i have no other thought but this and she with smile and blush divine kind to my stammering prayer do seem my thought be hers and hers be mine in the swift logic of my dream my arm cling round she slender waist through gold and silk the form i trace and glad as rain that follow drouth i kiss and kiss she bright red mouth what ail the girl no loving sigh heave the round bosom in she eye tremble no tear from she dear throat bubble a sweet and silvery note of girlish laughter shrill and clear that all the statue seem to hear the bronze tinkle laughter fine i hear a chuckle argentine ring from the silver image even the ivory netsuke utter in every silent pause dry bony laugh from tiny jaw the paint monkey on the wall wake up with chatter impudent pottery porcelain bronze and all break out in ghostly merriment -- faint as rain pattering on dry leaf or cricket 's chirp on summer eve and suddenly upon my sight there grow a portent : left and right on every side as if the air have take substance then and there in every sort of form and face a throng of tourist fill the place i see a frenchman 's sneer shrug a german countess in one hand a sky-blue string which hold a pug with the other a fiery face she fan a yankee with a soft feel hat a coptic priest from ararat a english girl with cheek of rise a nihilist with socratic nose paddy from cork with baggage light and pocket stuff with dynamite a haughty southern readjuster wrap in he pride and linen duster two noisy new york stock-brokèrs and twenty british globe-trottèrs to my disgust and vast surprise they turn on I lack-lustre eye and each with drop and wag jaw burst out into a wild guffaw : they laugh with huge mouth open wide they roar till each one hold he side they scream and writhe with brutal glee with finger rudely stretch to I -- till lo at once the laughter die the tourist fade into air none but my fair maid linger there who stand demurely by my side who be you friend i ask the maid take a tea-cup from its shelf this audience be disclose she say whenever a man make a fool of himself liberty what man be there so bold that he should say thus and thus only would i have the sea for whether lie calm and beautiful clasp the earth in love and throw back the smile of heaven from wave of amethyst or whether freshen by the busy wind it bear the trade and navy of the world to end of use or stern activity or whether lash by tempest it give way to elemental fury howl and roar at all its rocky barrier in wild lust of ruin drink the blood of live thing and strew its wreck o'er league of desolate shore -- always it be the sea and man bow down before its vast and vary majesty so all in vain will timorous one essay to set the mete and bound of liberty for freedom be its own eternal law it make its own condition and in storm or calm alike fulfil the unerr will let we not then despise it when it lie still as a sleep lion while a swarm of gnat-like evil hover round its head nor doubt it when in mad disjointed time it shake the torch of terror and its cry shrill o'er the quake earth and in the flame of riot and war we see its awful form rise by the scaffold where the crimson axe ring down its groove the knell of shudder king forever in thine eye o liberty shine that high light whereby the world be save and though thou slay we we will trust in thee the white flag i send my love two rose -- one as white as drive snow and one a blush royal red a flaming jacqueminot i mean to touch and test my fate that night i should divine the moment i should see my love if she true heart be mine for if she hold I dear i say she 'll wear my blushing rise if not she 'll wear my cold lamarque as white as winter 's snow my heart sink when i meet she : sure i have be overbold for on she breast my pale rise lay in virgin whiteness cold yet with low word she greet I with smile divinely tender upon she cheek the red rise dawn -- the white rise mean surrender the law of death the song of kilvanus : fairest she in all the land of savatthus she have one child as sweet and gay and dear to she as the light of day she be so young and he so fair the same bright eye and the same dark hair to see they by the blossomy way they seem two child at they play there come a death-dart from the sky kilvanus see she darling die the glimmer shade he eye invade out of he cheek the red bloom fade he warm heart feel the icy chill the round limb shudder and be still and yet kilvanus hold he fast long after life 's last pulse be past as if she kiss could restore the smile go out forevermore but when she see she child be dead she scatter ash on she head and seize the small corpse pale and sweet and rush wildly through the street she sob fall at buddha 's foot master all-helpful help I now here at thy foot i humbly bow have mercy buddha help I now she grovel on the marble floor and kiss the dead child o'er and o'er and suddenly upon the air there fall the answer to she prayer : bring I to-night a lotus tie with thread from a house where none have die she rise and laugh with thankful joy sure that the god would save the boy she find a lotus by the stream she pluck it from its noonday dream and then from door to door she fare to ask what house by death be spare she heart grow cold to see the eye of all dilate with slow surprise : kilvanus thou hast lose thy head nothing can help a child that be dead there stand not by the gange ' side a house where none have ever die thus through the long and weary day from every door she bear away within she heart and on she arm a heavier load a deeper harm by gate of gold and ivory by wattled hut of poverty the same refrain hear poor kilvanus _ the living be few the dead be many _ the evening come -- so still and fleet -- and overtake she hurrying foot and heartsick by the sacred fane she fall and pray the god again she sob and beat she bursting breast ah thou hast mock I mightiest lo i have wander far and wide there stand no house where none have die and buddha answer in a tone soft as a flute at twilight blow but grand as heaven and strong as death to he who hear with ear of faith : child thou art answer murmur not bow and accept the common lot kilvanus hear with reverence meet and lay she child at buddha 's foot mount tabor on tabor 's height a glory come and shrine in cloud of lambent flame the awestruck hushed disciple see christ and the prophet of the law mose whose grand and awful face of sinaus 's thunder bear the trace and wise elia -- in he eye the shade of israel 's prophecy -- stand in that wide mysterious light than syrian noon more purely bright one on each hand and high between shone forth the godlike nazarene they bow they head in holy fright -- no mortal eye could bear the sight -- and when they look again behold the fiery cloud have backward roll and bear aloft in grandeur lonely nothing be leave save jesus only resplendent type of thing to be we read its mystery to-day with clearer eye than even they the fisher-saint of galilee we see the christ stand out between the ancient law and faith serene spirit and letter but above spirit and letter both be love lead by the hand of jacob 's god through waste of eld a path be tread by which the savage world could move upward through law and faith to love and there in tabor 's harmless flame the crowning revelation come the old world knelt in homage due the prophet near in reverence draw law cease its mission to fulfill and love be lord on tabor 's hill so now while creed perplex the mind and wrangling load the weary wind when all the air be fill with word and text that ring like clash sword still as for refuge we may turn where tabor 's shine glory burn -- the soul of antique israel go and nothing leave but christ alone religion and doctrine he stand before the sanhedrim the scowling rabbi gaze at he he reck not of they praise or blame there be no fear there be no shame for one upon whose dazzled eye the whole world pour its vast surprise the open heaven be far too near he first day 's light too sweet and clear to let he waste he new-gained ken on the hate-clouded face of man but still they question who art thou what hast thou be what art thou now thou art not he who yesterday sit here and beg beside the way for he be blind -- _ and i be he for i be blind but now i see _ he tell the story o'er and o'er it be he full heart 's only lore : a prophet on the sabbath-day have touch he sightless eye with clay and make he see who have be blind they word pass by he like the wind which rave and howl but can not shock the hundred-fathom-rooted rock they threat and fury all go wide they could not touch he hebrew pride they sneer at jesus and he band nameless and homeless in the land they boast of mose and he lord all could not change he by one word _ i know not what this man may be sinner or saint but as for I one thing i know -- that i be he who once be blind and now i see _ they be all doctor of renown the great man of a famous town with deep brow wrinkle broad and wise beneath they wide phylactery the wisdom of the east be theirs and honor crown they silver hair the man they jeer and laugh to scorn be unlearned poor and humbly bear but he know better far than they what come to he that sabbath-day and what the christ have do for he he know and not the sanhedrim sinaus and calvary there be two mountain hallowed by majesty sublime which rear they crest unconquered above the flood of time uncounted generation have gaze on they with awe -- the mountain of the gospel the mountain of the law from sinaus 's cloud of darkness the vivid lightning play they serve the god of vengeance the lord who shall repay each fault must bring its penance each sin the avenge blade for god uphold in justice the law that he have make but calvary stand to ransom the earth from utter loss in shade than light more glorious the shadow of the cross to heal a sick world 's trouble to soothe its woe and pain on calvary 's sacred summit the paschal lamb be slay the boundless might of heaven its law in mercy furl as once the bow of promise o'erarch a drown world the law say as you keep I it shall be do to you but calvary pray forgive they they know not what they do almighty god direct we to keep thy perfect law o bless savior help we nearer to thee to draw let sinaus 's thunder aid we to guard we foot from sin and calvary 's light inspire we the love of god to win the vision of st peter to peter by night the faithfullest come and say we appeal to thee the life of the church be in thy life we pray thee to rise and flee for the tyrant 's hand be red with blood and he arm be heavy with power thy head the head of the church will fall if thou tarry in rome a hour through the sleep town st peter pass to the wide campagna plain in the starry light of the alban night he draw free breath again : when across he path a awful form in luminous glory stand he thorn-crowned brow he hand and foot be wet with immortal blood the godlike sorrow which fill he eye seem change to a godlike wrath as they turn on peter who cry aloud and sink to he knee in the path lord of my life my love my soul say what wilt thou with I a voice reply i go to rome to be crucify for thee the apostle spring all flush to he foot -- the vision have pass away the light still lay on the dewy plain but the sky in the east be gray to the city wall st peter turn and he heart in he breast grow fire in every vein the hot blood burn with the strength of one high desire and sturdily back he march to he death of terrible pain and shame and never a shade of fear again to the stout apostle come israel when by jabbok the patriarch wait to learn on the morrow he doom and he dubious spirit debate in darkness and silence and gloom there descend a be with whom he wrestle in agony sore with strive of heart and of brawn and not for a instant forbore till the east give a threat of the dawn and then as the awful one bless he to he lip and he spirit there come compel by the doubt that oppress he the cry that through question age have be wring from the hind and the sage tell I i pray thee thy name most fatal most futile of question wherever the heart of man beat in the spirit 's most sacred retreat it come with its sombre suggestion unanswered forever and aye the blessing may come and may stay for the wrestler 's heroic endeavor but the question unheeded forever die out in the broaden day in the age before we tradition by the altar of dark superstition the imperious question have come when the death-stricken victim lay sob at the foot of he slayer and priest and he heart be lay smoking and throb to the sound of the cymbal and drum on the step of the high teocalli when the delicate greek at he feast pour forth the red wine from he chalice with mocking and cynical prayer when by nile egypt worship lay and afar through the rosy flushed air the memnon call out to the day where the muezzin 's cry float from he spire in the vaulted cathedral 's dim shades where the crushed heart of thousand aspire through art 's highest miracle higher this question of question invade each heart bow in worship or shame in the air where the censer be swing a voice go up with the singing cry tell I i pray thee thy name no answer come back not a word to the patriarch there by the ford no answer have come through the age to the poet the seer and the sage who have seek in the secret of science the name and the nature of god whether cursing in desperate defiance or kiss he absolute rod but the answer which be and shall be my name nay what be it to thee the search and the question be vain by use of the strength that be in you by wrestle of soul and of sinew the blessing of god you may gain there be light in the far-gleaming heaven that never will shine on we eye to mortal it may not be give to range those inviolate sky the mind whether pray or scorn that tempt those dread secret shall fail but strive through the night till the morning and mightily shalt thou prevail crow at washington slow flap to the setting sun by two and three in waver row as twilight shadow dimly close the crow fly over washington under the crimson sunset sky virginian woodland leafless lie in wintry torpor bleak and dun through the rich vault of heaven which shine like a warm opal in the sun with wide advance in broken line the crow fly over washington over the capitol 's white dome across the obelisk soar bare to prick the cloud they travel home content and weary winnowing with dusky van the golden air which hint the come of the spring though winter whiten washington the dim deep air the level ray of die sunlight on they plume give they a beauty not they own they hoarse note fail and faint away a rustling murmur float down blend sweetly with the thicken gloom they touch with grace the fading day slow fly over washington i stand and watch with clouded eye these dim battalion move along out of the distance memory cry of day when life and hope be strong when love be prompt and wit be gay even then at evening as to-day i watch while twilight hover dim over potomac 's curve rim this selfsame flight of homing crow blot the sunset 's fading rise above the roof of washington remorse sad be the thought of sunniest day of love and rapture perish and shine through memory 's tearful haze the eye once fondliest cherish reproachful be the ghost of toy that charm while life be waste but saddest be the thought of joy that never yet be taste sad be the vague and tender dream of dead love 's linger kiss to crushed heart halo by the gleam of unreturning bliss deep mourn the soul in anguished pride for the pitiless death that win they -- but the saddest wail be for lip that die with the virgin dew upon they esse quam videri the knightly legend of thy shield betray the moral of thy life a forecast wise and that large honor that deceit defy inspired thy father in the elder day who deck thy scutcheon with that sturdy phrase _ to be rather than seem _ as eve 's red sky surpass the morning 's rosy prophecy thy life to that proud boast its answer pay scorn thy faith and purpose to defend the ever-mutable multitude at last will hail the power they do not comprehend -- thy fame will broaden through the century as storm and billowy tumult overpast the moon rule calmly o'er the conquer sea when the boy come home there be a happy time come when the boy come home there be a glorious day come when the boy come home we will end the dreadful story of this treason dark and gory in a sunburst of glory when the boy come home the day will seem brighter when the boy come home for we heart will be lighter when the boy come home wife and sweetheart will press they in they arm and
