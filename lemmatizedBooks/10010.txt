produce by jonathan ingram and pg distribute proofreader the eulogy of howard a vision -- to tell of deed above heroic milton mdccxci the eulogy of howard it be my chance to be converse with a friend of the benevolent and indefatigable howard when we country be first afflict with the public intelligence of he death after we first expression of surprize and sorrow we naturally fall into serious and affectionate reflection on the gentle character and sublime pursuit of the decease on these article we have no difference of opinion but in the course of we conversation a point arise on which we sentiment be directly opposite though we be equally sincere and ardent in we regret and veneration for the depart worthy to whom it related i happen to speak of the public honor that i hope a grateful a generous a magnificent nation would render to he memory my companion immediately exclaim that every ostentatious memorial to commemorate the virtue of he friend would be inconsistent with the meekness and simplicity of the man that all who have the happiness of know howard must recollect with what genuine modesty he have ever retire from the enthusiastic admiration of those who have hope to gratify he ambition by undeserved applause that he have really seek no reward but in the approbation of he conscience and he god that the british nation however eminent for genius and munificence could not devise any posthumous honor or raise any monument truly worthy of howard except in adopt and accomplish those benevolent project which he philanthropy and experience have recommend to public attention for the benefit of mankind i readily admit the singular and unquestionable modesty of the decease -- i allow that the noblest tribute of respect which the world could render to so pure a spirit would be to realize he idea but i contend that other honor be still due to he name that it be the duty and the interest of mankind to commemorate he character with the fondest veneration i remind my companion that although we be sincerely convince that no human mind engage in great design could be more truly modest than that of howard yet we have particular reason to recollect that he be not insensible to praise he have once impart to we he feeling on that subject with a frank and tender simplicity highly graceful in a upright and magnanimous be conscious of no sentiment that he could wish to conceal indeed a sincere and ardent passion for virtue could hardly subsist with a disdain of true glory which be nothing more than the proper testimony of intelligent and hone admiration to the existence of merit : nor be it reasonable to suppose that the fondest expression of remembrance from a world which he have serve and enlighten can be displease to the spirit of a just man make perfect since we be teach by religion that the gratitude of mankind be acceptable even to god i endeavor to convince my companion that as the publick have see in howard a person who reflect more genuine honor on we country than any of she philosopher she poet she orator she hero or divine it be incumbent on the nation to consult she own glory by commemorate in the fullest manner he beneficent exertion and by establish the dignity of he unrivaled virtue my argument and my zeal make some impression on the mind of my antagonist and sink so deeply into my own that on my retire to rest they give rise to the follow vision i be suddenly transport to the confines of a region which astonish I by its loveliness and extent it be call the paradise of true glory as i approach the entrance my eye be delightfully fascinate by two being of human form who preside over the portal they name be genius and sensibility : -- it be they office to gratify with a view of this paradise every mortal that revere they sincerely and to reject only such intruder as presume to treat either the one or the other with the insolence of disdain or the coldness of contempt : a incident that i should have think impossible from the transcendent beauty which be visible in each but to my surprize they inform I it very frequently happen as i readily pay they the unsuspected homage of my soul i be graciously permit to pass the gate -- immediately as i enter i be salute with a seraphic smile by two benignant and inseparable spirit : these be gratitude and admiration the joint ruler of the dominion -- you be welcome say the first in a tone of angelic tenderness -- you be welcome to a scene utterly new to you sens and in harmony with you heart : you delight in the praise of the deserving : and you be now waft to a spot where those who have merit highly of mankind be praise in proportion to they desert and where the praise of exalted merit be fondly listen to by a extensive human audience here purify by we supernatural agency from all the low and little jealousy of the earth i have hardly answer this please information by a grateful obeisance to my radiant informer when i perceive in a gorgeous prospect that now open before we three structure of stupendous size and superior magnificence the first be situate in a grove of olive and appear to I like a ancient temple of attica remarkable for massive strength and a sober dignity -- the second be less solid but richer in decoration and seem to be almost surround by every tree and plant on which nature have bestow any salutary virtue : the third be shaded only by palm the form of it be so wonderfully grand and aweful that it strike I as a sanctuary for every pure and devout spirit from all the nation of the globe these structure that you survey with astonishment say one of my benevolent conductor be devote to what you mortal denominate the three liberal profession law medicine and theology whoever have a claim to distinguish honor from any one of the three have a just encomium pronounce upon he service by the temporary president of that particular fabrick in which he be entitle to such grateful remembrance alas i reply with a murmur that i could not suppress the man whose well-deserved praise i most anxiously expect to hear in this region belong not to any one of these eminent class in human life -- he have no profession but that of humanity be patient say the sweetest of my aetherial guide with a rebuke that be soften by a smile of indulgence let not you zeal for the honor of a individual however meritorious make you unjust or insensible to the merit of other assume the temper of this region where praise be distribute by equity and affection but where prejudice and partiality be not allow to intrude -- let we advance continue my monitor with a encouraging movement of she hand it be time that i should lead you to the nearest assembly i obey with reverential silence and as i pass the vestibule of the majestic edifice my heart pant with a aweful expectation of behold the shades of solon lycurgus and other depart legislator from the various nation of the world i be chearfully surprize by a very different spectacle the capacious structure be fill with a concourse of live mortal lively yet respectable in they appearance evidently belong to many country but all as i perceive by they habit connect with the law throughout all the multitude i hear no sound of dissention or debate : but over all there reign a air of intelligence and sympathy while all be hush in silent expectance and eager attention with they eye direct to a elevated tribunal : -- on this a personage be sit whose majestic figure i immediately recollect he countenance be mark with that austerity and grandeur which be the external characteristick of law herself he heart as those who know it ultimately declare express the tender and beneficent influence of that power who be the acknowledged parent of security and comfort with a voice that pervade the most distant recess of the extensive dome and in tone that sink deep into the bosom of every auditor he pronounce the follow oration : after pass many year of life in the painful investigation of human offence it be with peculiar satisfaction that i find myself commission to commemorate in this assembly a character of virtue without example -- a character at once so meek and so sublime that if a feeling spirit have be poison with misanthropy from too close a contemplation of mortal crime this character alone might serve as a antidote to the word of mental distemper and awaken the most callous and sarcastic mind to confess the dignity of we nature and the beneficence of we god in state to you the merit of howard i might expatiate with delight on the various quality of this incomparable man i might trace he progress through the different period of a life always singular and always instructive i could not be check by any fear of overstep the modesty of truth in the celebration of virtue so solid and so extensive that the malevolence of envy could not diminish its weight the fondness of enthusiasm could not amplify its effect but i must not forget that there be professional limit to my discourse it be incumbent on I to confine myself to a single object and to dwell only on those public service that peculiarly endear the name of howard to the liberal and enlighten community in which i have the honor to preside it be in the capacity of a minister to justice that the pure spirit whom it be my glory to praise first conceive the idea of those unrivaled labor that have render he memory a treasure to mankind in discharge a temporary office that expose to he the condition of criminal he be lead to meditate on the evil which have grievously contaminate the operation of justice he perceive that law herself like one of she most illustrious delegate -lrb- i mean the immortal bacon -rrb- be grossly injure by the secret and sordid enormity of she menial servant : that captivity and coercion those necessary supporter of she power instead of produce good often give birth to mischief more flagrant and more fatal than those which they be employ to correct he find even in the prison of he own humane and enlighten country a accumulation of the most hideous abuse : he find they not nursery of penitence and amendment but school of vice and impiety or den of filth famine and disease : not the seat of just and salutary correction and punishment but the strong hold of cruelty and extortion the iron of the prisoner which he only behold enter into he soul and awaken unextinguishable energy in a spirit of which companion and fortitude be the divine characteristick in the noble emotion of pity for the oppressed and of zeal for the honor and interest of civilized society he conceive perhaps the sublimest design that ever occupy and exalt the mind of man the design to search and to purify the polluted stream of penal justice not only throughout he own country but through the various nation of the world how low how little be the grandest enterprize of heroic ambition when compare with this magnanimous pursuit how frivolous and vain be the highest aim of fancy and science when contrast with a purpose so beneficently great but marvellous as the magnitude of howard 's enterprise appear on the slightest view that magnitude become doubly striking when we contemplate at the same time the many circumstance that might either allure or deter he from the prosecution of he idea consider he as a private gentleman possess of ease and independence accustom to employ and amuse he mind in retired study and philosophical speculation arrive at that period of life when the spring of activity and enterprize in the human frame have begin to lose they force consider that he health even in youth have appear unequal to common fatigue he stature low he deportment humble he voice almost effeminate such be the wonderful be who relinquish the retirement the tranquillity the comfort that he love and enjoy to embark in labor at which the most hardy might tremble to plunge in peril from which the most resolute might recede without a diminution of honor under all these apparent disadvantage unsummoned unauthorized by any prince unexcited by any popular invitation he resolve to investigate all the abuse of imprisonment to visit the abode of wretchedness and infection and to prove himself the friend of the friendless in every country that the limit of he advanced life would allow he to examine against such a enterprize project by such a individual what forcible argument might be urge not only by every selfish passion but even by that prudence and that reason which be allow to regulate a elevated mind how plausibly do friendship exclaim to howard ` you project be unquestionably noble but they be above the execution of any individual : you be unarmed with authority you have the wish to do great good but the power of do little consider the probable issue of the undertaking -- you will see a few hapless wretch and tell they condition to the inattentive world perhaps perish yourself from contagion before you have time to tell it and leave you afflict friend to lament you untimely fate and the ungrateful publick to deride you temerity ' what force of intellect what dignity of soul be require to prevent a mortal from yield to remonstrance so engage the divine energy of genius and of virtue enable howard to foresee that the sanctity of he pursuit would supply he with strength and power far superior to all human authority : -- he piercing mind comprehend that there be enormity of such a nature that to survey and to reveal they be to effect they correction -- he feel that he sincere compassion for the oppressed and he ardent desire to promote perfect justice would serve he as a perpetual antidote against the poison of fear -- he feel that in the darkness of dungeon he should want no associate no guard to defend he against the outrage of detect extortion or suspicious brutality -- he feel that as he purpose be heavenly the power of heaven would be display in he support that iniquity and oppression would not dare to lift a hand against he though they know it be the business of he life to annihilate they sway in they most secret dominion how admirably do the progress of he travels evince and justify the pure and enlighten confidence of he spirit all danger all difficulty vanish before he gentleness he regularity he perseverance insolence and ferocity seem to turn at he approach into docility and respect every hardship he endure every step he advance in he wide and laborious career of beneficence instead of impair he strength invigorate he frame instead of diminish he influence increase the utility of he conduct by make the world acquaint with the sanctity of he character witness ye various region of the earth with what surprize delight and veneration ye behold a unarmed and unassuming traveller instruct you in the sublime science of mitigate human misery and give you a matchless example of tenderness and magnanimity o england thou generous country ever enamoured of glory contemplate in this the most perfect of thy illustrious son contemplate those virtue and that honor in which thy parental spirit may most happily exult -- what spectacle can be more flattering to thy native thy honest pride than to behold the proudest potentate of distant nation listen with pleasure to a private englishman and learning from he research how to relieve the most injured of they subject how to abolish the enormity of perverted justice to form a complete account of the good arise to the world from the life and labor of howard would be a task beyond the limit of any human mind : a exact statement of the benefit he have confer upon society could be render only by the attendant spirit whom providence commission to watch over he and who might discern by the power of supernatural vision what pregnant source of public calamity he crush in the seed and what future virtue in various individual he may draw into the service of mankind by the attraction of he example of good more immediately visible which he exertion produce there be abundant evidence in he own country in the wide circle of he foreign excursion what nation what city do not bear some conspicuous trace of he intrepid and indefatigable beneficence of the astonishing length to which he zeal and perseverance extend we have the most ingenuous and satisfactory narration in those singularly meritorious volume which he have give to the world in these we behold the minute detail of labor to which there be nothing similar or second in the history of public virtue and for which there could be no adequate reward but in the beatitude of heaven a eloquent enthusiast whose genius be nearly ally to frenzy have express a desire to present himself before the tribunal of the almighty judge with a volume in he hand in which he have record he own thought and action : if such a idea could be suitable to the littleness of man if it could become any mortal of faculty so limited to make such a offering to the great fountain of all intelligence that mortal must assuredly be howard : for where could we find another individual not professedly inspire who might present to he maker a record of labor so eminently direct by piety and virtue a book address to mankind without insulting they weakness or flattering they passion a book whose great object be to benefit the world without seek from it any kind of reward a book in which the genuine modesty of the writer be equal to he unexampled beneficence the mind of howard be singularly and sublimely free from the common and dangerous passion for applause : that passion which though take altogether it be certainly beneficial to the interest of mankind yet frequently communicate inquietude and unsteadiness to the pursuit of genius and virtue as human praise be never the object of he ambition so he have nobly soar above it there appear in different age upon the earth certain elevated spirit who by the sublimity of they conception and the magnanimity of they conduct attain a degree of glory which can never be reach by the keenest follower of fame -- they seek not panegyrick and panegyrick can add nothing to they honor the eulogy have perish which be devote by the luxuriant genius of tully and by the laconic spirit of brutus to the public virtue of cato yet the name of that illustrious roman be still powerful in the world and excite in every cultivate mind a animating idea of independent integrity the name of howard have superior force and a happier effect it be a sound at which the string of humanity will vibrate with exultation in many million of heart through the various nation that he visit the mere echo of he name will be sufficient to awaken that noblest sensibility which at once soften and elevate the soul every warm hearted and worthy individual who mention howard will glow with a honest a generous satisfaction in feeling himself the fellow-creature of such a man wherever the elegant art be establish they will contend in raise memorial to he honor indeed the globe itself may be consider as he mausoleum and the inhabitant of every prison it contain as group of live statue that commemorate he virtue there be no class of mankind by whom he memory ought not to be cherish because all be interested in those evil -lrb- so pernicious to society so dangerous to life -rrb- which he be ever labor to lessen or exterminate it might be wish that different community should separately devise some different tribute of respect to he whose character and conduct be so interesting to all : not for the sake of multiply vain and useless offering to the dead but to impress with more energy and extent he ennobling remembrance on the heart and soul of the live it be hardly possible to present too frequently to the human mind the image of a man who live only to do good i mean not merely such a resemblance of he form as art may execute with material almost as perishable as the image of human clay but such a impression of he soul as may have a more lasting influence on the life and conduct of he admirer such as diffusing among they a portion of he spirit may in some measure perpetuate he existence by this community i be confident such public honor will be pay to howard as may be most suitable to the peculiar interest which it become we to take in he glory what these honor shall be be a point to be settle by this liberal and enlighten assembly which assuredly will not fail to remember that he suggest to legal authority she omission and defect with the modest and endearing tenderness of a friend that he labor in the service of justice with that intelligence fortitude and zeal which she votary can not too warmly admire or too gratefully acknowledge the president arise as he thus end he speech and the member of the assembly seem begin to confer among themselves but what debate ensue or what measure be adopt i be unable to tell as my visionary guide immediately hurry I to the adjoining temple this second structure though less extensive and less solid than the first be more attractive to the eye as it abound with scientifical and diversified decoration the assembly consist of man who appear to I equally remarkable for keenness of intellect and elegance of manners the seat of pre eminence among they be fill by a person who possess in a very uncommon degree these two valuable quality so happily conducive to medical utility and medical distinction though leave a young orphan without patrimony and oblige to struggle with early disadvantage he raise himself by meritorious exertion to the head of a profession in which opulence be generally the just attendant on knowledge and reputation but neither opulence nor he long intercourse with sickness and death have harden the native tenderness of he heart and i have lately know he shed tear of regret on the untimely fate of a amiable patient whom he consummate skill and attention be unable to save thus strongly prepossess in he favor i be delighted to observe that he be prepare to address the assembly in the moment we enter my celestial guide smile on each other in perceive my satisfaction and be place by they instantaneously in a commodious situation i hear the follow discourse which the character i have describe deliver with a ease and refine acuteness peculiar to himself never raise he voice above the pitch of polite and spirited conversation : i be persuade that every individual to whom i have now the happiness of speak will readily agree with I in this sentiment that we can not possibly do ourselves more honor as a fraternity than by consider howard as a associate : assuredly there be no class of man who may more justly presume to cherish he name and character with a fraternal affection in proportion as we be accustom to contemplate to pity and to counteract the suffering of nature the more be we enable and incline to estimate to love and to revere a be so compassionate and beneficent if physician be what i once hear they call by a lively friend the soldier of humanity engage in a perpetual and too often alas unsuccessful conflict against the enemy of life howard be not only entitle to high rank in we corps but he be the very caesar of this hard this perilous and let I add this most honorable warfare perhaps the ambition of the great roman commander insatiate and sanguinary as it be do not contribute more to the torment and destruction of the human race than the charity of the english philanthropist have contribute to its relief and preservation of this we be very certain the splendid and indefatigable hero of slaughter and vain-glory do not traverse a more extensive field nor expose himself more courageously to personal danger than we meek and unostentatious hero of medical benevolence in point of true magnanimity i apprehend the spirit of caesar would very willingly confess that he own celebrated attempt to reduce gaul and britain be low and little achievement when compare to the unexampled effort by which howard endeavor to exterminate or subdue -lrb- those enemy more terrific -rrb- the gaol fever and the plague but leave it to more able and eloquent panegyrist to celebrate the originality the boldness and all the various merit of he philanthropic exertion i shall confine myself to a few remark and chiefly professional one on he invaluable character it appear to I highly worthy of observation that howard before he enter on he grand project of public benevolence be subject to those little but depressive variation of health which have betray many a valetudinarian into habit of inaction and inutility happily for himself and for mankind this excellent person surmount a constitutional bias to indolence and retirement the consequence sequence be he become a singular example of activity and vigor he power and enjoyment of bodily and mental health augment in proportion to the extensive utility of he pursuit beneficial as he life have be to the world he memory may be still more so it may prove a perpetual blessing to mankind if it dissipate as it ought to do a weak and common prejudice which often operate as a palsy upon the first idea of a great and generous undertake the prejudice i mean be a hasty persuasion frequently find in the most amiable mind that some peculiar strength of nerve some rare mechanism of frame and extraordinary assemblage of mental power be absolutely requisite for the execution of any noble design how greatly do it redound to the true glory of howard to have give in he successful labor the fullest refutation of a prejudice so inimical to the interest and the honor of human-nature a prejudice by whose influence to use the word of we great poet -- the native hue of resolution be sickly o'er with the pale cast of fear and enterprize of great pith and moment with this regard they current turn awry and lose the name of action the life and character of howard if they be justly consider may not only annihilate this pernicious prejudice but tend to establish a opposite and consolatory truth he example may shew we that some degree of bodily weakness and mental depression may be most happily cure by active exertion in the service of mankind perhaps there never exist a more striking proof how far a noble impulse communicate to the mind by a project of extensive benevolence may invigorate a frame not equal in health strength and stature to the common standard of man it be a prudential maxim of the celebrated raleigh that ` whosoever will live altogether out of himself and study other man 's humor shall never be unfortunate ' a maxim which the example of howard might almost teach we to convert into a medical aphorism by say ` whosoever will live altogether out of himself and consult other man 's want and calamity shall never be unhealthy ' it be delightful to those who detest the debase tenet of a selfish philosophy to see the happy influence of opposite idea to observe -lrb- what physician have frequent opportunity of observe -rrb- that as a selfish turn of mind often attract and encrease the malignity of sickness so a unselfish a compassionate spirit have a natural tendency to escape or subdue it what can be more please to those who assert and esteem the dignity of human-nature than to see that the have lose all thought of self and have act in direct opposition to selfish principle have promote even the personal advantage of a generous individual from such a series of philanthropic labor and peril as a selfish and timid mind might esteem it frenzy to encounter howard derive not only he unrivalled and immortal reputation but the perfect restoration of enfeebled health not to mention those high gratification of the heart and conscience which be superior to all the enjoyment both of health and glory with such temperance in diet that he daily food would appear to most people not sufficient to support the common function of life he chearfully sustain the hardship of long travel through region where travel be most difficult and dangerous with a figure voice and deportment that seem to preclude he from all personal influence and authority and with no mental acquisition except those which be common to every cultivate mind he secure to himself not only universal admiration but i may venture to say the just and moral idolatry of the world so invigorating be project of extensive beneficence so powerful be the energy of public virtue never indeed be the astonishing influence of plain and simple goodness more strikingly display than in the deference and respect which this private and meek individual receive not only from foreign and imperious ruler of the earth but from harden and atrocious wretch on whom justice herself could hardly make any mental impression though arm with all the splendor and all the violence of power two particular example of the influence i be speaking of i shall mention here not only as honorable to the prime object of we regard but as they may suggest to contemplative mind some useful idea by shew how far the mere weight of a upright and benevolent character alone may give to the most callous nerve a tremble sensibility and awaken the most ferocious spirit to self-correction when we indefatigable visitor of prison be in russium he behold in public the punishment of the knoot severely administer by a strong and stern executioner on the follow day he wait on this man to request from he various information the executioner attend he obsequiously but this athletic savage though train to act of cruelty and conscious he have a legal sanction for the barbarous violence he have exert could not behold without shudder the meek and gentle missionary of compassion the second and more memorable example of he singular influence occur in a prison of he own country and relate to a outrageous female delinquent a corrupt and ferocious woman be perhaps the most intractable fiend that human benevolence can attempt to reform but even this difficulty the mild and powerful character of howard accomplish in one of we western gaol he find a unhappy female loaded with heavy iron : on he appearance she entreat he to obtain for she the removal of these galling fetter upon enquiry he find that many endeavor have be make to keep this turbulent offender in proper subjection without the severity of chain but after repeat promise of amendment on milder treatment she have oblige the keeper to have recourse to this extreme by relapse into the most flagrant and insufferable contempt of decency and order upon this information howard say mildly to the unhappy criminal ' i wish to relieve you but you put it out of my power for i should lose all the little credit i have if i exert it for offender so hardened and so turbulent ' ' i know ' reply the intractable delinquent ' i know that i have a proud and rebellious spirit but if i give a promise to so good a man as you be i can and i will command it ' on this firm assurance of reformation the benevolent howard become a kind of surety for she future peaceable conduct on the removal of she iron and he have the inexpressible delight to find on he next visit to the prisoner of this gaol that the outrageous and ungovernable culprit for whom he have venture to answer be become the most orderly among they i could wish for the moral interest of mankind that it be possible to obtain a minute account of the service render to the calamitous spirit of many a forsake individual by the singular charity of howard what could be more instructive than to observe how he beneficence encrease by its exertion and success while he desire of befriend the wretched become as it be the vital spirit that give strength and duration to he own existence if we contemplate with pleasure the singular re-establishment of bodily health which howard derive from he active philanthropy it may be still more please to recollect that it also afford he a efficacious medicine for a afflict mind perhaps it be to shew the full efficacy of this virtue in all its lustre that heaven allot to this excellent personage a domestic calamity which appear -lrb- to borrow a expression from a great writer -rrb- ` of a unconscionable size to human strength ' that capricious and detestable spirit of detraction which on earth never fail to persecute superior virtue have not scruple to assert that the affliction to which i allude be the mere consequence of paternal austerity the earth itself though frequently accuse of be eager to receive idea that may abase the eminent could hardly admit a calumny so groundless and irrational in this purer spot it be utterly needless to prove the innocence of a exalt be to whom we be only solicitous to pay that sincere tribute of praise and veneration which we be conscious he deserve in truth this admirable character seem to illustrate the philosophical maxim that mildness be the proper companion of true magnanimity he have a gentleness of manners that be peculiar to himself and instead of possess such imperious severity of spirit as might produce the calamity i allude to he be really endue with such native tenderness of heart as must have sink under it have he not find in the unexampled service that he render to the world a antidote to the poison of domestic infelicity it be among the most gracious ordinance of providence that man be sure to find the most powerful relief for he own particular affliction in he endeavor to alleviate the suffering of other and permit I to add it be this beneficent law of we nature that give a peculiar charm and dignity to the medical profession a profession singularly endear to the affectionate howard not only as its compassionate and active spirit be the guide of he pursuit but as one of its prime ornament be he favorite associate and he bosom-friend if different class of man be to vie with each other as it may certainly become they to do in render various honor to this they matchless benefactor i hope we shall display with the most affectionate spirit the deep interest that we ought to take in he glory i think it very desirable that every physician should possess a medal of howard not only to shew he veneration for the great philanthropist but to derive personal advantage from such a mental amulet if i may hazard the expression most of we in the exercise of medicine feel at particular moment that we spirit be too sensibly affect by the object we survey that scene of misery and infection depress and alarm : at such a time how might it rekindle the energy of we mind to contemplate a little effigy of howard to recollect that all the trouble and danger that we encounter in the practice of a lucrative profession be trifle in the extreme when compare to the labor and the peril which this wonderful man most willingly take upon himself without look forward to any reward but the approbation of heaven i mention not a medal as a new idea -- it have be already in contemplation and a motto for it suggest which apply with such singular force and propriety to the person whom it be design to commemorate that perhaps the wide range of classical literature could not afford another passage so strikingly apposite to a character so extraordinary -- stupuere patre tentamina tanta conatusque tuo : pro te reus ipse timebat -- i must confess however that i wish for another which may seem to bind he more closely to we in a medical point of view but it be time to leave the different member of we fraternity at full liberty to propose any mark of distinction that they wish to suggest -- it be sufficient for I to have remind you of a truth which i be confident we all equally feel that while we justly consider ourselves as student in the extensive school of humanity it become we to look up to howard with a laudable veneration as the prince and patron of we order on the conclusion of this discourse my guide immediately conduct I with they former celerity and kindness to the only remain structure it be the most extensive and from the hallowed majesty of its appearance the most admirable of the three in approach it i pause a moment in aweful surprise at the solemnity of the fabrick : the most lovely and communicative of my two aetherial conductor smile upon I and say you will find here minister of god from every christian country but only those who consider evangelical charity as the essence of true religion and who be dispose to honor in the favorite object of you veneration the most signal example of that virtue which the present age have behold i hope then i eagerly reply i shall have the delight of hearing on this occasion the most eloquent of we english bishop on this exclamation my kind informer regard I with that lively and soothing air with which intelligent benevolence correct mistaken simplicity and thus continue to instruct I with unite vivacity and tenderness earthly distinction you know be of little moment in the sight of heaven you will hear no prelate and perhaps you may feel surprised and indignant when you observe how very few of you mitred countryman be to be see in this assembly but you will not retain in this hallowed spot that most common of human infirmity a tendency to censure or to suspicion you will recollect that this convocation contain only those charitable man who be peculiarly disposed to honor you recent model of this christian virtue other good man may exist who from motive of innocent mistake or of mere inadvertency may fail to exhibit that animated regard to he exemplary character which assuredly it have merit from all man and which the minister of religion may most properly display one of these continue my director you be now go to hear not indeed a dignitary of you church yet a divine of talent learn and charity he be lead by a laudable warmth of heart to suggest to you country the first idea of pay a public tribute of veneration to the signal virtue of howard and have acquire from this circumstance a title to commemorate here the merit to which he be eager to render such early justice on earth but it be time for we to attend he we immediately enter the temple and i beheld a ecclesiastic rise at that moment to address a very numerous assembly of he order that seem to contain christian of every sect and minister of every degree the person prepare to speak be distinguish by a majestic comeliness of person though he appear to have pass the middle age of life and with a powerful elocution he deliver the follow discourse the righteous be bold as a lion proverb chap xxviii ver i in these few word my brethren we have a passage of scripture that serve as a favorite maxim or lead truth to the admirable personage whose glorious quality it be now both my duty and my delight to recall to you remembrance the word indeed be so consonant to that exalted spirit which he life display that they almost appear to I a epitome of he character let we consider courage as one of he principal endowment to contemplate so pure and resolute a be in this point of view may lead we to form just idea on the true nature of this primary virtue on the sacred source from whence it should proceed and the sublime end to which it should aspire how large a portion of folly vice and wickedness have arise from mere mistake concern this most important of human quality so important that the real dignity of man can only rise in proportion as this virtue be perfectly understand and properly cherish in the same proportion let I add we courageous philanthropist will be find entitle to the praise of every upright mind to the homage of every feeling heart if we take the word courage in the most common and simple sense of that term as a generous and noble contempt of personal hardship and danger who have give more numerous or more striking example of such brave contempt or if we follow the definition of courage give we by a profound a eloquent and philanthropic writer namely that it be a just estimate of we own power who be there among the most signal benefactor of mankind not professedly inspire that ever form a estimate of what he might achieve in the most glorious field of enterprize at once so difficult and so true so humble and so grand with every apparent disadvantage howard conceive it possible that he endeavor might correct the abuse and mitigate the suffering of man in various nation of the world whence happen it that a mortal so visibly weak and gentle shrink not from a idea so pregnant with difficulty and peril it be because ` the righteous be bold as a lion ' it be because he feel the strongest internal conviction of this animate truth that while heaven bless a man with health sufficient to pursue a benevolent and magnanimous design the vigor of he mind and most probably he power of do good will be proportion to the firmness of he faith and the sincerity of he virtue many achievement of beneficent courage have undoubtedly be accomplish by man influence by no motive but that generous love of glory which be so frequently the predominant passion of a active and ardent mind : but the virtue that arise from this source be as unsteady and as precarious as the reward they pursue he who act only as a candidate for the applause of mankind will find he spirit vary with all the variation in the ever-changing atmosphere of popular opinion he will be subject to hot and cold fit of action and inactivity of confidence and distrust in proportion as the illusive vapor that he follow may either sparkle or fade before he hence proceed much of that inconsistency and weakness which appear in some of the most enlighten and exalt character of the pagan world -- want a purer light from heaven the most radiant spirit of antiquity be bewilder one in particular the mildest and most undaunted of antient worthy who have a sufficient portion of heroic philanthropy to prefer the benefit of mankind to every selfish consideration have yet he hour of diffidence and despondency on a final review of he own generous labor he be suppose to have question the very existence of virtue though he have make it the idol of he life a striking proof that the temperate and invariable energy of soul which alone perhaps deserve the name of true courage can only proceed from a fuller knowledge and love of god from the animate assurance that however we may prosper or fail in the earthly success of we endeavor to do good the merit of the attempt be register in heaven and we secure to ourselves the everlasting approbation of we almighty parent in proportion as we approach towards that bless model of perfect benevolence who have teach we by he divine example to compassionate and to relieve the suffering of the wretched from this source flow the courageous beneficence of howard : and how delightful it be to observe that the force the extent the utility and the lustre of the stream have gloriously correspond to the height and purity of the fountain the sensualist and the sceptic may indeed deride the conduct of a man who sacrifice all the common pleasure of life and seek for no recompence but in the favor of heaven it may be say that a illusive fervor of mind have hurry man in all period of the world into singular and wild exertion which excite the wonder of the pass hour and be afterwards either deservedly forget or only recall to notice by reason and philosophy to caution the restless and impetuous spirit of man against all similar excess but the pursuit of howard though they have all that sublime energy which so often distinguish the project of superstition be so far from be influence by any superstitious propensity that perhaps they can not appear to more advantage than by be bring into comparison or contrast not with the sluggish piety of sequestered monk but with the bold and splendid feat of the most active and enterprising fanaticism allow I therefore to recall to you thought those distant age when every ardent spirit in christendom be inflamed with a passionate desire to deliver the christian pilgrim of palestine from the oppression of infidel figure to yourselve the whole force of europe collect its violence like a troubled sea and prepare to pour a terrific and destructive inundation over the holy land behold the strong and the weak the ambitious and the humble pursue the same object behold assemble king and they people soldier and priest the servant of earth and heaven rush with equal ardor to rescue the sepulchre of christ and to drown all the innumerable enemy of they faith in a universal deluge of blood in this scene we have the sublimest spectacle perhaps that be ever exhibit by mistaken piety and misguided valor the love of god by which this heroic multitude be professedly impel be probably in many mind as sincere as it be ardent the religious spirit of they enterprize can still animate and transport we in the song of the poet : and in the more rational page of history while we justly lament the error of they devotion we admire the force and perseverance of they courage to the sublime fortitude of these collect warrior let we compare the mild magnanimity of howard let we survey he set forth for a expedition as perilous as theirs not as the soldier of fanaticism but as the pilgrim of humanity attachment to god and resolution which no hardship no danger no difficulty can daunt be equally conspicuous in the sanguinary fanatic and the compassionate philanthropist : but how widely different be the prime earthly object of they pursuit the fierce crusader invade asia with a desire to exterminate the infidel the benevolent howard be lead into the same quarter of the globe and into peril more deadly than those of war by a wish to exterminate or rather to restrain the ravages of that terrific enemy to human life the plague he have conceive a idea that as this most alarming of mortal malady have be often strangely neglect by the sluggish and superstitious inhabitant of the east it might be possible by a calm and courageous examination of its nature and its progress to set limit to its rage and particularly to secure he own country from a future visitation of a calamity against which the fearless and eager spirit of commerce appear not to have establish a sufficient precaution for the prospect of accomplish public good so devoutly to be wish he nobly think it a trifling sacrifice to hazard the little remnant of he advanced life and however man or nation may differ in policy or religion whereever there be a human spirit sufficiently pure and enlighten to estimate public virtue the sentiment and the conduct of howard must secure to he memory the fondest veneration there be a perfection and felicity in he character that appear supremely laudable in every point of view if abstract from all religious consideration we regard he only as a citizen who devote himself to the service of he country the brightest record of antiquity afford we no parallel to he merit have he live in those early time the generous enthusiasm of the antient world would have idolize he name philosophy and genius would have find in he benevolent labor the most ample theme for instruction and the purest subject for universal panegyrick they would have celebrate he as a benefactor to mankind who have build a new portico to the temple of glory superior to the dome itself they would have prefer the beneficent philanthropist to the dazzling conqueror to the fascinating demagogue to the attractive sophist and all the various idol of public praise but as antiquity exhibit no character of such unclouded lustre we have great reason to conclude that such a character could owe its existence only to the pure and sublime spirit of we christian faith let we therefore contemplate howard as a christian it be by consider he in this light that we shall feel ourselves most happily related to he virtue and most delightfully interested in the honor they receive in the poor and calamitous object of he regard in the gentleness and purity of he manners in he modest and magnanimous refusal of earthly honor in the wide extent and courageous perseverance of he charity we can not fail to discern how richly he be endowed with the genuine spirit of that pure and sublime religion which have the divine prerogative of convert weakness into strength and of give to humility the influence of power there be not a feature in the character there be hardly a action in the life of this exemplary personage that do not mark he as a true servant of christ and may we not presume the bless author of we faith in supply we in these dissolute time with a recent example of such astonishing and unlimited beneficence be graciously pleased to afford we a new motive to prize and to cherish that animate faith which could form in a age like the present a character so wonderfully entitle to the veneration of the world the spirit of christianity be so visible in the conduct of howard that the prime object of he attention might be think to have be suggest to he by the very word in which we bless lord announce to the heir of eternal glory the source of they beatitude -- ` come ye bless of my father inherit the kingdom prepare for you from the foundation of the world for i be a hungry and ye give I meat i be thirsty and ye give I drink i be a stranger and ye take I in naked and ye cloathe I i be sick and ye visit I i be in prison and ye come unto I ' be it possible for we my brethren to recall to we memory these holy word without feeling at the same time in the most forcible degree all the christian merit of howard can we fail to admire and to venerate the unexampled ardor purity and perseverance with which he exercise the peculiar virtue so distinguish by we lord -- while we behold he sublimely pre-eminent in this christian perfection shall we not cherish the delightful idea that he heavenly reward will be finally adequate to he unrivaled labor on earth shall not those who have love he exult in the persuasion that in that great and aweful day when the living and the dead be to receive they everlasting doom when the prince and the great one of the earth may be confront with those whom they have persecute and oppress or whom they have fail to relieve when the proudest son of learn genius or wit may shrink at the superior lustre of those whom they have ridicule and revile howard will shine encircle by thousand who will gratefully plead for he beatitude in those bless word of we redeemer ' i be in prison and he come unto I ' yes my brethren the day will assuredly come when the servant so signally faithful will be call to a reward surpass the utmost reach of we conception by the voice of he righteous master -- then and then only will praise be fully proportion to he transcendant merit when this consummate christian be raise to glory by the glorified messiah when he pure spirit exult in the commendation of he god the imperfect effort that mankind may make to do honor to such a be can not indeed so much promote he glory as they may conduce to the interest of human nature subject as it have be to the wildest excess human panegyric in all its shape may be safely devote to a personage whom it be hardly possible to praise with sincerity without feel we disposition improve in a beneficent a sublime and truly religious character there be a sort of magnetic virtue which to those who be affectionately draw towards it though only in idea communicate a portion of itself hence arise what we can not too fondly cherish the delight and the utility of commemorate depart worth if its title to commemoration be justly proportion to its magnitude its singularity and extent not only various individual but different nation will become rival in promote the fame of howard as the glorious quality which he life display be equally open to the emulation of the great and the humble every class of human creature be peculiarly interested in he praise if to honor he memory may be think to belong to any one community more than to another surely my brethren we shall not fail to assume to ourselves so please a duty so honorable a distinction well indeed might the insulting enemy of we faith reproach we with a supine and disgraceful inattention to the real interest of virtue and the true glory of religion could we suffer any other order of man to surpass the minister of christ in a meritorious zeal to honor this faithful servant of heaven whose life exhibit a lesson more instructive and sublime than all the eloquence of the pulpit a christian who have shewn we in the most signal manner how practicable it be to follow in succour the distrest not only the precept but the example of we god in the moment that this benevolent divine conclude he address to he attentive brethren my kind and vigilant guide remove I from the temple -- i be now lead into a scene entirely different from those we leave it be a open and verdant plain with a few elevation in the ground that afford advantageous view of the whole extensive spot here instead of behold the minister of peace i find myself encircle by the multitudinous votary of war it appear to I that all the military and all the naval servant of we country be collect together and each different division of these well-appointed and well-looking man that form a please spectacle alone be attend by a crowd of miscellaneous spectator more numerous than itself : yet in all this immense multitude there be no sign of tumult or confusion they be range in such a manner as to form a wide circular area in the midst of they i be station on a little eminence within this area and in the same vacant space i beheld a party of veteran commander both military and naval who seem to have be confer together but separate by the direction of my aetherial conductor to address in different part of this extensive field the different company assign to they care what they respectively say in they separate department i be unable to discover as i only hear distinctly one gallant veteran whose character be particularly dear to I this consummate officer have raise himself by merit alone from the humblest rank of military life to a station of the highest honor and trust he modesty be as singular as he fortune : pass close to I with a gracious salutation he approach a very fine orderly corps of foot who look up to he with a sort of filial respect while he speak to they the few follow word : as bravery and compassion be the characteristic of good soldier you can not want my friend any long exhortation from I to honor the memory of howard the most resolute and the most compassionate man that have live in we time though he be not of we profession as he life be devote to mitigate the unite horror of captivity and sickness those worst of enemy to the spirit of a soldier you will undoubtedly feel that he have a peculiar claim to we most grateful and generous regard this speech be follow by a burst of acclamation from those to whom it be particularly address similar shout of applause resound from different quarter of the spacious field while we aetherial attendant gratitude and admiration who follow each speaker at the close of each address to different division of this innumerable assembly display to each division in its turn a extensive sketch of a simple but magnificent mausoleum to the memory of howard in the form of a english lazaretto on the first display of this striking and worthy monument the applaud multitude seem to exult in the prospect of its completion but i soon observe to my inexpressible concern that while gratitude and admiration be busy in exciting the various rank of the vast assembly to accomplish this favorite design they be follow by two earthy fiend of a dark and malignant influence : these be detraction and indifference who shed such a chill and depressive mist around they that all the ardor of the assembly seem to sink among the miscellaneous crowd that be visible between the division of the martial host there run a murmur of obloquy and derision against the pure object of public veneration he be revile as a whimsical reformer and a rash enthusiast who have absurdly sacrifice he life in a vain and fantastic pursuit this base spirit of calumnious malignity be not communicate to any one division of the martial multitude but the universal zeal for the glory of howard seem to be almost annihilate even gratitude and admiration appear to grow faint in they darling purpose during they languor they suffer they sketch of the mausoleum to be gradually steal from they hand and to drop upon the ground at this moment a sudden and violent earthquake be feel through all the extensive scene the center of the vacant area open -- it throw forth a phantom terrific and enormous -- its magnitude seem to grow upon the sight its lineament be shroud from we view by a immense mantle on which be represent a thousand different and hideous image of death its name be contagion -- it rush forward with a indescribable movement dismay and confusion overwhelm all that quarter of the crowded scene that be particularly threaten by its first advance the affrighted multitude roll back like a tumultuous sea the horrid spectre stopt and leave a wide interval between itself and the retire host a ray of heavenly light illumine the vacant space i fix my eye on the brilliant spot and soon behold the meek and gentle form of howard advance without fear or arrogance towards the terrific phantom with a untrembling hand he seize the dark fold of its extensive mantle and seem animated with the hope of annihilate the monster in the instant a burst of celestial splendor be spread over the gloomy plain the angel of retribution descend and snatch the consummate philanthropist to he bosom he rise again while all the astonished multitude now revive from they terror gaze only on the celestial apparition and hear the reascending seraph thus address the beneficent spirit now commit to he care : thou faithful servant of heaven thy hour of recompence be come justly hast thou caution mankind not to impute thy conduct to rashness or enthusiasm weak and wavering in they own pursuit of felicity thou wilt not wonder to see they so in they sense of thy merit and they zeal for thy honor : but i be commission to bear thee to that all-seeing power who can alone truly estimate and perfectly reward thy desert i know that the praise of being inferior to thy god never influence thy life but the homage of good mind be grateful to the purest inhabitant of heaven and in depart from a world so much indebted to thy virtue let it gratify thy perfect spirit to foresee that as long as the earth endure the most enlighten of she son will remember and revere thee as one of she sublimest benefactor as soon as the divine messenger have cease to speak every voice in the reanimate multitude that hear he raise a shout of benediction on the name of howard i start in transport at the sound and the effort that i make to join the universal acclamation terminate my vision pardon I thou gentlest and most indulgent of friend that conscious as i be of the sincerity with which thy pure mind ever wish to avoid all exuberance of praise i yet presume to send into the world such a tribute to thy virtue as thy humility might reject let the motive of the publication atone for all its defect this little work be make public not from a vain expectation or desire in the writer to obtain any degree of literary distinction for if he wish and endeavor be successful the world will not know from what hand it proceed thou most revered object of my regard who art look down perhaps with compassion on the petty labor of various mortal now try to commemorate thy merit thou seest that i be influence by no arrogant conceit of have praise with peculiar felicity the perfection that i so ardently admire no i be perfectly sensible that the most worthy memorial of thy virtue will be find in those pure record of thy public service which thy own hand have give to the world with all the amiable and affect simplicity that distinguish thy character and in the more comprehensive composition of some accomplished biographer who may have opportunity and ability to do justice to thy life the chief aim of these few and hasty page be to recall at this particular time to the liberal spirit of we countryman that generous ardor with which they embrace the first idea of a public monument to howard while the expence and dignity of that monument be yet unsettle a writer may consider himself as a friend to national honor who endeavor to animate he country to the most extensive display of she munificence and she gratitude towards the purest public virtue may she justly remember that to testify a fond maternal pride in such a depart son to manifest and perpetuate esteem for such a character be in truth to promote the interest of genuine patriotism of sublime morality and of perfect religion finis end of project gutenberg 's the eulogy of howard by william hayley
