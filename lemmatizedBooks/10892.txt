to travel the self-same way to the brightness of sorrow for round she breathe a grace like that of the general air which soften the sharp extreme of thing and connect by its subtle invisible stair the lowest and the highest she interwreathe she mortal obscureness with so much light of the world unrisen that angel 's wing could hardly have give she greater right to float in the wind of the infinity edmund ollier dawn chapter i you lie you always be a liar and you always will be a liar you tell my father how i spend the money well and what if i do i have to look after myself i suppose you forget that i be only here on sufferance whilst you be the son of the house it do not matter to you but he would have turn I out of door whine george oh curse you fine word it be you who forget you swab ay it be you who forget that you ask I to take the money to the gambling - tent and make I promise that you should have half of what we win but that i should play for both what be you begin to remember now -- be it come back to you after a whole month i be go to quicken you memory up presently i can tell you i have get a good deal to pay off i be think i know what you be at you want to play cuckoo to turn ` cousin philip ' out that ` cousin george ' may fill the nest you know the old man 's soft point and you keep work he up against I you think that you would like the old place when he be go -- ay and i daresay that you will get it before you have do but i mean to have my penn ` orth out of you now at any rate and brushing the tear of anger that stand in he brown eye away with the back of he hand the speaker proceed to square up to george in a most determined way now philip with he broad shoulder and he firm-knit frame would even at eighteen have be no mean antagonist for a full-grown man much more then do he look formidable to the lankly overgrown stripling crouch against the corner of the wall that prevent he further retreat philip you be not go to strike I be you when you know you be so much stronger yes i be though if i can not match you with my tongue at any rate i will use my fist look out oh philip do not i 'll tell you father tell he why of course you will i know that but you shall have something to lie about this time and he advance to the attack with a grim determination not pleasant for he cousin to behold finding that there be no escape george turn upon he with so shrill a curse that it even frighten from he leafy perch in the oak above the tame turtle-dove intensely preoccupy as he be in coo to a new-found mate he do more than curse he fight like a cornered rat and with as much chance as the rat with a trained fox-terrier in a few seconds he head be as snugly tuck away in the chancery of he cousin 's arm as ever any property be in the court of that name and to speak truth it seem quite possible that when it emerge from its retreat it would like the property be much dilapidated and extensively bleed let we not dwell upon the scene for george it be a very painful one so painful that he never quite forget it he nose too be never so straight again it be soon over though to one of the party time go with unnatural slowness well i think you have have about enough for once soliloquize philip as he critically survey the writhe mass on the ground before he and he look a very handsome lad as he say it he curly black hair hang in wave confusion over he forehead and flung change light and shadow into the depths of he brown eye whilst he massive and somewhat heavy feature be touch into a more active life by the light of that please excitement which animate nine man out of every ten of the anglo-saxon race when they be engage on killing or hurt some other live creature the face too have a certain dignity about it a little of the dignity of justice it be the face of one who feel that if he action have be precipitate and severe it have at any rate be virtuous the full but clear-cut lip also have they own expression on they half serious half comical humor contempt and even pity be blended in it altogether philip caresfoot 's appearance in the moment of boyish vengeance be please and not uninteresting presently however something of the same change pass over he face that we see in the sky when a cloud pass over the sun the light fade out of it it be astonishing to note how dull and heavy -- ay more how bad it make he look all in a breath there will be a pretty business about this he murmur and then administer a sharp kick to the prostrate and groan form on the ground before he he say now then get up i be not go to touch you again perhaps though you will not be in quite such a hurry to tell lie about I another time though i suppose that one must always expect a certain amount of lie from a half-bred beggar like you like mother like son you know this last sentence be accompany by a bitter laugh and produce a decide effect on the grovel george who slowly raise himself upon he hand and lift he head look he cousin full in the face it be not the ghastly appearance of he mangled and blood-soaked countenance that make philip recoil so sharply from the sight of he own handiwork -- he have fight too often at school to be chicken-hearted about a little bloodshed and besides he know that he cousin be only knock about not really injure -- but rather the intense and almost devilish malignity of the expression that hover on the blur feature and in the half-closed eye but no attempt be make by george to translate the look into word and indeed philip feel that it be untranslatable he also feel dimly that the hate and malice with which he be regard by the individual at he foot be of a more concentrated and enduring character than most man have the power to originate in the lurid light of that one glance he be able though he be not very clever to pierce the darkest recess of he cousin 's heart and to see he inmost thought no longer through a veil but face to face and what he see be sufficient to make the blood leave he ruddy cheek and to fix he eye into a expression of fear next second george drop he head on to the ground again and begin to moan in a ostentatious manner possibly in order to attract some one whose footstep could be plainly hear proceed slowly down a shrubbery-path on the other side of the yard wall at any rate that be the effect produce for next moment before philip could think of escape have he wish to escape a door in the wall be open and a gentleman pause on the threshold survey the whole scene with the assistance of a gold-mounted eye-glass with some evident surprise and little apparent satisfaction the old gentleman for he be old make so pretty a picture frame as he be in the arched doorway and set off by a natural background of vary shades of green that he general appearance be worth sketch as he stand to begin with he be dress in the fashion of the commencement of this century and as have be say old though it be difficult to say how old indeed so vigorous and comparatively youthful be he bearing that he be generally take to be considerably under seventy but as a matter of fact he be but a few year short of eighty he be extremely tall over six foot and stand upright as a lifeguardsman indeed he height and stately carriage would alone have make he a remarkable-looking man have there be nothing else unusual about he but as it happen he feature be as uncommon as he person they be clear-cut and cast in a noble mould the nose be large and aquiline the chin like he son philip 's square and determine but it be he eye that give a painful fascination to he countenance they be steely blue and glitter under the pent-house of he thick eyebrow that in striking contrast to the snow-white of he hair be black in hue as temper steel glitter in a curtained room it be those eye in conjunction with sundry little peculiarity of temper that have earn for the old man the title of devil caresfoot a sobriquet in which he take peculiar pride so pleased be he with it indeed that he cause it to be engrave in solid oak letter a inch long upon the form of a life-sized and life-like portrait of himself that hang over the staircase in the house i be determine he would say to he son to be know to my posterity as i be know to my contemporary the picture represent my person not inaccurately from the nickname my descendant will be able to gather what the knave and fool with whom i live thought of my character ah boy i be wear out people will soon be stare at that portrait and wonder if it be like I in a very few year i shall no longer be ` devil ' but ` devilled ' and he would chuckle at he grim and ill-omened joke philip feel he father 's eye play upon he and shrink from they he face have at the mere thought of the consequence of he chastisement of he cousin lose the beauty and animation that have clothe it a minute before now it grow leaden and hard the good die away from it altogether and instead of a young god bright with vengeance there be nothing but a sullen youth with dull and frightened eye to he son as to most people who come under he influence devil caresfoot be a grave reality presently the picture in the doorway open its mouth and speak in a singularly measure gentle voice you will forgive I philip for interrupt you _ tete-a-tete _ but may i ask what be the meaning of this philip return no answer since you cousin be not in a communicative mood george perhaps you will inform I why you be lie on you face and groan in that unpleasant and aggressive manner george lift he blood-stained face from the stone and look at he uncle groan louder than ever may i ask you philip if george have fall down and hurt himself or if there have be a -- a -- altercation between you here george himself get up and before philip could make any reply address himself to he uncle sir he say i will answer for philip there _ have _ be a altercation and he in the scuffle knock I down and i confess here he put he hand up to he battered face that i be suffer a good deal but what i want to say be that i beg you will not blame philip he think that i have wrong he and though i be quite innocent and could easily have clear myself have he give I a chance i must admit that appearance be to a certain extent against I -- he lie break in philip sullenly you will wonder sir go on the blood-stained george how i allow myself to be draw into such a brutal affair and one so discreditable to you house i can only say that i be very sorry -- which indeed he be -- and that i should never have take any notice of he word -- know that he would regret they on reflection -- have he not in a unguarded moment allow himself to taunt I with my birth uncle you know the misfortune of my father 's marriage and that she be not he equal in birth but you know too that she be my mother and i love she memory though i never see she and i could not bear to hear she speak of like that and i strike he i hope that both you and he will forgive I i can not say any more he lie again he can not speak the truth philip will you allow I to point out remark he father in he blandest voice that the continue repetition of the very ugly word ` lie ' be neither narrative nor argument perhaps you will be so kind as to tell I you side of the story you know i always wish to be perfectly impartial he lie to you this morning about the money it be true enough that i gamble away the ten pound at roxham fair instead of pay it into the bank as you tell I but he persuade I to it and he be to have share the profit if we win i be a blackguard but he be a bigger blackguard why should i have all the blame and have that fellow continually shove down my throat as a saint and so i thrash he and that be all about it sir i be sorry to contradict philip but indeed he be in error the recollection of what take place have escape he i could if necessary bring forward evidence -- mr bellamy -- there be no need george for you to continue and then fix he glittering eye on philip : it be very melancholy for I have only one son to know he to be such a brute such a bearer of false witness such a impostor as you be do you know that i have just see mr bellamy the head clerk at the bank and inquire if he know anything of what happen about that ten pound and do you know what he tell I no i do not and i do not want to but i really must beg you attention : he tell I that the day follow the fair you cousin george come to the bank with ten pound and tell he how you have spend the ten pound i give you to pay in and that he bring the money he own savings to replace what you have gamble away and bellamy add that under all the circumstance he do not feel justified in place it to my credit what have you to say to that what have i to say i have to say that i do not believe a word of it if george have mean to do I a good turn he would have pay the money in and say nothing to bellamy about it why will not you trust I a little more father i tell you that you be turn I into a scoundrel i be be twist up into a net of lie till i be oblige to lie myself to keep clear of ruin i know what this sneak be at he want to work you into cut I out of the property which should be mine by right he know you weakness -- my weakness sir -- my weakness thunder he father strike he gold-headed cane on to the stone what do you mean by that hush uncle he mean nothing break in george mean nothing then for a idle speech it be one that may cost he dear look you here philip caresfoot i know very well that we family have be quite as remarkable for its vice as its virtue but for the last two hundred and fifty year we have be gentleman and you be not a gentleman we have not be thief and you have prove yourself a thief we have speak the truth and you be what you be so fond of call you cousin who be worth two of you a liar now listen however imperious i may have grow in my old age i can still respect the man who thwart I even though i hate he but i despise the man who deceive I as i despise you my dear son philip -- and i tell you this and i beg you to lay it to heart that if ever again i find that you have deceive I by heaven i will disinherit you in favor of -- _ oh oh _ and the old man fall back against the gray wall press he hand to he breast and with the cold perspiration start on to he pallid countenance both the lad spring forward but before they reach he he have recover himself it be nothing he say in he ordinary gentle voice a trifling indisposition i wish you both good morning and beg you to bear my word in mind when he be fairly go george come up to he cousin and lay he hand upon he arm why do you insist upon quarrel with I philip it always end like this you always get the worst of it but philip 's only reply be to shake he roughly off and to vanish through the door towards the lake george regard he depart form with a peculiar smile which be render even more peculiar by the distortion of he swollen feature chapter ii it be difficult to imagine any study that would prove more fascinating in itself or more instructive in its issue than the examination of the lead characteristic of individual family as display through a series of generation but it be a subject that from its very nature be more or less unapproachable since it be but little that we know even of we immediate ancestor occasionally in glance at the crack square of canvas many of which can not even boast a name but which alone remain to speak of the real and active life the joy and grief the sin and virtue that centre in the original of those hard daub and of ourselves we may light upon a face that about six generation since be the counterpart of the little boy upon we shoulder or the daughter standing at we side in the same way too partly through tradition and partly by other means we be sometimes able to trace in ourselves and in we child the strong development of characteristic that distinguish the race century ago if local tradition and such record of they individual life as remain be worthy of any faith it be beyond a doubt that the caresfoot of bratham abbey have hand down they own hard and peculiar cast of character from father to son unaffected in the main by the continual introduction of alien blood on the side of the mother the history of the caresfoot family have nothing remarkable about it they have be yeomen at bratham from time immemorial perhaps ever since the village have become a geographical fact but it be on the dissolution of the monastery that they first become of any importance in the county bratham abbey which have share the common fate be grant by henry viii to a certain courtier sir charle varry by name for two year the owner never come near he new possession but one day he appear in the village and ride to the house of farmer caresfoot which be its most respectable tenement he beg he to show he the abbey house and the land attach it be a dark November afternoon and by the time the farmer and he wearied guest have cross the soaked land and reach the great gray house the damp and shadow of the night have begin to curtain it and to render its appearance forsake as it be inexpressibly dreary and lonesome damp here my friend be it not say sir charle with a shudder look towards the lake into which the rain be splash you be right it be and lonely too now that the old monk have go ay but they do say that the house be mostly full of the spirit of the dead and the yeoman sink he voice to a awed whisper sir charle cross himself and mutter i can well believe it and then address he companion -- you do not know of any man who would buy a abbey with all its rights and franchise do you friend not rightly sir the land be so poor it have no heart in it it doth scarce repay the tillage and what the house be you may see the curse of the monk be on it but still sir if you have a mind to be rid of the place i have a little lay by and a natural love for the land have be breed on it and take the color of my mind and my stubby growth therefrom and i will give you -- and this astutest of all the caresfoot whisper a very small sum into sir charle ' ear you price be very small good friend it doth almost vanish into nothing and methink the land that rear you can not be so unkind as you would have I think the monk do not love bad land but yet if thou hast it in the gold i will take it it will pay off a debt or two and i care not for the burden of the land and so farmer caresfoot become the lawful owner of bratham abbey with its two advowson its royal franchise of treasure-trove and deodand and more than a thousand acre of the best land in marlshire the same astuteness that have enable this wise progenitor to acquire the estate enable he descendant to stick tightly to it and though like other family they have at time meet with reverse they never lose they grip of the abbey property during the course of the first half of the nineteenth century the land increase largely in value and its acreage be considerably add to by the father of the present owner a man of frugal mind but with the family mania for the collection of all sort of plate strongly develop but it be philip 's father devil caresfoot who have during he fifty year ' tenure of the property raise the family to its present opulent condition firstly by a strict attention to business and the large accumulation result from he practice of always live upon half he income and secondly by he marriage late in middle life with miss bland the heiress of the neighbouring isleworth estate that stretch over some two thousand acre of land this lady who be philip 's mother do not live long to enjoy she wealth and station she husband never speak a rough word to she and yet it be no exaggeration to say that she die of fear of he the marriage have be one of convenience not of affection indeed poor anna bland have secretly admire the curate at isleworth and hate mr caresfoot and he glittering eye but she marry he for all that to feel that till she die that glance be always play round she like a rapier in the hand of a skilled fencer and very soon she do die mr caresfoot receive she last word and wish with the same exquisite and unmoved politeness that he have extend to every remark she have make to he in the course of they married life have satisfactorily eye mr caresfoot off into a better world she husband give up all idea of further matrimonial venture and set himself to heap up riches but a little before he wife 's death and just after he son 's birth a event have occur in the family that have disturb he not a little he father have leave two son himself and a brother many year he junior now this brother be very dear to mr caresfoot he affection for he be the one weak point in he armor nor be it render any the less sincere but rather the more touching by the fact that its object be little better than half-witted it be therefore easy to imagine he distress and anger when he hear that a woman who have till shortly before be kitchen-maid at the abbey house and be now live in the village have be confine of a son which she fix upon he brother whose wife she declare herself to be investigation only bring out the truth of the story he weak-minded brother have be entrap into a glaring _ mesalliance _ but mr caresfoot prove himself equal to the occasion so soon as he sister-in-law as it please he to call she sardonically have sufficiently recover he call upon she what take place at the visit never transpire but next day mr e caresfoot leave she native place never to return the child remain with the father or rather with the uncle that boy be george at the time when this story open both he parent be dead : he father from illness result from entire failure of brain power the mother from drink whether it be that he consider the circumstance of the lad 's birth entitle he to peculiar consideration or that he transfer to he the affection he bear he father the result be that he nephew be quite as dear if not even dearer to mr caresfoot than he own son not however that he allow he preference to be apparent save in the negative way that he be blind to fault in george that he be sufficiently quick to note in philip to observer this partiality seem the more strange when they think upon philip 's bonny face and form and then note how the weak-brained father and coarse-blooded mother have leave they mark in george 's thick lip small restless eye pallid complexion and loose-jointed form when philip shake off he cousin 's grasp and vanish towards the lake he do so with bitter wrath and hatred in he heart for he see but too clearly that he have deeply injured himself in he father 's estimation and what be more he feel that so much as he have sink he side of the balance by so much he have raise up that of george he be inculpate a bellamy come upon the scene to save george and what be worse a untruthful bellamy he be the aggressor and george the meek in spirit with the soft answer that turneth away wrath it be intolerable he hate he father he hate george there be no justice in the world and he have not wit to play rogue with such a one as he cousin appearance be always against he he hate everybody and then he begin to think that there be in the very next parish somebody whom he do not hate but who on the contrary interested he and be always ready to listen to he trouble and he also become aware of the fact that whilst he mind have be think he leg have be walk and that he be very near the abode of that person -- almost at its gate in short he pause and look at he watch it have stop at half-past eleven the one blow that george have succeed in plant upon he have land on it to the great detriment of both the watch and the striker 's knuckle but the sun tell he that it be about half-past twelve not too early to call so he open the gate and advance up a avenue of old beech to a square red-brick house of the time of queen anne boldly ring the bell be miss lee at home yes miss lee be in the greenhouse perhaps mr philip would step into the garden which mr philip do accordingly how do you do philip i be delighted to see you you have just come in time to help in the slaughter slaughter slaughter of what -- a pig no green fly i be go to kill thousand you cruel girl i daresay it be cruel but i do not care grump always say that i have no heart and so far as green fly be concerned grump be certainly right now just look at this lily it be a auratum i give three-and-six -lrb- out of my own money -rrb- for that bulb last autumn and now the bloom be not worth twopence all through green fly if i be a man i declare i should swear please swear for I philip go outside and do it so that i may not have it on my conscience but now for vengeance oh i say i forget you know i suppose i ought to be look very sorry -- why what be the matter any one dead oh no so much better than that _ it be get grump _ get she what have get she what be ` it ' why chancery of course i always call chancery ` it ' i would not take its name in vain for world i be too much afraid i might be make to ` show a cause why ' and then be lock up for contempt which frequently happen after you have try to ` show a cause ' that be what have happen to grump she be now show a cause shortly she will be lock up when she come out if she ever do come out i think that she will avoid ward in chancery in future she will have too much sympathy with they and too much practical experience of they position but what on earth do you mean marium what have happen to miss gregson -lrb- _ anglice _ grump -rrb- well you remember one of my guardian or rather he wife get ` it ' to appoint she my chaperon but my other guardian want to appoint somebody else and after take eighteen month to do it he have move the court to show that grump be not a ` fit and proper person ' the idea of call grump improper she nearly faint at it and swear that whether she live through it or whether she do not she would never come within a mile of I or any other ward if she could help it not even the ward of a hospital i tell she to be careful or she would be ` commit contempt ' which frighten she so that she hardly speak again till she leave yesterday poor grump i expect she be on bread and water now but if she make herself half as disagreeable to the vice-chancellor as she do to I i do not believe that they will keep she long she 'll wear the gaoler out she will wear the wall out she will wear ` it ' down to the bone and then they will let she loose upon the world again why there be the bell for lunch and not a single green fly the less never mind i will do for they to-morrow how it would add to she suffering in she lonely cell if she could see we go to a _ tete-a-tete _ lunch come on philip come quick or the cutlet will get cold and i hate cold cutlet and off she trip follow by the laughing philip who by the way be now look quite handsome again marium lee be not very pretty at she then age -- just eighteen -- but she be a perfect specimen of a young english country girl fresh as a rose and sound as a bell and endowed besides with a quick wit and a ready sympathy she be essentially one of that class of englishwoman who make the english upper middle class what it be -- one of the finest and soundest in the world philip follow she into the house think that she be charming nor be a caresfoot and therefore have a considerable eye to the main chance do the fact of she be the heiress to fifteen hundred a year in land detract from she charm the cutlet be excellent and marium eat three and be very comical about the depart grump indeed anybody not acquaint with the circumstance would have gather that that excellent lady be to be shortly put to the question philip be not quite so merry he be oppress both by recollection of what have happen and apprehension of what might happen what be the matter philip she ask when they have leave the table to sit under the tree on the lawn i can see that something be the matter tell I all about it philip and philip tell she what have happen that morning lay bare all he heart-ache and not even conceal he evil deed when he have do she ponder awhile tap she little foot upon the turf philip she say at last in quite a changed voice i do not think that you be be well treat i do not think that you cousin mean kindly by you but -- but i do not think that you have behave rightly either i do not like that about the ten pound and i think that you should not have touch george he be not so strong as you please try to do as you father -- dear I i be sure i do not wonder that you be afraid of he i be -- tell you and regain he affection and make it up with george and if you get into any more trouble come and tell I about they before you do anything foolish for though accord to grump i be silly enough two head be better than one the tear stand in the lad 's brown eye as he listen to she he gulp they down however and say -- you be awfully kind to I you be the only friend i have sometimes i think that you be a angel nonsense philip if ` it ' hear you talk like that you would join grump do not let I hear any more such stuff but though she speak sharply somehow she do not look displeased i must be off he say at length i promise to go with my father to see a new building on reynold 's farm i have only twenty minute to get home and rise they go into the house through a french window opening on to the lawn in the dining-room he turn and after a moment 's hesitation stutter out -- marium do not be angry with I but may i give you a kiss she blush vividly how dare you suggest such a thing -- but -- but as grump have go and there be no new grump to refer to and therefore i can only consult my own wish perhaps if you really wish to philip why philip you may and he do when he be go she lean she head against the cold marble mantelpiece i do love he she murmur yes that i do chapter iii philip be not very fond of take walk with he father since he find that in nine case out of ten they afford opportunity for inculcation of fact of the driest description with reference to estate management or to the narration by he parent of little history of which he conduct upon some recent occasion would adorn the moral on this particular occasion the prospect be particularly unpleasant for he father would he be well aware overflow with awful politeness indeed after the scene of the morning it could not be otherwise oh how much rather would he have spend that lovely afternoon with marium lee dear marium he would go and see she again the very next day when he arrive some ten minute after time in the antler-hung hall of the abbey house he find he father stand watch in hand exactly under the big clock as though he be determine to make a note by double entry of every pass second when i ask you to walk with I this afternoon philip i if my memory do not deceive I be careful to say that i have no wish to interfere with any prior engagement i be aware how little interest compare to you cousin george you take in the estate and i have no wish to impose a uncongenial task but as you kindly volunteer to accompany I i regret that you do not find it convenient to be punctual to the time you fix i have now wait for you for seventeen minute and let I tell you that at my time of life i can not afford to lose seventeen minute may i ask what have delay you this long speech have give philip the opportunity of recover the breath that he have lose in run home he reply promptly -- i have be lunch with miss lee oh indeed then i no longer wonder that you keep I wait and i must say that in this particular i commend you taste miss lee be a young lady of good family good manners and good means if she estate go with this property it would complete as pretty a five thousand acre of mixed soil as there be in the county those be beautiful old meadow of hers beautiful perhaps -- but here the old man check himself on leave the house they have pass together down a walk call the tunnel walk on account of the arch bough of the lime-tree that interlace themselves overhead at the end of this avenue and on the border of the lake there stand a enormous but still grow oak know as caresfoot 's staff it be the old squire 's favorite tree and the best top piece of timber for many mile round i wonder say philip by way of make a little pleasant conversation why that tree be call caresfoot 's staff you ignorance astonish I philip but i suppose that there be some people who can live for year in a place and yet imbibe nothing of its tradition perhaps you know that the monk be drive out of these ruin by henry viii well on the spot where that tree now stand there grow a still greater oak a giant tree its trunk measure sixteen load of timber which have as tradition say be plant by the first prior of the abbey when england be still saxon the night the monk leave a great gale rage over england it be in October when the tree be full of leaf and its fiercest gust tear the great oak from its roothold and fling it into the lake look do you see that rise in the sand there by the edge of the deep pool in the eight foot water that be there it be suppose to lie well the whole country-side say that it be a sign that the monk have go for ever from bratham abbey and the country-side be right but when you ancestor old yeoman caresfoot buy this place and come to live here in a year when there be a great black frost that set the water of the lake like one of the new-fangled road he ask he neighbor ay and he labor folk to come and dine with he and drink to the success of he purchase it be a proud day for he and when dinner be do and they be all mellow with strong ale he bid they step down to the border of the lake as he would have they be witness to a ceremony when they reach the spot they see a curious sight for there on a strong dray and drag by farmer caresfoot 's six best horse be a oak of fifty year ' growth come across the ice earth root and all on that spot where it now stand there have be a great hole ten foot deep by fourteen foot square dig to receive it and into that hole caresfoot staff be tilted and lever off the dray and when it have be plant and the frozen earth well trodden in you grandfather in the ninth degree bring he guest back to the old banqueting-hall and make a speech which as it be the first and last he ever make be long remember in the country-side it be put into modern english something like this : ` neighbor -- prior 's oak have go into the water and folk say that it be for a sign that the monk would never come back to bratham and that it be the lord 's wind that put it there and neighbor as ye know the broad bratham land and the fat marsh down by the brook pass by king 's grant to a man that know not clay from loam or layer from pasturage and from he they pass by the lord 's will to I as i have ask you here to-day to celebrate and now neighbor i have a mind and though it seem to you but a childish thing yet i have a mind and have set myself to fulfil it when i be yet a little lad and drive the swine out to feed on the hill yonder when the acorn have fall afore farmer gyrton 's father have gracious leave from the feoffee to put up the fence that doth now so sorely vex we i find one day a great acorn as big as a dow 's egg and of a rich and wondrous brown and this acorn i bear home and plant in kind earth in the corner of my dad 's garden thinking that it would grow and that one day i would hew its growth and use it for a staff now that be fifty long year ago lad and there where grow prior 's oak there neighbor i have set my staff to-day the monk have tell we how in israel every man plant he fig and he vine for the fig i know not rightly what that be but for the vine i will plant no creep clinging vine but a hearty english oak that if they do but give it good room to breathe in and save they heirloom from the axe shall cast shade and grow acorn and burst into leaf in the spring and grow naked in the winter when ten generation of we child and we child 's child shall have mix they dust with ours yonder in the graveyard and now neighbor i have talk too long though i be better at do than talk but ye will even forgive I for i will not talk to you again though on this the great day of my life i be mind to speak but i will bid you every man pledge a health to the caresfoot 's staff and ask a prayer that so long as it shall push its leaf so long may the race of my loin be here to sit beneath its shade and even mayhap when the corn be ripe and the moon be up and they heart grow soft towards the past to talk with kinsman or with sweetheart of the old man who strike it in this kindly soil ' the old squire 's face grow tender as he tell this legend of the forget dead and philip 's young imagination summon up the strange old-world scene of the crowd of rustic gather in the snow and frost round this very tree philip say he father suddenly you will hold the yeoman 's staff one day be like it of a oaken english heart and you will defy wind and weather as it have do and as you forbear have do come we must go on by the way philip he continue after a while you will remember what i say to you this morning -- i hope that you will remember it though i speak in anger -- never try to deceive I again or you will regret it and now i have something to say to you i wish you to go to college and receive a education that will fit you to hold the position you must in the course of nature one day fill in the county the oxford term begin in a few day and you have for some year be enter at magdalen college i do not expect you to be a scholar but i do expect you to brush off you rough way and you local idea and to learn to become such a person both in you conduct and you mind as a gentleman of you station should be be george to go to college too no i have speak to he on the subject and he do not wish it he say very wisely that with he small prospects he would rather spend the time in learn how to earn he live so he be go to be article to the roxham lawyer foster and son or rather foster and bellamy for young bellamy who be a lawyer by profession come here this morning not to speak about you but on a message from the firm to say that he be now a junior partner and that they will be very happy to take george as a articled clerk he be a hard-working shrewd young man and it will be a great advantage to george to have he advice and example before he philip assented and go on in silence reflect on the curious change in he immediate prospects that this walk have bring to light he be much rejoice at the prospect of lose sight of george for a while and be sufficiently intelligent to appreciate the advantage social and mental that the university would offer he but it strike he that there be two thing which he do not like about the scheme the first of these be that whilst he be pursue he academical study george would practically be leave on the spot -- for roxham be only six mile off -- to put in motion any scheme he might have devise and philip be sure that he have devise scheme and the second that oxford be a long way from marium lee however he keep he objection to himself in due course they reach the building they have set out to examine and the old squire have settle what be to be do and what be to be leave undo with characteristic promptitude and shrewdness they turn homewards in pass through the shrubbery on they way back to the house they suddenly come upon a stolid-looking lad of about fifteen emerge from a side-walk with a nest full of young blackbird in he hand now if there be one thing in this world more calculated than another to rouse the most objectionable trait of the old squire 's character into rapid action it be the discovery of boy and more especially bird-nesting boy in he plantation in the first place he hate trespasser and in the second it be one of he simple pleasure to walk in the early morning and listen to the singing of the bird that swarm around accordingly at the obnoxious sight he stop suddenly and draw himself up to he full height address the tremble youth in he sweetest voice you name be i believe -- brady -- jim brady -- correct I if i be wrong -- and you have come here you -- you -- young -- villain -- to steal my bird the frightened boy walk slowly backwards follow by the old man with he fiery eye fix upon he face till at last concussion against the trunk of a great tree prevent further retreat here he stand for about thirty seconds writhe under the glance that seem to pierce he through and through till at last he could stand it no longer but fling himself on the ground roaring : oh do not ee squire do not ee now look at I with that ` ere eye take and thrash I squire but do not ee fix I so i hay not have no more nor twenty this year and a nest of spinx and tom smith he be have fifty-two and a young owl oh oh enrage beyond measure at this last piece of information mr caresfoot take he victim at he word and cease he ocular experiment lay into the less honorable portion of he form with the gold-headed malacca cane in a way that astonish the prostrate jim though he be afterwards hear to declare that the squire 's cane war not not nothing compare with the squire 's eye which wear a hot coal it wear and frizzle you innards as sich when jim brady have depart never to return again and the old man have recover he usual suavity of manner he remark to he son : there be some curious property in the human eye a property that be i believe very much develop in my own do you observe the effect of my glance upon that boy i be try a experiment on he i remember it be always the same with you poor mother she could never bear I to look at she philip make no reply but he think that if she have be the object of experiment of that nature it be not very wonderful shortly after they return home he receive a note from miss lee it run thus : my dear philip what _ do _ you think just after you have go away i get by the mid-day post which jone -lrb- the butcher -rrb- bring from roxham several letter amongst they one from grump and one from uncle tom grump have show a cause why ` it ' say she be not a improper person but for all that she be so angry with uncle tom that she will not come back but have accept a offer to go to canada as companion to a lady so farewell grump now for uncle tom ` it ' suggest that i should live with some of my relation till i come of age and pay they four hundred a year which i think a good deal i be sure it can not cost four hundred a year to feed I though i have such a appetite i have no idea they be all so fond of I before they all want I to come and live with they except aunt chamber who you know life in jersey uncle tom say in he letter that he shall be glad if he daughter can have the advantage of my example and of study my polished manners -lrb- just fancy _ my _ polish manners and i know because little tom who be a brick tell I that only last year he hear he father tell emily -- that be the eldest -- that i be a dowdy snub-nosed ill-mannered miss but that she must keep in with I and flatter I up -rrb- no i will not live with uncle tom and i will tell ` it ' so if i must leave my home i will go to aunt chamber at jersey jersey be a beautiful place for flower and one learn french there without the trouble of learn it and i like aunt chamber and she have no child and nothing but the memory of a dear depart but i do not like leave home and feel very much inclined to cry _ hang _ the court of chancery and uncle tom and he interference too -- _ there _ i suppose you can not find time to come over to-morrow morning to see I off good-bye dear philip you affectionate friend marium lee philip do manage to find time next morning and come back look very disconsolate chapter iv philip go to college in due course and george depart to learn he business as a lawyer in roxham but it will not be necessary for we to enter into the detail of they respective career during this period of they life at college philip do fairly well and be a caresfoot do not run into debt he be as he great bodily strength give promise of a first-class athlete and for two year stroke the magdalen boat nor do he altogether neglect he book but he reading be of a desultory and out-of-the-way order and much direct towards the investigation of mystical subject fairly well like amongst the man with whom he mix he could hardly be call popular he temperament be too uncertain for that at time he be the gayest of the gay and then when the fit take he he would be plunge into a state of gloomy depression that might last for day he companion to whom he mystical study be a favorite jest be wont to assert that on these occasion he be prepare for a visit from he familiar but the joke be one that he never could be prevail upon to appreciate the fact of the matter be that these fit of gloom be constitutional with he and very possibly have they origin in the state of he mother 's mind before he birth when she whole thought be color by she morbid and fanciful terror of she husband and she frantic anxiety to conciliate he during the three year that he spend at college philip saw but little of george since when he happen to be down at bratham which be not often for he spend most of he vacation abroad george avoid come there as much as possible indeed there be a tacit agreement between the two young man that they would see as little of each other as might be convenient but though he do not see much of he himself philip be none the less aware that george 's influence over he father be if anything on the increase the old squire 's letter be full of he and of the admirable way in which he manage the estate for it be now practically in he hand indeed to he surprise and somewhat to he disgust he find that george begin to be speak of indifferently with himself as the young squire long before he college day have come to a end philip have determine that he would do he best as soon as opportunity offer to reduce he cousin to he proper place not by the violent means to which he have resort in other day but rather by show himself to be equally capable equally assiduous and equally respectful and affectionate at last the day come when he be to bid farewell to oxford for good and in due course he find himself in a second-class railway carriage -- think it useless to waste money he always go second -- and bind for roxham just before the train leave the platform at paddington philip be agreeably surprise out of he meditation by the entry into he carriage of a extremely elegant and stately young lady a foreigner as he judge from she strong accent when she address the porter with the innate gallantry of twenty-one he immediately lay himself out to make the acquaintance of one possess of such proud yet melting blue eye such lovely hair and a figure that would not have disgrace diana and with this view set himself to render she such little service as one fellow-traveller can offer to another they be accept reservedly at first then gratefully and before long the reserve break down entirely and this very handsome pair drop into a conversation as animated as the lady 's broken english would allow the lady tell he that she name be hilda von holtzhausen that she be of a german family and have come to england to enter a family as companion in order to obtain a perfect knowledge of the english language she have already be to france and acquire french when she know english then she have be promise a place as school-mistress under government in she own country she father and mother be dead and she have no brother or sister and very few friend where be she go to she be go to a place call roxham here it be write on the ticket she be go to be companion to a dear young lady very rich like all the english whom she have meet when she have travel with she french family to jersey a miss lee you do not say so say philip have she come back to rewtham what do you then know she yes -- that be i use to three year ago i live in the next parish ah then perhaps you be the gentleman of whom i have hear she to speak mr car-es-foot whom she do seem to appear to love be not that the word -- to be very fond you know philip laugh blush and acknowledge he identity with the gentleman whom miss lee do seem to appear to love oh i be glad then we shall be friend and see each other often -- shall we not he declare unreservedly that she should see he very often from fraulein von holtzhausen philip gather in the course of they journey a good many particulars about miss lee it appear that have attain she majority she be come back to live at she old home at rewtham whither she have try to persuade she aunt chamber to accompany she but without success that lady be too much attach to jersey to leave it during the course of a long stay on the island the two girl have become fast friend and the friendship have culminate in a offer be make by marium lee to fraulein von holtzhausen to come and live with she as a companion a proposal that exactly suit the latter the mention of miss lee 's name have awaken pleasant recollection in philip 's mind recollection that at any other time might have tend towards the sentimental but when under fire from the blue eye of this stately foreigner it be impossible for he to feel sentimental about anybody save herself the journey be over all too soon be the secret thought of each as they step on to the roxham platform before they have finally say good-bye however a young lady with a dainty figure in a shady hat and pink and white dress come run along the platform hilda hilda here i be how do you do dear welcome home and she be about to seal she welcome with a kiss when she eye fall upon philip standing by oh philip she cry with a blush do not you know I have i change much i should have know you anywhere and i be glad to see you awfully glad -lrb- excuse the slang but it be such a relief to be able to say ` awful ' without be pull up by aunt chamber -rrb- just think it be three year since we meet do you remember grump how do i look do you think you will like I as much as you use to i think that you be look the same dear girl that you always use to look only you have grow very pretty and it be not possible that i shall like you more than i use to i think they must teach you to pay compliment at oxford philip she answer flush with pleasure but it be all rubbish for you to say that i be pretty because i know i be not -- and then confidentially glance round to see that there be nobody within hearing -lrb- hilda be engage with a porter in look after she thing -rrb- : just look at my nose and you will soon change you mind it be broader and flatter and snubbier than ever i consider that i have get a bone to pick with providence about that nose ah here come hilda be not she lovely there be beauty for you if you like she have not get a nose come and show we to the carriage you will come and lunch with we to-morrow will not you i be so glad to get back to the old house again and i mean to have such a garden ` life be short and joy be fleeting ' as aunt chamber always say so i mean to make the best of it whilst it last i see you father yesterday he be a dear old man though he have such awful eye i never feel so happy in my life as i do now good-bye one o'clock and she be go leave philip with something to think about philip 's reception at home be cordial and reassuring he find he father considerably age in appearance but as handsome and upright as ever and to all appearance heartily glad to see he i be glad to see you back my boy he say you come to take you proper place if you look at I you will see that you will not have long to wait before you take mine i can not last much longer philip i feel that eighty-two be a good age to have reach i have have my time and put the property in order and now i suppose i must make room i go with the clerk old jakes and mark out my grave yesterday there be a nice little spot the other side of the stone that they say mark where old yeoman caresfoot who plant caresfoot 's staff lay he bone and that be where i wish to be put in he good company do not forget that when the time come philip there be room for another if you care to keep it for yourself but perhaps you will prefer the vault you must not talk of die yet father you will live many year yet no philip perhaps one perhaps two not more than two perhaps a month perhaps not a day my life hang on a thread now and he point to he heart it may snap any day if it get a strain by the way philip you see that cupboard open it now you see that stoppered bottle with the red label good well now if ever you see I take with a attack of the heart -lrb- i have have one since you be away you know and it nearly carry I off -rrb- you run for that as hard as you can go and give it I to drink half at a time it be a tremendous restorative of some sort and old caley say that if i do not take it when the next attack come there 'll be a end of ` devil caresfoot ' and he rap he cane energetically on the oak floor and so philip i want you to go about and make yourself thoroughly acquaint with the property so that you may be able to take thing over when i die without any hitch i hope that you will be careful and do well by the land remember that a big property like this be a sacred trust and now there be two more thing that i will take this opportunity to say a word to you about first i see that you and you cousin george do not get on well and it grieve I you have always have a false idea of george always and think that he be underhand nothing could be more mistaken than such a notion george be a most estimable young man and my dear brother 's only son i wish you would try to remember that philip -- blood be thicker than water you know -- and you will be the only two caresfoot leave when i be go now perhaps you may think that i intend enrich george at you expense but that be not so take this key and open the top drawer of that secretaire and give I that bundle this be my will if you care to look over it and can understand it -- which be more than i can -- you will see that everything be leave to you with the exception of that outlying farm at holston those three essex farm that i buy two year ago and twelve thousand pound in cash of course as you know the abbey house and the land immediately round be entail -- it have always be the custom to entail they for many generation there put it back and now the last thing be i want you to get married philip i should like to see a grandchild in the house before i die i want you to marry marium lee i like the girl she come of a good old marlshire stock -- we family marry into hers in the year 1703 besides she property would put yours into a ring-fence she be a sharp girl too and quite pretty enough for a wife i hope you will think it over philip yes father but perhaps she will not have I i be go to lunch there to-morrow i do not think you need be afraid philip but i will not keep you any longer shake hand my boy you 'll perhaps think of you old father kindly when you come to stand in he shoe i hope you will philip we have have many a quarrel and sometimes i have be wrong but i have always wish to do my duty by you my boy do not forget to make the best of you time at lunch to-morrow philip go out of he father 's study considerably touch by the kindness and consideration with which he have be treat and not a little relieved to find he position with reference to he succession to the estate so much better than he have anticipate and he cousin george 's so much worse that red-haired fox have plot in vain he think with secret exultation and then he set himself to consider the desirability of fall in with he father 's wish as regard marriage of marium he be as the reader be aware very fond indeed a few year before he have be in love with she or something very like it he know too that she would make he a very good wife and the match be one that in every way commend itself to he common sense and he interest yes he would certainly take he father 's advice but every time he say this to himself -- and he say it pretty often that evening -- there would arise before he mind 's eye a vision of the sweet blue eye of miss lee 's stately companion what eye they be to be sure it make philip 's blood run warm and quick merely to think of they indeed he could almost find it in he heart to wish that hilda be marium and marium be in hilda 's shoe what between thought of the young lady he have set himself to marry and of the young lady he do not mean to marry but whose eye he admire philip do not sleep so well as usual that night chapter v philip do not neglect to go to luncheon at rewtham house and a very pleasant luncheon it be indeed it would have be difficult for he to have say which he find the pleasantest : marium 's cheerful chatter and flattering preference or hilda 's sweet and gracious presence after luncheon at marium 's invitation he give fraulein von holtzhausen she first lesson in write in english character and to speak truth he find the task of guide she fair hand through the mystery of the english alphabet a by no means uncongenial occupation when he come away he admiration of hilda 's blue eye be more pronounced than ever but on the other hand so be he conviction that he would be very foolish if he allow it to interfere with he intention of make marium lee he wife he who would drive two woman thus in double harness must need have a light hand and a ready lash and it be certainly to the credit of philip 's cleverness that he manage so well as he do for as time go on he discover he position to be this both hilda and marium be in love with he the former deeply and silently the latter openly and ostensibly now however gratify this fact might be to he pride it be in some way a thorny discovery since he dare not visibly pay he attention to either for he part he return hilda von holtzhausen 's devotion to a degree that surprise himself he passion for she burnt he like a fire utterly searing away the trace of he former affection for marium lee under these circumstance most young man of twenty-one would have throw prudence to the wind and acknowledge either by act or word the object of they love but not so philip who even at that age be by no means deficient in the characteristic caution of the caresfoot family he see clearly that he father would never consent to he marriage with hilda nor to speak truth do he himself at all like the idea of lose miss lee and she estate on the other hand he know hilda 's proud and jealous mind she be no melting beauty who would sigh and submit to a affront but for all she gracious way at heart a haughty woman who if she reign at all would reign like alexander unrivalled and alone that she be well aware of she friend 's tendresse for philip the latter very shortly guess indeed as he suspect marium be in the habit of confide to she all she hope and fear connect with himself a suspicion that make he very careful in he remark to that young lady the early summer pass away whilst philip be still think over he position and the face of the country be blush with all the glory of July when one afternoon he find himself as he do pretty frequently in the shady drawing-room at miss lee 's as he enter the sound of voice tell he that there be other visitor beside himself and as soon as he eye have grow accustomed to the light he see he cousin george together with he partner mr bellamy and a lady with whom he be not acquaint george have improve in appearance somewhat since we last see he meeting with severe treatment at he cousin 's hand the face have fill up a little with the result that the nose do not look so hooked nor the thick lip so coarse and sensual the hair however be as red as ever and as for the small light-blue eye they twinkle with the add sharpness and lustre that four year of such experience of the shady side of humanity as can be gather in a lawyer 's office be able to give to the student of man and manners so soon as philip have say how-do-you-do to marium and hilda give to each a gentle pressure of the hand george greet he with warmth how be you philip delighted to see you how be my uncle bellamy see he this morning and think that he do not look well i certainly do think mr philip say the gentleman allude to a very young-looking apple-faced little man with a timid manner who stand in the background nervously rub he dry hand together -- i certainly do think that the squire look age when i see he this morning well you see mr bellamy eighty-two be a good age be it not say philip cheerfully yes mr philip a good age a very good age for the _ next heir _ and mr bellamy chuckle softly somewhere down in he throat and retreat a little he be get facetious break in george that marriage have do that for he by the way philip do you know mr bellamy she have only be down here a fortnight you know what no then you have a pleasure to come -lrb- raise he voice so that it might be hear at the other end of the room -rrb- a very clever woman and as handsome as she be clever indeed i must ask you to introduce I presently mr bellamy i only recently hear that you be marry mr bellamy blush and twist and be about to speak when george cut in again no i dare say you do not sly dog bellamy do you know what he do i introduce he to the lady when we be up in town together last christmas i be dreadfully hard hit myself i can assure you and as soon as my back be turn he go and cut I out of the water -- and turn my adore into mr bellamy what be you take my name in vain about mr caresfoot say a rich low voice behind they bless I anne how softly you move you quite startle I say little mr bellamy put on he spectacles in a agitate manner my dear a wife like a embody conscience should always be at she husband 's shoulder especially when he do not know it bellamy make no reply but look as though the sentiment be one of which he do not approve meantime the lady repeat she question to george and the two fall into a banter conversation philip have drop back a little have a opportunity of carefully observe mr bellamy a occupation not without interest for she be certainly worthy of notice about twenty year of age and of medium height she figure be so finely proportion and so roomily make that it give she the appearance of be taller than she really be the head be set squarely on the shoulder the hair be cut short and cluster in ringlet over the low broad brow whilst the clearly carve egyptian feature and square chin give the whole face a curious expression of resoluteness and power the eye be heavily-lidded and greyish-green in hue with enormously large dark pupil that have a strange habit of expand and contract without apparent reason gaze at she philip be at a loss to know whether this woman so bizarrely beautiful fascinate or repel he indeed neither then nor at any future time do he succeed in decide the question whilst he be still contemplate and wonder how bellamy of all people in the world have manage to marry such a woman and what previous acquaintance george have have with she he see the lady whisper something to he cousin who at once turn and introduce he philip he say let I introduce you to the most charming lady of my acquaintance mr bellamy philip bow and express himself delighted whilst the lady curtsy with a mixture of grace and dignity that become she infinitely well you cousin have often speak to I of you mr caresfoot but he never tell I -- here she hesitate and break off what do he never tell you mr bellamy nothing to my disadvantage i hope on the contrary if you wish to know she say in that tone of flattering frankness which be sometimes so charming in a woman 's mouth he never tell I that you be young and handsome i fancied you forty at least i should dearly like to tell you mr bellamy what my cousin george never tell _ I _ but i will not for fear i should make bellamy jealous jealousy mr caresfoot be a luxury that _ my _ husband be not allow to indulge in it be very well for lover but what be a compliment in a lover become a impertinence in a husband but if i keep you here much longer i shall be draw the enmity of miss lee and -- yes of fraulein von holtzhausen too on to my devoted head and as that be the only sort of jealousy i have any fear of or indeed any respect for be as it be the expression of the natural abhorrence of one woman for another i have rather avoid it philip follow the direction of she sleepy eye and see that both miss lee and hilda appear to be put out the former be talk absently to mr bellamy and glance continually in the direction of that gentleman 's wife the latter too whilst appear to listen to some compliment from george be gaze at mr bellamy with a curious look of dislike and apprehension in she face you see what i mean fraulein von holtzhausen actually look as though she be afraid of I can you fancy any one be afraid of I except my husband of course -- for as you know when a woman be talk of man she husband be _ always _ excepted come we must be go but mr caresfoot bend a little nearer if you will accept it from such a stranger i want to give you a bit of advice -- make you choice pretty soon or you will lose they both what do you mean -- how do you know -- i mean nothing at all or just as much as you like and for the rest i use my eye come let we join the other a few minute later hilda put down she work and declare that she feel hot throw open the french window and go out into the garden whither on some pretext or other philip follow she what a lovely woman that be say mr bellamy with enthusiasm to miss lee as soon as philip be out of earshot she _ tout ensemble _ positively kill one i feel plain and dowdy as a milkmaid alongside of a court-beauty when i be in the room with she do not you miss lee oh i do not know i never think about it but of course she be lovely and i be plain so there be no possibility of comparison between we well i think you rate yourself rather low if you will allow I to say so but most woman would but ` poorly satisfy the sight ' of a man when she be present i know that i should not care to trust my admirer -lrb- if i have one -rrb- however devoted he might be for a single day in she company would you i really do not know what _ do _ you mean mean miss lee why i mean nothing at all what should i mean except that beauty be a magnet which attract all man it serve they for a standard of morality and a test of right and wrong man be different from woman if a man be faithful to one of we it be only because no other woman of sufficient charm have become between he and we you can never trust a man what dreadful idea you have do you think so i hope not i only speak what i have observe take the case of fraulein von holtzhausen for instance do you not notice that whilst she be in the room the eye of the three gentleman be all fix upon she and as soon as she leave it one of they follow she as the other would have do have they not be forestall one can not blame they they be simply follow a natural law any other man would do the same where such a charming person be concerned i certainly do not notice it indeed to speak the truth i think that they be more occupy with you -- with I why my dear miss lee _ i _ do not set up for be good - look what a strange idea but i dare say you be right it be only one of my theory base upon my own casual observation and after all man be not a very interesting subject be they let 's talk of something more exciting -- dress for instance but poor marium be too uncomfortable and disturbed to talk of anything else so she collapse into silence and shortly after mr and mr bellamy and george make they adieu meanwhile philip and hilda have be walk leisurely down the shrubbery adjoining the house why have you come out she ask in german a language he understand well to walk with you why do you speak to I in german because it be my pleasure to do so and i never ask you to walk with I you be want in the drawing-room you have better go back no i will not go hilda that be not until you have promise I something do not call I hilda if you please i be the fraulein von holtzhausen what be it you want I to promise i want you to meet I this evening at nine o'clock in the summer - house i think mr caresfoot that you be forget a little what be due to I to yourself and -- to miss lee what do you mean by due to miss lee simply that she be in love with you and that you have encourage she in she affection you need not contradict I she tell I all about it nonsense hilda if you will meet I to-night i will explain everything there be no need for you to be jealous she sweep round upon he toss she head and stamp she dainty foot upon the gravel mr caresfoot she say once and for all i be not jealous and i will not meet you i have too much respect for myself and too little for you and she be go philip 's face as he stand look after she be not pleasant to see it be very hard and angry jealous be she i will give she something to be jealous for the proud minx and in he vexation he knock off the head of a carnation with he stick philip what _ be _ you do those be my pet australian carnation at least i think they be australian how can you destroy they like that all right marium i be only pluck one for you will not you put it in you dress where be the other they have all go come in it be so hot out there and tell I what you think of mr bellamy i think that she be very handsome and very clever i wonder where bellamy pick she up i do not know i wish he have not pick she up at all i do not like she she say unpleasant thing and though i have only see she three time she seem to know all about I and everybody else i be not very quick but do you know just now i think that she be insinuate that you be in love with hilda that be not true be it philip do not think I forward if i ask you if that be true and if i say that if it be it be better that i should know it i sha 'n' t be angry philip and the girl stand before he to await he answer one hand press against she bosom to still the beating of she heart whilst with the other she screen she blushing brow and philip too stand face to face with she sweet self with conscience and with opportunity now whisper conscience be the time before very much harm be do now be the acceptable time to tell she all about it and whilst forbid she love to enlist she sympathy and friendship it will be wrong to encourage she affection when you ardently love another woman you can not palter any more now whisper opportunity shoulder conscience aside be the time to secure she she love and she possession and to reward hilda for she pride do not sacrifice yourself to a infatuation do not tell she about hilda -- it would only breed jealousy you can settle with she afterwards take the goods the god provide you all this and more pass through he mind and he have make he choice long before the rich blood that mantle in the lady 's cheek have sink back to the true breast from whence it come oh instant of time bear to color all eternity to thine own hue for this man thou hast come and go oh fleeting moment bearing desolation or healing on thy wing how the angel in whose charge lie the soul of man must tremble and turn pale as they mark thy flight through the circumstance of a man 's existence and thence take thy secret with thee away to add thy fateful store to the record of he past he take she hand the hand that be press upon she bosom marium he say you should not get such idea into you head i admire hilda very much and that be all why dear i have always look upon myself as half engage to you -- that be so far as i be concerned and i have only be wait till circumstance would allow I to do so to ask you if you think I worth marry for a while she make no reply but only blush the more at last she look up a little you have make I very happy philip that be all she say i be very glad dear that you can find anything in I to like but if you do care for I and think I worth wait for i be go to ask something of you affection : i be go to ask you to trust I as well as to love I i do not for reason that i will not enter into but which i beg you to believe be perfectly straightforward wish anything to be say of we engagement at present not even to you friend hilda do you trust I sufficiently to agree to that philip i trust you as much as i love you and for year i have love you with all my heart and now dear please go i want to think in the hall a servant give he a note it be from hilda and run thus -- i have change my mind i will meet you in the summer-house this evening i have something to say to you philip whistle as he read it devilish awkward he think to himself if i be go to marry marium she must leave this but i can not bear to part with she i love she i love she chapter vi it be some time before philip could make up he mind whether or no he would attend he tryst with hilda in the first place he feel that it be a unsafe proceeding generally inasmuch as moonlight meeting with so lovely a person might should they come to the knowledge of miss lee be open to misconstruction and particularly because should she show the least tenderness towards he he know in he heart that he could not trust himself however much he might be engage in another direction at twenty-one the affection can not be outrage with impunity but have a awkward way of assert themselves tie of honor notwithstanding but as a rule when in we heart we wish to do anything that thing must be bad indeed if we can not find a satisfactory excuse for do it and so it be with philip now think he to himself would be he opportunity to inform hilda of he relation with marium lee and to put a end to he flirtation with she for ostensibly at any rate it be nothing more than a very serious flirtation -- that be to say though there have be word of love and even on she part a passionate avowal of affection wring in a unguarded moment from the depths of she proud heart there have be no formal engagement it be a thing that must be do and now be the time to do it and so he make up he mind to go but when that night he find himself sit in the appoint place and wait for the come of the woman he be about to discard but whom he love with all the intensity of he fierce nature he begin to view the matter in other light and to feel he resolution ooze from he whether it be the silence of the place that tell upon he nerve strain as they be with expectation -- for silence and more especially silence by night be a great unveiler of reality -- or the dread of bitter word or the prescience of the sharp pang of parting -- for he know enough of hilda to know that what he have to say once say she would trouble he no more -- whether it be these thing or whatever it be that affect he he grow most unaccountably anxious and depressed moreover in this congenial condition of the atmosphere of he mind all its darker and hide characteristic spring into a vigorous growth superstition and presentiment crowd in upon he he people he surroundings with the shades of intangible deed that yet await do and grow afraid of he own thought he would have flee from the spot but he could not fly he could only watch the flicker of the moonlight upon the peaceful pool beside he and -- wait at last she come with quick and anxious step and though but a few minute before he have dread she come he now welcome it eagerly for we feeling of whatever sort when direct towards each other be so superficial as compare with the intensity of we fear when we be terrify by calamity or the presence real or fancied of the unknown that in any moment of emergency more especially if it be of a mental kind we be apt to welcome we worst enemy as a drown man welcome a spar at last he say with a sigh of relief how late you be i could not get away there be some people to dinner and then in a softened voice how pale you look be you ill no only a little tired after this there be silence and the pair stand face one another each occupy with they own thought and each dread to put they into word once philip make a beginning of speech but he voice fail he the beating of he heart seem to choke he utterance at length she lean as though for support against the trunk of a pine-tree in the bough of which the night breeze be whisper and speak in a cold clear voice you ask I to meet you here to-night have you anything to say to I no do not speak perhaps i have better speak first i have something to say to you and what i have to say may influence whatever be in you mind listen you remember what pass between we nearly a month ago when i be so weak as to let you see how much i loved you philip bow he head in assent very good i have come here to-night not to give you any lover 's meeting but to tell you that no such word must be speak again and that i be about to make it impossible that they should be speak either by you or by I i be go away from here _ never _ i hope to return go away he gasp when here be the very thing he hope for come to pass and yet the word that should have be so full of comfort fall upon he cold as ice and strike he into misery when why to-morrow morning a relation of mine be ill in germany the only one i have i never see he and care nothing for he but it will give I a pretext and once go i shall not return i have tell marium that i must go she cry about it poor girl at these word all recollection of he purpose pass out of philip 's mind all he realize be that unless he could alter she determination he be about the lose the woman he so passionately adore and whose haughty pride be to he in itself more charming than all poor marium 's gentle love hilda do not go he say seize she hand which she immediately withdraw do not leave I you know how i love you and why should i not leave you even suppose it to be true that you do love I to my cost i love you and be i any longer to endure the daily humiliation of see myself the poor german companion who have nothing but she beauty put aside in favor of another whom i also love you say you love I and bid I stay now tell I what be you purpose towards I do you intend to try to take advantage of my infatuation to make I you mistress it be i be tell a common thing for such proposal to be make to woman in my position whom it would be folly for wealthy gentleman to marry if so abandon that idea for i tell you philip that i would rather die than so disgrace my ancient name to gratify myself i know you money-loving english do not think very much of race unless the bearer of the name be rich but we do and although you would think it a _ mesalliance _ to marry I i on the other hand should not be proud of a alliance with you why philip my ancestor be prince of royal blood when yours still herd the swine in these wood i can show more than thirty quartering upon my shield each the mark of a noble house and i will not be the first to put a bar sinister across they now i have speak plainly indelicately perhaps and there be only one more word to be say between we and that word be _ good-bye _ and she hold out she hand he do not seem to see it indeed he have scarcely hear the latter part of what she say presently he lift he face and it bear trace of a dreadful inward struggle it be deadly pale and great black ring have paint themselves beneath the troubled eye hilda he say hoarsely do not go i can not bear to let you go i will marry you think of what you be say philip and do not be rash i do not wish to entrap you into marriage you love money remember that marium with all she possession ask nothing better than to become you wife and that i have absolutely nothing but my name and my good look look at I and she step out into a patch of moonlight that find its way between the tree and draw the filmy shawl she wear from she head and bare neck and bosom stand before he in all the brightness of she beauty shaded as it be and make more lovely by the shadow of the night examine I very carefully she go on with bitter sarcasm look into my feature and study my form and carriage or you may be disappoint with you bargain and complain that you have not get you money 's worth remember too that a accident a illness and at the best the passage of a few year may quite spoil my value as a beautiful woman and reflect before i take you at you word philip have sit or rather crouch himself down upon the log of a tree that lay outside the summer-house and cover he face with he hand as though she loveliness be more than he could bear to look upon now however he raise he eye and let they dwell upon she scornful feature i have rather he say slowly -- i have rather lose my life than lose you i love you so that i would buy you at the price even of my honor when will you marry I what have you make up you mind so quickly be you sure then -- and here she change she whole tone and bearing and passionately stretch out she arm towards he -- my dearest philip my life my love i will marry you when you will to-morrow to-morrow if you like you must promise I something first what be it that you will keep the marriage a complete secret and bear another name until my father 's death if you do not he will most probably disinherit I i do not like you term philip i do not like secret marriage but you be give up much to marry I so i suppose i must give up something to marry you you solemnly promise that nothing shall induce you to reveal that you be my wife until i give you permission to do so i promise -- that be provide you do not force I to in self-defence philip laugh you need not fear that he say but how shall we arrange about get married i can meet you in london very well i will go up early to-morrow and get a licence and then on Wednesday i can meet you and we can be marry as you will philip where shall i meet you he give she a address which she carefully note down now she say you must go it be late yes you may kiss I now there that will do now go in another minute he be go i have win the game she muse poor marium i be sorry for she but perhaps hers be the better part she will get over it but mine be a sad fate i love passionately madly but i do not trust the man i love why should we marriage be so secret he can not be entangled with marium or she would have tell I and she stretch out she arm towards the path by which he have leave she and cry aloud in the native tongue that sound so soft upon she lip oh my heart 's darling if i could only trust you as well as i love you it be a happy woman that i should be to-night chapter vii nothing occur to interfere with the plan of action decide on by hilda and philip no misadventure come to mock they dash the tantalus cup of joy to earth before they eye on the contrary within forty-eight hour of the conversation record in the last chapter they be as completely and irrevocably man and wife as a special licence and the curate of a city church assist by the clerk and the pew-opener could make they then follow a brief period of such delirium as turn the london lodgings dingy and stuffy as they be in the height of the hot summer into a earthly paradise a garden of eden into which alas the serpent have no need to seek a entrance but as be natural when the first glory of realize happiness be begin to grow faint on they horizon the young couple turn themselves to consider they position and find in it mutually and severally many thing that do not please they for philip indeed it be full of anxiety for he have many complication to deal with first there be he secret engagement to maria lee of which be it remember he wife be totally ignorant and which be in itself a sufficiently awkward affair for a married man to have on he hand then there be the paramount need of keep he marriage with hilda as secret as the dead to say nothing of the necessity of he live for the most part away from he wife indeed he only consolation be that he have plenty of money on which to support she inasmuch as he father have from the date of he leave oxford make he a allowance of one thousand a year hilda have begin to discover that she be not without she trouble for one thing she husband 's fit of moodiness and fretful anxiety trouble she and lead she possess as she be with a more than ordinary share of womanly shrewdness to suspect that he be hide something from she but what chiefly vex she proud nature be the necessity of concealment and all its attendant petty falsehood and subterfuge it be not pleasant for hilda caresfoot to have to pass as mr robert and to be careful not to show herself in public place in the daytime where there be a possibility of she be see by any one who might recognize in she striking figure the lady who have live with miss lee in marlshire it be not pleasant to she to be oblige to reply to maria lee 's affectionate letter full as they be of entreaty for she return by epistle that have to be forward to a country town in a remote district of germany to be post and which be in themselves full of lie that however white they might have seem under all the circumstance she feel in she conscience to be very black indeed in short there be in they union none of that sense of finality and of security that be under ordinary circumstance the distinguishing mark of marriage in this country it partake rather of the nature of a illicit connection at the end of a fortnight of wed bliss all these little thing have begin to make themselves feel and in truth they be but the commencement of evil for one afternoon philip for the first time since he wedding tear himself away from he wife 's side and pay a visit to a club to which he have be recently elect here he find no less than three letter from he father the first request he return the second command it in exceptionally polite language and the third -- which write in mingled anxiety and anger have just arrive -- coolly announce he parent 's intention should he not hear of he by return of set detective officer to work to discover he whereabouts from this letter it appear indeed that he cousin george have already be despatch to london to look for he and on reference to the hall porter he discover that a gentleman answer to he description have already inquire for he several time cursing he own folly in not have keep up some communication with he father he make the best of he way back to he lodgings to find hilda wait for he somewhat disconsolately i be glad you have come back love she say draw he towards she till he dark curl mingle with she own fair lock and kiss he upon the forehead i have miss you dreadfully i do not understand how i can have live all these year without you i be afraid dear you will have to live without I for a while now listen and he read she the letter he have just receive she listen attentively till he have finish what be you go to do she ask with some anxiety in she voice do why of course i must go home at once and what be i to do well i do not know i suppose that you must stop here that will be pleasant for I will it not no dear it will be pleasant neither for you nor I but what can i do you know the man my father be to deal with if i stop here in defiance to he wish especially as he have be anxious about I there be no know what might not happen remember hilda that we have to deal with george whose whole life be devote to secret endeavor to supplant I if i be to give he such a opportunity as i should by stop away now i should deserve all i get or rather all i do not get hilda sigh and acquiesce have she be a softer-minded woman she would have weep and relieve she feeling but she be not soft - mind and so before the post go out he write a affectionate letter to he father express he sorrow at the latter 's anxiety at at he own negligence in not have write to he the fact of the matter be he say that he have be take up with visit some of he oxford friend and have not till that afternoon be near he club to look for letter he would however he add return on the morrow and make he apology in person this letter he hand to he wife to read do you think that will do he ask when she have finish oh yes she reply with a touch of she old sarcasm it be a masterpiece of falsehood philip look very angry and fumed and fret but he make no reply and on the follow morning he depart to bratham abbey ah philip philip say he father under the mellow influence of he fourth glass of port on the night of he arrival i know well enough what keep you up in town well well i do not complain young man will be young man but do not let these affair interfere with the business of life remember marium lee my boy you have serious interest in that direction interest that must not be trifle with interest that i have a right to expect you will _ not _ trifle with he son make no reply but sip he wine in silence ache at he heart for he absent bride and wonder what he father would say do he really know what have keep he in town after this matter go on smoothly enough for a month or more since fortunately for philip the great marium lee question a question that the more he consider it the more thorny do it appear be for the moment shelve by the absence of that young lady on a visit to she aunt in the isle of wight twice during that month he manage on different pretext to get up to london and visit he wife whom he find as patient as be possible under the circumstance but anything but happy indeed on the second occasion she urge on he strongly the ignominy of she position and even beg he to make a clean breast of it to he father offer to undertake the task herself he refuse equally warmly and some sharp word ensue to be however quickly follow by a reconciliation on he return from this second visit philip find a note sign affectionately yours marium lee wait for he which announce that young lady 's return and beg he to come over to lunch on the follow day he go -- indeed he have no alternative but to go and again fortune favor he in the person of a diffident young lady who be stop with marium and who never leave she side all that afternoon much to the disgust of the latter and the relief of philip one thing however he be not spare and that be the perusal of hilda 's last letter to she friend write apparently from germany and give a lively description of the writer 's daily life and the state of she uncle 's health which she say preclude all possibility of she return alas he already know its every line too well for as hilda refuse to undertake the task he have but a week before draft it himself but philip be grow harden to deception and find it possible to read it from end to end and speculate upon its contents with marium without blush or hesitation but he could not always expect to find miss lee in the custody of such a obtuse friend and needless to say it become a matter of very serious importance to he to know how he should treat she it occur to he that he safest course might be to throw himself upon she generosity and make a clean breast of it but when it come to the point he be too weak to thus expose he shameful conduct to the woman whose heart he have win and to whom he be bind by every tie of honor that a gentleman hold sacred he think of the scornful wonder with which she would listen to he tale and prefer to take the risk of greater disaster in the future to the certainty of present shame in the end he contrived to establish a species of confidential intimacy with marium which whilst it somewhat mystify the poor girl be not without its charm inasmuch as it tend to transform the every-day philip into a hero of romance but in the main marium be ill-suited to play heroine to she wooer 's hero herself as open as the daylight it be quite incomprehensible to she why they relationship should be keep such a dark and mysterious secret or why if she lover give she a kiss it should be do with as many precaution as though he be about to commit a murder she be a very modest maiden and in she heart believe it a wonderful thing that philip should have fall in love with she -- a thing to be very proud of and she feel it hard that she should be deny the gratification of openly acknowledge she lover and show he off to she friend after the fashion that be so delightful to the female mind but though this consciousness of the deprivation of a lawful joy set up a certain feeling of irritation in she mind she do not allow it to override she entire trust in and love for philip whatever he do be no doubt wise and right but for all that on several occasion she take a opportunity to make he acquaint with she view of the matter and to ask he question that he find it increasingly difficult to answer in this way by the exercise of ceaseless diplomacy and with the assistance of a great deal of falsehood of the most artistic nature philip manage to tide over the next six month but at the end of that time the position be very far from improve hilda be chafe more and more at the ignominy of she position marium be daily grow more and more impatient to have they engagement make public and last but by no means least he father be almost daily at he on the subject of miss lee till at length he succeed in wring from he the confession that there exist some sort of understanding between marium and himself now the old squire be a shrewd man of the world and be not therefore slow to guess that what prevent this understanding from be openly acknowledge as a engagement be some entanglement on he son 's part indeed it have recently become clear to he that london have develop strange attraction for philip that this entanglement could be marriage be however a idea that never enter into he head he have too good a opinion of he son 's common - sense to believe it possible that he would deliberately jeopardize he inheritance by marry without he permission but philip 's reluctance and obstinacy annoy he excessively devil caresfoot be not a man accustom to be thwart indeed he have never be thwart in he life and he do not mean to be now he have set he heart upon this marriage and it would have to be a good reason that could turn he from he purpose accordingly have extract the above information he say no more to philip but proceed to lay he own plan that very afternoon he commence to put they into action at three o'clock he order the carriage and pair a vehicle that be rarely use give special direction that the coachman should see that he wig be properly curl a ill-curled wig have before now be know to produce a very bad effect upon mr caresfoot 's nerve and also upon its wearer 's future prospects in life at three precisely the heavy open carriage swing upon c-spring and draw by two huge grey draw up in front of the hall-door and the squire who be as usual dress in the old-fashioned knee-breeches and carry in he hand he gold-headed cane step solemnly into it and seat himself exactly in the middle of the back seat not lean back as be the fashion of we degenerate day but hold himself bolt upright any more impose sight than this old gentleman present thus seat and move at a stately pace through the village street it be impossible to conceive but it so oppress the very child that fear at the spectacle -lrb- which be a unwonted one for the squire have not thus drive abroad in state for some year -rrb- overcome they curiosity and at he approach they incontinently flee so soon as the carriage have pass through the drive-gate of the abbey the squire order the coachman to drive to rewtham house whither in due course he safely arrive he be usher into the drawing-room whilst a servant go in search of miss lee whom she find walk in the garden a gentleman to see you miss i be not at home who be it mr caresfoot miss oh why do not you say so before and take it for grant that philip have pay she a unexpected visit she start off for the house at a run why philip she exclaim as she swing open the door this _ be _ good of you o -- oh for at that moment mr caresfoot senior appear from behind the back of the door where he have be stand by the fireplace and make he most impose bow that my dear marium be the first time that i have hear myself call philip for many a long year and i fear that that be by accident neither the name nor the blush be mean for I now where they i think reply marium who be still overwhelm with confusion i think that it be philip you son you know he have not be here for so long with such a welcome wait he it be indeed wonderful that he can keep away and the old squire bow again with such courtly grace as to drive what little self-possession remain to poor marium after she fly entry entirely out of she head and now my dear go on she visitor fix he piercing eye upon she face with you permission we will sit down and have a little talk together will not you take off you hat marium take off she hat as suggest and sit down meekly full under fire of the glowing eye that have produce such curious effect upon subject so dissimilar as the late mr caresfoot and jim brady she could however think of nothing appropriate to say my dear the old gentleman continue presently the subject upon which i have take upon myself to speak to you be one very nearly affect you happiness and also of a delicate nature my excuse for allude to it must be that you be the child of my old friend -- ah we be great friend fifty year ago my dear -- and that i have myself a near interest in the matter do you understand I no not quite well then forgive a old man who have no time to waste if he come to the point i mean i have come to ask you maria if any understanding or engagement exist between philip and yourself the eye be full upon she now and she feel that they be draw she secret from she as a corkscrew do a cork at last it come out with a pop yes we be engage thank you my dear how long have you be engage about eight month and why have the affair be keep so secret i do not know philip wish it he tell I not to tell any one i suppose that i should not by rights have tell you make yourself easy my dear philip have already tell I that there be a understanding between you i only want to hear the confirmation of such good news from you own lip young man be great coxcomb my dear and apt to fancy thing where lady be concerned i be rejoice to hear that there be no mistake on he part i be so glad that you be pleased she say shyly pleased my dear say the old gentleman rise and walk up and down the room in he excitement pleased be not the word for it i be more rejoice than if some one have leave I another estate look here maria i have set my heart upon this thing come to pass i have think of it for year i love you father and you be like you father girl ay i love you too because you be a generous honest woman and will bring a good strain of blood into a family that

he eye flash break it off by god the day he play fast and loose with you that day i leave the property to he cousin george -- there there i frightened you i beg you pardon but in he own interest marium i advise you to hold he fast to he word to change the subject you news have freshen I up so much that i mean to have a little company will you come and dine with I next Thursday i shall be very glad mr caresfoot thank you and perhaps till then you will not unless he happen to ask you mention the subject of we conversation to philip i want to have a talk with he first marium assent and the squire take he leave with the same magnificence of mien that have mark he arrival chapter viii that evening he father astonished philip by tell he that he intend to give a dinner-party on that day week you see philip he say with a grim smile i have only get a year or so at the most before I and i wish to see a little of my neighbor before i go i have not have much society of late year i mean to do the thing well while i be about it and ask everybody in the neighborhood how many can dine with comfort in the old banqueting-hall do you suppose about five-and-forty i should think five-and-forty i remember that we sit down sixty to dinner when i come of age but then we be a little crowded so we will limit the number to fifty be you go to have fifty people to dinner ask philip aghast certainly i shall ask you to come and help I to write the invitation presently i have prepare a list and will you kindly send over to bell at roxham i wish to speak to he he must bring he man over to do up the old hall a bit and by the way write to gunter 's and order a man-cook to be here on Tuesday and to bring with he material for the best dinner for fifty people that he can supply i will see after the wine myself we will finish off that wonderful port my grandfather lay down now bustle about my lad we have no time to lose we must get all the note out to-day philip start to execute he order pretty well convince in he own mind that he father be take leave of he sens who ever hear of a dinner be give to fifty people before especially in a house where such rare entertainment have always be of a traditionally select and solemn nature the expense too reflect philip would be large a man of he father 's age have in he opinion no right to make such ducks-and-drake of money that be so near to belong to somebody else but one thing be clear : he father have set he mind upon it and when once that be the case to try to thwart he be more than philip dared when the note of invitation arrive at they respective destination great be the excitement in the neighborhood of bratham abbey curiosity be rampant on the point and the refusal be few and far between at length the eventful evening arrive and with it the expect guest among whom the old squire in he dress of a past generation -- resplendent in diamond buckle frill shirt-front and silk stocking -- be with he snow-white hair and stately bearing himself by far the most striking figure standing near the door of the large drawing-room he receive he guest as they arrive with a air that would have do credit to a ambassador but when miss lee enter philip notice with a prophetic shudder that in lieu of the accustomed bow he give she a kiss he also notice for he be a observant man that the gather company be pervade by a curious air of expectation they be nearly all of they people who have be neighbor of the caresfoot family for year -- in many instance for generation -- and as intimate with its member as the high-stomached stiffness of english country-life will allow they therefore be well acquaint with the family history and peculiarity but it be clear from they face that they knowledge be of no help to they now and that they be totally in the dark as to why they be all gather together in this unwonted fashion at length to the relief of all the last of the choose fifty guest put in a appearance and dinner be announce everybody make he way to he allotted partner and await the signal to move forward when a fresh piquancy be add to the proceedings by a unexpected incident -- in which marium lee play a principal part marium be sit in a corner of the drawing-room wonder if philip be go to take she in to dinner and why he have not be to see she lately when suddenly she become aware that all the room be look at she and on raise she eye she perceive the cause for there close upon she and advance with majestic step and outstretched arm be old mr caresfoot possess by the evident intention of take she down in the full face of all the married lady and people of title present she pray that the floor might open and swallow she indeed of the two she would have prefer that way of go down to dinner but it do not so there be no alternative left to she but to accept the proffer arm and to pass with as much dignity as she could muster in such a try moment in front of the intensely interested company -- from which she could hear a involuntary murmur of surprise -- through the wide-flung door down the great oak staircase load with exotic thence along a passage carpet with crimson cloth and through double door of oak that be fling open at they approach into the banqueting-hall on its threshold not only she but almost every member of the company who pass in behind they utter a exclamation of surprise and indeed the sight before they amply justify it the hall be a chamber of noble proportion sixty foot in length by thirty wide it be very lofty and the dark chestnut beam of the beautiful arched roof be throw into strong relief by the light of many candle the wall be panel to the roof with oak that have become almost black in the course of century here and there relieve by portrait and shine suit of armor down the center of the room run a long wide table whereon and on a huge sideboard be spread the whole of the caresfoot plate which catch the light of the suspend candle throw it back in dazzling gleam till the beholder be positively bewilder with the brilliancy of the sight oh how beautiful say marium in astonishment yes answer the old gentleman as he take he seat at the head of the table place marium on he right the plate be very fine it have take two hundred year to get together but my father do more in that way than all of we put together he spend ten thousand pound on plate during he lifetime that gold service on the sideboard belong to he i have only spend two mind my love he add in a low voice when it come into you keep that it be preserved intact but i do not recommend you to add to it there be too much already for a simple country gentleman 's family marium blush and be silent the dinner which be serve on a most magnificent scale wear itself away as all big county-dinner do in burst of sedate but not profoundly interesting conversation indeed have it not be for the novelty of the sight marium would have be rather bore the squire 's stately compliment notwithstanding as it be she feel inclined to envy the party at the other end amongst whom look down the long vista of sparkling glass and silver she could now and again catch sight of philip 's face beam with animation and even in the pause of conversation hear the echo of he distant laughter what good spirit he be in she think to herself and indeed philip be or appear to be in excellent spirit he handsome face that of late have be so gloomy be light up with laughter and he contrived by he witty talk to keep those round he in continual merriment philip seem very happy do not he say george _ sotto voce _ to mr bellamy who be sit next to he you must be a very bad judge of the face as a index to the mind if you think that he be happy i have be watch he all dinner and i draw a very different conclusion why look how he be laugh have you never see a man laugh to hide he misery never mind he lip watch he eye : they be dilate with fear see how he keep glance towards he father and miss lee there do you see he start believe I he be not happy and unless i be mistaken he will be even less so before the night be over we be not all ask here for nothing i hope not i hope not if so we shall have to act upon we information eh but to change the subject you look lovely to-night of course i do i _ be _ lovely i wish i could return the compliment but conscientiously i can not do you ever see such plate look at that centre-piece it be wonderful say george i never see it at all out before i wonder he add with a sigh if i shall ever have the finger of it yes she say with a strange look of she large eye if you continue to be guide by I you shall i tell you so and i _ never _ make mistake hush something be go to happen what be it the dinner have come to a end and in accordance with the old - fashion custom the cloth have be remove leave bare a ancient table of polished oak nearly forty foot in length and compose of slab of timber a good two inch thick when the wine have be hand round the old squire motion to the servant to leave the room and then have first whisper something in the ear of miss lee that cause she to turn very red he slowly rise to he foot in the midst of a dead silence look at you cousin 's face whisper mr bellamy george look it be ghastly pale and the black eye be gleam like polished jet against white paper friend and neighbor amongst whom or amongst whose father i have live for so many year begin the speaker whose voice soft as it be fill the great hall with ease it be if tradition do not lie in this very room and at this very table that the only caresfoot who ever make a after-dinner speech of he own accord deliver himself of he burden that man be my ancestor in the eighth degree old yeoman caresfoot and the occasion of he speech be to he a very important one be the day on which he plant caresfoot 's staff the great oak by the water yonder to mark the founding of a house of country gentry some century have elapse since my forefather stand where i stand most like with he hand upon this board as mine be now and address a company not so fine or so well dress but perhaps -- i mean no disrespect -- on the whole as good at heart as that before I now yes the sapling oak have grow into the biggest tree in the country-side ` twixt then and now it seem therefore to be fit that on what be to I as great a day as the planting of that oak be to my yeoman forefather that i like he should gather my ancient friend and neighbor round I under the same ancient roof that i may like he make they the partaker of my joy none of you sit at this board to-day can look upon the old man who now ask you attention without realize what he himself have already learn : namely that he day be over now life be hard to quit when a man grow old the terror of the unknown land loom just as large and terrible as they do to he youthful imagination larger perhaps but it be a fact that must be face a hard inevitable fact and age realize this look round it for consolation and find only two : first that as its interest and affection _ here _ fade and fall away in just that same proportion do they grow and gather _ there _ upon the further shore and secondly that after nature 's eternal fashion the youth and vigor of a new generation be wait to replace the worn-out decrepitude of that which sink into oblivion my life be do it can not be long before the churchyard claim its own but i live again in my son and take such cold comfort as i may from that idea of family and of long-continued and assure succession that have so largely help to make this country what she be but you will wonder what can be the particular purpose for which i have bid you here to-night be assure that it be not to ask you to listen to gloomy sermon on the to other not very interesting fact of my approach end but rather for a joyful and a definite reason one wish i have long have it be -- that before i go i may see my son 's child the little caresfoot that be to fill my place in future year prattle about my knee but this i shall never see what i have to announce to you however be the first step towards it my son 's engagement to miss lee the young lady on my right look at he face whisper mr bellamy to she neighbor during the murmur of applause that follow this announcement look quick philip have put he hand down upon he chair as though to raise himself up and a expression of such mingled rage and terror sweep across he feature as once see could not easily be forget but so quickly do it pass that perhaps mr bellamy who be watch be the only one in all that company to observe it in another moment he be smile and bow he acknowledgement to whisper and telegraph congratulation you all know miss lee go on the old squire as you know she father and mother before she she be a sound shoot from a honest stock a girl after my own heart a girl that i love and that all who come under she influence will love and this engagement be to I the most joyful news that i have hear for many a year may god ay and man too so deal with my son as he deal with marium lee and now i have do i have already keep you too long with you consent we will have no more speech no return of thanks we will spare philip he blush but before i sit down i will bid you all farewell for i be in my eighty-third year and i feel that i shall never see very many of you face again i wish that i have be a better neighbor to you all as there be many other thing i wish now that it be too late to fulfil they but i still hope that some of you will now and again find a kind think for the old man whom among yourselve you talk of as ` devil caresfoot ' believe I my friend there be truth in the old proverb : the devil be not always as black as he be paint i give you my toast my son philip and he affianced wife marium lee the whole company rise actuate by a common impulse and drink the health standing and such be the pathos of the old squire 's speech that there be eye among those present that be not free from tear then the lady retire amongst they poor marium who be naturally upset at the unexpected and in some way unwelcome notoriety thus give to herself in the drawing-room she be so overwhelmed with congratulation that at last feeling that she could not face a fresh edition from the male portion of the gathering she order she carriage and quietly slip away home to think over matter at she leisure philip too come in for he share of honor down below and acknowledge they as best he might for he have not the moral courage to repudiate the position he feel that he father have force he hand completely and that there be nothing to be do and sink into the outward calmness of despair but if he companion could have see the whirlpool of hatred terror and fury that rage within he breast as he sit and chat and sip he great-grandfather 's port they would have be justifiably astonish at length the banquet for it be nothing less come to a end and have bow they farewell to the last depart guest the old man and he son be leave alone together in the desert drawing-room philip be seat by a table he face bury in he hand whilst he father be stand by the die fire tap he eye-glass nervously on the mantelpiece it be he who break the somewhat ominous silence well philip how do you like my speech thus address the son lift he face from he hand it be white as a sheet by what authority he ask in a harsh whisper do you announce I as engage to miss lee by my own philip i have it from both you lip that you be engage i do not choose that it should remain a secret any longer you have no right to make that speech i will not marry miss lee understand once and for all i will _ not _ marry she in speak thus philip have nerve himself to bear one of those dreadful outburst of fury that have earn he father he title but to he astonishment none such come the steely eye glint a little as he answer in he most polite manner and that be all you position philip then be that you be engage very publicly engage to a girl whom you have no intention of marry -- a very disgraceful position mine be that i have with every possible solemnity announce a marriage that will not come off -- a very ridiculous position very good my dear philip please yourself i can not force you into a disgraceful marriage but you must not suppose that you can thus thwart I with impunity allow I to show you the alternative i see you be tired but i shall not detain you long take that easy-chair this house and the land round it also the plate which be very valuable but can not be sell -- by the way see that it be safely lock up before you go to bed -- be strictly entail and must of course belong to you the value of the entail land be about 1000 pound a year or a little less in bad time of the unentail a clear 4000 pound of my personal property about 900 pound should you persist in you refusal to marry miss lee or should the marriage in any way fall through except from circumstance entirely beyond you control i must to use you own admirably emphatic language ask you to ` understand once and for all ' that where you name appear in my will with reference to the unentailed and personal property it will be erase and that of you cousin george substitute please yourself philip please yourself it be a matter of entire indifference to I i be very fond of george and shall be glad to do he a good turn if you force I to it though it be a pity to split up the property but probably you will like to take a week to consider whether you prefer to stick to the girl you have get hold of up in town there -- oh yes i know there be some one -- and abandon the property or marry miss lee and retain the property -- a very pretty problem for a amorous young man to consider there i will not keep you up any longer good night philip good night just see to the plate will you remember you have a personal interest in that i can not leave it away philip rise without a word and leave the room but when he be go it be he father 's turn to hide he face in he hand oh god he groan aloud to think that all my plan should come to such a end as this to think that i be as powerless to prevent they collapse as a child be to support a fall tree that the only power leave I be the power of vengeance -- vengeance on my own son i have live too long and the dregs of life be bitter chapter ix poor hilda find life in she london lodging anything but cheerful and frequently beg philip to allow she to settle somewhere in the country this however he refuse to do on two grounds : in the first place because few country village would be so convenient for he to get at as london and in the second because he declare that the great city be the safest hiding-place in the world and so hilda continue perforce to live she lonesome existence that be only cheer by she husband 's short and uncertain visit friend she have none nor do she dare to make any the only person whose conversation she could rely on to relieve the tedium of the long week be she landlady mr jacob the widow of a cheesemonger who have ruin a fine business by he drinking and other vicious propensity and out of a good property have only leave he wife the leasehold of a house in lincoln 's inn field which fortunately for she have be settle upon she at she marriage like most people who have see better day -- not but what she be now very comfortably off -- she delight in talking of she misfortune and of the perfidiousness of man and in hilda who have poor girl nothing else to listen to she find a most attentive audience as be only natural where such a charming person and such a good listener be concerned honest mr jacob soon grow fond of she interesting lodger about whose husband 's circumstance and history she soon weave many a imaginary tale for needless to say she most pertinent inquiry fail to extract much information from hilda one of she favorite fiction be that she lodger be the victim of she handsome husband who have in some way beguile she from she home beyond the sea in order to keep she in solitary confinement and out of the reach of a hate rival another that he keep she thus that he might have greater liberty for he own action in course of time these idea take such possession of she mind that she grow to believe in they and when speaking of hilda to any of she other lodger would shake she head and talk of she mysteriously as a lamb and a victim as for that lady herself whilst far from suspect she good landlady 's gloomy surmise she certainly fall more and more a prey to depression and anxiety and occasionally even to suspicion to all of which evil she grow increasingly liable as she draw nearer to a event that be no longer very distant she could not but notice a change in philip 's manner on the rare occasion when he be able to visit she of which the most marked development be fit of silence and irritability a certain reticence also that become more and more noticeable as time go on lead she to feel that there be a invisible something grow up between they -- a something that the pride she possess in such a striking degree forbid she to attempt to pierce but which be none the less galling to she on that account very shortly before the event narrate in the last chapter she have take the occasion of a visit from philip to complain somewhat bitterly of she position beg he to tell she when there be any prospect of she being allow to take she rightful place -- a question she husband be quite unable to answer satisfactorily see that there be nothing to be get out of he with womanly tact she change the subject and ask after marium lee -lrb- for whom she entertain a genuine affection -rrb- -- when he last see she how she be look if there be any prospect of she get married and other question of the same sort -- the result of which be to evoke a most violent and to she inexplicable fit of irritability on the part of she husband something of a scene ensue which be finally terminate about five o'clock in the afternoon by philip 's abrupt departure to catch he train shortly afterwards mr jacob come up to bring some tea find hilda indulge in tear that she have be too proud to shed before she husband and have have a extend personal experience of such matter rightly guess that there have be a conjugal tiff the blame of which needless to say she fix upon the depart philip lor mr robert -lrb- as hilda be call -rrb- she say do not take on like that they be all brute that be what they be if only you could have see my samuel who be dead and go these ten year and bury in a private grave at kensal cemetery -- though he do not leave anything to pay for it except three dozen and five of brandy -- he be a beauty poor dear he be you husband be not nothing to he my husband let I tell you mr jacob be not a brute at all sob hilda with dignity ah mr robert that be just what i use to say of samuel but he be the biggest brute in the three kingdom for all that but if you ask I mean no offence i call a man a brute as only come to see he lawful wife about twice a month let alone make a angel cry mr robert have he reason mr jacob you must not talk of he like that ah so my samuel use to say when he stop away from home for three night at a time till i follow he and find out he ` reason ' and a mighty pretty ` reason ' she be too all paint and feather the hussy and eye as big as a teacup they all have they reason but they never tell 'em but come and put on you thing and go out a bit there be a dear it be a beautiful warm evening you feel tired -- oh never mind that it be necessary for people as be in a interested way to take exercise i well remember -- here hilda however cut the subject short and deprive herself of mr jacob ' reminiscence by go to put on she thing it be a bright warm evening and she find the air so pleasant that after stroll round lincoln 's inn field she think she would extend she walk a little and strike past lincoln 's inn hall into new square and then make she way to the archway opposite to where the new law court now stand under this archway a legal bookseller have build he nest and behind window of broad plate-glass be range specimen of he seductive wares bait on which to catch student avaricious of legal knowledge as they pass on they way to chamber or hall now at this window a young man be stand at the moment that hilda enter the archway he eye fix upon a pamphlet on the law of succession that young man be george caresfoot who be consider whether it would be worth he while to buy the pamphlet in order to see if he would be entitle to anything if he uncle should happen to die intestate as he sometimes fear might be the case he have come up to town on business connect with he firm and be now wait till it be time to begin a evening of what he understand as pleasure for george be a very gay young man he be however also a very sharp one so sharp that he even notice shadow especially when as in this case the shadow be clearly define and fling life-sized on the dark background of the book before he he watch it for a moment and as its owner with a absent air slowly pass from the bright sunlight into the shade of the arch it strike the astute george that there be something familiar about this particular and by no means unpleasing shadow wait till it have vanish and the footstep go past he he turn round and at a glance recognize hilda von holtzhausen miss lee 's beautiful companion who be suppose to have depart into the more distant part of germany george 's eye twinkle and a whole host of idea rush into he really able mind catch at last for a sovereign he mutter meanwhile hilda walk slowly on into chancery lane then turn to the left till she come into holborn and thence make she way round by another route back to lincoln 's inn field needless to say george follow at a respectful distance he first impulse have be to go up and speak to she but he resist the inclination on the doorstep of the house where hilda lodge stand she landlady give a piece of she mind to a butcher-boy both as regard he master 's meat and he personal quality she pause for breath just as hilda pass up the step and turn say something that make the latter laugh the butcher-boy take the opportunity of beat a rapid retreat leave mr jacob crow after he from she own doorstep as soon as hilda have go into the house george see he opportunity advance politely towards mr jacob he ask she if she be the landlady of the house and when she have answer in the affirmative he make inquiry about apartment thank you sir say mr jacob but i do not let room to single gentleman you take too much for grant ma'am i be marry she look at he doubtfully i suppose sir you would have no objection to give a reference a dozen if you like ma'am but shall we look at the room mr jacob assent and they make they way upstairs george keep in front on the first-floor he see a pair of lady 's shoe on a mat outside the door and guess to whom they belong be these the room he say lay he hand upon the door-handle no sir no they be mr robert ' next floor please sir mr robert -- i suppose the very handsome young lady i see come

trust in the man she love have enter into she soul and could philip have see she under these new circumstance he would have realize that he have indeed good reason to beware no wonder she go on no

george that be a wonderful woman -- a woman it be good to have some hold over we leave hilda stretch on she face sob but the fit do not last long she rise and fling open the window she seem stifle for want of air then she sit down to think what she should do vanish and leave no trace no not yet appear and claim she place no not yet the time be not ripe for choice between these two extreme upbraid philip with he faithlessness no not without proof what do that hateful letter say wait and watch yes that be what she would do but she could not wait here she feel as though she must go somewhere get some change of scene or she should break down she have hear mr jacob speak of a village not more than two hour from london that a convalescent lodger of hers have visit and find charming she would go there for a week and watch the spring cast she mantle over the earth and listen to the laughter of the brook and try to forget she burning love and jealousy and just for that one week be happy as she be when as a little girl she roam all day through the wood of she native germany alas she forget that it be the heart and not the scene that make happiness that evening she write a note to she husband say that she feel that change of air be necessary for she and that she be go out of london for a few day to some quiet place from whence she would write to he he must not however expect many letter as she want complete rest on the follow morning she go and if the sweet spring air do not bring peace to she mind at any rate it to a very great extent set up she in strength she write but one letter during she absence and that be to say that she should be back in london by midday on the first of may this letter reach philip on the morning of the great dinner-party and be either accidentally or on purpose send without the writer 's address on the morning of the first of may -- that be two day after the dinner-party which be give on the twenty-ninth of April -- hilda rise early and commence to pack she thing with the assistance of a stout servant girl who do all the odd job and a great deal of the work in the old-fashioned farmhouse in which she be stay presently the cowboy come whistle up the little garden bright with crocus and tulip that lay in front of the house and knock at the front door lawk say the stout girl in accent of deep surprise as she draw she head in from the open lattice jim 's get a letter perhaps it be for I suggest hilda a little nervously she have grow nervous about the post of late will you go and see the letter be for she in the handwriting of mr jacob she open it it contain another address in the character the sight of which make she feel sick and faint she could not trust herself to read it in the presence of the girl sally she say i feel rather faint i shall lie down a little i will ring for you presently sally retire and she open she letter fifteen minute after the girl receive she summons she find hilda very pale and with a curious look upon she face i hope you be better mum she say for she be a kind-hearted girl better -- ah yes thank you sally i be cure quite cure but please be quick with the thing for i shall leave by the nine o'clock train chapter x the night of the dinner-party be a nearly sleepless one for philip although he father have so considerately regret he wearied appearance he could do nothing but walk walk walk like some unquiet ghost up and down he great oak-panelled bedroom till about dawn he leg give way beneath he and think think think till he mind recoil confused and helpless from the dead wall of its object and out of all this walking and think there emerge after a hour of stupor that it would be a misnomer to call sleep two fix result the first of these be that he hate he father as a lose soul must hate its torture demon blindly madly impotently hate he and the second that he could no longer delay take he wife into he confidence then he remember the letter he have receive from she on the previous morning he get it and see that it bear no address merely state that she would be in london by midday on the first of may that be on the morrow till then it be clear he must wait and he be not sorry for the reprieve he be not a pleasant story for a husband to have to tell fortunately for philip there be a engagement of long standing for this day the thirtieth of April to go in conjunction with other person to effect a valuation of the fallow & c of a large tenant who be go out at michaelma this prevent any call be make upon he to go and see marium lee as after the event of the previous evening it might have be expect he would he start early on this business and do not return till late so he see nothing of he father that day on the morning of the first of may he breakfast about half-past eight and then without see he father drive to roxham to catch a train that get he up to london about twenty minute to twelve as he steam slowly into paddington station another train steam out and have he be careful to examine the occupant of the first-class carriage as they pass he in a slow procession he might have see something that would have interested he but he be not unnaturally too much occupy with he own thought to allow of the indulgence of a idle curiosity on the arrival of he train he take a cab and drive without delay to the house in lincoln 's inn field and ask for mr robert she be not back yet sir be mrs jacobs ' reply i get this note from she this morning to say that she would be here by twelve but it be twenty past now so i suppose that she have miss the train or change she mind but there will be another in at three so perhaps you have best wait for that sir philip be put out by this contretemps but at the same time he be relieve to find that he have a space to breathe in before the inevitable and dreadful moment of exposure and infamy for he have grow afraid of he wife three o'clock come in due course but no hilda philip be seriously disturbed but there be now no train by which she could arrive that day so he be force to the conclusion that she have postpone she departure there be now two thing to be do one to follow she down to where she be stay -- for he have ascertain she address from mr jacob the other to return home and come back on the morrow for reason which appear to he imperative but which need not be enter into here he decide on the latter course so leave a note for he wife he drive in a very bad temper back to paddington in time to catch the five o'clock train to roxham let we now return to the abbey house where whilst philip be cool he heel in lincoln 's inn field a rather curious scene be in progress at one o'clock old mr caresfoot as be he rule sit down to lunch which frugal as it be so far as he be concern be yet serve with some old-fashioned ceremony by a butler and a footman just as the meal be come to a end a fly with some luggage on it drive up to the hall-door the footman go to open it simmon say the squire to the old butler look out and tell I who that be simmon do as he be bid and reply : i do not rightly know squire but it be a lady and she be wonderful tall just then the footman return and say that a lady who would not give she name wish to speak to he in private be you sure the lady do not mean mr philip no sir she ask for mr philip first and when i tell she that he be out she ask for you sir i have show she into the study humph at any rate she have come off a journey and must be hungry set another place and ask she in here in another moment there be a rustle of a silk dress and a lady array in a long cloak and with a thick veil on be show into the room mr caresfoot rise with that courteous air for which he be remarkable bow and beg she to be seat and then motion to the servant to leave the room madam i be tell that you wish to speak to I might i ask whom i have the honor of address she with a rapid motion remove she hat and veil and expose she sternly beautiful face to he inquire gaze do you not know I mr caresfoot she say in she foreign accent surely yes you be the young lady who live with marium miss von holtzhausen that _ be _ my name it be now hilda caresfoot i be you son philip 's wife as this astounding news break upon he ear she hearer 's face become a shift study incredulity wonder fury all sweep across it and then in a single second it seem to freeze next moment he speak with overpowering politeness so madam then i have to congratulate myself on the possession of a very lovely daughter-in-law a silence ensue that they be both too move to break at last the old man say in a altered tone : we have much to talk of and you must be tired take off you cloak and eat whilst i think she obey he and he see that not only be she he son 's wife but that she must before long present the world with a heir to the name of caresfoot this make he think the more but meanwhile he continue to attend to she want she eat little but calmly that woman have nerve say he to himself then he ring the bell and bid simmon wait till he have write a note send jame to roxham at once with this take this lady 's thing off the fly and put they in the red bedroom by the way i be at home to nobody except mr bellamy and then turn to hilda now if you will come into my study we will continue we chat and he offer she he arm here we be secure from interruption he say with a ghost of a smile take this chair now forgive my impertinence but i must ask you if i be to understand that you be my son 's _ legal _ wife she flush a little as she answer : sir i be i have be careful to bring the proof here it be and she take from a little hand-bag a certified copy of the register of she marriage and give it to he he examine it carefully through he gold eye-glass and hand it back perfectly

dreadful in its intensity under the shadow of he thick black eyebrow gleam of light glinted and flicker in the expand pupil as before the outburst of a tempest the fork lightning flicker in the belly of the cloud he voice too be constrain and harsh owe to the position of he father 's head philip could not see this play of feature but he hear the voice and think that it mean mischief he have but a second to decide between confession and the lie that leap to he lip a inward conviction tell he that he father be not long for this world be it worth while to face he anger when matter might yet be keep dark till the end the tone of the voice -- ah how he mistake its meaning -- deceive he it be not he think possible that he father could know anything have he possess a little more knowledge of the world he might have judge differently marry no indeed what put that idea into you head and he laugh outright presently he become aware that he father have rise and be approach towards he another moment and a hand of iron be lay upon he shoulder the awful eye blaze into he face and seem to pierce he through and through and a voice that he could not have recognize hiss into he ear -- you unutterable liar you everlasting hound you wife be at this moment in this house philip spring up with a exclamation of rage and curse hilda aloud no go on he father standing before he he tall frame

and present with he glittering eye and work feature so terrible a spectacle of rage that he son recoil involuntarily before he but fury beget fury as love beget love and in another second philip feel he own wicked temper boil up within he he clench he tooth and stand firm do you worst he say i hate you i wish to god that you be dead hardly have these dreadful word leave he lip when a change come over the old man 's face it seem to stiffen and put one hand to he heart he stagger back into he chair point and make sign as he fall towards a little cupboard in the angle of the wall he son at once guess what have happen he father have get one of the attack of the heart to which he be subject and be motion to he to bring the medicine which he have before show he and which alone could save he in these seizure actuate by a common impulse of humanity philip for the moment forget they quarrel and step with all speed to fetch it as it happen there stand beneath this cupboard a table and on this table lay the document which he father have be read that afternoon before the arrival of mr bellamy it be he will and as be usual in the case of such deed the date be endorse upon the back all this philip see at a single glance and he also see that the will be date some year back and therefore one under which he would inherit doubtless the same that he father have some month before offer to show he it flash through he mind that he father have get it out in order to burn it and this idea be follow by another that for a moment still he heart _ if he should die now he can not destroy it _ if he do not take the medicine he _ will _ die think fly fast in moment of emergency philip too be a man of determine mind where he own interest be concerned and he blood be heat and he reason blind by fury and terror he be not long in settle on he course of action take the bottle from the cupboard he pour out its contents into one of the wine-glass that stand upon the table and come up to he father with it address he he know that these attack although they be of a nature to cause intense pain do not rob the sufferer of he sens the old man though he lay before he gasp with agony be quite in a condition to understand he listen to I he say in a slow distinct voice just now you say that you would disinherit I this medicine will save you life and if i let it fall you will die and there be no more in the house swear before god that you will not carry out you threat and i will give it to you lift up you hand to show I that you swear silence follow only break by the gasp of the die man if you will not swear i will pour it out before you eye again there be silence but this time the old man make a effort to rise and ring the bell he son throw he roughly back for the last time he say in a hoarse whisper will you swear a struggle pass over he father 's face now nearly black with pain and presently from the distended lip that do not seem to move there burst a single word -- destine to echo for ever in he son 's ear -- _ murderer _ it be he last he sink back groan and die and at the same moment the flame from the pine-chip flicker itself away and of a sudden the room grow nearly dark philip stand for awhile aghast at he own handiwork and watch the dull light glance on the dead white of he father 's brow he be benumb by terror at what he have do and in that awful second of realization would have give he own life to have it undo presently however the instinct of self-preservation come to he aid he light a candle and take some of the medicine in the glass smear it over the dead man 's chin and coat and then break the glass on the floor by he side -- thus make it appear that he have die whilst attempt to swallow the medicine next he raise a loud outcry and violently ring the bell in a minute the room be full of startled servant one of whom be instantly despatch for mr caley the doctor meanwhile after a vain attempt to restore animation the study-table be clear and the corpse lay on it as its mother 's have be on that day fifty year before then come a dreadful hush and the shadow of death come down upon the house and brood over it the men-servant move to and fro with muffle foot and the woman weep for in a way they have all love the imperious old man and the last change have come very suddenly philip 's brain burn he be consume by the desire of action suddenly he bethink he of he wife upstairs : after what he have just pass through no scene with she could disturb he -- it would he even feel be welcome he go up to the room where she be and enter it be evident that she have be tell of what have happen as both she and pigott who be undress she -- for she be weary out -- be weep she do not appear surprise at he appearance the shock of the old man 's death extinguish all surprise it be he who break the silence he be dead he say yes i have hear if you be at liberty for a few minute i wish to talk to you he say savagely i too she answer have something to say but i be too weary and upset to say it now i will see you to-morrow he turn and go without answer and pigott notice that no kiss or word of endearment pass between they and that the tone of they word be cold soon after philip get downstairs the doctor come philip meet he in the hall and accompany he into the study where the body be he make a rapid examination more as a matter of form than anything else for he first glance have tell he that life be extinct quite dead he say sorrowfully my old friend go at last one of a fine sort too a just man for all he temper they call he ` devil ' and he be fierce when he be younger but if i never meet a worse devil than he be i shall do well he be very kind to I once -- very how do he go -- in pain i fear we be talk together when suddenly he be seize with the attack i get the medicine as quick as i could and try to get it down he throat but he could not swallow and in the hurry the glass be knock by a jerk of he head right out of my hand next second he be dead very quick -- quicker than i should have expect do he say anything no now just as philip deliver himself of this last lie a curious incident happen or rather a incident that be apt to seem curious to a person who have just tell a lie the corpse distinctly move its right hand -- the same that have be clasp over the old man 's head as he denounce he son good god say philip turn pale as death what be that and even the doctor start a little and cast a keen look at the dead face nothing he say i have see that happen before where there have be considerable tension of the muscle before death it be only they final slacken that be all come will you ring the bell they have better come and take it upstairs this sad task have just be perform and mr caley be about to take he leave when pigott come down and whisper something into he ear that evidently cause he the most lively astonishment draw philip aside he say -- the housekeeper ask I to come up and see ` mr philip caresfoot ' whom she think be go to be confine do she mean you wife yes answer philip sullenly she do it be a long story and i be too upset to tell it you now it will soon be all over the country i suppose the old doctor whistle but judge it advisable not to put any more question when suddenly a idea seem to strike he you say you be talk to you father when the fit take he be it about you marriage yes when do he first know of it to-day i believe ah thank you and he follow pigott upstairs that night exactly at twelve o'clock another little lamp float out on the water of life : angelum be bear chapter xii when the doctor have go upstairs philip go into the dining-room to eat something only to find that food be repugnant to he he could scarcely swallow a mouthful to some extent however he supply its place by wine of which he drink several glass then draw by a strange fascination he go back into the little study and remember the will bethink himself that it might be as well to secure it in take it off the table however a fold and much erase sheet of manuscript be disclose recognize bellamy 's write he take it up and commence to read the draft for it be nothing else its substance be as follow the document begin by state that the testator 's former will be declare null and void on account of the treacherous and dishonourable conduct of he son philip it then in brief but sweeping term bequeath and devise to trustee of whom philip be not one the unentailed property and personalty to be hold by they : firstly for the benefit of any _ son _ that might be bear to the say disinherited philip by _ he wife hilda _ -- the question of daughter be probably by accident pass over in silence -- and fail such issue then to the testator 's nephew george caresfoot absolutely subject however to the follow curious condition : should the say george caresfoot _ either by deed of gift or will _ attempt to convey the estate to he cousin philip or to descendant of the say philip then the gift over to the say george be to be of none effect and the whole be to pass to some distant cousin of the testator 's who live in scotland then follow several legacy and one charge on the estate to the extent of 1000 pound a year payable to the _ separate _ use of the aforesaid hilda caresfoot for life and revert at death to the holder of the estate in plain english philip be under this draft totally disinherit first in favor of he own male issue by he wife hilda all mention of daughter be omit and fail such issue in favor of he hate cousin george who as though to add insult to injury be prohibit from willing the property back either to himself or he descendant by whom the testator have probably understand the child of a second marriage philip read the document over twice carefully phew he say that be touch and go thank heaven he have no time to carry out he kind intention but presently a terrible thought strike he he ring the bell hastily it be answer by the footman who since he have a hour before help to carry he poor master upstairs have become quite demoralize it be some time before philip could get a answer to he question as to whether or no any one have be with he father that day whilst he be out at last he succeed in extract a reply from the man that nobody have be except the young lady -- leastway he beg pardon mr caresfoot as he be tell she be never mind she say philip feeling as though a load have be take from he breast you be sure nobody else have be no sir nobody leastway he beg pardon nobody except lawyer bellamy and he clerk who have be there all the afternoon write with a black bag and have send for simmon to be witness you can go say philip in a quiet voice he see it all now he have let the old man die _ after _ he have execute the fresh will disinherit he he have let he die he have effectually and beyond redemption cut he own throat doubtless too bellamy have take the new will with he there be no chance of he be able to destroy it by degree however he fit of brooding give way to one of sullen fury against he wife himself but most of all against he dead father drunk with excitement rage and baffle avarice he seize and candle and stagger up to the room where the corpse have be lay launch imprecation as he go at he dead father 's head but when he come face to face with that dread presence he passion die and a cold sense of the awful quiet and omnipotence of death come upon he and chill he into fear in some indistinct way he realize how impotent be the chafing of the water of mortality against the iron - bind coast of death to what purpose do he rail against that solemn quiet thing that husk and mask of life which lay in unmoved mockery of he revile he father be dead and he even he have kill he father he be he father 's murderer and then a terror of the reckoning that must one day be strike between that dead man 's spirit and he own take possession of he and a foreknowledge of the awful shadow under which he must henceforth live creep into he mind and freeze the very marrow in he bone he look again at the face and to he excited imagination it appear to have assume a sardonic smile the curse of cain fall upon he as he look and weigh he down he hair rise and the cold sweat pour from he forehead at length he could bear it no longer but turn flee out of the room and out of the house far into the night when haggard with mental and bodily exhaustion he at length return it be after midnight he find dr caley wait for he he have just come from the sick-room and wear a anxious look upon he face you wife have be deliver of a fine girl he say but i be bind to tell you that she condition be far from satisfactory the case be a most complicated and dangerous one a girl groan philip mindful of the will be you sure that it be a girl of course i be sure answer the doctor testily and hilda ill -- i do not understand look here my good fellow you be upset take a glass of brandy and go to bed you wife do not wish to see you now but if necessary i will send for you now do as i tell you or you will be down next you nerve be seriously shake philip do as he be bid and as soon as he have see he off to he room the doctor return upstairs in the early morning he send for two of he brother-practitioner and they hold a consultation the upshot of which be that they have come to the conclusion nothing short of a miracle could save hilda 's life -- a conclusion that she herself have arrive at some hour before doctor she say i trust to you to let I know when the end be near i wish my husband to be present when i die but not before hush my child -- never talk of die yet please god you have many year of life before you she shake she golden head a little sadly no doctor my sand have run out and perhaps it as as well give I the child -- why do you keep the child away from I it be the messenger send to call I to a happier world yes she be a angel messenger when i be go see that you call she ` angelum ' so that i may know by what name to greet she when the time come during the course of the morning she express a strong desire to see marium lee who be accordingly send for it will be remember that old mr caresfoot have on the previous day immediately after hilda have leave he sit down and write to maria lee in this note he tell she the whole shameful truth end it with a few word of bitter humiliation and self-reproach that such a thing should have befall she at the hand of one bear he name over the agony of shame and grief thus let loose upon this unfortunate girl we will draw a veil it be fortunate for the endurance of human reason that life do not hold many such hour as that through which she pass after the receipt of this letter as be but natural notwithstanding old mr caresfoot 's brief vindication of hilda 's conduct in he letter marium be fill with indignation at what to herself she call she treachery and deceit while she be yet full of these thought a messenger come gallop over from bratham abbey bring a note from dr caley that tell she of she old friend 's sudden death and of hilda 's dangerous condition and she desire to see she the receipt of this news plunge she into a fresh access of grief for she have grow fond of the old man nor have the warm affection for hilda that have find a place in she gentle heart be altogether wrench away and now that she hear that she rival be face to face with that king of terror before whom all earthly love hate hope and ambition must fall down and cease they trouble it revive in all its force nor do any thought of she own wrong come to chill it within half a hour she be at the door of the abbey house where the doctor meet she and in answer to she eager question tell she that humanly speak it be impossible she friend could live through another twenty-four hour add a injunction that she must not stay with she long she enter the sick-room with a heavy heart and there from hilda 's die lip she hear the story of she marriage and of philip 's perfidy they reconciliation be as complete as she friend 's fail voice and strength would allow at length she tear herself away and turn at the door take she last look at hilda who have raise herself upon she elbow and be gaze at she retreat form with a earnestness that be very touch the eye marium feel be take they fill of what they look upon for the last time in this world catch she tearful gaze the die woman smile and lift she hand point upward thus they part but marium could control herself no longer : she own blast prospects the loss of the man she love and the affect scene through which she have just pass all help to break she down run downstairs into the dining-room she throw herself on a sofa and give full passage to she grief presently she become aware that she be not alone philip stand before she or rather the wreck of he whom she know as philip indeed it be hard to recognize in this scared man with dishevelled hair white and tremble lip and eye ringed round with black the bold handsome youth whom she have love the sight of he stay she sorrow and a sense of she bitter injury rush in upon she what do you want with I she ask want i want forgiveness i be crushed marium crush -- quite crushed and he put he hand to he face and sob she answer he with the quiet dignity that good woman can command in moment of emergency -- dignity of a very different stamp from hilda 's haughty pride but perhaps as impressive in its way you ask forgiveness of I and say that you be crushed have it occur to you that without fault of my own except the fault of trust you as entirely as i love you i too be crush do you know that you have wantonly or to gain selfish end break my heart blighted my name and drive I from my home for i can live here no more do you understand that you have do I one of the greatest injury one person can do to another i say do you know all this philip caresfoot and know it do you still ask I to forgive you do you think it possible that i _ can _ forgive he have never hear she speak like this before and do not remember that intense feeling be the mother of eloquence he gaze at she for a moment in astonishment then he drop he face into he hand again and groan make no other answer after wait awhile she go on -- i be a insignificant creature i know and perhaps the mite of my happiness or misery make little difference in the scale of thing but to I the gift of all my love be everything i give it to you philip -- give it without a doubt or murmur give it with both hand i can never have it back to give again how you have treat it you best know here she break down a little and then continue : it may seem curious but though my love have be so mistakenly give though you to whom it be give have deal so ill with it yet i be anxious that on my side there should be no bitter memory that in look back at all this in after year you should never be able to dwell upon any harsh or unkind word of mine it be on that account and also because i feel that it be not for I to judge you and that you have already much to bear that i do as you ask I and say ` philip from my heart i forgive you as i trust that the almighty may forgive I ' he fling himself upon he knee before she and try to take she hand you do not know how you have humble I he groan she gaze at he with pity i be sorry she say i do not wish to humble you i have one word more to say and then i must go i have just bid my last earthly farewell to -- you wife my farewell to you must be as complete as that as complete as though the grave have already swallow one of we we have do with each other for ever i do not think that i shall come back here in my wake moment you name shall never willingly pass my lip again i will say it for the last time now _ philip philip philip _ whom i choose to love out of all the world i pray god that he will take I or deaden the edge of what i suffer and that he may never let my foot cross you path or my eye fall upon you face again in another second she have pass out of the room and out of he life that night or rather just before dawn on the follow morning hilda know that she end be very near send for she husband go quickly doctor she say i shall die at dawn the doctor find he seat in the same spot where marium lee have leave he what more misery he say when he have tell he errand i can not bear it there be a curse upon I -- death and wickedness misery and death you must come if you wish to see you wife alive i will come and he rise and follow he a sad sight await he the moment of the gray dawn be draw near and by he wife 's request a window have be unshuttered that she dimmed eye might once more look upon the light on the great bed in the center of the room lay hilda whose life be now quickly drain from she and by she side be place the sleep infant she be raise and support on either side by pillow and she unbound golden hair fall around she shoulder enclose she face as in a frame she pallid countenance seem touch with a awful beauty that have not belong to it in life whilst in she eye be that dread and prescient gaze which sometimes come to those who be about to solve death 's mystery by the side of the bed kneel mr fraser the clergyman of the parish repeat in a earnest tone the prayer for the die whilst the sad-faced attendant move with muffle tread backwards and forwards from the ring of light around the bed into the dark shadow that lay beyond when philip come the clergyman cease pray and draw back into the further part of the room as do pigott and the nurse the former take the baby with she hilda motion to he to come close to she he come and bent over and kiss she and she with a effort throw one ivory arm around he neck and smile sweetly after about a minute during which she be apparently collect she thought she speak in a low voice and in she native tongue i have not send for you before philip for two reason -- first because i wish to spare you pain and next in order that i might have time to rid my mind of angry thought against you they be all go now -- go with every other earthly interest but i _ be _ angry with you philip and now listen to I -- for i have not much time -- and do not forget my word in future year when the story of my life will seem but as a shadow that once fall upon you path change you way philip dear abandon deceit atone for the past if you can make you peace with marium lee and marry she -- ah it be a pity that you do not do that at first and leave I to go my way -- and above all humble you heart before the power that i be about to face i love you dear and notwithstanding all i be thankful to have be you wife please god we shall meet again she pause awhile and then speak in english to the astonishment of all she voice be strong and clear and she utter she word with a energy that under the circumstance seem almost awful tell she to bring the child there be no need for philip to repeat what she say for pigott hear she and at once come forward with the baby which she lay beside she the die woman place she hand upon its tiny head and turn she eye upward with the rapt expression of one who see a vision say -- may the power of god be about you to protect you my motherless babe may angel guard you and make you as they be and may the heavy curse and everlasting doom of the almighty fall upon those who would bring evil upon you she pause and then address she husband philip you have hear my word in you charge i leave the child see that you never betray my trust then turn to pigott she say in a fainter voice -- thank you for you kindness to I you have a good face if you can stop with my child and give she you love and care and now may god have mercy on my soul then come a minute 's silence break only by the stifled sob of those who stand around till a ray of light from the rise sun struggle through the gray mist of the morning and touch the head of mother and child illumine they as with a glory it pass as quickly as it come draw away with it the mother 's life suddenly as it fade she spread out she arm sigh and smile when the doctor reach the bed she story be tell : she have fall asleep death have be very gentle with she chapter xiii go my reader if the day be dull and you feel inclined to moralize -- for whatever may be say to the contrary there be less useful occupation -- and look at you village churchyard what do you see before you a plot of enclosed ground back by a gray old church a number of tombstone more or less decrepit and a great quantity of little oblong mound cover with rank grass if you have any imagination any power of thought you will see more than that first with the instinctive selfishness of human nature you will recognize you own future habitation perhaps you eye will mark the identical spot where the body you love must lie through all season and weather through the slow century that will flit so fast for you till the crash of doom it be good that you should think of that although it make you shudder the english churchyard take the place of the egyptian mummy at the feast or the slave in the roman conqueror 's car -- it mock you vigor and whisper of the end of beauty and strength probably you need some such reminder but if give to the inevitable the sigh that be its due you pursue the vein of think it may further occur to you that the plot before you be in a sense a summary of the aspiration of humanity it mark the realization of human hope it be the crown of human ambition the grave of human failure here too be the end of the man and here the birthplace of the angel or the demon it be he sure inheritance one that he never solicit and never squander and last it be the only certain resting-place of sleepless tired mortality here it be that they bring hilda and the old squire and lay they side by side against the coffin of yeoman caresfoot whose fancy it have be to be bury in stone and then pile primrose and blackthorn bloom upon they grave leave they to they chilly sleep farewell to they they have pass to where as yet we may not follow violent old man and proud and lovely woman rest in peace if peace be the portion of you both to return to the live the news of the sudden decease of old mr caresfoot of the discovery of philip 's secret marriage and the death of he wife of the term of the old man 's will under which hilda be dead and have only leave a daughter behind she george inherit all the unentailed portion of the property with the curious provision that he be never to leave it back to philip or he child of the sudden departure of miss lee and of many other thing that be some of they true and some of they false follow as they do upon the heel of the great dinner-party and the announcement make thereat throw the country-side into a state of indescribable ferment when this settle down it leave a strong and permanent residuum of public indignation and contempt direct against philip the more cordially perhaps because he be no longer a rich man people very rarely express contempt or indignation against a rich man who happen to be they neighbor in the country whatever he may have do they keep they virtue for those who be impoverished or for they unfortunate relation but for philip it be feel that there be no excuse and no forgiveness he have lose both he character and he money and must therefore be cut and from that day forward he be cut accordingly as for philip himself he be fortunately as yet ignorant of the kind intention of he friend and neighbor who have be so fond of he a week ago he have enough upon he shoulder without that -- for he have speak no lie when he tell marium lee that he be crush by the dreadful and repeated blow that have fall upon he blow that have rob he of everything that make life worth living and give he in return nothing but a infant who could not inherit and who be therefore only a incumbrance who be it that say after all let a bad man take what pain he may to push it down a human soul be a awful ghostly unique possession for a bad man to have during the time that have elapse between the death and burial of he father and wife philip have become thoroughly acquaint with the truth of this remark do what he would he could never for a single hour shake himself free from the recollection of he father 's death whenever he shut he eye he uneasy mind continually conjure up the whole scene with uncanny distinctness the gloomy room the contorted face of the die man the red flicker of the firelight on the wall -- all these thing be burnt deep into the tablet of he memory more and more do he recognize the fact that even should he live long enough to bury the event of that hour beneath the debris of many year the lapse of time would be insufficient to bring forgetfulness and the recognition bring with it moral helplessness he have too sufficient religious feeling to make he uneasy as to he future fate and possess a certain amount of imagination which be at this time all direct towards that awful day when he and he dead father must settle they final account already in the quiet night he would wake with a start think that the inevitable time have come superstitious fear also would seize he with they clammy finger and he would shake and tremble at the fancied step of ghostly foot and he blood would curdle in he vein as he mind hearken to voice that be for ever still and worst of all what have be do and could never be undo have be do in vain these deadly torment must be endure whilst the object for which they have be incur have utterly escape he he have sell himself to the power of evil for a price and that price have not be pay but the bond be good for all that and so he would brood hour after hour till he feel himself draw near to madness sometimes by a strong effort he would succeed in tear he mind away from the subject but then its place be instantly fill by a proud form with reproachful eye and he would feel that there too death have put it out of he power to make atonement of those whom he have wrong marium lee alone survive and she have leave he in sorrow more bitter than any anger truly philip caresfoot be in melancholy case somewhere he have read that the wages of sin be death but surely what he feel surpass the bitterness of death he evil-doing have not prosper with he the snare he have set for he father have fall back upon himself and he be a crushed and ruin man it afford a curious insight into he character to reflect that all these piled-up calamity all this wreck and sudden death do not bring he penitent on he knee before the maker he have outrage the crime he have commit especially if unsuccessful or the sorrow that have fall upon he would have suffice to reduce nine-tenth of ordinary man to a condition of humble supplication for generally speak irreligion or rather forgetfulness of god be a plant of no deep growth in the human heart since its root be turn by the rock of that innate knowledge of a higher power that form the foundation of every soul and on which we be glad enough to set we foot when the storm of trouble and emergency threaten to destroy we but with philip this be not so he never think of repentance he be not the nature to fall down and say lord i have sin take thou my burden from I indeed he be not so much sorry for the past as fearful for the future it be not grief for wrong-doing that wring he heart and break he spirit but rather he natural sorrow at lose the only creature he have ever deeply love chagrin at the shame of he position and the failure of he hope and the icy finger of superstitious fear the crisis have come and pass : he have sin against he father in heaven and he father on earth and he do not sorrow for he sin he wife have leave he murmur with she die lip exhortation to repentance and he do not soften shame and loss have fall upon he and he do not turn to god but he pride be break all that remain to he of strength be he wickedness the flood that have sweep over he have purge away not the evil but the good from the evil it only take its courage henceforth if he sin at all he will be no bold and hazardous villany which whilst it excite horror can almost compel respect but rather the low and sordid crime the safe and treacherous iniquity ajax no longer defy the lightning -- he mutter curse on it beneath he breath on the evening of the double funeral -- which philip do not feel equal to attend and at which george in a most egregious hatband and with many sob and tear officiate as chief mourner -- mr fraser think it would be a kind act on he part to go and offer such consolation to the bereaved man as lay within he power if indeed he would accept it somewhat contrary to he expectation he be on arrival at the abbey house ask in without delay i be glad to see a human face say philip to the clergyman as he enter the room this loneliness be intolerable i be as much alone as though i lay stark in the churchyard like my poor wife mr fraser do not answer he immediately so take up be he in notice the wonderful change a week have work in he appearance not only do he countenance bear trace of the illness and exhaustion that might not unnaturally be expect in such a case of bereavement but it faithfully reflect the change that have take place in he mental attitude he eye have lose the frank boldness that have make they very please to some people they look scare the mouth too be render conspicuous by the absence of the firm line that once give it character indeed the man 's whole appearance be pitiful and almost abject i be afraid he say at length in a tone of gentle compassion that you must have suffer a great deal caresfoot suffer i have suffer the torture of the damned i still suffer they i shall always suffer they i do not wish say the clergyman with a little hesitation to appear officious or to make a mockery of you grief by tell you that it be for you good but i should fail in my duty if i do not point out to you that he who strike the blow have the power to heal the wound and that very often such thing be for we ultimate benefit either in this world or the next carry you trouble to he my dear fellow acknowledge he hand and if you know in you heart of any way in which you have sin offer he you hearty repentance do this and you will not be desert you life that now seem to you nothing but ash may yet be both a happy and a useful one philip smile bitterly as he answer -- you talk to I of repentance -- how can i repent when providence have treat I so cruelly rob I at a single blow of my wife and my fortune i know that i do wrong in conceal my marriage but i be drive to it by fear of my father ah if you have see he as i see he you would have know that they be right to call he ` devil caresfoot ' he check himself and then go on -- he force I into the engagement with miss lee and announce it without my consent now i be ruin -- everything be take from I you have you little daughter and all the entail estate -- at least so i be tell my little daughter -- i never want to see she face she kill she mother if it have be a boy it would have be different for then at any rate that accurse george would not have get my birthright my little daughter indeed do not enumerate she among my earthly blessing it be rather sad to hear you talk like that of you child but at any rate you be not leave in want you have one of the finest old place in the county and a thousand a year which to most man would be riches and which to I answer philip be beggary i should have have six and i have get one but look you here fraser i swear before god -- hush i can not listen to such talk well then before anything you like that while i live i will never rest one single moment until i get my own back again it may seem impossible but i will find a way for instance he add as a thought strike he strangely enough the will do not forbid I to buy the land back if i can get they no other way i will buy they -- do you hear -- i will buy they i _ must _ have they again before i die how will you get the money the money -- i will save it make it steal it get it somehow oh do not be afraid i will get the money it will take a few year but i will get it somehow it be not the want of a few thousand that will stop a determine man and suppose you cousin will not sell i will find a way to make he sell -- some bribe something there there and he enthusiasm and eagerness vanish in a moment and the broken look come back upon he face it be all nonsense i be talk impossibility -- a little weak in my mind i suppose forget it there be a good fellow say nothing about it and so you bury they ah I ah I and george do chief mourner i suppose he blubber freely he always could blubber freely when he like i remember how he use to take folk in as a lad and then laugh at they that be why they call he ` crocodile ' at school well he be my master now and i be he very humble servant perhaps one day it will be the other way up again what must you go if you know how fearfully lonely i be you would not go my nerve have quite go and i fancy all sort of thing i can think of nothing but those two grave out there in the dark have they sod they over tell they to sod they over it be kind of you to come and see I you must not pay any attention to my talk i be not quite myself good night mr fraser be a extremely unsuspicious man but somehow as he pick he way to the vicarage to eat he solitary chop he feel a doubt rise in he mind as to whether he disclaimer notwithstanding philip have not sincerely mean all he say he be shockingly change he muse and i be not sure that it be a change for the better poor fellow he have a great deal to bear and should be kindly judge it be all so painful that i must try to divert my mind mr brown will you bring I a little chocolate - color book that you will see on the table in my study when you come back with the potato it have plato -- p-l-a-t-o -- print on the back chapter xiv the jubilation of george at the turn event have take may perhaps be more easily imagine than describe there be generally one weak point about all artful scheme to keep other people out of they rights they break down over some unforeseen detail or through the neglect of some trivial and obvious precaution but this be one of the glorious instance to the contrary that prove the rule nothing have break down everything have prosper as a holy cause always should and do -- in theory the star in they course have fight for sisera everything have succeed beyond expectation nothing have fail in the gratitude of he heart george would willingly have give a thousand pound towards the establishment of a training-school for anonymous letter-writer or the erection of a statue to hilda caresfoot whose outraged pride and womanly jealousy have do he such yeoman service speak seriously he have great cause for rejoice instead of a comparatively slender younger son 's portion he have step into a fine and unencumbered property of over five thousand a year and that in the heyday of he youth when in the full possession of all he capacity for enjoyment which be large indeed henceforth everything that money could buy would be he include the respect and flattery of he poorer neighbor a add flavor too be give to the overflow cup of he good fortune by the fact that it have be wrench from the hand of the cousin whom he hate and on whom he have from a boy swear to be avenge poor philip bankrupt in honor and break in fortune he could afford to pity he now to pity he ostentatiously and in public he be open-handed with he pity be george nor do he lack a sympathizer in these delicious moment of unexpected triumph do i not tell you say mr bellamy in she full rich tone on the afternoon of the reading of the will -- do i not tell you that if you would consent to be guide by I i would pull you through and have i not pull you through never misdoubt my judgment again my dear george it be infinitely sounder than you own you do anne you certainly do you be a charming woman and as clever as you be charming compliment be all very well and i be sure i appreciate yours -- and she give a little curtsey -- at they proper value but i must remind you george that i have do my part of the bargain and that now you must do yours oh that be all right bellamy shall have the agency and two hundred a year with it and to show you that i have not forget you perhaps you will accept this in memorial of we joint achievement and he draw from he pocket and open a case contain a superb set of sapphire mr bellamy have all a beautiful woman 's love for jewel and especially adore sapphire oh she say clasp she hand thank you george they be perfectly lovely perhaps he reply politely but not half so lovely as they wearer i wonder he add with a little laugh what the old boy would say if he could know that a thousand pound of he personalty have go by anticipation to buy a necklace for anne bellamy to this remark she make no reply be apparently absorb in she own thought at last she speak i do not want to seem ungracious george but these -- and she touch the jewel -- be not the reward i expect : i want the letter you promise I back my dear anne you be under a mistake i never promise you the letter i say that under the circumstance i might possibly restore they -- a very different thing from promising mr bellamy flush a little and the great pupil of she sleepy eye contract till she look quite dangerous then i must have strangely misunderstand you she say what do you want the letter for can not you trust I with they do not you think george that if you have pass through something very terrible you would like to have all the memento of that dark time destroy those letter be the record of my terrible time nothing remain of it but those write line i want to burn they to stamp they into powder to obliterate they as i have obliterate all the past whilst they exist i can never feel safe suppose you be to turn traitor to I and let those letter fall into the hand of other suppose that you lose they i should be a ruin woman i speak frankly you see i fully appreciate my danger principally because i know that the more intimate a man and woman have be the more chance there be of they become bitter enemy george give I those letter do not overcloud my future with the shadow of the past you talk as well as you do everything else anne you be really a very remarkable woman but curiously enough those letter the existence of which be so obnoxious to you be to I a source of great interest you know that i love to study character -- curious occupation for a young man be not it -- but i do well in my small experience i have never yet either in fiction or in real life come across such a fascinating display as be reflect in those letter there i can and often do trace in minutest detail the agony of a strong mind can see the barrier of what people call religion early training self - respect and other curiosity which we name virtue burst away one by one under pressure like the water-tight bulkhead they put in passenger steamer till at length the work be do the moral ship sink and the writer stand reveal what you be my dear anne the loveliest the cleverest and the most utterly unscrupulous woman in the three kingdom she rise very quietly but quite white with passion and answer in she low voice -- whatever i be you make I and _ you _ be a devil george caresfoot or you could not take pleasure in the torture you inflict before you destroy but do not go too far or you may regret it be i a woman to be play with i think that you have train I too well he laugh a little uneasily there you see _ grattez le russe _ & c and out come the true character look at you face in the glass it be magnificent but not pleasant rather dangerous indeed why anne do be reasonable if i give you those letter i should never be able to sleep in peace for the sake of my own safety i dare not abandon the whip-hand i have of you remember you could if you choose say some unpleasant thing about I and i do not want that any more than you do just now but you see whilst i hold in my power what would if necessary effectually ruin you and probably bellamy too -- for this country society be absurdly prejudiced -- i have little cause for fear perhaps in the future you may be able to render I some service for which you shall have the letter -- who know you see i be perfectly frank with you for the simple reason that i know that it be useless to try to conceal my thought from a person of you perception well well perhaps you be right : it be difficult to trust oneself much less any one else at any rate she say with a bitter smile you have give I bellamy a start in society and a sapphire necklace in twenty year i hope if the fate be kind to have lose bellamy on the road -- he be really unendurable -- to rule society and to have as many sapphire necklace and other fine thing as i care for in enumerate my quality you omit one ambition with you look you determination and you brain there be nothing that you will not be able to do if you set you mind to it and do not make a enemy of you devoted friend and thus the conversation end now little bellamy have after much anxious thought just about this time come to a bold determination -- namely to asset he marital authority over mr bellamy indeed he self-pride be much injure by the treatment he receive at he wife 's hand for it seem to he that he be utterly ignore in he own house in fact it would not be too much to say that he _ be _ a entire nonentity he have marry mr bellamy for love or rather from fascination though she have nothing in the world -- married she in a fortnight from the time that george have first introduce he when he have walk out of church with he beautiful bride he have think himself the luckiest man in london whereas now he could not but feel that matrimony have not fulfil he expectation in the first place love 's young dream -- he be barely thirty -- come to a rude awakening for once marry it be impossible -- though he have in common with the majority of little man a tolerably good opinion of himself -- but that he should perceive that he wife do not care one brass farthe about he to he soft advance she be as cold as a marble statue the lovely eye never grow tender for he indeed he find that she be worse than a statue for statue can not indulge in bitter mockery and contemptuous comment and mr bellamy could and what be more frequently do it be very well reflect she husband to marry the loveliest woman in the county but i do not see the use of it if she treat one like a dog at last this state of affair have grow intolerable and meditate in the solitude of he office mr bellamy resolve to assert himself once and for all and set matter on a proper footing and mr bellamy in she place but it be one thing for husband of the bellamy stamp to form high-stomached resolution and another for they to put those resolution into active and visible operation on wife of the mr bellamy stamp indeed have it not be for a little incident about to be detail it be doubtful if mr bellamy would have ever come to the scratch at all when george have go mr bellamy sit down in by no mean the sweetest of temper to think but think in this instance prove a unprofitable occupation and she give it up in order to admire the sapphire necklace that lay upon she knee at that moment she husband enter the room but she take no notice merely go on examine the stone after move about a little as though to attract attention the gentleman speak i have manage to get home to lunch my dear indeed well you might take a little notice of I why be there anything remarkable about you this morning no there be not but remarkable or not a man who have be fool enough -- mr bellamy lay great emphasis on the word fool -- to get marry have a right to expect when he come into he own house that he will have a little notice take of he and not be as completely overlook as -- as though he be a tub of butter in a grocer 's shop and he pug out he chest rub he hand and look defiant the lady lay she head back on the chair and laugh with exquisite enjoyment really my dear john you will kill I she say at length may i ask he reply look as though there be nothing in the world that he would like better what you be laugh at you slightly vulgar but happy simile it be easy to see where you draw you inspiration from if you have only say butterine inferior butter you know the counterfeit article it would have be perfect she husband give a glance at he tubby little figure in the glass be i to understand that you refer to I as ` butterine ' mr bellamy oh certainly yes if you like but butter or not you will melt if you lose you temper so i have not lose my temper madam i be perfectly cool he reply positively gasp with fury here he eye fall upon the necklace what necklace be that who give you that necklace i demand to know you _ demand _ to know be careful what you say please mr george caresfoot give I the necklace it cost a thousand pound be you satisfied no i be not satisfied i will not have that cursed george caresfoot continually here i will send he back he necklace i will assert my rights as a englishman and a spouse i will -- you will sit down and listen to I the tone of the voice check he absurd linguistic and physical caper and cause he to look at he wife she be stand and point to a chair she face be calm and immovable only she eye appear to expand and contract with startling rapidity one glance be enough for bellamy he feel frightened and sit down in the indicate chair that be right she say pleasantly now we can have a cosy chat john you be a lawyer and therefore i suppose more or less a man of the world now _ as _ a lawyer and a man of the world i ask you to look at I and then at yourself and say if you think it likely or even possible that i marry you for love to be frank i do nothing of the sort i marry you because you be the person most suit to my purpose if you will only understand that it will save we both a great deal of trouble as for you talk about assert yourself and exercise you authority it be simple nonsense you be very well in you way my dear john and a fair attorney but do you suppose for one moment that you be capable of match yourself against I if so you make a shocking mistake be advise and do not try the experiment but do not think that the bargain be all my side -- it be not if you will behave yourself properly and be guide by my advice i will make you one of the richest and most powerful man in the county if you will not i shall shake myself free of you as soon as i be strong enough rise i must and will and if you will not rise with I i will rise alone as regard you complaint of my not care about you the world be wide my dear john console yourself elsewhere i shall not be jealous and now i think i have explain everything it be so much more satisfactory to have a clear understanding come shall we go to lunch but bellamy want no lunch that day after all he soliloquize to himself between the pang of a rack headache bring on by he outburst of temper time sometimes bring its revenge and if it do you may look out mr bellamy chapter xv it be perhaps time that the reader should know a little of the ancient house and loyalty where many of the personage of whose history these page treat live and move and have they be the abbey house so call be in reality that part of the monastery which have be devote to the use of successive generation of prior it be like the ruin that lay to its rear entirely build of gray masonry render greyer still by the lichen that feed upon its wall which be of exceed strength and thickness it be a long irregular building and roof with old and narrow tile which from red have in the course of age fade to sober russet the banqueting - hall be a separate building at its northern end and connect with the main dwelling by a covered way the aspect of the house be westerly and the front window look on to a expanse of park-like land heavily timbered with oak of large size some of they pollard that might have push they first leaf in the time of william the conqueror in spring they vivid green be diversify by the reddish brown of a double line of noble walnut-tree a full half mile in length mark the track of the carriage-drive that lead to the roxham high-road behind the house lay the walled garden celebrate in the time of the monk as be a fortnight earlier than any other in the neighborhood skirt the southern wall of this garden which be a little less than a hundred pace long the visitor reach the scatter ruin of the old monastery that have for generation serve as a stone quarry to the surround village but of which enough be leave include a magnificent gateway to show how great have be its former extent pass on through these he would come to a enclosure that mark the boundary of the old graveyard now turn to agricultural use and then to the church itself a building with a very fine tower but possess no particular interest if we except some exceedingly good brass and a colossal figure of a monk cut out of the solid heart of a oak and suppose to be the effigy of a prior of the abbey who die in the time of edward i below the church again and about one hundred and fifty pace from it be the vicarage a comparatively modern building possess no architectural attraction and evidently rear out of the remains of the monastery at the south end of the abbey house itself lay a small grass plot and pleasure-garden fringed with shrubbery and adorn with two fine cedar-tree one of these tree be at its further extremity and under it there run a path cut through the dense shrubbery this path which be edge with lime and call the tunnel walk lead to the lake and debouch in the little glade where stand caresfoot 's staff the lake itself be a fine piece of water partly natural and partly construct by the monk measure a full mile round and from fifty to two hundred yard in width it be in the shape of a man 's shoe the heel face west like the house but project beyond it the narrow part represent the hollow of the instep be exactly opposite to it and the sole swell out in a easterly direction bratham abbey be altogether a fine old place but the most remarkable thing about it be its air of antiquity and the solemnity of its peace it do not indeed strike the spirit with that religious awe which be apt to fall upon we as we gaze along the vaulted aisle of great cathedral but it appeal perhaps with equal strength to the softer and more reflective side of we nature for generation after generation that house have be the home of man like ourselves they have pass and be forget but it remain the sole witness of the story of they life hand of which the very bone have long since crumble into dust have plant those old oak and walnut that still don they green robe in summer and shed they in the autumn to stand great skeleton through the winter month await the resurrection of the spring there lay upon the place and its surroundings a burden of dead life intangible but none the less real the air be thick with memory as suggestive as the gray dust in a vault even in the summer in the full burst of nature revelling in she strength the place be sad but in the winter when the wind come howl through the groan tree and drive the gray scud across a ashy sky when the bird be dumb and there be no cattle on the sodden lawn its isolate melancholy be a palpable thing that hoary house might have be a gateway of the dim land we call the past look down in stony sorrow on the folly of those who so soon must cross its portal and to the wise who could hear the lesson pregnant with echo of the warning voice of many generation here it be that angelum grow up to womanhood some nine and a half year have pass from the date of the event describe in the foregoing page when one evening mr fraser bethought he that he have be indoors all day and propose read till late that night and that therefore he have better take some exercise a tall and somewhat nervous-looking man with dark eye a sensitive mouth and that peculiar stoop and pallor of complexion which those devote to much study almost invariably acquire he have student write on he face he history be a sufficiently common one he possess academical ability of a very high order and have in he youth distinguish himself greatly at college both as a classical and a mathematical scholar when quite young he be appoint through the influence of a relation to he present living where the income be good and the population very small indeed free from all necessity for exertion he shut himself up with he book have he little round of parish work for relaxation and never seek to emerge from the quiet of he aimless study to struggle for fame and place in the laborious world mr fraser be what people call a able man throw away if they have know he shy sensitive nature a little better they would have understand that he be infinitely more suit for the solitary and peaceful lot in life which he have choose than to become a unit in the turbulent and greedy crowd that be struggle through all the age up the slippery slope of the temple of that greatest of we god -- success there be many such man probably you my reader know one or two with infinite labor they store up honey from the field of knowledge collect endless datum from the statistics of science pile up they calculation against the very star and all to no end as a rule they do not write book they gather the learning for the learning 's sake and for the very love of it rejoice to count they labor lose and thus they go on from year to year until the golden bowl be break and the pitcher break at the fountain and the gather knowledge sink or appear to sink back to whence it come alas that one generation can not hand on its wisdom and experience -- more especially its experience -- to another in its perfect form if it could we man should soon become as god it be a mild evening in the latter end of October when mr fraser start on he walk the moon be up in the heaven as he a hour later make he way from the side of the lake where he have be wander back to the churchyard through which he have to pass to reach the vicarage just before he come to the gate however he be surprise in such a solitary spot to see a slight figure lean against the wall opposite the place where lay the mortal remains of the old squire and he daughter-in-law hilda he stand still and watch the figure appear to be gaze steadily at the grave presently it turn and see he and he recognize the great gray eye and golden hair of little angelum caresfoot angelum my dear what be you do here at this time of night he ask in some surprise she blush a little as she shake hand rather awkwardly with he do not be angry with I she say in a deprecatory voice but i be so lonely this evening that i come here for company come here for company what do you mean she hang she head come he say tell I what you mean i do not quite know myself how can i tell you he look more puzzle than ever and she observe it and go on : i will try to tell you but you must not be cross like pigott when she can not understand I sometimes i feel ever so much alone as though i be look for something and could not find it and then i come and stand here and look at my mother 's grave and i get company and be not lonely any more that be all i know i can not tell you any more do you think I silly pigott do i think you be a very strange child be you not afraid to come here alone at night afraid -- oh no nobody come here the people in the village dare not come here after dark because they say that the ruin be full of spirit jake tell I that but i must be stupid i can not see they and i want so very much to see they i hope it be not wrong but i tell my father so the other day and he turn white and be angry with pigott for give I such idea but you know pigott do not give they to I at all i be not afraid to come i like it it be so quiet and if one listen enough in the quiet i always think one may hear something that other people do not hear do you hear anything then yes i hear thing but i can not understand they listen to the wind in the branch of that tree the chestnut off which the leaf be fall now it say something if only i could catch it yes child yes you be right in a way all nature tell the same eternal tale if we ear be not stop to its voice he answer with a sigh indeed the child 's talk have strike a vein of thought familiar to he own mind and what be more it deeply interested he there be a quaint far-off wisdom in it it be pleasant to-night be it not mr fraser say the little maid though everything be die the thing die softly without any pain this year last year they be all kill in the rain and wind look at that cloud float across the moon be it not beautiful i wonder what it be the shadow of i think all the cloud be shadow of something up in heaven and when there be no cloud oh then heaven be quite still and happy but heaven be always happy be it i do not understand how it can be always happy if _ we _ go there there must be so many to be sorry for mr fraser muse a little that last remark be difficult to answer he look at the fleecy cloud and fall into she humor say -- i think you cloud be the shadow of a eagle carry a lamb to its little one and i think she answer confidently that it be the shadow of a angel carry a baby home again he be silence the idea be infinitely more poetical than he own this he reflect be a child of a curious mental calibre before he could pursue the thought further she break in upon it in quite a different strain have you see jack and jill they _ be _ jolly who be jack and jill why my raven of course i get they out of the old tree with a hole in it at the end of the lake the tree at the end of the lake why the hole where the raven nest be fifty foot up who get they for you i get they myself sam -- you know sam -- be afraid to go up he say he should fall and that the old bird would peck he eye so i go by myself one morning quite early with a bag tie round my neck and get up it be hard work and i nearly tumble once but i get on the bough beneath the hole at last it shake very much it be so rotten you have no idea there be three little one in the nest all with great mouth i take two and leave one for the old bird when i be nearly down again the old bird find I out and fly at I and beat my head with they wing and peck -- oh they do peck look here and she show he a scar on she hand that be where they peck but i stick to my bag and get down at last and i be glad i do for we be great friend now and i be sure the cross old bird would be quite pleased if they know how nicely i be educate they young one and how they manners have improve but i say mr fraser do not tell pigott she can not climb tree and do not like to see I do it she do not know i go after they myself mr fraser laugh i will not tell she angelum my dear but you must be careful -- you might tumble and kill yourself i do not think i shall mr fraser unless i be mean to god look after I as much when i be up a tree as when i be upon the ground once more he have nothing to say he could not venture to disturb she faith i will walk home with you my dear tell I angelum would you like to learn learn -- learn what book and the language that other nation nation that have pass away use to talk and how to calculate number and distance yes i should like to learn very much but who will teach I i have learn all pigott know two year ago and since then i have be try to learn about the tree and flower and star but i look and watch and can not understand ah my dear contact with nature be the highest education but the mind that would appreciate she wonder must have a foundation of knowledge to work upon the uneducated man be rarely sensitive to the thousand beauty and marvel of the field around he and the sky above he but if you like i will teach you angela i be practically a idle man and it will give I great pleasure but you must promise to work and do what i tell you oh how good you be of course i will work when be i to begin i do not know -- to-morrow if you like but i must speak to you father first she face fall a little at the mention of she father 's name but presently she say quietly -- my father he will not care if i learn or not i hardly ever see my father he do not like I i see nobody but pigott and you and old jakes and sam sometimes you need not ask my father he will never miss I whilst i be learn ask pigott at that moment pigott herself heave into view in a great flurry oh here you be miss angelum where have

win smile and take she very solid hand between she own tiny palm do not be cross pigott dear she say i do not mean to frighten you i could not help go -- i could not indeed and then i stop talk to mr

she be go with a merry laugh there sir that be just like she catch a body up like and twist what she say till you do not know which be head and which be heel i 'll be bind you find she down yonder and she nod towards the churchyard yes pigott draw a little nearer and speak in a low voice ` tis my belief sir that that child see _ thing _ she be just the oddest child i ever see there be nothing she like better than to slip out of a night and to go to that there beastly churchyard save you presence for ` company ' as she call it -- nice sort of company indeed and it be just the same way with storm you remember that dreadful gale a month ago the one that take down the north grove and blow the spire off rewtham church well just when it be at its worst and i be a-sitting and pray that the roof might keep over we head i look round for angelum and can not see she ` some of you trick again ' think i to myself and just then up come mr jake to say that sam have see little missy creep down the tunnel walk i be that scare that i run down get hold of sam for jakes say he would not go out with all they tree a-flying about in the air like straw -- no not for a thousand pound and off we set after she here pigott pause to groan at the recollection of that walk well say mr fraser who be rather interested -- everything about this queer child interested he where do you find she well sir you know where the old wall run out into the water before caresfoot 's staff there well at the end of it there be a post sink in with a ring in it to tie boat to now would you believe it out there at the end of the wall and tie to the ring by a scarf pass round she middle be that dreadful child she be stand there she back against the post right in the tooth of the gale with the spray dashing over she she arm stretch out before she she hat go she long hair stand out behind straight as a iron bar and she eye flash as though they be on fire and all the while there be the great tree crash down all round in a way enough to make a body sick with fright we get she back safe thank god but how long we shall keep she i be sure i do not know now she be drown herself in the lake for she take to the water like a duck and now break she neck off tree and now go to ghost in the churchyard for company it be wear I to the bone -- that be what it be mr fraser smile for to tell the truth pigott 's bone be pretty comfortably cover come he say you would not part with she for all she wicked deed would you part with she answer pigott in hot indignation part with my little beauty i would rather part with my head the love there never be another like she nor never will be with she sweet way and if i know anything about girl she 'll be the beauty of england she will she be make for a beautiful woman and look at they eye and forehead and hair -- where do you ever see the like and as for she queer way what can you expect from a child as have get a great empty mind and nothing to put in it and no one to talk to but a common woman like I and a father -- here she drop she voice -- as be a miser and hate the sight of he own flesh and blood hush you should not say such thing pigott now i will tell you something i be go on to ask you master to allow I to educate angelum i be right glad to hear it sir she be sharp enough to learn anything and it be kind of you to teach she if you can make she mind like what she body will be if she live somebody will be a lucky man one of these day good-night sir and many thanks for bring missy home next day angelum begin she education chapter xvi reader we be about to see angelum again and to see a good deal of she but you must be prepare for a change in she personal appearance for the curtain have be down for ten year since last you meet the child whose odd propensity excite pigott 's wonder and indignation and mr fraser 's interest and ten year as we all know can work many change in the history of the world and individual in ten year some have be sweep clean off the board and they place take by other a few have grow richer many poorer some of we sadder some wiser and all of we ten year older now this be exactly what have happen to little angelum -- that be the angelum we know as little and ten year make curious difference between the slim child of nine and a half and the woman of nearly twenty when we last see she angelum be about to commence she education let we re-introduce ourselves on the memorable evening when after ten year of study mr fraser a master by no means easily pleased express himself unable to teach she any more it be christmas eve drip drop drip fall the rain from the leafless bough on to the sodden earth the apology for daylight that have be do its dull duty for the last few hour be slowly efface itself and the gale be celebrate the fact and show its joy at the closing-in of the melancholy night by howl its loudest through the tree and flog the fly scud it have bring with it from the sea till it whirl across the sky like a succession of ghostly racehorse this be outside the vicarage let we look within in a well-worn arm - chair in the comfortable study near to a table cover with book and hold some loose sheet of foolscap in he hand sit mr fraser he hair be a little greyer than when he begin angelum 's education about as gray as rather accommodate hair will get at the age of fifty-three otherwise he general appearance be much the same and he face as refine and gentlemanlike as ever presently he lay down the sheet of paper which he have be study attentively and say : you solution be perfectly sound angelum but you have arrive at it in a characteristic fashion and by you own road not but what you method have some merit -- for one thing it be more concise than my own but on the other hand it show a feminine weakness it be not possible to follow every step from you premise to you conclusion correct as it be ah say a low voice with a happy ripple in it the owner of which be busy with some tea-thing out of range of the ring of light throw by the double reading-lamp you often blame I for jump to conclusion but what do it matter provide they be right the whole secret be that i use the equivalent algebraic formulum but suppress the work in order to puzzle you and the voice laugh sweetly that be not worthy of a mathematician say mr fraser with some irritation it be nothing but a trick a _ tour de force _ the solution be correct you say quite then i maintain that it be perfectly mathematical the object of mathematics be to arrive at the truth _ vox et preterea nihil _ come out of that corner my dear i hate argue with a person i can not see but there there what be the use of argue at all the fact be angelum you be a first-class mathematician and i be only second-class i be oblige to stick to the old track you cut a roman road of you own great master be entitle to do that the algebraic formulum never occur to I when i work the problem out and it take I two day to do you be try to make I vain you forget that whatever i know which be just enough to show I how much i have to learn i have learn from you as for be you superior in mathematics i do not think that as a clergyman you should make such a statement here be you tea and the owner of the voice come forward into the ring of light she be tall beyond the ordinary height of woman and possess unusual beauty of form that the tight-fitting gray dress she wear be well calculate to display she complexion which be of a dazzling fairness be set off by the darkness of the lash that curl over the deep gray eye the face itself be round and very lovely and surmount by a ample forehead whilst she hair which be twist into a massive knot be of a tinge of chestnut gold and mark with deep-set ripple the charm of she face however do not as be so often the case begin and end with its physical attraction there be more much more in it than that but how be it possible to describe on paper a presence at once so full of grace and dignity of the soft loveliness of woman and of a higher and more spiritual beauty there hang in the louvre a picture by raphael which represent a saint pass with light step over the prostrate form of a dragon there be in that heaven-inspired face the equal of which have be rarely if ever put on canvas a blending of earthly beauty and of the calm awe-compelling spirit-gaze -- that gaze that holy dignity which can only come to such as be in truth and in deed pure in heart -- that will give to those who know it a better idea of what angelum be like than any write description at time but ah how rarely we may have see some such look as that she wear on the face of those around we it may be bring by a great sorrow or be the companion of a overwhelming joy it may announce the consummation of some sublime self-sacrifice or convey the swift assurance of a everlasting love it be to be find alike on the feature of the happy mother as she kiss she new-born babe and on the pallid countenance of the saint sink to he rest the sharp moment that bring we nearer god and go nigh to pierce the veil that hide he presence be the occasion that call it into be it be a beauty bear of the murmur sound of the harp of heaven it be the light of the eternal lamp gleam faintly through its earthly casket this spirit-look before which all wickedness must feel ashamed have find a home in angelum 's gray eye there be a strange nobility about she whether it dwelt in the stately form or on the broad brow or in the large glance of the deep eye it be not possible to say but it be certainly a part of herself as self-evident as she face or feature she might well have be the inspiration of the line that run : truth in she might beloved grand in she sway truth with she eye beloved clearer than day holy and pure beloved spotless and free be there one thing beloved fairer than thee mr fraser absently set down the tea that angelum be give he when we take the liberty to describe she personal appearance now angela read a little what shall i read oh anything you like please yourself thus enjoin she go to a bookshelf and take down two volume hand one to mr fraser and then open she copy at haphazard announce the page to she companion and sit down begin to read what sound be this now soft and melodious as the sweep of a summer gale over a southern sea and now again like to the distant stamp and rush and break of the wave of battle what can it be but the roll of those magnificent hexameter with which homer charm a listen world and rarely have english lip give they with a juster cadence stop my dear shut up you book you be as good a greek scholar as i can make you shut up you book for the last time you education my dear angelum be satisfactorily complete i have succeed with you -- complete mr fraser say angelum open-eyed do you mean to say that i be to stop now just as i have begin to learn my dear you have learn everything that i can teach you and besides i be go away the day after to-morrow go away and then and there without the slightest warning angelum -- who for all she beauty and learn very much resemble the rest of she sex -- burst into tear come come angelum say mr fraser in a voice mean to be gruff but only succeed in be husky for oddly enough it be try even to a clergyman on the wrong side of middle-age to be weep over by a lovely woman do not be nonsensical i be only go for a few month at this intelligence she pull up a little oh she say between she sob how you frighten I how could you be so cruel where be you go to i be go for a long trip in southern europe do you know that i have scarcely be away from this place for twenty year so i mean to celebrate the conclusion of we study by take a holiday i wish you would take I with you mr fraser color slightly and he eye brighten he sigh as he answer -- i be afraid my dear that it would be impossible something warn angelum not to pursue the subject now angela i believe that it be usual on the occasion of the severance of a scholastic connection to deliver something in the nature of a farewell oration well i be not go to do that but i want you to listen to a few word she do not answer but draw a stool to a corner of the fireplace she wipe she eye and sit down almost at he foot clasp she knee with she hand and gaze rather sadly into the fire you have dear angela he begin be educate in a somewhat unusual way with the result that after ten year of steady work that have be always interesting though sometimes arduous you have acquire information deny to the vast majority of you sex whilst at the same time you could be put to the blush in many thing by a school-girl of fifteen for instance though i firmly believe that you could at the present moment take a double first at the university you knowledge of english literature be almost nil and you history of the weakest all a woman 's ordinary accomplishment such as draw play singing have of necessity be to a great extent neglect since i be not able to teach they to you myself and you have have to be guide solely by book and by the light of nature in give to they such time as you could spare you mind on the other hand have be daily saturate with the noblest thought of the intellectual giant of two thousand year ago and would in that respect be as much in place in a well-educated grecian maiden living before the time of christ as in a english girl of the nineteenth century i have educate you thus angelum partly by accident and partly by design you will remember when you begin to come here some ten year since -- you be a little thing then -- and i have offer to give you some teaching because you interested I and i see that you be run wild in mind and body but when i have undertake the task i be somewhat puzzle how to carry it out it be one thing to offer to educate a little girl and another to do it not know where to begin i fall back upon the latin grammar where i have begin myself and so by degree you slide into the curriculum of a classical and mathematical education then after a year or two i perceive you power of work and you great natural ability and i form a design i say to myself ' i will see how far a woman cultivate under favourable condition can go i will patiently teach this girl till the literature of greece and rome become as familiar to she as she mother-tongue till figure and symbol hide no mystery from she till she can read the heaven like a book i will teach she mind to follow the secret way of knowledge i will train it till it can soar above its fellow like a falcon above sparrow ' angelum my proud design pursue steadily through many year have be at length accomplished you bright intellect have rise to the strain i have put upon it and you be at this moment one of the best all-round scholar of my acquaintance she flush to the eye at this high praise and be about to speak but he stop she with a motion of the hand and go on : i have recognize in teaching you a fact but too little known that a classical education properly understand be the foundation of all learn there be little that be worth say which have not already be beautifully say by the ancient little that be worthy of meditation on which they have not already profoundly reflect save indeed the one great subject of christian meditation this foundation my dear angela you possess to a eminent degree henceforth you will need no assistance from I or any other man for to you trained mind all ordinary knowledge will be easy to assimilate you will receive in the course of a few day a parting present from myself in the shape of a box of carefully choose book on european literature and history devote yourself to the study of these and of the german language which be you mother 's native tongue for the next year and then i shall consider that you be fairly finish and then too my dear angela i shall expect to reap a full reward for my labor what be it that you will expect of I i shall expect angelum and he rise from he chair and walk up and down the room in he excitement -- i shall expect to see you take you proper place in you generation i shall say : ` choose you own line become a critical scholar a practical mathematician or -- and perhaps that be what you be most suit for with you imaginative power -- a writer of fiction for remember that fiction properly understand and direct to worthy aim be the noblest and most far-reaching as it be also the most difficult of the art ' in watch the success that will assuredly attend you in this or any other line i shall be amply reward for my trouble angelum shake she head with a gesture of doubt but he do not wait for she to answer well my dear i must not keep you any longer -- it be quite dark and blow a gale of wind -- except to say one more word remember that all this be -- indirectly perhaps but still none the less truly -- a means to a end there be two education the education of the mind and the education of the soul unless you minister to the latter all the time and toil spend upon the former will prove to little purpose the learning will it be true remain but it will be as the quartz out of which the gold have be already crush or the dry husk of corn it will be valueless and turn to no good use will serve only to feed the swine of intellectual voluptuousness and infidelity it be believe I the higher learning of the soul that gild we earthly lore the loftier object of all education be so to train the intellect that it may become competent to understand something however little of the nature of we god and to the true christian the real end of learning be the appreciation of he attribute as exemplify in he mystery and earthly wonder but perhaps that be a subject on which you be as well fitted to discourse as i be so i will not enter into it ` finis ' my dear ` finis ' angelum 's answer to this long oration be a simple one she rise slowly from she low seat and put she hand upon mr fraser 's shoulder kiss he on the forehead and say -- how shall i ever learn to be grateful enough for all i owe you what should i have be now but for you how good and patient you have be to I this embrace affect the clergyman strangely he put he hand to he heart and a troubled look come into he eye thrust she gently away from he he sit down angelum he say presently go away now dear i be tired to-night i shall see you at church to-morrow to say good-by and so she go homewards through the wind and storm little know that she leave she master to struggle with a tempest far more tremendous than that which rage around she as for he as the door close he give a sigh of relief pray god i have not put it off too long he say to himself and now for to-morrow 's sermon sleep for the young laughter for the happy work for old fool -- work work work and thus it be that angelum become a scholar chapter xvii the winter month pass away slowly for angelum but not by any means unhappily though she be quite alone and miss mr fraser sadly she find considerable consolation in he present of book and in the thought that she be get a good hold of she new subject of study and then come the wonder of the spring with its rush of bud life and who least of all angelum could be sad in springtime but nevertheless that spring mark a important change in we heroine for it be during its sweet hour when have put she book aside she would roam alone or in company with she raven through the flower-starred wood around the lake that a feeling of restlessness amounting at time almost to dissatisfaction take possession of she indeed as the week creep on and she draw near the completion of she twentieth year she realize with a sigh that she could no longer call herself a girl and begin to feel that she life be incomplete that something be want in it and this be what be want in angelum 's life : she have if we except she nurse no one to love and she have so much love to give do she but guess it the still recess of she heart already tremble to the footfall of one now draw near : out of the multitude of the life around she a life be mark to mingle with she own she do not know it but as the first reflection of the dawn strike the unconscious sky and shadow the come of its king so the red flush that now so often spring unbidden to she brow tell of girlhood 's twilight end and proclaim the advent of woman 's life and love angelum call she father one day as he hear she footstep pass he study come in here i want to speak to you he daughter stop and a look of blank astonishment spread itself over she face she have not be call into that study for year she enter however as bidden she father who be seat at he writing-table which be pile up with account-book do not greatly differ in appearance from what he be when we last see he twenty year ago he frame have grow more massive and acquire a slight stoop but he be still a young powerful-looking man and certainly do not appear a day more than he age of forty-two the eye however so long as no one be look at they have contract a concentrated stare as though they be eternally gaze at some object in space and this appearance be render the more marked by a apparently permanent puckering of the skin of the forehead the moment however that they come under the fire of anybody else 's optics and oddly enough more particularly those of he own daughter the stare vanish and they grow shifty and uncertain to a curious degree philip be employ in add up something when he daughter enter and motion to she to sit down she do so and fix she great gray eye on he with some curiosity the effect be remarkable she father fidget make a mistake in he calculation glance all round the room with he shifty eye -lrb- ah how change from those bold black eye with which marium lee fall in love four-and-twenty year ago -rrb- and finally throw down he pen with a exclamation that would have shock angelum have she understand it how often angelum have i ask you not to stare I out of countenance it be a most unladylike trick of yours she blush painfully i beg you pardon i forget i will look out of the window do not be a fool look like other people but now i want to speak to you in the first place i find that the household expenditure for the last year be three hundred and fifty pound that be more than i can afford it must not exceed three hundred this year i will do my best to keep the expense down father but i can assure you that there be no money waste now then come a pause which after hum and haw a little philip be the first to break do you know that i see you cousin george yesterday he be back at last at isleworth yes pigott tell I that he have come he have be away a long while when do you last see he when i be about thirteen i believe before he lose the election and go away he have be down here several time since then i wonder that you do not see he i always dislike he and keep out of he way gad you can not dislike he more than i do but i keep good friend with he for all that and you must do the same now look here angela will you promise to keep a secret yes father if you wish it well then i appear to be a poor man do not i and remember he add hastily that with reference to household expense i be poor but as a matter of fact -- and here he sink he voice and glance suspiciously round -- i be worth at this moment nearly one hundred and fifty thousand pound in hard cash that be six thousand pound a year at four per cent comment angelum without a moment 's hesitation then i really think you might put a flue into the old greenhouse and allow a shill a week to mr jakes ' mother curse mr jakes ' mother nobody but a woman would have interrupt with such nonsense listen you must have hear how i be disinherit on account of my marriage with you mother and the isleworth estate leave to you cousin george and how with a refined ingenuity he be forbid to bequeath they back to I or to my child but mark this he be not forbid to sell they to I no doubt the old man never dream that i should have the money to buy they but you see i have almost enough how do you get so much money get it first i take the gold plate my grandfather buy and sell it i have no right to do it but i could not afford to have so much capital lie idle it fetch nearly five thousand pound with this i speculate successfully in two year i have eighteen thousand the eighteen thousand i invest in a fourth share in a coal-mine when money be scarce and coal cheap coal rise enormously just then and in five year ' time i sell my share to the co-holder for eighty-two thousand in addition to twenty-one thousand receive by way of interest since then i have not speculate for fear my luck should desert I i have simply allow the money to accumulate on mortgage and other investment and bide my time for i have swear to have those estate back before i die it be for this cause that i have toil and think and screw and be cut by the whole neighborhood for twenty year but now i think that with you help my time be come with _ my _ help what be it that you wish I to do listen answer she father nervously tap he pencil on the account-book before he george be not very fond of isleworth -- in fact he rather dislike it but like all the caresfoot he do not care about parting with land property and though we appear to be good friend he hate I too much ever to consent under ordinary circumstance to sell it to I it be to you i look to overcome that objection i how you be a woman and you ask I how you should get the blind side of a man i do not in the least understand you philip smile incredulously then i suppose i must explain if ever you take the trouble to look at yourself in the glass you will probably see that nature have be very kind to you in the matter of good look nor be you by any means deficient in brain you cousin george be very fond of a pretty woman and to be plain what i want you to do be to make use of you advantage to get he under you thumb and persuade he into sell the property oh father how can you ejaculate angelum in a agony of shame you idiot i will not want you to marry he i only want you to make a fool of he surely be of the sex you be you will not find _ that _ a uncongenial occupation angelum 's blush have give away to pallor now and she answer with cold contempt : i do not think you quite understand what a girl feel -- at least what i feel for i know no other girl perhaps it would be useless for I to try to explain i have rather go blind than use my eye for such a shameful purpose angelum say she father with as much temper as he ever show now let I tell you that you be a silly fool you be more you be a encumbrance you birth he add bitterly rob I of you mother and the fact of you be a girl deprive we branch of the family of they rights now that you have grow up you prefer to gratify you whim rather than help I to realize the object of my life by a simple course of action that could do no one any harm i never ask you to commit yourself in any way well well it be what i must expect we have not see much of each other heretofore and perhaps the less we meet in the future the better you have no right to talk to I so she answer with flash eye though i be you daughter and it be cowardly to reproach I with my birth my sex and my dependence be i responsible for any of these thing but i will not burden you long and as to what you want I to do and think such a little of i ask you be it what my poor mother would have wish she daughter -- here philip abruptly rise and leave the room and the house she be as like she mother as possible he muse as soon as he be clear of the house it might have be hilda herself only she be twice as beautiful as hilda be i shall have another bad night after this i know i shall i must get rid of that girl somehow i can not bear she about I she be a daily reminder of thing i dare not remember and whenever she stare at I with those great eye of hers i feel as though she be look through I i wonder if she know the story of marium lee and then dismiss or try to dismiss the matter from he mind he take he way across the field to isleworth hall a large white brick mansion in the queen anne style about two mile distant from the abbey and on arrival ask for he cousin george and be at once show into that gentleman 's presence year have tell upon george more than they have upon philip and though there be no touch of gray in the flaming red of he hair the bloodshot eye and the puckered crowsfeet beneath they to say nothing of the slight but constant tremble of the hand all show that he be a man well on in middle-life and who have live every day of it time too have make the face more intensely unpleasant and vulgar-looking than ever such caresfoot characteristic as it possess be year by year give place in a increasingly greater degree to the kitchen-maid strain introduce by the mother in short george caresfoot do not even look a gentleman whereas philip certainly do you do not seem very well george i be afraid that you travels have not agree with you my dear philip answer he cousin in a languid and affected voice if you have live the life that i have for the last twenty year you would look a little knock up i have have some very good time but the fact be that i have be too prodigal of my strength not think enough about the future it be a great mistake and one of the worst result be that i be utterly _ blase _ of everything even _ la belle passion _ be play out for I i have not see a woman i care twopence about for ten year ah you should sell this place and take a house in town it would suit you much better i can do that without sell the place i do not intend to sell the place -- in fact nothing would induce I to do so some day i may marry and want to transmit it to some future caresfoot but i confess i do not mean to do that just yet marry when you want a nurse but never before that be my maxim marriage be a excellent institution for parson and fool the two class that providence have create to populate the world but a wise man should as soon think of walk into a spring-trap take you own case for instance my dear philip look what marriage lead to at any rate answer he cousin bitterly it lead to you advantage exactly and that be one of the reason why i have such a respect for the institution in the abstract it have be my personal benefactor and i worship it accordingly -- at a distance by the way talking of marriage remind I of its legitimate fruit bellamy tell I that you daughter angelum -lrb- if i have a daughter i should call she diabolum it be more appropriate for a woman -rrb- have grow uncommonly handsome bring she to see I i adore beauty in all its form especially its female form be she really so handsome i be no judge but you will soon have a opportunity of form a opinion -- that be i hope so i propose come with angelum to make a formal call on you to-morrow good tell my fair cousin that i shall be certain to be in and be prepare metaphorically to fall at the foot of so much loveliness by the way that remind I you have hear of bellamy 's or rather mr bellamy 's good fortune i suppose no what -- not why he be now sir john bellamy knight indeed how be that you remember the bye-election six month back oh yes i be actually badger by mr bellamy into promise to vote much against my personal convenience exactly well just at the time old prescott die you may remember that mr shower the member of the government be unseated on petition from some borough or other and come down here post-haste to get re-elected but he have sir percy vivyan against he and as i know to my cost this benighted country be not fond of those who preach the gospel of progress bellamy who be a stout radical as you know -- chiefly i fancy because there be more to be get out of that side of politics -- get the job as shower ' agent but three day before it become quite clear that he cause cabinet minister or not be hopeless then it be that mr -- i beg she pardon lady -- bellamy come to the fore just as shower be think of withdraw she demand a private interview with he next day she post off to old sir percy who be a perfect fool of the chivalrous school and be desperately fond of she and _ mirabile dictu _ that evening sir percy withdraw on the plea of ill-health or some such rubbish and shower walk over within three month mr bellamy become sir john bellamy nominally for he service as town-clerk of roxham and i hear that old sir percy be now perfectly rampant and go about cursing she ladyship up hill and down dale and declare that he have be shockingly taken-in how we mutual friend work the rope be more than i can tell you but she do work they and to some purpose she be a uncommonly handsome woman ah yes you be right there she be a1 but let we stroll out a little it be a fine evening for the 30th of April to-morrow will be the 1st of may so it will a day neither of we be likely to forget philip wince at the allusion but say nothing by the way george go on i be expect a visitor my ward young arthur heigham who be just back from indium he will be twenty - five in a few day when he come of age and be come down to settle up the fact be that ten thousand of he money be on the jotley property and both bellamy and myself be anxious that it should stop there for the present as if the mortgage be call in it might be awkward be he well off comfortably about a thousand a year come of a old family too bellamy and i know he father captain heigham slightly when we be in business he wife by the way be a distant cousin of ours they be both dead now the captain be wipe out at inkerman and for some unknown reason leave I the young gentleman 's sole guardian and joint trustee with a london lawyer a certain mr borley i have never see he yet -- my ward i mean -- he have always be at eton or cambridge or in indium or somewhere here philip begin to manifest sign of considerable uneasiness the cause of which be sufficiently apparent for whilst they be talk a very large and savage-looking animal of the sheep-dog order have emerge from the house and be follow he up and down growl in a low and ominous undertone its nose be the while glue to he calf as they alternately present themselves in he line of vision would you mind call off this animal george he say at length he do not look amiable oh that be snarleyow do not mind he he never bite unless you stop philip instinctively quicken he pace be not he a beauty he be a pure breed thibet sheep-dog and i will back he to fight against any animal of he own weight he kill two dog in one morning the other day and pull down a beggar-woman in the evening you should have hear she holler at that moment fortunately for philip 's calf which be begin to tingle with a unwholesome excitement mr snarleyow 's attention be divert by the approach of a dog-cart and he leave to enjoy the amusement of snap and bark at the horse the cart pull up at the door and out of it emerge a tall and extremely gentlemanly - look young fellow follow by a very large red bull-dog mr caresfoot i believe say the young gentleman to george take off he hat yes mr heigham at you service i be very glad to see you my cousin mr philip caresfoot chapter xviii i must apologize for have bring aleck my dog you know with I begin arthur heigham but the fact be that at the very last moment the man i be go to leave he with have to go away and i have no time to find another place before the train leave i think that if you object to dog he could easily be send somewhere into the village he be very good-tempered though appearance be against he oh he will be all right i daresay say george rather sulkily for with the exception of snarleyow in whose fiendish temper he find something refreshing and congenial he like no dog but you must be careful or snarleyow _ my _ dog will give he a hammer here good dog good dog and he attempt to pat aleck on the head but the animal growl savagely and avoid he i never know he do that before ejaculate arthur in confusion and heartily wish aleck somewhere else i suppose he have take a dislike to you dog do sometimes you know next second it strike he that this be one of those thing that have better have be leave unsaid and he grow more uncomfortable than ever but at this very moment the situation be render intensely lively by the approach of the redoubtable snarleyow himself who have snap at the horse 's heel all the way to the stable have on he return to the front of the house spot aleck from afar he be now advance on tiptoe in full order of battle he wicked-looking tooth gleam and he coat and tail standing out like a angry bear 's arthur already sufficiently put out about the dog question think it best to take no notice and even when he distinctly hear george quietly sah on he dog as he pass he he contented himself with give aleck a kick by way of a warn to behave himself and enter into some desultory conversation with philip but presently a series of growl behind he announce that a encounter be imminent look round he perceive that snarleyow be stand over the bull-dog of which he be more than twice the size and hold on to the skin of he neck with he long tooth whilst george be look on with scarcely suppress amusement i think mr caresfoot that you have better call you dog off say arthur good-temperedly mine be a peaceable animal but he be a awkward customer when he do fight oh better let they settle it they will be much better friend afterwards hold he snarleyow thus encourage the big dog seize the other and fairly lift he off the ground shake he violently -- a proceeding that have the effect of thoroughly rouse aleck 's temper and then begin a most homeric combat at first the bull-dog be dreadfully maul he antagonist 's size weight and length of leg and jaw to say nothing of the thick coat by which he be protect all tell against he but he take he punishment very quietly never so much as utter a growl in strange contrast to the big dog 's vociferous style of do business and at last patience be reward by he enemy 's fore-paw find its way into aleck 's powerful jaw and remain there till snarleyow 's attention to the back of he neck force he to shift he hold from that time forward the sheep-dog have to fight on three leg which he find demoralizing but still he have the advantage and it be not until any other dog of aleck 's size would have retreat half kill that the bull-dog 's superior courage and stamen begin to tell quite heedless of he injury and the blood that pour into he eye he slowly but surely drive the great sheep-dog who by this time would have be glad to stop back into a angle of the wall and then suddenly pin he by the throat down go snarleyow on the top of the bull-dog and roll right over he but when he stagger to he leg again he throat be still in its cruel grip take you dog off shout george see that affair have take a turn he very little expected i fear that be impossible reply arthur politely but look anything but polite if you do not get it off i will shoot it you will do nothing of the sort mr caresfoot you set the dog on and you must take the consequence ah the affair be finish as he speak the choke snarleyow whose black tongue be protrude from he jaw give one last convulsive struggle and cease to breathe satisfied with this result aleck let go and have sniff contemptuously at he dead antagonist return to he master 's side and sit quietly down begin to lick such of he numerous wound as he could reach george when he realize that he favorite be dead turn upon he guest in a perfect fury he face look like a devil 's but arthur act with wonderful self-possession for so young a man stop he remember mr caresfoot before you say anything that you may regret that neither i nor my dog be to blame for what have happen i be exceedingly sorry that you dog should have be kill but it be you own fault i be afraid however that after what have happen i shall be as unwelcome here as aleck so if you will kindly order the cart for I again i will move on we business can no doubt be finish off by letter george make no reply : it be evident that he could not trust himself to speak but turn sullenly on he heel walk towards the house wait a bit mr heigham say philip who have be watch the whole scene with secret delight you be perfectly in the right i will go and try to bring my cousin to he sens i be very thankful to you dog for kill that accursed brute he be away for about ten minute during which arthur take aleck to a fountain there be in the center of a grass plot in front of the house and wash he many wound none of which however be thanks to the looseness of he hide very serious just as he have finish that operation a gardener arrive with a wheelbarrow to fetch away the deceased snarleyow lord sir he say to arthur i be glad to have the job of tuck up this here brute he bite my missus last week and kill a whole clutch of early duck i seed the row through the bush that ` ere dog of yours sir he do fight in proper style i should like to have a dog like he just then the re-arrival of philip put a stop to the conversation draw arthur aside he tell he that george begged to apologize for what have occur and hope that he would not think of go away but add philip with a little laugh i do not pretend that he have take a fancy to you and if i be you i should cut my visit short that be exactly my view of the case i will leave to-morrow evening philip make no further remark for a few moment he be evidently think presently he say i see you have a fishing-rod amongst you thing if you find the time hang heavy on you hand to-morrow or wish to keep out of the way you have better come over to bratham lake and fish there be some very large carp and perch there and pike too for the matter of that but they be out of season arthur thank he and say that he should probably come and have receive instruction as to the road they part arthur to go and shut up aleck in a outhouse point out to he by he friend the gardener and thence to dress for a dinner that he look forward to with dread and philip to make he way home as he pass up through the little flower-garden at the abbey house he come across he daughter pick the blight from she shooting rose-tree angela he say i be sorry if i offended you prejudice this afternoon do not let we say anything more about it but i want you to come and pay a formal call with I at isleworth to-morrow it will only be civil that you should do so i never pay a call in my life she answer doubtfully and i do not want to call on my cousin george oh very well and he begin to move on she stop he i will go if you like at three o'clock then oh by the way do not be surprise if you see a young gentleman fishing here to-morrow angelum reflect to herself that she have never yet see a young gentleman to speak to in she life and then ask with undisguised interest who he be well he be a sort of connection of you own through the preston who be cousin of ours if any of they be leave he mother be a preston and he name be arthur preston heigham george tell I something about he just now and on think it over i remember the whole story he be a orphan and george 's ward what be he like ask angelum ingenuously really i do not know rather tall i think -- a gentlemanly fellow it really be a relief to speak to a gentleman again there have be a nice disturbance at isleworth and then he tell he daughter the history of the great dog fight i should think mr heigham be perfectly in the right and i should like to see he dog be she comment on the occurrence as arthur dress himself for dinner that evening he come to the conclusion that he dislike he host more than any man he ever see and to say the truth he descend into the dining-room with considerable misgiving just as he enter the opposite door open and sir john bellamy be announce on see he george emerge from the sulky silence into which he be plunge and advance to meet he hullo bellamy i must congratulate you upon you accession to rank thank you caresfoot thank you reply mr bellamy who with the exception that he have grow a size larger and boast a bald patch on the top of he head that give he something of a appearance of a jolly little monk look very much the same as when we last see he as a newly marry man a kind providence he go on rub he dry hand and glance nervously under the chair have put this honor into my hand a providence in petticoat you mean break in george possibly my dear caresfoot but i do not see he be it possible that he be lurk yonder behind the sofa who on earth do you mean i mean that exceedingly fine dog of yours snarleyow snarleyow where be you excuse I for take precaution but last time he put he head under my chair and bit I severely as i dare say you remember arthur groan at hear the subject thus bring forward mr heigham 's dog kill snarleyow this afternoon say george in a savage voice at this intelligence sir john 's face become wreathe in smile i be deeply delighted -- i mean grieve -- to hear it poor snarleyow he be a charming dog and to think that such a fate should have overtake he when it be only last week that he do the same kind office for anne 's spaniel poor snarleyow you should really have he stuff but my dear caresfoot you have not yet introduce I to the hero of the evening mr heigham mr heigham i be delighted to make you acquaintance and he shake hand with arthur with gentle enthusiasm as though he be the last scion of a race that he have know and love for generation presently dinner be announce and the three sit down at a small round table in the center of the big dining-room on which be place a shaded lamp it be not a cheerful dinner george have say grace relapse into moody silence eating and drinking with gusto but in moderation and savor every sup of wine and morsel of food as though he regret its departure he be not free from gluttony but he be a judicious glutton for he part arthur find a certain fascination in watch he guardian 's red head as he bob up and down opposite to he and speculate on the thickness of each individual hair that contribute to give it such a spiky effect what have he mother be like he wonder that she have start he in life with such a entirely detestable countenance meanwhile he be reply in monosyllable to sir john 's gentle babbling till at last even that gentleman 's flow of conversation run dry and arthur be leave free to contemplate the head in solemn silence as soon as the cloth have be clear away george suggest that they have better get to work arthur assent and sir john smile with much sweetness remark profoundly that business be one of the ill of life and must be attend to at any rate it be a ill that have agree uncommonly well with you growl george as rise from the table he go to a solid iron safe that stand in the corner of the room and unlock it with a small key that he take from he pocket extract a bundle of document that be a excellent deed-box of yours caresfoot say sir john carelessly yes that lock would not be very easy to pick it be make on my own design but do not you find that small parcel such as private letter be apt to get lose in it it be so big oh no there be a separate compartment for they now mr heigham and then with the able and benign assistance of sir john he proceed to utterly confuse and mystify arthur till stock preference-shares consol and mortgage be all whirling in he bewildered brain have satisfactorily reduce he to this condition he suddenly spring upon he the proposal he have in view with reference to the jotley mortgage point out to he that it be a excellent investment and strongly advise he as a friend to leave the money upon the land arthur hesitate a little more from natural caution than anything he could urge to the contrary and george notice it say it be only right that before you come to any decision you should see the map of the estate and a copy of the deed i have both in the next room if you care to come and look at they arthur assent and they go off together sir john whose eye appear to be a little heavy under the influence of the port presume that he be not wanted but no sooner have the door close than the worthy knight prove himself very wide-awake indeed he commence a singular course of action advance on tiptoe to the safe in the corner of the room he closely inspect it through he eyeglass then he cautiously try the lid of a artfully contrived subdivision um he mutter half aloud that be where they be i wish i have ten minute next he return swiftly to the table and take a piece of the soft bread which he be eat instead of biscuit with he wine he rapidly knead it into dough and go to the safe divide the material into two portion one portion he carefully press upon the keyhole of the subdivision and then extract the key of the safe itself take a very fair impress of its ward on the other this do he carefully put the piece of dough in he breast-pocket in such a way that they be not likely to be crushed and with a smile of satisfaction return to he chair help himself to a glass of port and doze off hullo bellamy go to sleep wake up man we have settle this business about the mortgage will you write to mr borley and convey mr heigham 's decision and perhaps -- address arthur -- you will do the same on you own account certainly i will write caresfoot and now i think that i must be off she ladyship do not like have to sit up for I george laugh in a peculiarly insulting way i do not think she would care much bellamy if you stay away all night but look here tell she i want to see she to-morrow do not forget sir john bit he knightly lip but answer smile that he would remember and beg george not to ring as he trap be at the hall - door and the servant wait he bid a affectionate good-night to arthur to whom he express a hope that they would soon meet again and let himself out of the room but as soon as the door be close he go through another performance exceedingly inappropriate in a knight turn round he smug face red with anger he pirouett on he toe and shake he fist violently in the direction of the door you scoundrel he say between he tooth you have make a fool of I for twenty year and i have be oblige to grin and bear it but i will be even with you yet and she too more especially she so soon as sir john have leave arthur tell he host that if the morning be fine he propose to go and fish in bratham lake and that he also propose to take he departure by the last train on the follow evening to these proposition george offer no objection -- indeed they be distinctly agreeable to he as lessen the time he would be force to spend in the society of a guest he cordially detest for such be the feeling that he have conceive towards arthur then they part for the night but before he leave the room george go to lock up the safe that be still open in the corner strike by some thought he unlock the separate compartment with a key that hang on he watch-chain and extract therefrom a thick and neatly fold packet of letter draw out one or two he glance through they and replace they oh lady anne lady anne he say to himself as he close the case you be up in the world now and you aspire to rule the county society and have both the wealth and the wit to do it but you must not kick over the trace or i shall be force to suppress you lady anne though you be the wife of a brummagem knight and i think that it be time you have a little reminder you be grow a touch too independent chapter xix arthur 's sleep be oppress that night by horrible nightmare of fight dog whereof the largest and most ferocious be fit with george 's red head the effect of which screw without any eye to the fitness of thing to the body of the deceased snarleyow strike he as peculiarly disagreeable he himself be arm with a gun and whilst he be still argue with sir john bellamy the nice point whether should he execute that particular animal as he feel a carnal longing to do it would be manslaughter or dogslaughter he find himself wide awake it be very early in the morning of the 1st of may and contrary to the usual experience of the inhabitant of these island the sky give promise of a particularly fine day just the day for fishing he do not feel sleepy and have he do so he have have enough of he doggy dream so he get up dress and take he fishing-rod let himself out of the house as he have be instruct to do on the previous evening and release aleck from he outhouse proceed towards bratham lake and about this time angelum wake up too for she always rise early and run to the window to see what sort of a day she have get for she birthday see it to be so fine she throw open the old lattice at which she pet raven jack be already tap to be admit and let the sweet air play upon she face and neck and think what a wonderful thing it be to be twenty year old and then kneel by the window she say she prayer after she own fashion thank god who have spare she to see this day and pray he to show she what to do with she life and if it be he will to make it a little less lonely then she rise and dress herself feel that now that she have do with she teens she be in every respect a woman grow -- indeed quite old and in honor of the event she choose out of she scanty store of dress all of they make by pigott and herself she very prettiest the one she have have for Sunday wear last summer a tight-fitting robe of white stuff with soft little frill round the neck and wrist next she put on a pair of stout boot calculate to keep out the morning dew and start off now all this have take a good time nearly a hour perhaps for be she birthday and there have be some mention of a young gentleman who might possibly come to fish she have plait up she shine hair with extra care a very laborious business when you hair hang down to you knee meanwhile we other early riser arthur have make he way first to the foot of the lake and then along the little path that skirt its area till he come to caresfoot staff have sufficiently admire that majestic oak for he be a great lover of timber he proceed to investigate the surrounding water with the eye of a true fisherman a few yard further up there jut into the water that fragment of wall on which stand the post now quite rotten to which angelum have bind herself on the day of the great storm at he foot too the foundation of another wall run out for some distance into the lake be doubtless the underpinning of a ancient boathouse but this do not rise out of the water but stop within six inch of the surface between these two wall lay a very deep pool just the place for a heavy fish reflect arthur and even as he think it he see a five-pound carp rise nearly to the surface in order to clear the obstruction of the wall and sink silently into the depths retire carefully to one of two quaintly carven stone block place at the foot of the oak-tree on which doubtless many a monk have sit in meditation he set himself to get he fishing-gear together presently however strike by the beauty of the spot and its quiet only break by the song of many nesting bird he stop a while to look around he above he head the branch of a great oak now clothing themselves with the most vivid green form a dome-like roof beneath the shade of which grow the softest moss star here and there with primrose and violet outside the circle of its shadow the brushwood of mingled hazel and ash-stub rise thick and high ringing-in the little spot as with a wall except where its depths be pierce by the passage of a long green lane of lime that unlike the shrubbery appear to be keep in careful order and of which the arch bough form a perfect leafy tunnel before he lay the lake where the long morning light quiver and dance as its calm be now and again ruffle by a gentle breeze the whole scene have a lovely and peaceful look and gaze on it arthur fall into a reverie sit thus dreamily he face look at its best its expression of gentle thoughtfulness give it a attraction beyond what it be entitle to judge purely from a sculptor 's point of view it be a intellectual face a face that give sign of great mental possibility but for all that a little weak about the mouth the brow indicate some degree of power and the mouth and eye no small capacity for affection and all sort of human sympathy and kindness these last in vary light could change as often as the english climate they groundwork however be blue and they be honest and bonny in short a man in look at arthur heigham at the age of twenty-four would have reflect that even among english gentleman he be remarkable for he gentleman-like appearance and a fellow one would like to know a girl would have dub he nice-looking and a middle-aged woman -- and most woman do not really understand the immense difference between man until they be get on that way -- would have recognize in he a young man by no means uninteresting and one who might accord to the circumstance of he life develop into anything or -- nothing in particular presently draw by some unguessed attraction arthur take he eye off a industrious water-hen who be build a nest in a hurry way as though she be not quite sure of he intention and perceive a large raven standing on one leg on the grass about three yard from he and peer at he comically out of one eye this be odd but he glance do not stop at the raven for a yard or two beyond it he catch sight of a white skirt and he eye travel upward see first a round waist and then a bust and pair of shoulder such as few woman can boast and at last another pair of eye and he then and there fall utterly and irretrievably in love good heaven he say aloud -- poor fellow he do not mean to say it it be wring from the depths of he heart -- good heaven how lovely she be let the reader imagine the dreadful confusion produce in that other pair of eye at the open expression of such a sentiment and the vivid blush that stain the fair face in which they be set if he can but somehow they do not grow angry -- perhaps it be not in the nature of the most sternly repressive young lady to grow angry at a compliment which however mark be so evidently genuine and unpremeditated in another moment arthur bethought he of what he have say and it be he turn to blush he recover himself pretty well however rise from he stone seat he take off he hat and say humbly i beg you pardon but you startle I so and really for a moment i think that you be the spirit of the place or he add gracefully point to a branch of half-opened hawthorn bloom she hold in she hand the original queen of the may angela blush again the compliment be only imply this time she have therefore no possible pretext for get angry for a moment she drop the sweet eye that look as though they be fresh from read the truth of heaven before he gaze of unmistakable admiration and stand confused and as she stand it strike arthur that there be something more than mere beauty of form and feature about she -- a indescribable something a glory of innocence a reflection of god 's own light that tinge the worship she loveliness command with a touch of reverential awe the angel must look like that he think but he have no time to think any more for next moment she have gather up she courage in both she hand and be speak to he in a soft voice of which the tone go ring on through all the change of he life my father tell I that he have ask you to come and fish but i do not expect to meet you so early i -- i fear that i be disturbing you and she make as though she would be go arthur feel that this be a contingency to be prevent at all hazard you be miss caresfoot he say hurriedly be you not yes -- i be angelum i need not ask you name my father tell it I you be mr arthur heigham yes and do you know that we be cousin this be a slight exaggeration but he be glad to advance any plea to she confidence that occur to he yes my father say something about we be related i have no relation except my cousin george and i be very glad to make the acquaintance of one and she hold out she hand to he in a win way he take it almost reverently you can not he say with much sincerity be more glad than i be i too be without relation till lately i have my mother but she die last year be you very fond of she she ask softly he nod in reply and feeling instinctively that she be on delicate ground angelum pursue the conversation no further meanwhile aleck have awake from a comfortable sleep in which he be indulge on the other stone seat and come forward sniff at angelum and wag he tail in approval -- a liberty that be instantly resent by the big raven who have now be join by another not quite so large advance boldly it peck he sharply on the tail -- a proceeding that cause master aleck to jump round as quickly as he maimed condition would allow he only to receive a still harder peck from its companion bird indeed it be not until angelum intervene with the bough of hawthorn that they would cease from they attack they be such jealous creature she explain they always follow I about and fly at every dog that come near I poor dog that be the one i suppose who kill snarleyow my father tell I all about it yes it be easy to see that say arthur laughing and point to aleck who indeed be in lamentable case have one eye entirely close a large strip of plaster on he head and all the rest of he body more or less marked with bite it be a uncommonly awkward business for I and you cousin will not forgive it in a hurry i fancy but it really be not poor aleck 's fault -- he be gentle as a lamb if only he be let alone he have a very honest face though he nose do look as though it be break she say and stoop down she pat the dog but i must be go in to breakfast she go on presently it be eight o'clock the sun always strike that bough at eight in spring and she point to a dead limb half hide by the bud foliage of the oak you must observe closely to have notice that but i do not think that the sun be quite on it yet i do not like to lose my new-found relation in such a hurry he add with a somewhat force smile and i be to go away from here this evening the intelligence be evidently very little satisfactory to angelum nor do she attempt to conceal she concern i be very sorry to hear that she say i hope you be go to stay for some time and so i might have have it not be for that brute aleck but he have put a long sojourn with you cousin and the ghost of snarleyow out of the question so i suppose i must go by the 620 train at any rate he add more brightly as a thought strike he i must go from isleworth she do not appear to see the drift of the last part of he remark but answer i be go with my father to call at isleworth at three this afternoon so perhaps we shall meet again there but now before i go in i will show you a better place than this to fish a little higher up where jake we gardener always set he night-lines arthur assent as he would have be glad to assent to anything likely to prolong the interview and they walk off slowly together talk as cheerfully as a sense that the conversation must soon come to a end would allow the spot be reach all too soon and angelum with evident reluctance for she be not accustom to conceal she feeling say that she must now go why must you go so soon well to tell you the truth to-day be my birthday -- i be twenty to-day -- and i know that pigott my old nurse mean to give I a little present at breakfast and she will be dreadfully disappoint if i be late she have be think a great deal about it you see may i wish you many very many happy return of the day and -- with a little hesitation -- may i also offer you a present a very worthless one i fear how can i -- stammer angelum when he cut she short do not be afraid it be nothing tangible though it be something that you may not think worth accept what do you mean she say bluntly for she interest be arouse do not be angry my present be only the offer of myself as you sincere friend she blush vividly as she answer you be very kind i have never have but one friend -- mr fraser but if you think you can like I enough it will make I very happy to be you friend too and in another second she be go with she raven fly after she to receive she present and a jobation from pigott for be late and to eat she breakfast with such appetite as a entirely new set of sensation can give in the garden she meet she father walk up and down before the house and inform he that she have be talk to mr heigham he look up with a curious expression of interest why do you not ask he in to breakfast he say because there be nothing to eat except bread and milk ah -- well perhaps you be right i will go down and speak to he no i forget i shall see he this afternoon and arthur let those who disbelieve in love at first sight laugh if they will sit down to think tremble in every limb utterly shake by the inrush of a new and strong emotion he have not come to the age of twenty-four without some experience of the other sex but never before have he know any such sensation as that which now overpower he never before have he fully realize what solitude mean as he do now that she have leave he in youth when love do come he come as a strong man arm and so steady and overwhelming all resistance the full tide of a pure passion pour itself into he heart there be no pretence or make-believe about it the bold that speed from angelum 's gray eye have go straight home and would remain a ever-fixed mark so long as life itself should last for only once in a lifetime do a man succumb after this fashion to many indeed no such fortune -- call it good or ill -- will ever come since the majority of man flirt or marry indulge in platonic friendship or in a consistent course of admiration of they neighbor ' wife as fate or fancy lead they and wear they time away without ever have know the meaning of such love as this there be no fixed rule about it the most unlikely even the more sordid and contemptible of mankind be liable to become the subject of a enduring passion only then it raise they for though strong affection especially if unrequited sometimes wear and enervate the mind its influence be in the main undoubtedly ennobling but though such affection be bound by no rule it be curious to observe how generally true be the old saying which declare that a man 's thought return to he first real love as naturally and unconsciously as the needle that have for a while be draw aside by some overmastering influence return to its magnetic pole the needle have waver but it have never shake off its allegiance that would be against nature and be therefore impossible and so it be with the heart it be the eve that he love as a lad which he see through the gathering darkness of he death-bed it be a chance but that he will always adore the star which first come to share he loneliness in this shadowed world above all the shine multitude in heaven and though it be not every watcher who will find it early or late that star may rise for he as it do for arthur now a man may meet a face which it be quite beyond he power to forget and be touch of lip that print they kiss upon he very heart yes the star may rise to pursue its course perhaps beyond the ken of he horizon or only to set again before he have learn to understand its beauty -- rarely very rarely to shed its perfect light upon he for all he time of watch the star may rise and set the sweet lip whose touch still thrill he after so many year may lie to-day beyond the graveyard 's barren wall or worse still have since be sell to some richer owner but if once it have rise if once those lip have meet the memory _ must _ remain the soul know no forgetfulness and the little thread of life spin out will it not claim its own for the compact that it have seal be holy among holy thing that love which it have give be of its own nature and not of the body alone -- it be inscrutable as death and everlasting as the heaven yes the fiat have go forth for good or for evil for comfort or for scorn for the world and for eternity he love she henceforth that love so lightly and yet so irredeemably give will become the guide spirit of he inner life rough-hew he destiny direct he end and shoot its memory and hope through the whole fabric of he be like a interwoven thread of gold he may sin against it but he can never forget it other interest and tie may overlay it but they can not extinguish it he may drown its fragrance in voluptuous scent but when these have satiate and become hateful it will re-arise pure and sweet as ever time or separation can not destroy it -- for it be immortal use can not stale it pain can only sanctify it it will be to he as a beacon-light to the sea-worn mariner that tell of home and peace upon the shore as a rainbow-promise set upon the sky it alone of all thing pertain to he will defy the attack of the consuming year and when old and wither he lay he down to die it will at last present itself before he glazing eye a embody joy clothe in shine robe and breathe the air of paradise for such be love to those to whom it have be give to see he face to face chapter xx arthur do not do much fishing that morning indeed he never so much as get he line into the water -- he simply sit there lose in dream and hope in a vague way that angelum would come back again but she do not come back though it would be difficult to say what prevent she for have he but know it she be for the space of a full hour sit within a hundred yard of he and occasionally peep out to watch he mode of fishing with some curiosity it be she reflect exceedingly unlike that practice by jakes she too be wish that he would detect she and come to talk to she but amongst other new sensation she be now the victim of a most unaccountable shyness and could not make up she mind to reveal she whereabouts at last arthur awake from he long reverie and remember with a sudden pang that he have have nothing to eat since the previous evening and that he be consequently exceedingly hungry he also discover on consult he watch that it be twelve o'clock and moreover that he be quite stiff from sit so long in the same position so sigh to think that such a vulgar necessity as that of obtain food should force he to depart he put up he unused fishing-rod and start for isleworth where he arrive just as the bell be ring for lunch george receive he with cold civility and ask he what sport he have to which he be force to reply -- none do you see anybody there yes i meet miss caresfoot ah trust a girl to trail out a man what be she like i remember she a raw-boned girl of fourteen with fine eye i think that she be the handsomest woman i ever see arthur reply coldly ah say george with a rude little laugh youth be always enthusiastic especially when the object be of the dairymaid cut there be something so intensely insolent in he host 's way of talk that arthur long to throw a dish at he but he restrain he feeling and drop the subject let I see you be only just home from indium be you ask george presently i get back at the beginning of last month and what be you do there travel about and shooting do you get much sport no i be rather unfortunate but i and another fellow kill two tiger and go after a rogue elephant but he nearly kill we i get some very good ibix-shooting in cashmere however what do you intend to do with yourself now you education have be extravagantly expensive especially the cambridge part of it be you go to turn it to any account yes i be go to travel for another year and then read for the bar there be no particular object in be call too young and i wish to see something more of the world first ah i see idleness call by a fine name really i can not agree with you say arthur who be rapidly lose he temper of course you can not but every man have a right to choose he own road to the dog come he add with a smile of malice as he notice arthur 's rise color no need to get angry you see i stand _ in loco parentis _ and feel bind to express my opinion i must congratulate you on the success with which you assume the character answer arthur now thoroughly put-out but as everything i have do or mean to do be so distasteful to you i think it be a pity that you do not give I the benefit of you advice a little sooner george 's only answer be a laugh and presently the two part detest each other more cordially than ever at half-past three when george be still away for he have go out with he bailiff immediately after lunch philip and he daughter be show into the drawing-room where we may be sure arthur be await they mr caresfoot be not back yet say arthur but i do not suppose that he will be long oh he will be here soon say philip because i tell he we be come to call what sort of sport do you have what none i be very sorry you must come and try again -- ah i forget you be go away by the way mr heigham why should you go just yet if you be fond of fishing and have nothing better to do come and put up at the abbey house for a while we be plain people but there be plenty of room and you shall have a hearty welcome would you care to come it would have be amusing to any outsider to watch angelum 's face as she hear this astounding proposition for nobody have be invite inside she father 's door within she recollection it assume first of all a look of blank amazement which be presently change into one of absolute horror would he come indeed reflect arthur would he step into paradise would he accept the humble offer of free quarter in the garden of eden rapture beam so visibly from every feature of he face that philip see it and smile just as he be about to accept with enthusiasm he catch sight of angelum 's look of distress it chill he like the sudden shock of cold water she do not wish he to come he think she do not care for he oblige however to give a answer he say i shall be delighted if -- and here he bow towards she -- miss caresfoot do not object if father break in angelum with hesitation you could arrange that mr heigham come to-morrow not to-day it would be more convenient i must get a room ready ah domestic detail i have overlook they i daresay you can manage that -- eh heigham oh yes easily thank you as he say the word the door be fling open and lady bellamy be announce with the energy that a footman always devote to the enunciation of a title and next second a splendid creature magnificently dress sail into the room ah how do you do mr caresfoot she say in that low rich voice that he remember so well it be some time since we meet indeed it quite bring back old time to see you when we be all young people together at any rate lady bellamy you show no sign of age indeed if you will permit I to say so you look more beautiful than ever ah mr caresfoot you have not forget how to be gallant but let I tell you that it entirely depend upon what light i be in if you see I in the midst of one of those newfangled electric illuminations you would see that i do look old but what can one expect at forty here she glance fall upon angelum 's face for the first time and she absolutely start the great pupil of she eye expand and a dark frown spread itself for a moment over she countenance next second it be go be it possible that that beautiful girl be you daughter but remember she mother i need not ask look at she mr caresfoot and then look at I and say whether or not i look old and who be the young man she lover i suppose -- at any rate he look like it but please introduce I angelum say philip cross to the window where they be talk let I introduce you to lady bellamy mr heigham -- lady bellamy i be delighted to make you acquaintance miss caresfoot though i think it be very generous of I to say so angela look puzzle indeed she say what do you not guess why it be generous then look at yourself in the glass and you will see i use to have some pretension to good look but i could never have stand beside you at the best of time and now -- you mother even when i be at my best always _ kill _ I if i be in the same room with she and you be even handsomer than you mother angelum blush very much at this unqualified praise and put it and the exclamation she appearance have that morning wring from arthur together she suddenly come to the conclusion -- for odd as it may seem she have never before take the matter into serious consideration -- that she must be very good-looking a conclusion that make she feel extremely happy she could not quite tell why it be whilst she be thus blush and look she happiest and loveliest that george return from he walk chance to look in at the window and see she and gradually draw by the attraction of she beauty he eye fix themselves intently upon she and he coarse feature grow instinct with a mixture of hungry wickedness and delighted astonishment it be thus that arthur and lady bellamy see he philip who be look at a picture in the corner of the room do not see he nor indeed do angela the look be unmistakable and once more the dark frown settle upon lady bellamy 's brow and the expand pupil fill the heavy-lidded eye as for arthur it make he feel sick with unreasonable alarm next minute george enter the room with a stupid smile upon he face and look as daze as a bat that have suddenly be show the sun angelum 's heaven-lit beauty have come upon he gross mind as a revelation it fascinate he he have lose he command over himself oh here you be at last george say lady bellamy -- it be always she habit to call he george we have all be like sheep without a shepherd though i see you keep a eye on the flock through the window george start he do not know that he have be observe i do not know that you be all here or i would have be back sooner he say and then begin to shake hand when he come to angela he favor she with a tender pressure of the finger and a elaborate and high-flown speech of welcome both of which be inexpressibly disagreeable to she but here lady bellamy intervene and skilfully force he into a conversation with she in which philip join what do lady bellamy remind you of angelum ask arthur as soon as the hum of talk make it improbable that they would be overhear of a egyptian sorceress i think look at the low broad forehead the curl hair the full lip and the inscrutable look of the face to my mind she be a ideal of the spirit of power i be very much afraid of she and as for he -- nod towards george -- i dislike he even more than i be prepare to and she give a little shudder by the way mr heigham you really must not be so rash as to accept my father 's invitation if you do not wish to see I of course i will not he answer in a hurt and disappointed tone oh it be not that indeed how could you think so when only this morning we agree to be friend well what be it then he ask blankly why mr heigham the fact be that we -- that be my old nurse and i for my father be irregular in he meal and always take they by himself -- live so very plainly and i be ashamed to ask you to share we mode of life for instance we have nothing but bread and milk for breakfast and the golden head sink in some confusion before he amuse gaze oh be that all he say cheerily i be very fond of bread and milk and then go on angelum with she confession we never drink wine and i know that gentleman do i be a teetotaller so that do not matter really yes -- really but then you know my father shut himself up all day so that you will have nobody but myself to talk to oh never mind -- encouragingly i be sure that we shall get on well if in spite of all this and a great deal more -- ah a very great deal that i have not time to tell you -- you still care to come i will do my best to amuse you at any rate we can read together that will be something if you do not find I too stupid you must remember that i have only have a private education and have never be to college like you i shall be glad of the opportunity of rub up my classic a little i have be neglect they rather lately and actually get into a mess over a passage in aristophane that i shall ask you to clear up this be enough for arthur whose knowledge of the classic be that of the ordinary university graduate he turn the subject with remarkable promptitude tell I he say look she straight in the face be you glad that i be come the gray eye drop a little before the boldness of he gaze but she answer unhesitatingly yes for my own sake i be glad but i fear that you will find it very dull come angelum we must be off i want to be home by a quarter to six say philip just then she rise at once and shake hand with arthur murmur good-by till to-morrow morning and then with lady bellamy george meanwhile with the most unwonted hospitality be press she father to stay to dinner and when he decline announce he intention of come over to see he on the morrow at last he get away but not before lady bellamy have bid he a seemingly cordial adieu you and you charming daughter must come and see I at rewtham house when we get in what have you not hear that sir john have buy it from poor marium lee 's executor philip turn pale as death and hurry from the room it be good reflect lady bellamy as she watch the effect of she shaft to let he know that i never forget but even when she father have go the path be still block to angela what say george who be when in a amiable mood that worst of all cad a jocose cad be you go to play truant too my pretty cousin then first you must pay the penalty not a very heavy one however and he throw he long arm round she waist and prepare to give she a cousinly embrace at first angelum not be accustom to little joke of the sort do not understand what he intention be but as soon as she do be a extremely powerful young woman she soon put a stop to they shake george away from she so sharply by a little swing of she lithe body that stumble over a footstool in he rapid backward passage he in a trice measure he length upon the floor see what she have do angelum turn and flee after she father as for arthur the scene be too much for he risible nerve and he fairly roar with laughter whilst even lady bellamy go as near to it as she ever do george rise white with wrath mr heigham he say i see nothing to laugh at in a accident do not you reply arthur i do it be just the most ludicrous accident that i ever see george turn away mutter something that it be perhaps as well he guest do not hear and at once begin to attack lady bellamy my dear george be she rejoinder let this little adventure teach you that it be not wise for middle-aged man to indulge in gallantry towards young lady and especially young lady of thew and sinew good-night at the same moment the footman announce that the dog-cart which arthur have order be wait for he good-by mr heigham good-by say george with angry sarcasm within twenty-four hour you have kill my favorite dog take offence at my well-meant advice and ridicule my misfortune if we should ever meet again doubtless you will have further surprise in store for I and without give arthur time to make any reply he leave the room chapter xxi early on the day follow arthur 's departure from isleworth lady bellamy receive a note from george request she if convenient to come and see he that morning as he have something rather important to talk to she about john she say to she husband at breakfast do you want the brougham this morning no why because i be go over to isleworth have not you better take the luggage-cart too and you luggage in it and live there altogether it would save trouble send backwards and forwards suggest she husband with severe sarcasm lady bellamy cut the top off a egg with a single clean stroke -- all she movement be decisive -- before she answer i think she say that we have do with that sort of nonsense some year ago be you go to begin it again yes lady bellamy i be i be not go to stand be bully and jeer at by that damned scoundrel caresfoot any more i be not go to stand you eternal visit to he you have stand they for twenty year rather late in the day to object now be not it she remark coolly begin she egg it be never too late to mend it be not too late for you to stop quietly at home and do you duty by you husband most man would think that i have do my duty by he pretty well twenty year ago you be nobody and have comparatively speak nothing now you have a title and between three and four thousand a year who have you to thank for that certainly not yourself curse the title and the money i have rather be a poor devil of a attorney with a large family and five hundred a year to keep they on than live the life i do between you and that vulgar beast caresfoot it be a dog 's life not a man 's and poor bellamy be so overcome at he real or imaginary wrong that the tear actually roll down he puffy little face he wife survey he with some amusement i think she say that you be a miserable creature perhaps i be anne but i tell you what it be even a miserable creature can be drive too far it may perhaps be worth you while to be a little careful she cast one swift look at he a look not without apprehension in it for there be a ring about he voice that she do not like but he appearance be so ludicrously wretched that it reassure she she finish she egg and then slowly drive the spoon through the shell she say do not threaten john it be a bad habit and show a un-christian state of mind besides it might force I to cr-r-rush you in self - defense you know and john and the egg-shell have finally collapse together lady bellamy order the brougham have thus sufficiently scourge she husband she depart in due course to visit she own taskmaster little guess what await she at he hand after all there be a deal of poetic justice in the world little smith fresh from he mother 's apron-string be savagely beat by the cock of the school jone and to he jone be a all-powerful cruel devil place above all possibility of retribution if however little smith could see the omnipotent jone be mentally ploughed and harrowed by he papa the clergyman in celebration of the double event of he have miss a scholarship and take too much sherry it be probable that he wound feeling would be greatly soothe nor do it stop there robinson the squire of the parish take it out of the reverend jone and speak ill of he to the bishop a low churchman on the matter of vestment and very shortly afterwards sir buster brown the chairman of the quarter session express he opinion pretty freely of robinson in he magisterial capacity only in he turn to receive a most unexampled wig from she majesty 's judge baron muddlebone for not show he that respect he be accustom to receive from the high sheriff of the county and even over the August person of the judge himself there hang the fear of the only thing that he can not commit for contempt public opinion justice why the world be full of it only it be mostly build upon a foundation of wrong lady bellamy find george sit in the dining-room beside the safe that have so greatly interested she husband it be open and he be read a selection from the bundle of letter which the reader may remember have see in he hand before how do anne he say without rise you look very handsome this morning i never see a woman wear better she vouchsafe no reply to he greet but turn as pale as death what she say huskily point with she finger to the letter in he hand what be you do with those letter bravo

dog by show he the whip anne i have get something to ask of you and i wish to get you into a generous frame of mind first listen now i be go to read you a few extract from a past that be so vividly record here she sink into a chair hide she face in she hand and groan george whose own feature betray a certain nervousness take a yellow sheet of paper and begin to read ` do you know how old i be to-day nineteen and i have be marry a year and a half ah what a happy lass i be before i marry how they worship I in my old home queen anne they always call I well they be dead now and pray god they sleep so sound that they can neither hear nor see yes a year and a half -- a year of happiness half a year of hell happiness whilst i do not know you hell since i see you face what secret spring of

there be more of the same sort remark george coolly it afford a most interesting study of mental anatomy but i have no time to read more of it we will pass on to another lady bellamy do not move she sit tremble a little she face bury in she hand he take up a second letter and begin to read a marked passage ` the die be cast i will come i can no longer resist you influence it grow stronger every day and now it make I a murderess for the shock will kill he and yet i be tire of the sameness and smallness of my life my mind be too big to be cramp in such narrow fetter ' that extract be really very funny say george critically but do not look depressed anne i be only go to trouble you with one more date a year or so later listen ' i have several time see the man you send I he be a fool and contemptible in appearance and worst of all show sign of fall in love with I but if you wish it i will go through the marriage ceremony with he poor little dupe you will not marry I yourself and i would do more than that to keep near you indeed i have no choice i _ must _ keep near you i go to the zoological garden the other day and see a rattlesnake feed upon a live rabbit the poor thing have ample room to run away in but could not it be fascinate and sit still and scream at last the snake strike it and i think that its eye look like yours i be as helpless as that poor animal and you be much more cruel than the snake and yet my mind be infinitely stronger than you own in every way i can not understand it what be the source of you power over I but i be quite reckless now so what do it matter i will do anything that do not put I within reach of the law you know that my husband be dead i _ know _ that he would die he expire with my name upon he lip the child too i hear die in a fit of croup the nurse have go out and there be no one to look after it upon my word i may well be reckless for there be no forgiveness for such as you and i as for little b -- as i think i tell you i will lead he on and marry he : at any rate i will make he fortune for he : i _ must _ devote myself to something and ambition be more absorb than anything else -- at least i shall rise to something great good-night i do not know which ache most my head or my heart ' now that extract would be interesting reading to bellamy would it not here she suddenly spring forward and snatch at the letter but george be too quick for she he fling it into the safe by he side and swing the heavy lid to no no my dear anne that property be too valuable to be part with except for a consideration she attempt frustrated she drop back into she chair what be you torture I for she ask hoarsely have you any object in drag up the ghost of that dead past or be it merely for amusement do i not tell you that i have a favor to ask of you and wish to get you into a proper frame of mind first a favor you mean that you have some wickedness in hand that you be too great a coward to execute yourself out with it i know you too well to be shock oh very well you see angelum caresfoot philip 's daughter here yesterday yes i see she very good i mean to marry she and you must manage it for I lady bellamy sit quite still and make no answer you will now continue george relieve to find that he have not provoke the outburst he have expect understand why i read you those extract i be thoroughly determine upon marry that girl at whatever cost and i see very clearly that i shall not be able to do so without you help with you help the matter will be easy for no obstacle except the death of the girl herself can prevail against you iron determination and unbounded fertility of resource and if i refuse i must have read those extract to very little purpose for you to talk about refuse if you refuse the pang of conscience will overcome I and i shall feel oblige to place these letter and more especially those refer to himself in the hand of you husband of course it will for my own sake be unpleasant to I to have to do so but i can easily travel for a year or two till the talk have blow over for you it will be different bellamy have no cause to love you now judge what he will feel when he know all the truth he will scarcely keep the story to himself and even be he to do so it could easily be set about in other way and in either case you will be a ruin woman and all that you have toil and scheme for for twenty year will be snatch from you in a instant if on the other hand you do not refuse and i can not believe that you will i will on my wedding-day burn these uncomfortable record before you eye or if you prefer it you shall burn they yourself you have only see this girl once be it possible that you be in earnest in wish to marry she do you think that i should go through this scene by way of a joke i never be so much in earnest in my life before i be in love with she i tell you as much in love as though i have know she for year what happen to you with reference to I have happen to I with reference to she or something very like it and marry she i must and will lady bellamy as she hear these word rise from she chair and fling herself on the ground before he clasp he knee with she hand oh george george she cry in a broken voice have some little pity do not force I to do this unnatural thing be you heart a stone or be you altogether a devil that by such cruel threat you can drive I into become the instrument of my own shame i know what i be none better : but for whose sake do i become so surely george i have some claim on you compassion if i have none on you love think again george and if you will not give she up choose some other means to compass this poor girl 's ruin get up anne and do not talk sentimental rubbish not but what he add with a sneer it be rather amusing to hear you pity you successful rival she spring to she foot all the softness and entreaty go from she face which be instead now spread with she darkest and most vindictive look _ i _ pity she she say i hate she look you if i have to do this my only consolation will be in know that what i do will drag my successor down below my own level i suffer she shall suffer more i know you a fiend she shall find a whole hell with you she be purer and better than i have ever be soon you shall make she worse than i have dream of be she purity shall be dishonour she love betray she life reduce to such chaos that she shall cease to believe even in she god and in return for these thing i will give she -- _ you _ you new plaything shall pass through my mill george caresfoot before ever she come to yours and on she i will repay with interest all that i have suffer at you hand and exhaust with the fierceness of she own invective and the violence of conflict passion she sink back into she chair bravo anne quite in you old style i daresay that the young lady will require a little moulding and she could not be in better hand but mind no trick -- i be not go to be cheat out of my bride you need not fear george i shall not murder she i do not believe in violence it be the last resort of fool if i do you would not be alive now george laugh a little uneasily well we be good friend again so there be no need to talk of such thing he say the campaign will not be by any mean a easy one -- there be many obstacle in the way and i do not think that my intend have take a particular fancy to I you will have to work for you letter anne but first of all take a day or two to think it over and make a plan of the campaign and now good-by i have get a bad headache and be go to lie down she rise and go without another word but all necessity for set about she shameful task be soon postpone by news that reach she the next morning to the effect that george caresfoot be seriously ill chapter xxii the dog-cart that arthur have hire to take he away belong to a old-fashioned inn in the parish of rewtham situate about a mile from rewtham house -lrb- which have just pass into the hand of the bellamy -rrb- and two from bratham abbey and thither arthur have himself drive he jehu know through all the country round as old sam be a ancient ostler who have be in the service of the rewtham king 's head man and boy for over fifty year and from he arthur collect a good deal of inaccurate information about the caresfoot family include a garbled version of all the death of angelum 's mother and philip 's disinheritance after all there be few more comfortable place than a inn not a huge london hotel where you be know as no 48 and have to lock the door of you cell when you come out of it and deliver up you key to the warder in the hall but a old-fashioned country establishment where they cook you breakfast exactly as you like it and give you sound ale and a four-poster at least so think arthur as he sit in the private parlor smoking he pipe and reflect on the curious vicissitude of existence now here he be with all the hope and interest of he life utterly change in a single space of six-and - twenty hour why six-and-twenty hour ago he have never meet he respected guardian nor sir john and lady bellamy nor philip and he daughter he could hardly believe that it be only that morning that he have first see angela it seem week ago and if time could have be measure on a new principle by event and not by minute it would have be week the wheel of life he think revolve with a strange irregularity for month and year it turn slowly and steadily under the even pressure of monotonous event but on some unexpected day a tide come rush down the stream of be and spin it round at speed and then tear onward to the ocean call the past leave its plaything to creak and turn to turn and creak or wreck perhaps and useless thinking thus arthur make he way to bed the excitement of the day have weary he and for a while he sleep soundly but as the fatigue of the body wear off the activity of he mind assert itself and he begin to dream vague happy dream of angelum that by degree take shape and form till they stand out clear before the vision of he mind he dream that he and angelum be journey two such happy traveller through the green field in summer till by-and-by they come to the dark entrance of a wood into which they plunge fear nothing thicker grow the overshadow branch and darker grow the path and now they journey lover-wise with they arm around each other but as they pass along they come to a place where the path fork and here he stoop to kiss she already he could feel the thrill of she embrace when she be sweep from he by a unseen force and carry down the path before they leave he root where he be but still he could trace she progress as she go wring she hand in sorrow and presently he see the form of lady bellamy robe as a egyptian sorceress and hold a letter in she hand which she offer to angelum whispering in she ear she take it and then in a second the letter turn to a great snake with george 's head that throw its coil around she and strike at she with its fang next the darkness of night rush down upon the scene and out of the darkness come wild cry and mock laughter and the choke sound of death and he sens leave he when sight and sense come back he dream that he be still walk down a wooded lane but the foliage of the overhang tree be of a richer green the air be sweet with the scent of unknown flower beautiful bird flit around he and from far-off come the murmur of the sea and as he travel broken-hearted a fair woman with a gentle voice stand by he side and kiss and comfort he till at length he grow weary of she kiss and she leave he weep and he go on he way alone seek he lose angelum and then at length the path take a sudden turn and he stand on the shore of a illimitable ocean over which brood a strange light as where the quiet end of evening smile mile on mile and there with the soft light linger on she hair and tear of gladness in she eye stand angelum more lovely than before she arm outstretch to greet he and then the night close in and he awake he eye open upon the solemn and beautiful hour of the first quickening of the dawn and the thrill and softness that come from contact with the thing we meet in sleep be still upon he he get up and flung open he lattice window from the garden beneath rise the sweet scent of may flower very different from that of he dream which yet linger in he nostril whilst from a neighbouring lilac - bush stream the rich melody of the nightingale presently it cease before the broaden daylight but in its stead pure and clear and cold arise the note of the mavi give tuneful thanks and glory to its maker and as he listen a great calm steal upon he spirit and kneel down there by the open window with the breath of spring upon he brow and the voice of the happy bird within he ear he pray to the almighty with all he heart that it might please he in he wise mercy to verify he dream inasmuch as he would be well content to suffer if by suffer he might at last attain to such a unutterable joy and rise from he knee feel better and stronger he know in some dim way that that undertaking must be blest which in such a solemn hour of the heart he do not fear to pray god to guide to guard and to consummate and on many a after-day and in many another place the book of he life would reopen at this well-conned page and he would see the dim light in the faint flushed sky and hear the song of the thrush swell upward strong and sweet and remember he prayer and the peace that fall upon he soul by ten o'clock that morning arthur he dog and he portmanteau have all arrive together in front of the abbey house before he foot have touch the moss-grown gravel the hall-door be fling open and angelum appear to welcome he look as old sam the ostler forcibly put it afterwards to he helper just like a hangel with the wing off jakes too emerge from the recess of the garden and ask angela in a tone of aggrieved sarcasm as he edge he way suspiciously past aleck why the gentleman have not bring the rampingest lion from the zoologic garden with he at once have thus express he feeling on the subject of bull-dog he shoulder the portmanteau and make he way with it upstairs arthur follow he up the wide oak stair every one of which be square out of a single log stop for a while on the landing where the staircase turn to gaze at the stern-faced picture that hang so that it look through the large window face it right across the park and over the whole stretch of the abbey land and to wonder at the deep-graved inscription of devil caresfoot set so conspicuously beneath he room be the largest upon the first landing and the same in which angelum 's mother have die it have never be use from that hour to this and indeed in a little recess or open space between a cupboard and the wall there still stand two trestle drape with rotten black cloth that have originally be bring there to rest she coffin on and which angelum have overlook in get the room ready this spacious but somewhat gloomy apartment be hung round with portrait of the caresfoot of past age many of which bear a marked resemblance to philip but amongst whom he look in vain for one in the slightest degree like angelum whose handiwork he recognize in two large bowl of flower place upon the dark oak dressing-table just as jakes have finish unbuckle he portmanteau a task that he have undertake with some groan and be depart in haste lest he should be ask to do something else arthur catch sight of the trestle what be those he ask cheerfully coffin-stool be the abrupt reply coffin-stool ejaculate arthur feeling that it be unpleasant to have little detail connect with one 's latter end bring thus abruptly into notice what the deuce be they do here bring to put the last as sleep in that ` ere bed on and stand ever since do not you think insinuate arthur gently that you have better take they away can not do so they be part of the furniture they be -- stand there all handy for the next one too maybe you and he vanish with a sardonic grin jakes do not submit to the indignity of unbuckle portmanteau and have he leg sniff at by bull-dog for nothing not by any means please by suggestion so unpleasant arthur take he way downstair determine to renew the coffin-stool question with he host he find angelum wait for he in the hall and make friend with aleck will you come in and see my father for a minute before we go out she say arthur assent and she lead the way into the study where philip always sit the same room in which he father have die he be sit at a writing-table as usual at work on farm account rise he greet arthur civilly take however no notice of he daughter although he have not see she since the previous day well heigham so you have make up you mind to brave these barbarous wild have you i be delighted to see you but i must warn you that beyond a pipe and a glass of grog in the evening i have not much time to put at you disposal we be rather a curious household i do not know whether angelum have tell you but for one thing we do not take we meal together so you will have to make you choice between the dining-room and the nursery for my daughter be not out of the nursery yet and he give a little laugh on the whole perhaps you have better be relegate to the nursery it will at any rate be more amusing to you that the society of a morose old fellow like myself and besides i be very irregular in my habit angela you be stare at I again i should be so very much oblige if you would look the other way i only hope heigham that old pigott will not talk you head off she have get a dreadful tongue well do not let I keep you any longer it be a lovely day for the time of year try to amuse yourself somehow and i hope for you sake that angelum will not occupy herself with you as she do with I by stare as though she wish to examine you brain and backbone good-by for the present what do he mean asked arthur as soon as they be fairly outside the door about you stare at he mean answer poor angelum who look as though she be go to cry i wish i could tell you all i know be that he can not bear I to look at he -- he be always complain of it that be why we do not take we meal together -- at least i believe it be he detest my be near he i be sure i do not know why it make I very unhappy i can not see anything different in my eye from anybody else 's can you and she turn they swim as they be with tear of mortification full upon arthur he scrutinize they depths very closely so closely indeed that presently she turn they away again with a blush well she say i be sure you have look long enough be they different very different reply the oracle with enthusiasm how well they -- they be larger be that all and they be deeper deeper -- that be nothing i want to know if they produce any unpleasant effect upon you -- different from other people 's eye i mean well if you ask I i be afraid that you eye do produce a strange effect upon I but i can not say that it be a unpleasant one but you do not look long enough for I to form a really sound opinion let we try again no i will not and i do believe that you be laugh at I i think that be very unkind and she march on in silence do not be angry with I or i shall be miserable i really be not laugh at you only if you know what wonderful eye you have get you would not ask such ridiculous question about they you father must be a strange man to get such idea i be sure i should be delighted if you would look at I all day long but tell I something more about you father : he interest I very much angelum feel the tell-tale blood rise to she face as he praise she eye and bit she lip with vexation it seem to she that she have suddenly catch a epidemic of blush i can not tell you very much about my father because i do not know much he life be to a great extent a seal book to I but they say that once he be a very different man when he be quite young i mean but all of a sudden he father -- my grand-father you know -- whose picture be on the stair die and within a day or two my mother die too that be when i be bear after that he break down and become what he be now for twenty year he have live as he do now pore all day over book of account and very rarely see anybody for he do all he business by letter or nearly all of it and he have no friend there be some story about he be engage to a lady who live at rewtham when he marry my mother which i daresay you have hear but i do not know much about it but mr heigham -- and here she drop she voice -- there be one thing that i must warn you of : my father have strange fancy at time he be dreadfully superstitious and think that he have communication with being from another world i believe that it be all nonsense but i tell you so that you may not be surprise at anything he say or do he be not a happy man mr heigham apparently not i can not imagine any one be happy who be superstitious it be the most dreadful bondage in the world where be you raven to-day ask arthur presently i do not know i have not see very much of they for the last week or two they have make a nest in one of the big tree at the back of the house and i daresay that they be there or perhaps they be hunting for they food -- they always feed themselves but i will soon tell you and she whistle in a soft but penetrate note next minute there be a swoop of wing and the largest raven after hover over she for a minute light upon she shoulder and rub he black head against she face this be jack you see i expect that jill be busy sit on she egg fly away jack and look after you wife she clap she hand and the great bird give a reproachful croak spread he wing and be go you have a strange power over animal to make those bird so fond of you do you think so it be only because i have live as i do quite alone have time to study all they way and make friend of they do you see that thrush there i know he well i feed he during the frost last winter if you will stand back with the dog you shall see arthur hide himself behind a thick bush and watch angelum whistle again but in another note with a curious result not only the thrush in question but quite a dozen other bird of different sort and size come fly round she some settle at she foot and one a little robin actually perch itself upon she hat presently she dismiss they as she have do the raven by clap she hand and come back to arthur in the winter time she say i could show you more curious thing than that i think that you be a witch say arthur who be astounded at the sight she laugh as she answer the only witchery that i use be kindness chapter xxiii pigott angelum 's old nurse be by no means sorry to hear of arthur 's visit to the abbey house though have in she youth be a servant in good house she be distressed at the nature of he reception but put this aside she think it high time that she darling should see a young man or two that she might learn what the world be like pigott be no believer in female celibacy and angelum 's future be a frequent subject of meditation with she for she know very well that she present mode of life be scarcely suit either to she birth she beauty or she capability not that she ever in she highest flight imagine angelum as a great lady or one of society 's shine star she love to picture she in some quiet happy home beloved by she husband and surround by child as beautiful as herself it be but a moderate ambition for one so peerlessly endowed but she would have be glad to see it fulfil for of late year there have spring up in nurse pigott 's mind a increase dislike of she surroundings which sometimes almost amount to a feeling of horror philip she have always detest with he preoccupy air and uncanny way there must she would say be something wicked about a man as be afraid to have he own bonny daughter look he in the face to say nothing of he be that mean as to grudge she the clothes on she back and make she live worse nor a servant-girl have therefore by a quiet peep through the curtain ascertain that he be nice-looking and about the right age pigott confess to herself that she be heartily glad of arthur 's arrival and determine that should she take to he on further acquaintance he should find a warm ally in she in any advance he might choose to make on the fortress of angelum 's affection i do so hope that you do not mind dining at half-past twelve and with my old nurse angelum say as they go together up the stair to the room they use as a dining-room of course i do not -- i like it really i do angelum shake she head and look but partially convinced lead the way down the passage and into the room where to she astonishment she perceive that the dinner-table be furnish with a more sumptuous meal than she have see upon it for year the fact be that pigott have receive order from philip which she do not know of not to spare expense whilst arthur be he guest what waste reflect angelum in whom the pressure of circumstance have develop a economical turn of mind as she glance at the unaccustomed jug of beer he say he be a teetotaller a loud hem from pigott arrest she attention stop all further consideration of the matter that good lady who in honor of the occasion be dress in a black gown of a formidable character and a many-ribboned cap be stand up behind she chair wait to be introduce to the visitor angelum proceed to go through the ceremony which pigott 's straight-up-and-down attitude render rather try nurse this be the gentleman that my father have ask to stay with we mr heigham let I introduce you to my old nurse pigott arthur bow politely whilst pigott make two obligatory curtsy require a step backwards after each as though to make room for another she speech too carefully prepare for the occasion be worthy of transcription hem she say this sir be a pleasure as i little expected and i well know that it be not what you or the likes be accustom to a-eating of dinner and tea with old woman which i hope sir how as you will put up with it see how as the habit of this house be what might without mistake be call peculiar which i say without any offence to miss angelum 'cause though she bringing-up have be what i call odd she know it as well as i do which indeed be the only consolation i have to offer be right sure as indeed i be how as any young gentleman as ever breathe would sit in a pool of water to dine along with miss angelum let alone a old nurse i be not such a fool as i may look no need for you to go a-blushing of miss angelum and now sir if you please we will sit down for fear lest the gravy should begin to grease and utterly exhaust by the exuberance of she own verbosity she plunge into she chair -- a example which arthur bow he acknowledgement of she opening address be not slow to follow one of he first act be at pigott 's invitation to help himself to a glass of beer of which to speak truth he drink a good deal angelum watch the proceeding with interest what she ask presently be a teetotaller the recollection of he statement of the previous day flash into he mind he be however equal to the occasion a teetotaller he reply with gravity be a person who only drink beer and angelum the apparent discrepancy explain retire satisfied that be a very pleasant dinner what a thing it be to be young and in love how it gild the dull gingerbread of life what new capacity of enjoyment it open up to we and for the matter of that of pain also and oh what stupendous fool it make of we in everybody else 's eye except we own and if we be lucky those of we adore the afternoon and evening pass much as the morning have do angelum take arthur round the place and show he all the spot connect with she strange and lonely childhood of which she tell he many a curious story in fact before the day be over he know all the history of she innocent life and be strike with amazement at the variety and depth of she scholastic acquirement and the extraordinary power of she mind which combine with she simplicity and total ignorance of the way of the world produce a affect as charming as it be unusual needless to say that every hour he know she he fall more deeply in love with she at length about eight o'clock just as it be begin to get dark she suggest that he should go and sit a while with she father and what be you go to do asked arthur oh i be go to read a little and then go to bed i always go to bed about nine and she hold out she hand to say good-night he take it and say good-night then i wish it be to-morrow why because then i should be say ` good-morning angelum ' instead of ` good-night angelum ' may i call you angela we seem to know each other so well you see yes of course she laugh back everybody i know call I angela so why should not you and will you call I arthur everybody i know call I arthur angelum hesitate and angelum blush though why she hesitate and why she blush be perhaps more than she could have exactly say y-e-s i suppose so -- that be if you like it it be a pretty name arthur good-night arthur and she be go he companion go arthur turn and enter the house the study - door be open so he go straight in philip who be sit and stare in a abstracted way at the empty fireplace with a light behind he turn quickly round as he hear the footstep oh it be you be it heigham i suppose angelum have go upstairs she go to roost very early i hope that she have not bore you and that old pigott have not talk you head off i tell you that we be a odd lot you know but if you find we odder than you bargain for i should advise you to clear out thank you i have spend a very happy day indeed i be glad to hear it you must be easily satisfy have a arcadian mind and that sort of thing take some whisky and light you pipe arthur do so and presently philip in that tone of gentlemanly ease which above everything distinguish he from he cousin lead the conversation round to he guest 's prospects and affair more especially he money affair arthur answer he frankly enough but this money talk have not the same charm for he that it have for he host indeed a marked repugnance to everything that have to do with money be one of he characteristic and weary out at length with pecuniary detail and endless research into the mystery of investment he take advantage of a pause to attempt to change the subject well he say i be much oblige to you for you advice for i be very ignorant myself and hate anything to do with money i go back to first principle and believe that we should all be better without it i always think answer philip with a semi-contemptuous smile that the desire of money or amongst savage race its equivalent shell or what not be _ the _ first principle of human nature perhaps it be -- i really do not know but i heartily wish that it could be eliminate off the face of the earth forgive I laugh philip but that be the speech of a very young man why eliminate money and you take away the principal interest of life and destroy the social fabric of the world what be power but money comfort -- money social consideration -- money ay and love and health and happiness itself money money money tell I he go on rise and address he with a curious earnestness what god be there more worthy of we adoration than plutus see that if we worship he enough he alone of the idol we set in high place will never fail we at need it be a worship that rarely bring lasting happiness with it in we greed to collect the means of enjoyment surely we lose the power to enjoy pshaw that be the cant of fool of those who do not know of those who can not feel but i know and i feel and i tell you that it be not so the collection of those means be in itself a pleasure because it give a consciousness of power do not talk to I of fate that sovereign -lrb- throw the coin on to the table -rrb- be fate 's own seal you see I for instance apparently poor and helpless a social pariah one to be avoid and even insult good before long these will right all that for I i shall by they help be powerful and court yet ay believe I heigham money be a living move force leave it still and it accumulate expend it and it gratify every wish save it and that be best of all and you hold in you hand a lever that will lift the world i tell you that there be no height to which it can not bring you no gulf it will not bridge you except soliloquize arthur the cliff of the hereafter and -- the grave he word produce a curious effect philip 's eloquence break off short and for a moment a great fear creep into he eye silence ensue which neither of they seem to care to break meanwhile the wind suddenly spring up and begin to moan and sigh amongst the half-clad bough of the tree outside -- make arthur think to himself a very melancholy music presently philip lay he hand upon he guest 's arm and he feel that it shake like a aspen - leaf tell I he say in a hoarse whisper what do you see there arthur start and follow the direction of he eye to the bare wall opposite the window at that end of the room through which the door be make i see he say some move shadow what do they resemble i do not know nothing in particular what be they what be they hiss philip whose face be livid with terror they be the shades of the dead send here to torture I look she go to meet he the old man be tell she now she will wring she hand nonsense mr caresfoot nonsense say arthur shake himself together i see nothing of the sort why it be only the shadow fling by the moonlight through the swing bough of that tree cut it down and you will have no more writing upon you wall ah of course you be right heigham quite right ejaculate he host faintly wipe the cold sweat from he brow it be nothing but the moonlight how ridiculous of I i suppose i be a little out of sort -- liver wrong give I some whisky there be a good fellow and i 'll drink damnation to all the shadow and _ the tree that throw they _ ha ha ha there be something so uncanny about he host 's manner and he evident conviction of the origin of the waver figure on the wall -lrb- which have now disappear -rrb- that arthur feel have it not be for angelum he would not be sorry to get clear of he and he shadow as soon as possible for superstition he know be as contagious as small-pox when at length he reach he great bare bed-chamber not by the way a comfortable sort of place to sleep in after such a experience it be only after some hour in the excited state of he imagination that tired though he be he could get the rest he need chapter xxiv next morning when they meet at they eight o'clock breakfast arthur notice that angelum be distressed about something there be bad news she say almost before he greet she my cousin george be very ill with typhus fever indeed remark arthur rather coolly well i must say it do not appear to distress you very much no i can not say it do to be honest i detest you cousin and i do not care if he be ill or not there as she appear to have no reply ready the subject then drop after breakfast angelum propose that they should walk -- for the day be again fine -- to the top of a hill about a mile away whence a view of the surrounding country could be obtain he consent and on the way tell she of he curious experience with she father on the previous night she listen attentively and when he have finish shake she head there be she say something about my father that separate he from everybody else he life never come out into the sunlight of the pass day it always grope along in the shadow of some gloomy past what the mystery be that envelop he i neither know nor care to inquire but i be sure that there be one how do you explain the shadow i believe you explanation be right they be under certain condition of light throw by a tree that grow some distance off i have see something that look like figure on that wall myself in full daylight that he should interpret such a simple thing as he do show a curious state of mind you do not think then say arthur in order to draw she out that it be possible after all he be right and that they be something from another place the reality of he terror be almost enough to make one believe in they i can tell you no i do not answer angelum after a minute 's thought i have no doubt that the veil between ourselves and the unseen world be thinner than we think i believe too that communication and even warning sometimes under favourable condition or when the veil be worn thin by trouble or prayer can pass from the other world to ourselves but the very fact of my father 's terror prove to I that he shadow be nothing of the sort for it be hardly possible that spirit can be permit to come to terrify we poor mortal if they come at all it be in love and gentleness to comfort or to warn and not to work upon we superstition you speak as though you know all about it you should join the new ghost society he answer irreverently sit himself down on a fall tree a example that she follow i have think about it sometimes that be all and so far as i have read i think that my belief be a common one and what the bible teach we but if you will not think I foolish i will tell you something that confirm I in it you know that my mother die when i be bear well it may seem strange to you but i be convince that she be sometimes very near I do you mean that you see or hear she no i only feel she presence more rarely now i be sorry to say as i grow older how do you mean i can hardly explain what i mean but sometimes -- it may be at night or when i be sit alone in the daytime -- a great calm come upon I and i be a changed woman all my thought rise into a higher purer air and be as it be tinge with a reflect light everything earthly seem to pass away from I and i feel as though fetter have fall from my soul and i _ know _ that i be near my mother then everything pass and i be leave myself again and what be the thought you have at these time ah i wish i could tell you they pass away with she who bring they leave nothing but a vague after-glow in my mind like that in the sky after the sun have set but now look at the view be it not beautiful in the sunlight all the world seem to be rejoice angelum be right the view be charming below lay the thatched roof of the little village of bratham and to the right the water of the lake shone like silver in the glance sunlight whilst the gable of the old house peep out from amongst the bud foliage look very picturesque the spring have cast she green garment over the land from every copse ring out the melody of bird and the gentle breeze be heavy with the scent of the unnumbered violet that star the mossy carpet at they foot in the field where grow the wheat and clover now spring into lusty life the busy weeder be at work and on the warm brown fallow the sower go forth to sow from the early pasture beneath where purl a little brook there come a pleasant lowing of kine well-contented with the new grass and a cheerful bleating of lamb to whom as yet life be nothing but one long skip it be a charming scene and its influence sink deep into the gazer ' heart it be depress to think say arthur rather sententiously but really chiefly with the object of get at he companion 's view that all this can not last but be as it be like ourselves under sentence of death it rise and fall and fleet upon earth 's troubled sea a wave that swell to vanish into eternity oh mystery and wonder of wing that can not fly of ear that can not hearken of life that live -- to die quoth angelum by way of comment whose line be those ask arthur i do not know they my own she say shyly that be they be a translation of a verse of a greek ode i write for mr fraser i will say you the original if you like i think it better than the translation and i believe that it be fair greek thank you thank you miss blue-stocking i be quite satisfied with you english version you positively alarm I angela most people be quite content if they can put a poem write in english into greek you reverse the process and have coolly give expression to you thought in greek condescend to translate they into you native tongue i only wish you have be at cambridge or -- what do they call the place -- girton it would have be a joke to see you come out double-first ah she break in blush you be like mr fraser you overrate my acquirement i be sorry to say i be not the perfect scholar you think I and about most thing i be shockingly ignorant i should indeed be silly if after ten year ' patient work under such a scholar as mr fraser i do not know some classic and mathematics why do you know for the last three year that we work together we use as a rule to carry on we ordinary conversation during work in latin and greek month and month about sometimes with the funniest result one never know how little one do know of a dead language till one try to talk it just try to speak in latin for the next five minute and you will see thank you i be not go to expose my ignorance for you amusement angelum she laugh no she say it be you who wish to amuse yourself at my expense by try to make I believe that i be a great scholar but what i be go to say before you attack I about my fancied acquirement be that in my opinion you remark about the whole world be under sentence of death be rather a morbid one why it be obviously true yes in a sense but to my mind this scene speak more of resurrection than of death look at the earth push up she flower and the dead tree break into beauty there be no sign of death there but rather of a renew and glorified life yes but there be still the awful _ fact _ of death to face nature herself have be temporarily dead before she bloom into beauty she die every autumn to rise again in the same form every spring but how do we know in what form _ we _ shall emerge from the chrysali as soon as a man begin to think at all he stand face to face with this hideous problem to the solution of which he know himself to be draw daily nearer he position i often think be worse than that of a criminal under sentence because the criminal be only be deprive of the employment of a term indefinite indeed but absolutely limited but man at large do not know of what he be deprive and what he must inherit in the aeon that await he it be the uncertainty of death that be its most dreadful part and with that hang over we race the wonder to I be not only that we for the most part put the subject entirely out of mind but that we can ever think seriously of anything else i remember answer angelum once think very much in the same way and i go to mr fraser for advice ` the bible ' he say ` will satisfy you doubt and fear if only you will read it in a right spirit ' and indeed more or less it do i can not of course venture to advise you but i pass he advice on it be that of a very good man have you then no dread of death or rather of what lie beyond it she turn she eye upon he with something of wonder in they and why she say should i who be immortal fear a change that i know have no power to harm I that can on the contrary only bring I nearer to the purpose of my be certainly i shrink from death itself as we all must but of the danger beyond i have no fear pleasant as this world be at times there be something in we all that strive to rise above it and if i know that i must die within this hour i _ believe _ that i could meet my fate without a qualm i be sure that when we tremble hand have draw the veil from death we shall find he feature passionless indeed but very beautiful arthur look at she with astonishment wonder what manner of woman this could be who in the first flush of youth and beauty could face the great unknown without a tremor when he speak again it be with something of envious bitterness ah it be very well for you whose life have be so pure and free from evil but it be different for I with all my consciousness of sin and imperfection for I and thousand like I strive as we will immortality have terror as well as hope it be and always will be human to fear the future for human nature never change you know the line in ` hamlet ' it be ` that the dread of something after death -- the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller return -- puzzle the will and make we rather bear those ill we have than fly to other that we know not of thus conscience do make coward of we all ' they be true and while man last they always will be true oh arthur she answer earnestly and for the first time address he in conversation by he christian name how limited you trust must be in the mercy of a creator whose mercy be as wide as the ocean that you can talk like that you speak of I too as better than yourself -- how be i better i have my bad thought and do bad thing as much as you and though they may not be the same i be sure they be quite as black as yours since everybody must be responsible accord to they character and temptation i try however to trust in god to cover my sin and believe that if i do my best he will forgive I that be all but i have no business to preach to you who be older and wiser than i be if he break in lay he hand involuntarily upon she own you know -- although i have never speak of they to any one before and could not speak of they to anybody but yourself -- how these thing weigh upon my mind you would not say that but would try to teach I you faith how can i teach you arthur when i have so much to learn myself she answer simply and from that moment though she do not know it as yet she love he this conversation -- a very curious one arthur think to himself afterwards for two young people on a spring morning -- have come to a end nothing more be say for some while and they take they way down the hill vary the route in order to pass through the little hamlet of bratham under a chestnut-tree that stand upon the village green arthur notice _ not _ a village blacksmith but a small crowd mostly compose of child gather round somebody on go to see who it be he discover a battered-looking old man with a intellectual face and the remnant of a gentlemanlike appearance playing on the violin a very few touch of he bow tell arthur who know something of music that he be in the presence of a performer of no mean merit see the quality of he two auditor and that they appreciate he performance the player change he music and from a village jig pass to one of the more difficult opera air which he execute in brilliant fashion bravo cry arthur as the last note thrill and die away i see you understand how to play the fiddle yes sir and so i should for i have play first violin at she majesty 's opera before now name what you like and i will play it you or if you like it better you shall hear the water run in a brook the wind pass through the tree or the wave fall on the beach only say the word arthur think for a moment it be a beautiful day let we have a contrast -- give we the music of a storm the old man consider a while i understand but you set a difficult subject even for I and take up he bow he make several attempt at begin i can not do it he say set something else no no try again that or nothing again he start and this time he genius take possession of he the note fall very softly at first but with a ominous sound then rise and wail like the rising of the wind next the music come in gust the rain patter and the thunder roar till at length the tempest seem to spend its force and pass slowly away into the distance there sir what do you say to that -- have i fulfil you expectation write it down and it will be one of the finest piece of violin music in the country write it down the divine ` afflatus ' be not to be cage sir it come and go i could never write that music down arthur feel in he pocket without answer and find five shilling if you will accept this he say thank you sir very much i be gladder of five shilling now than i once be of as many pound and he rise to go a man of you talent should not be wander about like this i must earn a living somehow for all talleyrand 's witticism to the contrary be the curious answer have you no friend no sir this be my only friend all the rest have desert I and he tap he violin and be go lord sir say a farmer who be stand by he be go to get drunk he be the biggest old drunkard in the countryside and yet they do say he be gentleman once and the best fiddler in london but he can not be depend on so no one will hire he now how sad say angelum as they move homewards yes and what music that be i never hear any with such imagination before you have a turn that way angelum you should try to put it into word it would make a poem i complain like the old man that you set a difficult subject she say but i will try if you will promise not to laugh at the result if you succeed on paper only half so well as he do on the violin you verse will be worth listen to and i certainly shall not laugh chapter xxv on the follow day the somewhat curious religious conversation between arthur and angelum -- a conversation which begin on arthur 's part out of curiosity have end on both side very much in earnest -- the weather break up and the grand old english climate reassert its treacherous supremacy from summer weather the inhabitant of the county of marlshire suddenly find themselves plunge into a spell of cold that be by contrast almost arctic storm of sleet drive against the window-pane and there be even a very damaging night-frost while that dreadful scourge which nobody in he sens except kingsley _ can _ ever have like the east wind literally pervade the whole place and go whistle through the surround tree and ruin in a way calculate to make even a laplander shiver under these cheerless circumstance we pair of companion -- for as yet they be ostensibly at any rate nothing more -- give up they outdoor excursion and take to ramble over the disused room in the old house and hunting up many a record some of they valuable and curious enough of long-forgotten caresfoot and even of the old prior before they a splendidly illuminate missal be amongst the latter prize when this amusement be exhaust they sit together over the fire in the nursery and angelum translate to he from she favorite classical author especially homer with a ease and fluency of expression that to arthur be little short of miraculous or when they get tire of that he read to she from standard writer which elaborate as she education have be in certain respects she have scarcely yet even open notably shakespeare and milton needless to say herself imbue with a strong poetic feeling these immortal writer be a source of intense delight to she how be it that mr fraser never give you shakespeare to read asked arthur one day as he shut up the volume have come to the end of hamlet he say that i should be better able to appreciate it when my mind have be prepare to do so by the help of a classical and mathematical education and that it would be ' a mistake to cloy my mental palate with sweet before i have learn to appreciate they flavor ' there be some sense in that remark arthur by the way how be the verse you promise to write I get on have you do they yet i have do something she answer modestly but i really do not think that they be worth produce it be very tiresome of you to have remember about they arthur however by this time know enough of angelum 's ability to be sure that she something would be something more or less worth hearing and mildly insist on they production and then to she confusion on she read they aloud they run as follow and whatever angelum 's opinion of they may have be the reader shall judge of they for himself : a storm on the string the minstrel sit in he lonely room its wall be bare and the twilight gray fell and creep and gather to gloom it come like the ghost of the die day and the chord fall hushed and low pianissimo he arm be raise and the violin quiver and shake with the strain it bear while the swell forth of the sound within rise with a sweetness unknown before and the chord fall soft and low piano the first cold flap of the tempest 's wing clash with the silence before the storm the raindrop patter across the string as the gathering thunder-cloud take form -- drip drop high and low staccato heavily roll the thunder roar sudden and jag the lightning play faster and faster the raindrop pour sob and surge the tree-crest sway crack and crash above below crescendo the wind tear howl across the wold and tangle he train in the groan tree wrap the dense cloud in he mantle cold then shiver and die in a wail breeze whistle and weep high and low sostenuto a pale sun break from the drive cloud and flash in the raindrop serenely cool : at the touch of he finger the forest bow as it shimmer and glance in the ruffle pool while the rustling leave soughed soft and low gracioso it be only a dream on the throbbing string a echo of nature in phantasy work a breath of she breath and a touch of she wing from a kingdom outspread in the region of think below roll the sound of the city 's din and the fading day as the night draw in show the quaint old face and the pointed chin and the arm that be raise o'er the violin as the old man whisper he hope 's dead tale to the friend who could comfort though other might fail and the chord steal hushed and low pianissimo he stop and the sheet of paper fall from he hand well she say with all the eagerness of a new-born writer tell I do you think they _ very _ bad well angela you know -- ah go on now i be ready to be crushed pray do not spare my feeling i be about to say that thanks be to providence i be not a critic but i think -- oh yes let I hear what you think you be speak so slowly in order to get time to invent something extra cut well i deserve it do not interrupt i be go to say that i think the piece above the average of second-class poetry and that a few of the line touch the first-class standard you have catch something of the ` divine afflatus ' that the drunken old fellow say he could not cage but i do not think that you will ever be popular as a writer of verse if you keep to that style i doubt if there be a magazine in the kingdom that would take those line unless they be by a known writer they would return they marked ` good but too vague for the general public ' magazine editor do not like line from ' a kingdom outspread in the region of thought ' for as they say such poem be apt to excite vagueness in the brain of that dim entity the ` general public ' what they do like be commonplace idea put in pretty language and sweeten with sentimentality or emotional religious feeling such as the think power of they subscriber be competent to absorb without mental strain and without leave they accustomed channel to be popular it be necessary to be commonplace or at the least to describe the commonplace to work in a well-worn groove and not to startle -- requirement which unfortunately simple as they seem very few person possess the art of act up to see what happen to the unfortunate novelist for instance who dare to break the unwritten law and defraud he reader of the orthodox transformation scene of the reward of virtue and the discomfiture of vice or to make he creation finish up in a way that however well it may be suit to its tenor or illustrate its more subtle meaning be contrary to the ` general reader 's ' idea as to how it should end -- badly as it be call he simply collapse to rise no more if he be new at the trade and if he be a known man that book will not sell you talk quite feelingly say angelum who be get rather bore and want not unnaturally to hear more about she own line yes reply arthur grimly i do once i be fool enough to write a book but i must tell you that it be a painful subject with I it never come out nobody would have it oh arthur i be so sorry i should like to read you book but as regard the verse i be glad that you like they and i really do not care what a hypothetical general public would say i write they to please you not the general public well my dear i be sure i be much oblige to you i shall value they doubly once for the giver 's sake and once for they own angelum blush but do not reprove the term of endearment which have slip unaware from he lip poetry be a dangerous subject between two young people who at heart adore one another it be apt to excite the brain and bring about startling revelation the day follow the reading of angelum 's piece of poetry be render remarkable by two event of which the first be that the weather suddenly turn a somersault and become beautifully warm and the second that news reach the abbey house that thanks chiefly to lady bellamy 's devoted nursing -- who fearless of infection have to the great admiration of all she neighbor volunteer she service when no nurse could be find to undertake the case -- george be pronounce out of danger this piece of news be peculiarly grateful to philip for have he cousin die the estate must have pass away for ever under the term of he uncle 's will for he know that george have make none angelum too try like a good girl as she be to lash herself into enthusiasm about it though in she heart she go as near hate she cousin since he attempted indignity towards herself as she gentle nature would allow arthur alone be cynically indifferent he hate george without any reservation whatsoever and after this they come for we pair of embryo lover some ten or twelve such happy day -lrb- for there be no talk of arthur 's departure philip have on several occasion pointedly tell he that the house be at he disposal for as long as he choose to remain in it -rrb- the sky be blue in those day or only fleck with summer cloud just as arthur and angelum 's perfect companionship be fleck and shaded with the deeper hue of dawn passion alas the sky in this terrestrial clime be never _ quite _ blue but as yet nothing of love have pass between they no kiss or word of endearment only when hand touch hand a strange thrill have move they both and send the warm blood to stain angelum 's clear brow like a waver tint of sunlight throw upon the marble feature of some white venus only in each other 's eye they find a holy mystery the spell be not yet fully at work but the wand of earth 's great enchanter have touch they and they be change angelum be hardly the same girl she be when we meet she a little more than a fortnight back a nameless change have come over she face and manner the merry smile once so bright have grow softer and more sweet and the laughing light of she gray eye have give place to a look of some such gratitude and wonder as that with which the traveller in lonely desert gaze on the oasis of he perfect rest many time arthur have almost blurt out the truth to the woman he passionately adore and every day so add to the suppress fire of he love that at length he feel that he could not keep he secret to himself much longer and yet he fear to tell it better he think to live happy if in doubt than to risk all he fortune on a single throw for before he eye there lay the black dread of failure and then what would life be worth here with angelum he live in a garden of eden that no foreboding no anxiety no fear of that partially scotch serpent george could render wretched so long as it be gladden by the presence of she whom he hope to make he eve but without and around where she could not be there be nothing but clod and thistle and a black desolation that even in imagination he dare not face and angelum gaze on veil mystery with wonder eye be she happy during those spring-tide day almost but still there be in she heart a consciousness of effort a sense of transformation and knowledge of the growth of hidden thing the bud burst into the glory of the rose must if there be feel in a rose undergo some such effort before it can make its beauty know the butterfly but newly free from the dull husk that hide its splendor at first must feel the imperfect wing it stretch in the sun to be irksome to its unaccustomed sense and so it be with angelum she spread she half - grow wing in the sun of she new existence and find they strange not know as yet that they be shape to bear she to the flower - crown height of love hers be one of those rare nature in which the passion that we know by the generic term of love approach as near perfection as be possible in we human heart for there be many sort and division of love range from the affection pure steady and divine that be shower upon we from above to the degrading madness of such a one as george caresfoot it be surely one of the saddest evidence of we poor humanity that even among the purest of we there be none who can altogether rid the whiteness of the love they have to offer of its earthly stain indeed if we could so far conquer the prompting of we nature as to love with perfect purity we should become like angel but just as white flower be sometimes to be find on the blackest peak so there do bloom in the world spirit as pure as they be rare -- so free from evil so closely shadow by the almighty wing that they can almost reach to this perfection then the love they have to give be too refine too holy and strong to be understand of the mass of man : often it be squander on some unequal and unanswering nature sometimes it be wisely offer up to he from whom it come we gaze upon a ice-bound river and there be nothing to tell we that beneath that white cloak its current rush to the ocean but presently the spring come the prisoned water burst they fetter and we see a glad torrent sparkling in the sunlight and so it be with we heroine 's heart the breath of arthur 's passion and the light of arthur 's eye have beat upon it and almost free the river of its love already the listener might hear the ice-sheet crack and start soon they will be go and she deep devotion will set as strong towards he as the tide of the torrent towards its receive sea fine write perhaps the reader will say but surely none too fine to describe the most beautiful thing in this strange world the irrevocable gift of a good woman 's love however that may be it will have serve its purpose if it make it clear that a crisis be at hand in the affair of the heart of two of the central actor on this mimic stage chapter xxvi one Saturday morning when may be three-parts go philip announce he intention of go up to london till the Monday on business he be a man who have long since become callous to appearance and though arthur fearful lest spiteful thing should be say of angelum almost hint that it would look odd he host merely laugh and say that he have little doubt but that he daughter be quite able to look after herself even when such a fascinating young gentleman as himself be concern as a matter of fact he object be to get rid of angelum by marry she to this young heigham who have so opportunely tumble down from the sky and whom he rather like than otherwise this be the case he rightly conclude that the more the two be leave together the greater probability there be of he object be attain accordingly he leave they together as much as possible it be on the evening of this Saturday that arthur gather up he courage and ask angelum to come and walk through the ruin with he angela hesitate a little the shadow of something about to happen have fall on she mind but the extraordinary beauty of the evening to say nothing of the prospect of he company turn the scale in arthur 's favor it be one of those night of which if we be lucky we get some five or six in the course of a english summer the moon be at she full and the twilight end she fill the heaven with she light every twig and blade of grass show out as clearly as in the day but look like frosted silver the silence be intense and so still be the air that the sharp shadow of the tree be motionless upon the grass only grow with the grow hour it be one of those night that fill we with a indescribable emotion bring we into closer companionship with the unseen than ever do the garish busy day in such a hour we can sometimes feel or think that we can feel other presence around we and involuntarily we listen for the whisper of the wing and the half-forgotten voice of we beloved on this particular evening some such feeling be stir in angelum 's heart as with slow step she lead the way into the little village churchyard a similar spot to that which be to be find in many a country parish except that the population be very small there be but few recent grave most of the mound have no head-stone to recall the name of the neglect dead but here and there be dot discolor slab some sink a foot or two into the soil a few lie prone upon it and the remainder throw by the gradual subsidence of they support into every variety of angle as though they have be suddenly halt in the maddest whirl of a grotesque dance of death pick she way through these angelum stop under a ancient yew and point to one of the two shadowed mount to which the moonlight scarcely struggle say in a low voice that be my mother 's grave it be a modest tenement enough a little heap of close green turf surround by a railing and plant with sweet-william and forget - me-not at its head be place a white marble cross on which arthur could just distinguish the word hilda caresfoot and the date of death he be about to speak but she stop he with a gentle movement and then step forward to the head of the railing she bury she face in she hand and remain motionless arthur watch she with curiosity what he wonder be pass in the mind of this strange and beautiful woman who have grow up so sweet and pure amidst moral desolation like a white lily bloom alone on the black african plain in winter suddenly she raise she head and see the inquire look he bent upon she she come towards he and in that sweet half - plead voice which be one of she greatest charm she say i fear you think I very foolish why should i think you foolish because i have come here at night to stand before a half-forgotten grave i do not think you foolish indeed i be only wonder what be pass in you mind angelum hang she head and make no answer and the clock above they boom out the hour raise its sullen note in insolent defiance of the silence what be it that be so solemn about the striking of the belfry-clock when one stand in a churchyard at night be it that the hour soften we nature and make they more amenable to semi - superstitious influence or be it that the thousand evidence of depart mortality which surround we appeal with dumb force to natural fear throw open for a space the gate of we world-sealed imagination to tenant its vast hall with prophetic echo of we end perhaps it be useless to inquire the result remain the same : few of we can hear those tone at night without a qualm and do we put we thought into word they would run something thus : that sound once break upon the living ear of those who sleep around we we hear it now in a little while hour after hour it will echo against the tombstone of _ we _ grave and new generation come out of the silent future will stand where we stand and hearken and muse as we muse over the old problem that we have go to solve whilst we -- shall we not be deaf to hear and dumb to utter such at any rate be the unspoken thought that creep into the heart of arthur and angelum as the full sound from the belfry thin itself away into silence she grow a little pale and glance at he and he give a involuntary shiver while even the dog aleck sniff and whine uncomfortably it feel cold he say shall we go they turn and walk towards the gate and by the time they reach it all superstitious thought have vanish -- at any rate from arthur 's mind for he recollect that he have set himself a task to do and that now would be the time to do it absorb in this reflection he forget he politeness and pass first through the turnstile on the further side he pause and look earnestly into he beloved 's face they eye meet and there be that in he that cause she to swiftly drop she own a silence ensue as they stand by the gate he break it it be a lovely night let we walk through the ruin i shall wet my foot : the dew must be fall there be no dew fall to-night will not you come let we go to-morrow it be later than i generally go in pigott will wonder what have become of I never mind pigott the night be too fine to waste asleep besides you know one should always look at ruin by moonlight please come she look at he doubtfully hesitate and come what do you want to see she say presently with as near a approach to irritation as he have ever hear she indulge in that be the famous window that mr fraser always go into rapture about it be beautiful shall we sit down here and look at it they sit down on a low mass of fall masonry some fifteen pace from the window around they lay a delicate tracery of shadow whilst they themselves be seat in the eye of the moonlight and remain for a while as silent and as still as though they have be the shades of the paint figure that have once fill the stony frame above they angela he say at length -- angelum listen and i will tell you something my mother a woman to whom sorrow have become almost a inspiration when she be die speak to I something thus : ` there be ' she say ` but one thing that i know of that have the power to make life happy as god mean it to be and as the folly and weakness of man and woman render it nearly impossible for it to be and that be -- love love have be the consolation of my own existence in the midst of many trouble first the great devotion i bear you father and then that which i entertain for yourself without these two tie life would indeed have be a desert and yet though it be a grief to I to leave you and though i shrink from the dark passage that lie before I so far do that first great love outweigh the love i bear you that in my calmer moment i be glad to go because i know i be await by you father and from this i wish you to learn a lesson : look for you happiness in life from the love of you life for there only will you find it do not fritter away you heart but seek out some woman some one good and pure and true and in give she you devotion you will reap a full reward for she happiness will reflect you own and if you choice be right you will however stormy you life may be lay up for yourself as i feel that i have do a everlasting joy ' she listen to he in silence angelum he go on boldly enough now that the ice be break i have often think about what my mother say but until now i have never _ quite _ understand she meaning i do understand it now angela do _ you _ understand I there be no answer she sit there upon the fall masonry gaze at the ruin round she motionless and white as a marble goddess forget in she desecrate fane oh angelum listen to I -- listen to I i have find the woman of whom my mother speak who must be so ` good and pure and true ' you be she i love you angela i love you with my whole life and soul i love you for this world and the next oh do not reject I though i be so little worthy of you i will try to grow so dearest can you love I still there be silence but he think that he see she breast heave gently then he place he hand all tremble with the fierce emotion that throb along he vein upon the palm that hang listless by she side and gaze into she eye still she neither speak nor shrink and in the imperfect light she face look very pale while she lovely eye be dark and meaningless as those of one entranced then slowly he gather up he courage for a effort and raise he face to the level of she own he kiss she full upon she lip she stir she sigh he have break the spell the sweet face that have withdraw itself draw nearer to he for a second the awaken eye look into he own and fill they with reflect splendor and then he become aware of a warm arm throw about he neck and next -- the star grow dim and sense and life itself seem to shake upon they throne for a joy almost too great for mortal man to bear take possession of he heart as she lay she willing lip upon he own and then before he know she purpose she slide down upon she knee beside he and place she head upon she breast dearest he say do not kneel so look at I slowly she raise she face wreathe and lovely with many blush and look upon he with tearful eye he try to raise she let I be she say speak very low i be best so it be the attitude of adoration and i have find -- my divinity but i can not bear to see you kneel to I oh arthur you do not understand a minute since _ i _ do not understand that a woman be very humble when she really love do you -- really love I angela i do have you know that long i only _ know _ it

expression of shy love and conviction on she face and answer she spirit who lead I to you heart chapter xxvii george 's recovery when the doctor have give up all hope be sufficiently marvellous to suggest the idea that a certain power have determine -- on the hangman 's principle perhaps -- to give he the longest of rope but it could in reality be trace to a more terrestrial influence -- namely lady bellamy 's nursing have it not be for this nursing it be very certain that she patient would have join he forefather in the bratham churchyard for whole day and night she watch and tend he scarcely close she own eye and quite heedless of the danger of infection till in the end she conquer the fever and snatch he from the jaw of the grave how often have not a woman 's devotion be successful in such a struggle on the Monday follow the event narrate in the last chapter george now in a advanced stage of convalescence though forbid to go abroad for another fortnight be sit

i be prepare to offer a good price & c & c i 'll see he hang first be george 's comment how do he get the money save it and make it i suppose well at any rate he shall not buy I out with it no no master philip i be not fond enough of you to do you that turn it do not strike you she say coldly that you hold in you hand a lever that may roll all you difficulty about this girl out of the way by jove you be right anne trust a woman 's brain but i do not want to sell the estate unless i be force to would you rather part with the land or give up you project of marry angelum caresfoot why do you ask because you will have to choose between the two then i have rather sell you have better give it up george i be not superstitious but i have knowledge in thing that you do not understand and i

expose you oh i be you very humble servant you may count on I the galley - slave pull well when the lash hang over he shoulder and she laugh coldly just then a servant announce that mr caresfoot be at the door and anxious to speak to he cousin he be order to show he into the drawing-room as soon as he have go on he errand george say i will not see he say i be too unwell but do you go and see that you make the most of you chance lady bellamy nod and leave the room she find philip in the drawing-room ah how do you do mr caresfoot i come from you cousin to say that he can not see you to-day he have scarcely recover sufficiently from the illness through which i have be nurse he but of course you know all about that oh yes lady bellamy i have hear all about it include you own brave behavior to which the doctor tell I george owe he life i be sorry that he can not see I though i have just come down from town and call in on my way from roxham i have some rather important business that i want to speak about about you offer to repurchase the isleworth land she ask ah you know of the affair yes that be it then i be commission to give you a reply philip listen anxiously you cousin absolutely refuse to sell any part of the land will nothing chance he determination i be ready to give a good price and pay a separate valuation for the timber nothing he do not intend to sell a deep depression spread itself over she hearer 's face then there go the hope of twenty year he say for twenty long year ever since my misfortune i have toil and scheme to get these land back and now it be all for nothing well there be nothing more to be say and he turn to go stop a minute mr caresfoot do you know you interest I very much i be proud to interest so charming a lady he answer a touch of depressed gallantry that be as it should be but you interest I because you be a instance of the truth of the say that every man have some ruling passion if only one could discover it why do you want these particular land you money will buy other just as good why do a swiss get home-sick why do a man defraud of he own wish to recover it lady bellamy muse a little what would you say if i show you a easy way to get they philip turn sharply round with a new look of hope upon he face you would earn my eternal gratitude -- a gratitude that i should be glad to put into a practical shape she laugh oh you must speak to sir john about that now listen i be go to surprise you you cousin want to get marry get marry george want to get marry exactly so and now i have a further surprise in store for you -- he want to marry you daughter angelum this time philip say nothing but he start in evident and uncomfortable astonishment if lady bellamy wish to surprise he she have certainly succeed surely you be joke he say i never be further from joke in my life he be desperately in love with she and wild to marry she well well do not you now see a way to force you cousin to sell the land at the price of angelum 's hand precisely philip walk up and down the room in think though as the reader may remember he have himself but a month before be base enough to suggest that he daughter should use she eye to forward he project he have never in justice to he be it say dream of force she into a marriage in every way little less than unnatural he idea of responsibility towards he daughter be as regard sin of omission extremely lax but there be some of commission that he do not care to face certain fear and memory oppress he too much to allow of it lady bellamy he say presently you have know my cousin george intimately for many year and be probably sufficiently acquaint with he habit of life to know that such a marriage would be a infamy many a man who have be wild in he youth make a good husband she answer quietly the more i think of it go on philip excitedly after the fashion of one who would lash himself into a passion the more i see the utter impossibility of any such thing and i must say that i wonder at you have undertake such a errand on the one hand there be a young girl who though i do not from force of circumstance see much of myself be i believe as good as she be handsome -- and on the other break in lady bellamy ironically be the isleworth estate and on the other go on philip without pay heed to she remark -- i be go to speak plainly lady bellamy -- be a man utterly devoid of the foundation of moral character whose appearance be certainly against he who i have get reason to know be not to be trust and who be old enough to be she father and she cousin to boot -- and you ask I to forward such a marriage as this i will have nothing to do with it my responsibility as a father forbid it it would be the wickedest thing i have ever do to put the girl into the power of such a man lady bellamy burst into a low peal of laughter she never laugh aloud she think that it be now time to throw he a little off he balance forgive I she say with she sweetest smile but you must admit that there be something rather ludicrous in hear the hero of the great marium lee scandal talk about moral character and the father who detest he daughter so much that he fear to look she in the face and whose sole object be to rid himself of a encumbrance prating of he paternal responsibility philip start visibly at she word ah mr caresfoot she go on i surprise you by my knowledge but we woman be sad spy and it be my little amusement to find out other people 's secret a very useful little amusement i could tell you many thing -- i be about to say break in philip who have naturally no desire to see more of the secret of he life unveil by lady bellamy that even if i do wish to get rid of angelum i should have little difficulty in do so as young heigham who have be stop at the abbey house for a fortnight or so be head over ear in love with she indeed i should think it highly probable that they be at this moment engage it be lady bellamy 's turn to start now ah she say i do not know that that complicate matter and then with a sudden change of tone -- mr caresfoot as a friend let I beg of you not to throw away such a chance in a hurry for the sake of a few nonsensical idea abut a girl what be she after all that she should stand in the way of such grave interest as you have in hand i tell you that he be perfectly mad about she you can make you own term and fix you own price price ay that be what it would be -- a price for she body and soul well and what of it the thing be do every day only one do not talk of it in that way who teach you who be once a young girl yourself to plead such a cause as this nonsense it be a very good cause -- a cause that will benefit everybody especially you daughter george will get what he want you with the recovery of the estate will also recover you lose position and reputation both to a great extent a affair of land property mr heigham will gain a little experience whilst she will bloom into a great lady and like any other girl in the same circumstance learn to adore she husband in a few month and what will _ you _ get lady bellamy i she reply with a gay laugh oh you know virtue be its own reward i shall be quite satisfied in see everybody else make happy come i do not want to press you about the matter at present think it over at you leisure i only beg you not to give a decide answer to young heigham should he ask you for angelum till i have see you again -- say in a week 's time then if you do not like it you can leave it alone and nobody will be a penny the worse as you like but i tell you that i can never consent and philip take he leave you cousin entirely refuse he consent and angelum be by this time probably engage to you ex-ward arthur heigham be lady bellamy 's not very promising report to the interesting invalid in the dining - room after relieve he feeling at this intelligence in language more forcible than polite george remark that under these circumstance matter look very bad not at all they look very well i shall see you cousin again in a week 's time when i shall have a different tale to tell why wait a week with that young blackguard make the run on the spot because i have put poison into philip 's mind and the surest poison always work slow besides the mischief have be do good-by i will come and see you in a day or two when i have make my plan you see i mean to earn my letter chapter xxviii with what degree of soundness we pair of lover slumber on that memorable Saturday night let those who have be so fortunate or unfortunate as to have be place in analogous circumstance form they own opinion it be however certain that arthur gaze upon the moon and sundry of the larger planet for some hour until they unkindly set and leave he for he candle have burn out to find he way to bed in the dark with he reflection we will not trouble ourselves or rather we will not intrude upon they privacy but there be another person in the house who sit at a open window and look upon the heaven -- angelum to wit let we avail ourselves of we rightful privilege and look into she thought arthur 's love have come upon she as a surprise but it have find a perfect home all the day and hour that she have spend in he company have unknown to herself be mysteriously employ in prepare a habitation to receive it we all know the beautiful bible story of the creation how first there be a empty void and the spirit brood on the water then light and then life and last man come to turn all thing to he use surely that story which be the type and symbol of many thing be of none more so than of the growth and birth of a perfect love in the human heart the soil be make ready in the dead winter and receive the seed into its bosom then come the spring and it be clothe with verdure space be void till the sun shoot its sudden ray athwart it and make it splendid the heart be cold and unwitting of its end till the spirit brood upon it as upon the water and it grow quick with the purpose of life and then what a change be there what have the flower in common with the seed from whence it spring or the noonday sky with the darkness before the dawn thinking in she chamber with the night air playing on she hot brow and she hand press upon she heart as though to still the tumult of its joy angelum grow vaguely conscious of these thing be she the same in heart and mind that she have be a month ago no a thousand time no then what be this mysterious change that seem to shake she inmost life to its foundation what angel have trouble the water into which she have so newly plunge and whence come the healing virtue that she find in they bring rest after the vague trouble of the last two week with sight to see the only good -- she love with speed to follow and strength to hold oh happy happy world oh merciful creator who give she to drink of such a living spring oh arthur beloved arthur on Sunday morning it be pigott 's habit to relax the draconian severity of she law in the matter of breakfast which generally speak be not till about half-past eight o'clock at that hour precisely on the sabbath in question she appear as usual -- no not as usual for it be Sunday she have on she stiff black gown -- and with all due solemnity make the tea a few minute elapse and angelum enter dress in white and very lovely in she simple tight-fitting robe but a trifle pale and with a shy look upon she face she greet she nurse with a kiss why what be the matter with you dearie ejaculate pigott whose watchful eye detect a change she could not define you look different somehow hush i will tell you by-and-by at that moment arthur 's quick step be hear advance down the passage together with a pattering noise that announce the presence of aleck and as they come angelum poor angelum grow red and redder and yet more painfully red till pigott watch she face be enable to form a shrewd guess as to what be the cause of she unaccustomed look on come the step and open fly the door more and more ready to sink into the earth look angelum and so interested grow nurse pigott that she actually pour some hot tea on to she dress a thing she could never remember have do before the first to enter be aleck who follow he custom spring upon angelum and lick she hand and behind aleck look somewhat confused but handsome and happy -- for he be one of those face that become handsome when they owner be happy -- come aleck 's master and then there ensue a infinitesimal but most awkward pause on such occasion as the present namely the first meeting after a engagement there be always -- especially when it occur in the presence of a third person -- a very considerable difficulty in the mind of the party to know what demeanor they be to adopt towards one another be they to treat the little affair of the previous evening as a kind of confidential communication not to be allude to except in private conversation and to drop into the mr and miss of yesterday that would certainly be the easiest but then it would also be a decide act of mutual retreat or be they to rush into each other 's arm as become betrothed lover this process be so new that they feel that it still require private rehearsal and meanwhile time press and everybody be begin to stare and something _ must _ be do these be very much the feeling of arthur and angelum he hesitate before she confused and she keep she head down over the dog but presently aleck get bored move on and as it would have be inane to continue to stare at the floor she have to raise herself as slowly as she might soon they eye arrive in the same plane and whether a mutual glance of intelligence be exchange or whether they power of attraction overcome he power of resistance it be not easy to determine but certain it be that follow a primary natural law arthur gravitate towards she and kiss she on the face my exclaimed pigott and the milk-jug rolled unheeded on the floor hum i suppose i have better explain begin he i think you have spill the milk add she that we have become engage and be -- all to piece i declare break in angelum with she head somewhere near the carpet and then they both laugh well i never no not in all my bear day sir and miss angelum all i have get to say about this extraordinary proceeding -- they glance at each other in alarm -- be that i be very glad to hear on it and i hope and pray how as you may be happy and if you treat my angelum right you 'll be just the happiest and luckiest man in the three kingdom include ireland the royal family and if you treat she wrong worse will come to you and she poor mother 's last word as i hear with my own ear will come true to you and serve you right -- and there be all the milk upon the floor and god bless you both my dear be the prayer of a old woman and here the worthy soul break down and begin to cry nor be angelum 's eye free from tear after this little episode breakfast proceed in something like the usual way church be at 1030 and a while before the hour arthur and angelum stroll down to the spot that have already become as holy ground to they and look into each other 's eye and say again the same sweet word then they go on and mingle with the little congregation -- that do not number more than thirty soul -- they pass into the cool quiet of the church lawk say a woman as they go by be not she just a beauty what a pretty wedding they would make arthur overhear it and note the woman and afterwards find a pretext to give she five shilling because he say it be a lucky omen on the communion-table of the pretty little church there be spread the fair white cloth of the rubric it be the day for the monthly celebration of the sacrament that meet the religious requirement of the village will you stay to the sacrament with I whisper angelum to she lover in the interval between they seat themselves and the entry of the clergyman mr fraser 's _ locum tenen _ arthur nod assent and so when the time come those two go up together to the altar - rail and kneel side by side eat of the bread and drink of the cup and rise depart thence with a new link between they for be sure part of the prayer which they offer up at that high moment be in humble petition to the almighty to set he solemn seal and blessing on they love indeed so far as angelum be concern there be few act of she simple life that she do not consecrate by prayer how much more then be she bent on bring this the greatest of all she act before she maker 's throne strange indeed and full of a holy promise be the yearning with which we turn to heaven to seek sanctification of we deed feel we weakness and craving strength from the source of strength a yearning of which the church with that subtle knowledge of human nature which be one of the mainspring of its power have not be slow to avail itself and this need be more especially feel in matter connect with the noblest of all passion perhaps because all true love and all true religion come from a common home thus pledge to one another with a new and awful pledge and knit together in the bond of a universal love embrace they poor affection as the wide sky embrace the earth they rise and go they way purer to worship and stronger to endure that afternoon arthur have a conversation with he betrothed that partaking of a business nature in the beginning end rather oddly i must speak to you father when he come back to-morrow dear he begin my father oh yes i have forget about that and she look a little anxious fortunately i be fairly well off so i see no cause why he should object well i think that he will be rather glad to get rid of pigott and myself you know that he be not very fond of I that be strange want of taste on he part oh i do not know everybody do not see I with you eye arthur because they have not the chance all the world would love you if it know you but seriously i think that he can hardly object or he would not have allow we to be throw so much together for in nine case out of ten that sort of thing have only one result what do you mean i mean that to import a young fellow into the house and throw he solely into a daughter 's company be very apt to bring about -- well what have be bring about then you mean that you think that i should have fall in love with any gentleman who have come here arthur not see the slight flash of indignation in she eye reply well you know there be always a risk but i should imagine that it would very much depend upon the gentleman arthur -- with a little stamp -- i be ashamed of you how can you think such thing of I you must have a very poor opinion of I my dear why should i suppose myself superior to anybody else that you should only fall in love with I you set too high a value on I and you set too low a value on I you do not understand I you be my fate my other self how would it have be possible for I to love any one but you i feel as though i have be travel to meet you since the beginning of the world to stand by you side till it crumble away yes for eternity itself oh arthur do not laugh at what i say i be indeed only a simple girl but as i tell you last night there be something stir in I now my real life my eternal part something that you have awaken and with which you have to deal something apart from the _ I _ you see before you as i speak i feel and know that when we be dead and go i shall love you still when more age have pass than there be leave upon that tree i shall love you still arthur i be yours for ever for the time that be and be to be she speak with the grand freedom of one inspired nay he feel that she be inspire and the same feeling of awe that have come upon he when he first see she face again take possession of he take she hand he kiss it dearest he say dearest angelum who be i that you should love I so what have i do that such a treasure should be give to I i hope that it may be as you say it will be as i say she answer as she bent to kiss he and they go on in silence chapter xxix philip arrive home about one o'clock on the Monday and after they nursery dinner arthur make he way to the study and soon find himself in the dread presence -- for what presence be more dread -lrb- most people would rather face a chief-justice with the gout -rrb- -- of the man whose daughter he be about to ask in marriage philip whom he find seat by a tray the contents of which he seem in no humor to touch receive he with he customary politeness say with a smile that he hope he have not come to tell he that he be sick of the place and its inhabitant and be go away far from it mr caresfoot i come to speak to you on a very different subject philip glance up with a quick look of expectant curiosity but say nothing in short say arthur desperately i come to ask you to sanction my engagement to angela a pause -- a very awkward pause -- ensue you be then engage to my daughter subject to you consent i be then come another pause you will understand I heigham when i say that you take I rather by surprise in this business you acquaintance with she have be short that be true but i have see a great deal of she perhaps but she know absolutely nothing of the world and she preference for you -- for as you say you be engage to she i presume she have show a preference -- may be a mistake merely a young girl 's romantic idea arthur thought of he conversation of the previous day with angelum and could not help smile as he answer i think if you ask she that she will tell you that be not the case heigham i will be frank with you i like you and you have i believe sufficient means of course you know that my daughter will have nothing -- at any rate till i be dead he add quickly i never think about the matter but i shall be only too glad to marry she with nothing but herself very good i be go to say that notwithstanding this marriage be a important matter and i must have time to think over it before i give you a decide answer say a week i shall not however expect you to leave here unless you wish to do so nor shall i seek to place any restriction on you intercourse with angelum since it would appear that the mischief be already do i be flatter by you proposal but i must have time and you must understand that in this instance hesitation do not necessarily mean consent in affair of this nature a man be satisfy with small mercy and willing to put up with inconvenience that appear trifling in comparison with the disaster that might have overtake he arthur be no exception to the general rule indeed he be profuse in he thanks and buoy up with all the confidence of youth feel sure in he heart that he would soon find a way to extinguish any objection that might still linger in philip 's mind he would-be father-in-law contented himself with acknowledge he remark with courtesy and the interview come to a end arthur go however he host lose all he calmness of demeanor and rise from he untasted meal pace up and down the room in think everything have he reflect fall out as he wish young heigham wish to marry he daughter and he could not wish for a better husband save for the fatality which have send that woman to he on she fiend 's errand he would have give he consent at once and be glad to give it not that he mean to refuse it -- he have no such idea and then he begin to think what suppose that lady bellamy 's embassy have be of a nature that he could entertain which it be not it would mean to he it would mean the realization of the work and aspiration of twenty year it would mean he re-entry into the property and position from which he have accord to he own view be unjustly oust it would mean last but not least triumph over george and now chance mighty chance -lrb- as fool call providence -rrb- have at last throw into he hand a lever with which it would be easy to topple over every stumbling-block that lay in he path to triumph more he might even be able to spoil that egyptian george give he less than he due oh how he hunger for the broad acre of he birthright longing for they as a lover long for he lose bride the opportunity would never come again why should he throw it away to do so would be to turn he cousin into a open and implacable foe why should he allow this girl whose birth have bereft he of the only creature he have ever love whose sex have alienate the family estate and for whose company he care nothing to come as a destruction on he plan she would be well-off the man love she as for she be engage to this young heigham woman soon get over those thing after all now that he come to think of the matter calmly what valid cause be there why the thing should not be and as he pace to and fro and think thus a answer come into he mind for there rise up before he a vision of he die wife and there sound in he ear the murmur of she half-forgotten voice that for all its broken softness have with its last accent call down god 's winged vengeance and he everlasting doom on he who would harm she unprotected child and feeling that if he do this thing on he would be the vengeance and the doom he think of the shadow of the night and grow afraid when arthur and he host meet accord to they custom that evening no allusion be make on either side to they conversation of the afternoon nor do she father even speak a word to angelum on the subject life to all appearance go on in the old house precisely as though nothing have happen philip do not attempt to put the smallest restraint on arthur and he daughter and studiously shut he eye to the pretty obvious sign of they mutual affection for they the long June day be golden but all too short every morning find they mutual love more perfect but when the flake of crimson light fade from the sky and night drop she veil over the tall tree and peaceful lake by some miracle it have grow deeper and more perfect still day by day arthur discover new charm in angelum here some hidden knowledge there a unsuspected grace and everywhere a all-embracing charity and love day by day he gaze deeper into the depths of she mind and still there be more to plumb for it be a storehouse of noble thought and high ambition -- ambition many of which could only find fulfilment in another world than this and the more he see of she the prouder he be to think that such a perfect creature should so dearly love himself and with the greater joy do he look forward to that supreme and happy hour when he should call she he and so day add itself to day and find they happy indeed the aspect of they fortune seem as smooth and smile as the summer surface of the lake about philip 's final consent to they engagement they do not trouble themselves judge not unnaturally that he conduct be in itself a guarantee of approval if he mean to raise any serious objection he would surely have do so before arthur would urge and angelum would quite agree with he and wonder what parent could find it in he heart to object to she bonnie-eyed lover what a merciful provision of providence it be that throw a veil over the future only to be pierce by the keenest-eyed of scotchman where should we find a flavor in those unfrequent cup that the shyest of the god joy hold to we yearning lip could we know of the bitter that lurk in the tinsel bowl surely we have much to be thankful for but for nothing should we be so grateful as for this bless impotence of foresight but as it be often on the bluest day that the mercury begin to sink beneath the breath of far-off hurricane so there be a warning spirit implant in sensitive mind that make they mistrustful of too great happiness we feel that for most of we the wheel of we fortune revolve too quickly to allow of a long continuance of unbroken joy arthur say angelum one morning when eight day have pass since she father 's return from town we be too happy we should throw something into the lake i have not get a ring except the one you give I he answer for he signet be on he finger so unless we sacrifice aleck or the raven i do not know what it be to be do not joke arthur i tell you we be too happy could arthur have see through a acre or so of undergrowth as angelum utter these word he would have perceive a very smart page-boy with the bellamy crest on he button deliver a letter to philip it be true that there be nothing particularly alarming about that but its contents might have give a point to angelum 's foreboding it run thus : rewtham house Monday my dear mr caresfoot with reference to we conversation last week about you daughter and g can you come over and have a quiet chat with I this afternoon sincerely yours anne bellamy philip read this note and then re-read it know in he heart that now be he opportunity to act up to he conviction and put a end to the whole transaction in a few decisive word but a man who have for so many year give place to the devil of avarice even though it be avarice with a legitimate object can not shake himself free from he clothes in a moment even when as in philip 's case honor and right to say nothing of a still more powerful factor superstition speak so loudly in he ear surely he think there would be no harm in hear what she have to say he could explain he reason for have nothing to do with the matter so much better in person such mental struggle have only one end presently the smart page-boy bear back this note : dear lady bellamy i will be with you at half-past three pc it be with very curious sensation that philip be that afternoon show into a richly furnished boudoir in rewtham house he have not be in that room since he have talk to maria lee sit on that very sofa now occupy by lady bellamy 's still beautiful form and he could not but feel that it be a place of evil omen for he lady bellamy rise to greet he with she most fascinating smile this be very kind she say as she motion he to a seat which philip afterwards discover have be carefully arrange so as to put he feature in the full light whilst sit on the sofa she own be conceal well mr caresfoot she begin after a little pause i suppose i have better come to the point at once first of all i presume that as you anticipate would be the case there exist some sort of understanding between mr heigham and you daughter philip nod well you cousin be as determine as ever about the matter indeed he be simply infatuate or bewitch i really do not know which i be sorry for it lady bellamy as i can not -- one moment mr caresfoot first let I tell you he offer then we can talk it over he offer conditionally on he marriage with you daughter to sell you the isleworth estate at a fair valuation hereafter to be agree upon and to make a large settlement and what part do he wish I to play in the matter this first you must get rid of young heigham and prevent he from hold _ any _ communication either with angelum herself or with any other person connect with this place for one year from the date of he departure secondly you must throw no obstacle in george 's path thirdly if require you must dismiss she old nurse pigott it can not be lady bellamy i come here to tell you so i dare not force my daughter into such a marriage for all the estate in england lady bellamy laugh it be amusing she say to see a father afraid of he own daughter but you be over-hasty mr caresfoot who ask you to force she all you be ask to do be not to interfere and leave the rest to myself and george you will have nothing to do with it one way or the other nor will any responsibility rest with you besides it be very probable that you cousin will live down he fancy or some other obstacle will arise to put a end to the thing in which case mr heigham will come back at the end of he year 's probation and event will take they natural course it be only wise and right that you should try the constancy of these young lover instead of let they marry out of hand if on the other hand angelum should in the course of the year declare a preference for she cousin surely that will be no affair of yours i do not understand what you interest be in this matter lady bellamy my dear mr caresfoot what do my interest matter to you perhaps i have one perhaps i have not all woman love match-making you know what really be important be you decision and she shoot a glance at he from the heavy-lidded eye only to recognize that he be not convince by she argument or if convinced obstinate by the way she go on slowly george ask I to make a payment to you on he account money that have he say be long owe but which it have not hitherto be convenient to repay what be the sum ask philip abstractedly a large one a thousand pound it do not require the peculiar intonation she throw into she voice to make the matter clear to he he be well aware that no such sum be owe here be the cheque she go on and take from she purse a sign and cross cheque upon a london banker she unfold it and throw it upon the table watch he the while philip gaze at the money with the eye of a hungry wolf a thousand pound that might be he for the ask nay for the take it would bind he to nothing the miser 's greed take possession of he as he look slowly he raise he hand twitch with excitement and stretch it out towards the cheque but before he finger touch it lady bellamy as though by accident drop she white palm upon the precious paper i suppose that mr heigham will leave to-morrow on the understanding we mention she say carelessly but in a significant tone philip nod the hand be withdraw as carelessly as it have come leave the cheque blush in all its naked beauty upon the table philip take it as deliberately as he could and put it in he pocket then rise he say good-bye add as he pass through the door : remember i have no responsibility in the matter i wash my hand of it and wish to hear nothing about it the thousand pound have do it reflect lady bellamy i tell george that he would rise greedily at money i have not watch he for twenty year for nothing fancy sell a only daughter 's happiness in life for a thousand pound and such a daughter too i wonder how much he would take to murder she if he be certain that he would not be find out upon my word my work grow quite interesting that cur philip be as good as a play and she laugh she own peculiar laugh chapter xxx into philip 's guilty thought as he wend he homeward way we will not inquire and indeed for all the warm glow that the thousand pound cheque in he pocket diffuse through he system they be not to be envy perhaps no scoundrel present at heart such a miserable object to himself and all who know he as the scoundrel who attempt to deceive himself and whilst reap its profit try to shoulder the responsibility of he iniquity on to the back of other unfortunately in this prosaic world of bargain one can not receive cheque for one thousand pound without in some shape or form give a _ quid pro quo _ now philip 's _ quid _ be to rid he house and the neighborhood of arthur heigham he guest and he daughter 's lover it be not a task he like but the unearned cheque in he breeches - pocket continually remind he of the obligation it entail when arthur come to smoke he pipe with he host that evening the latter look so gloomy and depressed that he wonder to himself if he be go to be treat to a repetition of the shadow scene little guess that there be something much more personally unpleasant before he heigham philip say suddenly and look studiously in the other direction i want to speak to you i have be think over we conversation of about a week ago on the subject of you engagement to angelum and have now come to a final determination i may say at once that i approve of you in every way -lrb- here he hearer 's heart bound with delight -rrb- but under all the circumstance i do not think that i should be right in sanction a immediate engagement you be not sufficiently sure of each other for that i may seem old-fashioned but i be a great believer in the virtue of constancy and i be anxious in you own interest to put yours and angelum 's to the test the term that i can offer you be these you must leave here to-morrow and must give I you word of honor as a gentleman -- which i know will be the most effectual guarantee that i can take from you -- that you will not for the space of a year either attempt to see angelum again or to hold any write communication with she or anybody in any way connect with she the year end you can return and should you both still be of the same mind you can then marry she as soon as you like if you decline to accede to these term -- which i believe to be to you mutual ultimate advantage -- i must refuse my consent to the engagement altogether a silence follow this speech the match that arthur have light before philip begin burnt itself out between he finger without he appear to suffer any particular inconvenience and now he pipe fall with a crash into the grate and break into fragment -- a fit symbol of the blow deal to he hope for some moment he be so completely overwhelm at the idea of lose angelum for a whole long year lose she as completely as though she be dead that he could not answer at length he find he voice and say hoarsely : yours be hard term i can not argue the point with you heigham such as they be they be my term found on what i consider i owe to my daughter do you accept they i can not answer you off-hand my happiness and angelum 's be too vitally concern to allow I to do so i must consult she first very good i have no objection but you must let I have you answer by ten to-morrow have arthur only know he own strength and philip 's weakness -- the strength that honesty and honor ever have in the face of dishonor and dishonesty -- have he know the hesitate feebleness of philip 's avarice-tossed mind how easy it would have be for he to tear he bald argument to shed and by the bare exhibition of unshaken purpose to confound and disallow he determination -- have he then and there refuse to agree to he ultimatum so divide be philip in he mind and so shake by superstitious fear that he would have accept it as a omen and have yield to a decision of character that have no real existence in himself but he do not know indeed how could he know and he be besides too thorough a gentleman to allow himself to suspect foul play and so too sad for talk and oppress by the dread sense of come separation from she whom he love more dearly than he life he seek he room there to think and pace to pace and think until the star have set when weary out at length he throw himself into bed it be only to exchange bad for worse for on such occasion sleep be worse than wakefulness it be so full of dream big with come pain shortly after dawn he get up again and go into the garden and listen to the bird sing they matin hymn but he be in no mood for the song of bird however sweet and it be a positive relief to he when old jakes emerge he cross face set in the gladness of the morning like a sullen cloud in the blue sky and begin to do something to he favorite bed of cabbage not that arthur be fond of old jakes on the contrary ever since the coffin-stand conversation which betray he consider a malevolent mind he detest he personally but still he set a fancy value on he because he be connect with the daily life of he betrothed and then at last out come angelum have spy he from behind the curtain of she window clothe in the same white gown in which he have first behold she and which he consequently consider the prettiest of frock never do she look more lovely than when she come walk towards he that morning with she light proud step which be so full of grace and womanly dignity never have he think she more sweet and heart-compelling than when have first make sure that jakes have retreat to feed he pig she shyly lift she bright face to be greet with he kiss but she be quick of sympathy and have learn to read he like a open page and before he lip have fairly fall on she own she know that thing have go amiss oh what be it arthur she say with a little pant of fear be brave dear and i will tell you and in somewhat choky tone he recount word for word what have pass between she father and himself she listen in perfect silence and bear the blow as a brave woman should when he have finish she say with a little tremor in she voice : you will not forget I in a year will you arthur he kiss she by way of answer and then they agree to go together to philip and try to turn he from he purpose breakfast be not a cheerful meal that day and pigott notice the prevail depression remark with sarcasm that they might for all appearance to the contrary have be marry for twenty year but even this spirited sally do not provoke a laugh ten o'clock the hour that be to decide they fate come all too soon and it be with very anxious heart that they take they way to the study philip who be seat in residence appear to view angelum 's arrival with some uneasiness of course angelum he say i be always glad to see you but i hardly expect -- i beg you pardon for intrude father she answer but as this be very important to I i think that i have better come too and hear what be settle as it be evident that she mean to stay philip do not attempt to gainsay she oh very well very well -- i suppose you have hear the term upon which i be prepare to consent to you engagement yes arthur have tell I and it be to implore you to modify they that we have come father they be cruel term -- to be dead to each other for a whole long year i can not help it angelum i be sorry to inflict pain upon either of you but i have arrive at they entirely in you own interest and after a great deal of anxious thought believe I a year 's probation will be very good for both of you it be not probable that where my only child be concerned i should wish to do anything except what be for she happiness arthur look rebellion at angelum philip see it and add : of course you can defy I -- it be i believe rather the fashion for girl nowadays to do so -- but if you do you must both clearly understand first that you can not marry without my consent till the first of may next or very nearly a year hence when angelum come of age and that i shall equally forbid all intercourse in the interval and secondly that when you do so it will be against my wish and that i shall cut she name out of my will for this property be only entail in the male line it now only remain for I to ask you if you agree to my condition angela answer he speak very slowly and clearly : i accept they on my own behalf not because i understand they or think they right or because of you threat but because though you do not care for I i be you daughter and should obey you -- and believe that you wish to do what be best for I that be why i accept although it will make my life wretched for a year do you hear what she say say philip turn to arthur do you also agree he answer boldly and with some temper -lrb- how would he have answer could he have see the thousand pound cheque that be repose upon the table in philip 's rusty pocket-book and know for what purpose it come there -rrb- if it have not be angelum 's wish i would never have agree i think you term preposterous and i only hope that you have some satisfactory reason for they for you have not show we any but since she take this view of the matter and because so far as i can see you have completely corner we i suppose i must you be she father and can not in nature wish to thwart she happiness and if you have any plan of cause she to forget I -- i do not want to be conceit but i believe that it will fail here angela smile somewhat sadly so unless one of we die before the year be up i shall come back to be marry on the 9th of June next year really my dear heigham you way of talk be so aggressive that some father might be tempt to ask you not to come back at all but perhaps it be under the circumstance excusable you would probably think so if you be in my place blurt out arthur you give I then you word of honor as a gentleman that you will attempt either in person or by letter no communication with angelum or with anybody about this place for one year from to-day on the condition that at the end of the year i may return and marry she as soon as i like certainly you marriage can take place on the 9th of June next if you like and care to bring a license and a proper settlement -- say of half you income -- with you answer philip with a half smile i take you at you word say arthur eagerly that be if angelum agree angelum make no sign of disagreement then on those term i give you my promise very good then that be settle and i will send for a dog-cart to take you to the four o'clock train i fear you will hardly be ready for the 1225 i shall however hope he add to have the pleasure of present this young lady to you for good and all on this day next year good-bye for the present i shall see you before you go it be painful to have to record that when arthur get outside the door and out of angelum 's hearing he curse philip in he grief and anger for the space of some minute to linger over those last hour could only be distressing to the sympathetic reader of this history more especially if he or she have ever have the misfortune to pass through such a time in they own proper person the day of any one 's departure be always wretched but much more be it wretched when the person depart be a lover whose face will not be see and of whom no postman will bear tiding for a whole long year some comfort however these two take in look forward to that joyous day when the year of probation should have be gather to its predecessor and in make the most minute arrangement for they wedding : how angelum be to warn mr fraser that he service would be require where they should go to for they honeymoon and even of what flower the wedding bouquet which arthur be to bring down from town with he should be compose and thus the hour pass away all too quickly and each of they strive to be merry in order to keep up the spirit of the other but it be not in human nature to feel cheerful with a lump of ice upon the heart dinner be even more dismal than breakfast and pigott who have be inform of the impending misfortune and who be distrustful of philip 's motive though she do not like to add to the general gloom by say so make after the manner of half-educated people a painful and infectious exhibition of she grief poor aleck say angelum when the time draw near bend down over the dog to hide a tear as she have once before bent down to hide a blush poor aleck i shall miss you almost as much as you master you will not miss he angela because i be go to make you a present of he if you will keep he that be very good of you dear i shall be glad to have he for you sake well keep he love he be a good dog he will quite have transfer he allegiance by the time i come back i hope you will not have do the same angelum oh arthur why will you so often make I angry by say such thing the sun will forget to shine before i forget you hush love i do not mean it and he take she in he arm and so they sit there together under the oak where first they have meet hand in hand and heart to heart and it be at this moment that the self - reliant strength and more beautiful serenity of angelum 's character as compare with she lover 's come into visible play for whilst as the moment of separation draw nigh he could scarcely contain he grief she on the other hand grow more and more calm strengthen he weakness with she quiet power and bidding he seek consolation in he trouble at the hand of he who for he own purpose decree it dearest she say in answer to he complaining there be so many thing in the world that we can not understand and yet they must be right and lead to a good end what may happen to we before this year be out of course we can not say but i feel that all love be immortal and that there be a perfect life await we if not in this world then in the next remember dear that these few year be after all but as a breath to the general air or as that dew-drop to the water of the lake when compare with the future that await we there and that until we attain that future we can not really know each other or the true meaning and purpose of we love so look forward to it without fear dear heart and if it should chance that i should pass out of you life or that other tie should spring up round you that shall forbid the outward expression of we love -- here arthur start and be about to interrupt but she stop he do not start arthur who can read the future stranger thing have happen and if i say such a thing should come about in we case then remember i implore you that in that future lie the answer to the puzzle of the world and turn you eye to it as to the horizon beyond which you will find I wait for you and not only I but all that you have ever love only dear try to be a good man and love I always he look at she in wonder angelum he say what have make you so different from other woman with all whom i have know love be a affair of passion or amusement of the world and the day but yours gaze towards heaven and look to find its real utterance in the stillness of eternity to be love by you my dear would be worth a century of sorrow at last the moment come as all moment good and bad must come to pigott who be cry he give a hug and a five-pound note to aleck a pat on the head to philip who could not look he in the face a shake of the hand and to angelum who bravely smile into he eye -- a long last kiss but when the cruel wheel begin to crunch upon the gravel the great tear well to she eye blot he from sight blindly she make she way up to she room and throw herself upon the bed let she unrestrained sorrow loose feeling that she be indeed desolate and alone chapter xxxi when angelum be still quite a child the permanent inhabitant of sherborne lane king william street in the city of london use to note a very pretty girl of small statue and modest way pass out -- every evening after the city gentleman have lock up they office and go home -- from the quiet of the lane into the roar and rush of the city this young girl be mildr jame the only daughter of a struggle a very struggling city doctor and she daily mission be to go to the cheap market and buy the provision that be to last the sherborne lane household -lrb- for she father live in the same room that he practice in -rrb- for the ensue twenty-four hour the world be a hard place for poor mildr in those day of provision hunting when so little money have to pay for so many necessaries and to provide also for the luxury that be necessaries to she invalid mother some year later when she be a sweet maiden of

and tell mr carr that i will be with he in a minute it will never do to see a new patient in this coat mildr depart and glide into the gloomy consulting-room like a sunbeam deliver she message to the old gentleman who appear to be in some pain and prepare to return do not go away almost shout the aged patient i have crush my finger in a door and it hurt most confoundedly you be something to look at in this hole and distract my attention mildr think to herself that this be a odd way of pay a compliment if it be mean for one but then old gentleman with crushed finger be not give to weigh they word be you dr jame ' daughter he ask presently yes sir ugh i have live most of my life in sherborne lane and never see anything half so pretty in it before confound this finger at this moment the doctor himself arrive and want to dismiss mildred but mr carr who be a headstrong old gentleman vow that no one else should hold he injured hand whilst it be dress and so she stay just long enough for he to fall as completely in love with she shell-like face be though he have be twenty instead of nearly seventy now mr carr be not remarkable for good look and in addition to have see out so many summer have also bury two wife it will therefore be clear that he be scarcely the suitor that a lovely girl conscious of capacity for deep affection would have select of she own free will but on the other hand he be honest and kind - heart and what be more to the point perhaps the wealthiest wine - merchant in the city mildr resist as long as she could but want be a hard master and a father 's argument be difficult to answer and in the end she marry he and what be more make he a good and faithful wife she never have any cause to regret it for he be kindness itself towards she and when he die some five year afterwards have no child of he own he leave she sole legatee of all he enormous fortune bind up by no restriction as to re-marriage about this time also she father die and she be leave as much alone in the world as it be possible for a young and pretty woman possess in she own right between twenty and thirty thousand a year to be needless to say mr carr be thenceforth one of the catch of she generation but nobody could catch she though she alone know how many have try once she make a list of all the people who have propose to she it include amongst other a bishop two peer three member of parliament no less than five army officer a american and a dissent clergyman it be perfectly marvellous my dear she say to she companion agatha terry how fond people be of twenty thousand a year and yet they all say that they love I for myself that be all except the dissenter who want I to help to ` feed he flock ' and i like he the best of the lot because he be the honestest mr carr have a beautiful house in grosvenor square a place in leicestershire where she hunt a little a place in the isle of wight that she rarely visit and lastly a place at madeira where she live for nearly half the year there never have be a breath of scandal against she name nor have she give cause for any as for loving she would say the only thing she love be beetle and mummy for she be a clever naturalist and a faithful student of the lore of the ancient egyptian the beetle she would explain have be the connect link between the two science since beetle have lead she to scarabaeus and scarabaeus to the human husk with which they be to be find but this statement though amusing be not strictly accurate as she have in reality contract the taste from she late husband who have leave she a large collection of egyptian antiquity i do adore a mummy she would say i be small enough in mind and body already but it make I feel inch smaller and i like to measure my own diminutiveness she be not much of a reader life be she declare too short to waste in study but when she do take up a book it be generally of a nature that most woman of she class would have call stiff and then she could read it without go to sleep in addition to these occupation mr carr have have various craze at different stage of she widowhood which have now endure for some five year she have travel she have gone-in for art once she have speculate a little but find that for a woman it be a losing game she be too shrewd to continue this last pastime but she always come back to she beetle and she mummy still with all she money she place she offer of marriage and she self-made occupation mildr carr be essentially a weary woman sink deep in ease and sate with she life within that little frame of hers there beat a great active heart ever urge she onward towards a unknown end she would describe herself as a ill - regulate woman and the description be not without justice for she do not possess that placid even mind which be so necessary to the comfort of english lady and which enable many of they to bury a husband or a lover as composedly as they take he she would have give world to be able to fall in love with some one to fill up the daily emptiness of she existence with another 's joy and grief but she _ could _ not man pass before she in endless procession all sort and condition of they and for the most part be anxious to marry she but they might as well have be a string of wax doll for aught she could care about they to she eye they be nothing more than a succession of frock-coat and tall hat full of shine and emptiness signify nothing for they opinion too and that of the society which they help to form she have a most complete and wrong - head contempt she care nothing for the ordinary law of social life and be prepare to break through they on emergency as a wasp break through a spider 's web perhaps she guess that a good deal of break would be forgive to the owner of such a lovely face and more than twenty thousand a year with all this she be extremely observant and possess unknown to herself great power of mind and great though dormant capacity for passion in short this little woman with the baby face smile and serene as the blue sky that hide the gathering hurricane be rather odder than the majority of she sex which be perhaps say a great deal one day about a week before arthur depart from the abbey house agatha terry be sit in the blue drawing-room in the house in grosvenor square when mr carr come in almost at a run slam the door behind she and plumped herself down in a chair with a sigh of relief agatha give order to pack up we will go to madeira by the next boat goodness gracious mildr across that dreadful bay again and just think how hot it will be and the beginning of the season too now agatha i be go and there be a end of it so it be no use argue you can stay here and give a series of ball and dinner if you like nonsense dear I give party indeed and you at madeira why it be just as though you ask ruth to entertain the reaper without naomus i 'll go and give the order but i do hope that it will be calm why do you want to go now i 'll tell you lord minster have be propose to I again and announce he intention of go on do so till i accept he you know he have just get into the cabinet so he have celebrate the event by ask I to marry he for the third time poor fellow perhaps he be very fond of you not a bit of it he be fond of my good look and my money i will tell you the substance of he speech this morning he stand like this with he hand in he pocket and say ' i be now a cabinet minister it be a good thing that a cabinet minister should have somebody presentable to sit at the head of he table you be presentable i appreciate beauty when i have time to think about it i observe that you be beautiful i be not very well-off for my position you on the other hand be immensely rich with you money i can in time become prime minister it be consequently evidently to my advantage that you should marry I and i have sacrifice a very important appointment in order to come and settle it ' agatha laugh and how do you answer he in he own style ` lord minster ' i say ' i be for the third time honor by you flattering proposal but i have no wish to ornament you table no desire to expose my beauty to you perpetual admiration and no ambition to advance you political career i do not love you and i have rather become the wife of a crossing-sweeper that i loved than that of a member of the government for whom i have _ every _ respect but no affection ' ` as the wife of a crossing-sweeper it be probable ' he answer ` that you would be miserable as my wife you would certainly be admire and powerful and consequently happy ' ` lord minster ' i say ` you have study human nature but very superficially if you have not learn that it be better for a woman to be miserable with the man she love than admire powerful and consequently happy with one who have no attraction for she ' ` you remark be interesting ' he reply ` but i think that there be something paradoxical about it i must be go now as i have only five minute to get to westminster but i will think it over and answer it when we renew we conversation which i propose to do very shortly ' and he be go before i could get in another word but why should that make you go to madeira because my dear if i do not so sure as i be a living woman that man will tire I out and marry I and i dislike he and do not want to marry he i have a strong will but he be of iron and so it come to pass that the name of mr carr miss terry and three servant appear upon the passenger list of messr donald currie & co 's royal mail steamship _ warwick castle _ due to sail for madeira and the cape port on the 14th of June chapter xxxii arthur arrive in town in a melancholy condition he be a temperament peculiarly liable to suffer from attack of depression and he have with some excuse a sufficiently severe one on he now do what he would he could not for a single hour free he mind from the sick longing to see or hear from angelum that in addition to the mental distress it occasion he amount almost to a physical pain after two or three day of lounge about he club -- for he be in no mood for go out -- he begin to feel that this sort of thing be intolerable and that it be absolutely necessary for he to go somewhere or do something it so happen that just after he have come to this decision he overhear two man who be sit at the next table to he in the club dining-room talking of the island of madeira and speaking of it as a charming place he accept this as a omen and determine that to madeira he would go and indeed the place would suit he as well as any other to get through a portion of he year of probation in and whilst afford a complete change of scene would not be too far from england and so it come to pass that on the morrow arthur find himself in the office of messr donald currie for the purpose of book he berth in the vessel that be due to sail on the 14th there he be inform by the very affable clerk who assist he to choose he cabin that the vessel be unusually empty and that up to the present time berth have be take for only five lady and two of they jewess however the clerk add by way of consolation this one point to mr carr 's name on the list be as good as a cargo and he whistle expressively what do you mean ask arthur he curiosity slightly excited i mean -- my word here she come at that moment the swing door of the office be push open and there come through they one of the sweetest daintiest little woman arthur have ever see she be no longer quite young she might be eight and twenty or thirty but on the other hand maturity have but add to the charm of youth she have big brown eye that arthur think could probably look languish if they choose and that even in repose be full of expression a face soft and bloom as a peach and round as a baby 's surmount by a quantity of nut-brown hair the very sweetest mouth the lip rather full and just show a line of pearl and lastly what look rather odd on such a infantile countenance a firm square and very determine if very diminutive chin for the rest it be difficult to say which be the most perfect she figure or she dress all of which of course have little interest for arthur but what do rather startle he be she voice when she speak from such a woman one would naturally have expect a voice of a corresponding nature namely one of the soft and murmur order but hers on the contrary though sweet be decide and clear as a bell and with a peculiar ring in it that he would have recognize amongst a thousand other on she entrance arthur step on one side i have come to say she say with a slight bow of recognition to the clerk that i have change my mind about my berth instead of the starboard deck cabin i should like to have the port i think that it will be cooler at this time of year and also will you please make arrangement for three horse i be excessively sorry mr carr the clerk answer but the port cabin be engage -- in fact this gentleman have just take it oh in that case -- with a little blush -- there be a end of the question by no means interrupted arthur it be a matter of perfect indifference to I where i go i beg that you will take it oh thank you you be very good but i could not think of rob you of you cabin i must implore you to do so rather than there should be any difficulty i will go below and then address the clerk be so kind as to change the cabin i owe you many thanks for you courtesy say mr carr with a little curtsey arthur take off he hat then we will consider that settle good morning or perhaps i should say _ au revoir _ and bow again he leave the office what be that gentleman 's name mr carr ask when he be go here it be madam on the list ` arthur preston heigham passenger to madeira ' arthur preston heigham mr carr say to herself as she make she way down to she carriage in fenchurch street arthur be pretty and preston be pretty but i do not much like heigham at any rate there be no doubt about he be a gentleman i wonder what he be go to madeira for he have a interesting face i think i be glad we be go to be fellow-passenger the two day that remain to he in town arthur spend in make he preparation for departure get money buy after the manner of young englishman start on a voyage to foreign part a large and fearfully sharp hunting-knife as though madeira be the home of wild beast and lay in a stock of various other article of a useless description such as impenetrable sun-helmet and leather coat the boat be to sail at noon on Friday and on the Thursday evening he leave paddington by the mail that reach dartmouth about midnight on the pier he and one or two other fellow-passenger find a boat wait to take they to the great vessel that paint a dull gray lay still and solemn in the harbor as they be row up to she very different from the active living thing that she be destine to become within the next twenty-four hour the tide ebb past she iron side the fresh strong smell of the sea the tall mast point skywards like gigantic finger the chime of the bell upon the bridge the sleepy steward and the stuffy cabin be all a pleasant variation from the every-day monotony of existence and contribute towards the conclusion that life be still partially worth live even when it could not be live with angelum indeed so much be we the creature of circumstance and so liable to be influence by surroundings that arthur who a few hour before have be plunge into the depths of depression turn into he narrow berth after a tremendous struggle with the sheet -- which steward arrange on a principle incomprehensible to landlubber and probably only partially understand by themselves -- with considerable satisfaction and a pleasurable sense of excitement the next morning or rather the earlier part of it he devote when he be not think about angelum to arrange he goods and chattel in he small domain to examine the lovely scenery of dartmouth harbor -- the sight of which be enough to make any outward-bound individual bitterly regret he determination to quit he native land -- and to inspect the outward man of he fellow-passenger with that icy stolidity which characterize the true-born briton but the great event of the morning be the arrival of the mail-train bring the bag destine for various african port loose letter for the passenger and a motley contingent of the passenger themselves amongst these latter he have no difficulty in recognize the two jewess of whom the clerk in the office have speak who be accompany by individual presumably they husband and very remarkable for the splendor of they diamond stud and the dirtiness of they nail the only other specimen of saloon-passenger womankind that he could see be a pretty black-eyed girl of about eighteen who be as he afterwards discover go out under the captain 's care to be a governess at the cape and who to judge from the intense melancholy of she countenance do not particularly enjoy the prospect but with the exception of some heavy baggage that be be work up from a cargo-boat by the donkey-engine and a luxurious cane-chair on the deck that bear she name no sign be there of mr carr presently the purser send round the head-steward a gentleman whom arthur mistook for the first mate so smart be he uniform to collect the letter and it wring he not a little to think that he alone could send none the bell sound to warn all not sail to hurry to they boat but still there be nothing to be see of he acquaintance of the office and to speak the truth he be just a little disappointed for what he have see of she have pique he curiosity and make he anxious to see more i can not wait any longer he hear the captain say she must come on by the _ kinfaun _ it be full twelve o'clock and the last rope be be loose from the mooring ting-ting go the engine-room bell thud-thud start the great screw that would not stop again for so many restless hour the huge vessel shudder throughout she frame like a awaken sleeper and grow quick with life forge a inch or two a-head next a quartermaster come with two man to hoist up the gangway when suddenly a boat shot alongside and hook on amongst the occupant of which arthur have no difficulty in recognize mr carr who sit laugh like pleasure at the helm the other occupant of the boat who be not laugh he guess to be she servant and the lady who figure on the passenger-list as miss terry a stout solemn-looking person in spectacles now then agatha call out mr carr from the stern-sheet be quick and jump up my dear mildr i can not go up there i can not indeed why the thing 's move but you must go up or else be pull up with a rope here i will show the way and move down the boat she spring boldly as it rise with the swell into the stalwart arm of the sailor who be wait on the gangway landing-stage and thence run up the step to the deck very well i be go to madeira i do not know what you be go to do but you must make up you mind quick can not hold on much longer mum say the boatman she be get way on now come on mum i will not let you in say the man of the ladder seductively oh dear oh dear what shall i do groan miss terry wring the hand that be not employ in hold on john call mrs carr to a servant who be behind miss terry and look considerably alarm do not stand there like a fool put miss terry on to that ladder mr carr be evidently accustom to be obey for thus admonish john seize the struggle and shriek miss terry and bear she to the edge of the boat where she be catch by two sailor and amidst the cheer of excited passenger fairly drag on to the deck oh mr carr say the chief officer reproachfully when miss terry have be satisfactorily deposit on a bench you be late again you be late last voyage not at all mr thompson i hate spending longer than be necessary aboard ship so when the train get in i take a boat and go for a row in the harbor i know that you would not go without I oh yes we should have mr carr the skipper hear about it because he wait for you before well here i be and i promise that i will not do it again mr thompson laugh and pass on at this moment mr carr perceive arthur and bow to he they fall into conversation about the scenery through which the boat be pass on she way to the open sea before very long indeed as soon as the vessel begin to rise and fall upon the swell this talk be interrupt by a voice from the seat where miss terry have be place mildr it say i do wish you would not come to sea i be begin to feel ill and no wonder if you will insist upon come up ladder head downward where 's john he will help you to you cabin the deck one next to mine but john have vanish with a parcel mildr send some one quick i beg of you remark miss terry in the solemn tone of one who feel that a crisis be approach i can not see anybody except a very dirty sailor permit I say arthur step to the rescue you be very kind but she can not walk i know she way she have get to the stage when she must be carry can you manage she i think so reply arthur if you do not mind hold she leg and provide that the vessel do not roll and with a effort he hoist miss terry baby-fashion into he arm and stagger off with she towards the indicate cabin mr carr as suggest hold the lower limb of the prostrate lady presently she begin to laugh if you only know how absurd we look she say do not make I laugh answer arthur puff for miss terry be by no means light or i shall drop she if you do young man ejaculate he apparently unconscious burden with wonderful energy i will never forgive you a remark the suddenness of which so startle he that he very nearly do thank you now lay she quite flat please she will not get up again till we drop anchor at madeira if i live so long murmur the invalid arthur now make he bow and depart wonder how two woman so dissimilar as mr carr and miss terry come to be live together as it be a piece of curiosity that the reader may share perhaps it have better be explain miss terry be a middle-aged relative of mr carr 's late husband who have by a series of misfortune be leave quite destitute she distress have come to the knowledge of mildr carr she with the kind - hearted promptitude that distinguish she at once come to she aid pay she debt and bring she to she own house to stay where she have remain ever since under the title of companion these two woman live thus together have nothing whatsoever in common save that miss terry take some reflect interest in beetle as for travel have be bring up and live in the same house of the same county town until she reach the age of forty-five it be as may be imagine altogether obnoxious to she indeed it be more than doubtful if she retain any clear impression whatsoever of the place she visit a set of foreign hole as she would call they contemptuously miss terry be in short neither clever nor strong mind but so long as she could be in the company of she beloved mildred whom she regard with mingled reverence and affection she be perfectly happy oddly enough this affection be reciprocate and there probably be nobody in the world for whom mr carr care so much as she cousin by marriage agatha terry and yet it would be impossible to imagine two woman more dissimilar not long after they have leave dartmouth the afternoon set in dull and towards evening the sea freshen sufficiently to send most of the passenger below leave those who remain to be finally disperse by the penetrate drizzle that be generally to be meet with off the english coast arthur leave alone on the heave deck survey the scene and think it very desolate around be a gray waste of toss water illumine here and there by the setting ray of a angry sun above a wild and windy sky with not even a sea-gull in all its space and in the far distance a white and fading line which be the shore of england faint it grow and fainter yet and as it disappear he think of angelum and a yearning sorrow fall upon he when he wonder sadly should he again look into she eye and hold that proud beauty in he arm what fate await they in the future that stretch before they dim as the darken ocean and more uncertain alas he could not tell he only feel that it be very bitter to be part thus from she to whom have be give he whole heart 's love to know that every fleeting moment widen a breach already far too wide and not to know if it would again be narrow or if this farewell would be the last then he think if it should be the last if she should die or desert he what would he life be worth to he a consciousness within he answer nothing and in a degree he conclusion be right for although it be fortunately not often in the power of any single passion to render life altogether worthless it be certain that when it strike in youth there be no sickness so sore as that of the heart no sorrow more keen and no evil more lasting than those connect with its disappointment and its grief for other sorrow life have salve and consolation but a noble and enduring passion be not all of this world and to cure its sting we must look to something beyond this world 's quackery other grief can find sympathy and expression and become absorb little by little in the variety of love 's issue but love as it be and should be understand -- not the faint ghost that array itself in steal robe and say i be love but love the strong and the immortal the passkey to the happy sky the angel cipher we read but can not understand -- such love as this and there be none other true can find no full solace here not even in its earthly satisfaction for still it beat against its mortal bar and rend the heart that hold it still strive like a meteor flaming to its central star or a new loose spirit seek the presence of its god to pass hence with that kindred soul to the inner heaven whence it come there to be wholly mingled with its other life and clothe with a divine identity : -- there to satisfy the aspiration that now vaguely throb within they fleshly wall with the splendor and the peace and the full measure of the eternal joy it know await its coming and be it not a first-fruit of this knowledge that the thought of those who be plunge into the fire of a pure devotion fly upwards as surely as the spark nothing but the dross the grosser earthly part be purge away by they ever-chastening sorrow which be in truth a discipline for finer soul for do there ever yet live the man or woman who loving truly have suffer and the fire burn out have not rise phoenix-like from they ash purer and better and hold in the heart a bright undying hope never for these have walk bare-footed upon the holy ground it be the flame from the altar that have purge they and leave they own light within and surely this hold also good of those who have love and lose of those who have be scorn or betray of the suffering army that cry aloud of the empty bitterness of life and dare not hope beyond they do not understand that have once love truly it be not possible that they should altogether lose : that there be to they pain and the dry-rot of they hope as to everything else in nature a end object shall the soul be immortal and its best essence but a thing of air shall the one think by day and the one dream by night the ethereal star which guide we across life 's mirage and which will still shine serene at the moment of we fall from the precipice of time : shall this alone amidst all that make we what we be be choose out to see corruption to be cast off and forget in the grave never there by the workings of a providence we can not understand that mighty germ await fruition there too shall we know the wherefore of we sorrow at which sad-eyed we now so often wonder : there shall we kiss the rod that smite we and learn the glorious use and pluck the glowing fruit of a affliction that on earth fill we with such sick longing and such a ache pain let the long-suffering reader forgive these page of speculative write for the subject be a tempting one and full of interest for we mortal indeed it may chance that if he or she be more than five-and-twenty these line may even have be read without impatience for there be many who have the memory of a lose angelum hide away somewhere in the record of they past and who be fain in the breathing space of they life to dream that they will find she wander in that wide eternity where all human barrier fall all human relation end and love cease to be a crime chapter xxxiii the morning after the vessel leave dartmouth bring with it lovely weather brisk and clear with a fresh breeze that just top the glitter swell with white there be however a considerable roll on the ship and those poor wretch who for they sin be give to sea-sickness be not yet happy presently arthur observe the pretty black-eyed girl -- poor thing she do not look very pretty now -- creep on to the deck and attempt to walk about a effort which promptly result in a fall into the scupper he pick she up and ask if she would not like to sit down but she faintly decline say that she do not mind fall so long as she could walk a little -- she do not feel so sick when she walk under these circumstance he could hardly do less than help she which he do in the only way at all practicable with one so weak namely by walk she about on he arm in the midst of he interesting peregrination he observe mr carr gaze out of she deck cabin window look he think pale but sweetly pretty and rather cross when that lady see that she be observe she pull the curtain with a jerk and vanish shortly after this arthur 's companion vanish too circumstance over which she have no control compelling she and arthur himself sit down rather relieved but he be destine that day to play knight-errant to lady in distress presently mr carr 's cabin-door open and that lady herself emerge therefrom hold on to the side-rail he have just begin to observe how charmingly she be dress when some qualm seize she and she return to re-enter the cabin but the door have swung-to with the roll of the vessel and she could not open it impel by a agony of doubt she fly to the side and to he horror spring with a single bind on to the broad rail that surmount the bulwark net and remain seat there hold only to a little rope that hang down from the awning-chain the ship which be at the moment roll pretty heavily have just reach the full angle of she windward roll and be prepare for a heavy swing to leeward arthur see that mr carr would in a few seconds certainly be fling out to sea rush promptly forward and lift she from the rail it be none too soon for next moment down the great ship go with a lurch into a trough of the sea hurl he with she in he arm up against the bulwark and to say truth hurt he considerably but if he expect any thanks for this exploit he be destine to be disappoint for no sooner have he set he lovely burden down than she make use of she freedom to stamp upon the deck how could you be so foolish say he in another moment you would have be fling out to sea and pray mr heigham she answer in a cutting and sarcastic voice be that my business or you own surely it would have be time enough for you to take a liberty when i ask you to jump over after I arthur draw himself up to he full height and look dignified -- he could look dignified when he like i do not quite understand you mr carr he say with a little bow what i do i do to save you from go overboard next time that such a little adventure come in my way i hope for my own sake that it may concern a lady possess of less rudeness and more gratitude and then glare defiance at each other they separate she march off with all the dignity of a offended queen to the sweet seclusion that a cabin grant whilst he withdraw moodily to a bench comfort however not a little by the thought that he have give mr carr a roland for she oliver mr carr 's bind on to the bulwark have be the last effort of that prince of demon sea-sickness rend she ere he leave when the occasion for remain there have thus pass away she soon tire of she cabin and of listen to the inarticulate moan of she beloved agatha who be a most faithful subject of the fiend one who would never desert he manner so long as he could roll the tiniest wave and sally forth take up she position in the little society of the ship but between arthur and herself there be no attempt at reconciliation each feel they wrong to be as eternal as the rock at luncheon they look unutterable thing from different side of the table go in to dinner she cut he with the sweetest grace and on the follow morning they naturally remove to situation as remote from each other as the cubic area of a mail steamer would allow pretty very much so but ill-mannered not quite a lady i should say reflect arthur to himself with a superior smile i detest he say mr carr to herself at least i think i do but how neatly he put I down there be no doubt about he be a gentleman though insufferably conceited these uncharitable thought rankle in they respective mind about 12 be what then be arthur 's disgust on descend a little late to luncheon that day to be inform by the resplendent chief-steward -- who for some undiscovered reason always remind he of pharaoh 's butler -- that the captain have alter the place at table and that this alteration involve he be place next to none other than mr carr everybody be already seat and it be too late to protest at any rate for that meal so he have to choose between submission and go without he luncheon be extremely hungry he decide for the first alternative and reluctantly bring himself to a halt next he avowed enemy but surprise like sorrow come in battalion a fact that he very distinctly realize when have help himself to some chicken he hear a clear voice at he side address he by name mr heigham say the voice i have not yet thank you for you kindness to miss terry i be commission to assure you that she be very grateful since she be prevent by circumstance from do so herself i be much gratified he reply stiffly but really i do nothing to deserve thanks and if i have he add with a touch of sarcasm i should not have expect any oh what a cynic you must be she answer with a ripple laugh as though woman helpless as they be be not always thankful for the tiniest attention do not the pretty girl with the black eye thank you for you attention yesterday for instance do the lady with the brown eye thank I for my attention -- my very necessary attention -- yesterday for instance he answer somewhat mollify for the laugh and the voice would have thaw a human icicle and with all he fault arthur be not a icicle no she do not she defer do so in order that she might do it better it be very kind of you to help I and i daresay that you save my life and i -- i beg you pardon for be so cross but be sea-sick always make I cross even to those who be kindest to I do you forgive I please forgive I i really be quite unhappy when i think of my behavior and mr carr shoot a glance at he that would have clear the north-west passage for a man-of-war please do not apologize he say humbly i really have nothing to forgive i be aware that i take a liberty as you put it but i think that i be justify by the circumstance it be not generous of you mr heigham to throw my word into my tooth i have forget all about they but i will set you want of feeling against my want of gratitude and we kiss and be friend i can assure you mr carr that there be nothing in the world i should like better when shall the ceremony come off now you be laugh at I and actually interpret what i say literally as though the english language be not full of figure of speech by that phrase and she blush a little -- that be she cheek take a deeper shade of coral -- i mean that we would not cut each other after lunch you bring I from the seventh heaven of expectation into a very prosaic world but i accept you term whatever they be i be conquer for exactly half a hour but let we talk sense be you go to stop at madeira yes for how long i do not know till i get tire of it i suppose be it nice madeira charming i live there half the year ah then i can well believe that it be charming mr heigham you be pay compliment i think that you look above that sort of thing in the presence of misfortune and of beauty -- here he bow -- all man be reduce to the same level talk to I from behind a curtain or let I turn my back upon you and you may expect to hear work-a-day prose -- but face to face i fear that you must put up with compliment a neat way of say that you have have enough of I you compliment be two-edged good-bye for the present and she rise leave arthur -- well rather amuse after this they see a good deal of each other -- that be to say they converse together for at least thirty minute out of every sixty during a average day of fourteen hour and in the course of these conversation she learn nearly everything about he except he engagement to angelum and she shrewdly guess at that or rather at some kindred circumstance in he career arthur on the other hand learn quite everything about she for she life be open as the day and would have bear repeat in the _ time _ newspaper but nevertheless he find it extremely interesting you must be a busy woman he say one morning when he have be listen to one of she rattle account of she travels and gaiety sprinkle over as it be with the shrewd remark and illumine by the keen insight into character that make she talk so charming busy no one of the idlest in the world and a very worthless one to boot she answer with a little sigh then why do not you change you life it be in you own hand if ever anybody 's be do you think so i doubt if anybody 's life be in they own hand we follow a appoint course if we do not it would be impossible to understand why so many sensible clever people make such a complete mess of they existence they can not do it from choice at any rate you have not make a mess of yours and you appoint course seem a very pleasant one yes and the sea beneath we be very smooth but it have be rough before and will be rough again -- there be no stability in the sea as to make a mess of my life who know what i may not accomplish in that way prosperity can not shine down fear of the future it only throw it into darker relief myself i be afraid of the future -- it be unknown and to I what be unknown be not magnificent but terrible the present be enough for I i do not like speculation and i never love the dark and as they talk madeira in all its summer glory loom up out of the ocean for they have pass the deserta and porto santo by night and for a while they be lose in the contemplation of one of the most lovely and verdant scene that the world can show before they have well examine it however the vessel have drop she anchor and be surround by boat full of custom-house official boat full of diving boy of vegetable of wicker chair and table of parrot fruit and other article too numerous to mention as they say in the auctioneer 's catalogue and they know that it be time to go ashore well it have be a pleasant voyage say mr carr i be glad you be not go on so be i you will come and see I to-morrow will you not look there be my house and she point to a large white house opposite leeuw rock that have a background of glossy foliage and command a view of the sea if you come i will show you my beetle and if you care to come next day i will show you my mummy and if i come the next what will you show I so often as you may come she say with a little tremor in she voice i shall find something to show you then they shake hand and take they respective way she -- together with the unfortunate miss terry who look like a resuscitate corpse -- on to the steam-launch that be wait for she and he in the boat belong to mile ' hotel chapter xxxiv a minute or two after the boat in which arthur be be pilot to the shore under the guidance of the manager of mile ' hotel have leave the side of the vessel mr carr 's steam-launch shot up alongside of they its brass-work gleaming in the sunlight like polished gold on the deck near the little wheel stand mr carr herself and by she side she martial cloak around she lay miss terry still as any log mr heigham say mr carr in a voice that sound across the water like a silver bell i forget that you will not be able to find you way to my place by yourself to-morrow so i will send down a bullock-car to fetch you you have to travel about with bullock here you know good-bye and before he could answer the launch 's head be round and she be tear through the swell at the rate of fourteen knot that be she private launch say the manager of the hotel to arthur it be the quickest in the island and she always go at full steam she must have come some way round to tell you that too there be she place over there mr carr come here every year do she not oh yes every year but she be very early this year we season do not begin yet you know she be a great blessing to the place she give so much away to the poor peasant at first she use to come with old mr carr and a wonderful nurse they say she make to the old gentleman till he die do she entertain much not as a rule but sometimes she give great ball splendid affair and a series of dinner-party that be the talk of the island she hardly ever go out anywhere which make the lady in the place angry but i believe that they all go to she ball and dinner mostly she spend she time up in the hill collect butterfly and beetle she have get the most wonderful collection of egyptian curiosity up at the house there too though why she keep they here instead of in england i be sure i do not know she husband begin the collection when he be a young man and collect all he life and she have go on with it since i wonder that she have not marry again well it can not be for want of ask if half of what they say be true for accord to that every single gentleman under fifty who have be at madeira during the last five year have have a try at she but she would not look at one of they but of course that be gossip -- and here we be at the landing-place sit steady sir those fellow will pull the boat up have it not be for the pre-occupied and uncomfortable state of he mind that take the flavor out of all that he do and persistently thrust a skeleton amidst the flower of every landscape arthur should by rights have enjoy himself very much at madeira to live in one of the lofty room of mile ' hotel protect by thick wall and cool green shutter to feel that you be enjoy all the advantage of a warm climate without its drawback and that too however much people in england may be shiver -- which they mostly do all the year round -- be in itself a luxury and so it be if the day be hot to dine chiefly off fish and fruit and such fruit and then to exchange the dining-room for the cool portico with the sea-breeze sweep through it and pipe in hand to sink into a slumber that even the diabolical shriek of the parrot tie by the leg in a line below be powerless to disturb or if you be energetic -- i speak of madeira energy -- you may stroll down the little terraced walk under the shade of you landlord 's vine and contemplate the grow mass of greenery that in this heavenly island make a garden you can do more than this even for have penetrate through the brilliant flower-bed and recruit exhaust nature under a fig-tree you can engage in true english fashion in a game of lawn - tennis which do you will again seek the shade of the creep vine or spread banana and in a springy hammock take you well - earn repose all these thing be the quintessence of luxury so much so that he who have once enjoy they will long to turn lotos-eater forget the painful and laborious past and live and die at mile ' hotel oh madeira gem of the ocean land of pine-clad mountain that foolish man love to climb valley where wise one much prefer to rest and of smell that both alike abhor madeira of the sunny sky and azure sea land flow with milk and honey and overflow with population if only you belong to the country on which you depend for a livelihood what a perfect place you would be and how poetical one could grow about you a consummation which fortunately for my reader the recollection of the open drain the ill-favoured priest and portuguese official effectually prevent on the follow morning at twelve punctually arthur be inform that the conveyance have arrive to fetch he he go down and be quite appal at its magnificence it be sledge-like in form build to hold four and mount on wooden runner that glide over the round pebble with which the madeira street be pave with scarcely a sound and as smoothly as though they run on ice the chariot as arthur always call it afterwards be build of beautiful wood and line and curtain throughout with satin whilst the motive power be supply by two splendidly harness white oxen two native servant handsome young fellow dress in a kind of white uniform accompany the sledge and salute arthur on he appearance with much reverence it take he however some time before he could make up he mind to embark in a conveyance that remind he of the description of cleopatra 's galley and smell more sweet but finally he get in and off he start feel that he be the observe of all observer and follow by at least a score of beggar each afflict with some peculiar and dreadful deformity or disease and thus in triumphal guise they slide down the quaint and narrow street squeeze in for the sake of shade between a double line of tall green-shuttered house over the bridge that span the vast open drain past the ochre-coloured cathedral down the promenade edge with great magnolia-tree that make the air heavy with they perfume and where twice a week the band play and the portuguese official march up and down in all the pomp and panoply of office onward through the dip where the town lope downward to the sea then up again through more street and past a stretch of dead wall after which the chariot wheel through some iron gate and he be in fairyland one each side of the carriage-way there spread a garden calculate to make english horticulturist gnash they tooth with envy through the bower of which he could catch peep of green turf and of the blue sea beyond here the cabbage palm shoot its smooth and lofty trunk high into the air there the bamboo wave its leafy ostrich plume and all about and around the soil be spread like a indian shawl with many a gorgeous flower and many a splendid fruit arthur thought of the garden of eden and the isle of the blest and whilst he eye accustom to nothing better than we poor english rose be still fix upon the blaze mass of pomegranate flower and he sens be fill with the sweet scent of orange and magnolia bloom the ox halt before the portico of a stately building white-walled and green-shuttered like all madeira house then the slave of the chariot assist he to descend whilst other slave of the door bow he up the step and he stand in a great cool hall dazzling dark after the brilliancy of the sunlight and here no slave await he but the princess of this fair domain none other than mildred carr herself clothe all in summer white and with a smile of welcome in she eye i be so glad that you have come how do you like madeira do you find it very hot i have not see much of it yet but this place be lovely it be like fairyland and i believe that you he add with a bow be the fairy queen compliment again mr heigham well i be the sleep beauty last time so one may as well be a queen for a change i wonder what you will call I next let I see : shall we say -- a angel mr heigham stop talk nonsense and come into the drawing-room he follow she laughing into a apartment that from its noble proportion and beauty might fairly be call magnificent its ceiling be panel with work timber and its floor beautifully inlay with wood of various hue whilst the wall be thickly cover with picture chiefly sea-piece and all by good master he have however but little time to look about he for a door open at the further end of the room and admit the portly person of miss terry array in a gigantic sun hat and a pair of green spectacles she seem very hot and hold in she hand a piece of brown paper inside of which something be violently scratch i have catch he at last she say though he do avoid I all last year i have catch he good gracious catch what ask arthur with great interest what why he that mildr want she reply regardless of grammar in she excitement just look at he he be beautiful thus admonish arthur carefully undo the brown paper and next moment start back with a exclamation and begin to dance about with a enormous red beetle grind its jaw into he finger oh keep still do pray call miss terry in alarm do not shake he off on any account or we shall lose he for the want of a little patience as i do when he bite my finger last year if you 'll keep he quite still he will not leave go and i 'll ring for john to bring the chloroform bottle arthur feeling that the interest of science be matter of a higher importance than the well-being of he finger obey she injunction to the letter hang he arm -lrb- and the beetle -rrb- over the back of a chair and look the picture of silent misery quite still if you please mr heigham quite still be not the animal 's tenacity interesting no doubt to you but i hope you pet beetle be not poisonous for he be gnash he pincers together inside my finger never mind we will treat you with caustic presently mildr do not laugh so much but come and look at he he be lovely john please be quick with that chloroform bottle if this sort of thing happen often i do not think that i should collect beetle from choice at least not large one groan arthur oh dear laugh mr carr i never see anything so absurd i do not know which look most savage you or the beetle do not make all that noise mildr you will frighten he and if once he fly we shall never catch he in this big room here fortunately for arthur the servant arrive with the require bottle into which the ferocious insect be triumphantly stopper by miss terry i be so much oblige to you mr heigham you be a true collector for the first and last time mumble arthur who be suck he finger i be infinitely oblige to you too mr heigham say mr carr as soon as she have recover from she fit of laugh the beetle be really very rare it be not even in the british museum but come let we go in to luncheon after that meal be over mr carr ask she guest which he would like to see she collection of beetle or of mummy thank you mr carr i have have enough of beetle for one day so i vote for the mummy very well will you come agatha now mildr you know very well that i will not come just think mr heigham : i only see the nasty thing once and then they give I the creep every night for a fortnight as though those horrid egyptian ` fellah ' be not ugly enough when they be alive without go and make great skin and bone doll of they -- pah agatha persist in believe that my mummy be the body of people like she see in egypt last year and so they be mildr that last one you get be just like the boy who use to drive my donkey at cairo -- the one that die you know -- i believe they just stuff he and say that he be a ancient king ancient king indeed and miss terry depart in search for more beetle now mr heigham you must follow I the museum be not in the house wait i will get a hat in a minute she return and lead the way across a strip of garden to a detach building with a broad verandah face the sea scarcely ten foot from this verandah and on the edge of the sheer precipice be build a low wall lean over which arthur could hear the wavelet lap against the hollow rock two hundred foot beneath he here they stop for a moment to look at the vast expanse of ocean glittering in the sunlight like a sea of molten sapphire and heave as gently as a infant 's bosom it be very lovely the sea move just enough to show that it be only asleep yes but i like it best when it be awake when it blow a hurricane -- it be magnificent the whole cliff shake with the shock of the wave and sometimes the spray drive over in sheet that be when i like to sit here it exhilarate I and make I feel as though i belong to the storm and be strong with its strength come let we go in the entrance to the verandah be from the end that face the house and to gain it they pass under the bough of a large magnolia-tree go through glass door that open outwards into the verandah mr carr enter a room luxuriously furnished as a boudoir this have apparently no other exit and arthur be begin to wonder where the museum could be when she take a tiny bramah key from she watch-chain and with it open a door that be paper and paint to match the wall exactly he follow she and find himself in a stone passage dimly light from above and sloping downward that lead to a doorway graven in the rock on the model of those to be see at the entrance of egyptian temple now mr heigham she say fling open another door and step forward you be about the enter ` the hall of the dead ' he go in and a strange sight meet he gaze they be stand in the center of one side of a vast cave that run right and left at right angle to the passage the light pour into it in great ray from skylight in the roof and by it he could see that it be hollow out of the virgin rock and measure some sixty foot or more in length by about forty wide and thirty high down the length of each side of the great chamber run a line of six polished sphinx which have be hew out of the surround granite on the model of those at carnac whilst the wall be elaborately paint after the fashion of a egyptian sepulchre here osiris hold he dread tribunal on the spirit of the depart here the warrior speed onward in he charge chariot here the harper sweep he sound chord and here again crown with lotus flower those whose corpse lay around hold they joyous festival in the respective centre of each end of the stone chamber a colossus tower in its silent and unearthly grandeur that to the right be a statue of osiri judge of the soul of the dead seat on he judgment-seat and holding in he hand the source and the bent-headed sceptre face he at the other end of the hall be the effigy of the mighty rams he broad brow encircle by that kingly symbol which few in the world 's history have worn so proudly and he noble feature impress those who gaze upon they from age to age with a sense of scornful power and melancholy calm such as do not belong to the countenance of the man of they own time and all around under this solemn guardianship each upon a polished slab of marble and enclose in a case of thick glass lay the corpse of the egyptian dead swathe in numberless wrapping as in they day the true religion that they hold be swathe in symbol and in mummery here be to be find the high-priest of the mystery of isis the astronomer whose lore could read the prophecy that be write in the star the dark magician the renowned warrior the noble the musician with he cymbal by he side the fair maiden who have -- so say she cedar coffin-board -- die of love and sorrow and the royal babe all sleep the same sleep and wait the same awakening this princess must have be well know to joseph that may have be she who rescue mose from the water whilst the babe belong to a dynasty of which the history be already merge into tradition when the great pyramid rear its head on egypt 's fertile plain arthur stand awed at the wonderful sight never before say he in that whisper which we involuntarily use in the presence of the dead do i realize my own insignificance the thought be abruptly put but the word represent well what be pass in he mind what must pass in the mind of any man of culture and sensibility when he gaze on such a sight for in such presence the human mite of to-day fluttering in the sun and walk on the earth that these have know and walk four thousand year ago must indeed learn how infinitely small be the place that he occupy in the tale of thing create and yet if to he culture and sensibility he add religion a word of live hope hover on those dumb lip for where be the spirit of those that lie before he in they eternal silence answer wither lip and tell we what judgment have osiri give and what have thoth write in he awful book four thousand year old human husk if thy dead carcass can last so long what limit be there to the life of the soul it hold do you collect all these ask arthur when he have make a superficial examination of the almost countless treasure of the museum oh no mr carr spend half he long life and more money than i can tell you in get this collection together it be the passion of he life and he have this cave hollow at enormous cost because he think that the air here would be less likely to injure they than the english fog i have add to it however i get those papyrus and that beautiful bust of berenice the one in black marble do you ever see such hair arthur think to himself that he have at that moment some not far from he heart that must be quite as beautiful but he do not say so look there be some curious thing and she open a air-tight case that contain some discolor grain and a few lump of shrivel substance what be they this be wheat take from the inside of a mummy and those be suppose to be hyacinth bulb they come from the mummy-case of that baby prince and i have be tell that they would still grow if plant i can scarcely believe that : the principle of life must be extinct wise people say you know that the principle of life can never become extinct in anything that have once live though it may change its form but i do not pretend to understand these thing however we will settle the question for we will plant one and if it grow i will give the flower to you choose one arthur take the biggest lump from the case and examine it curiously i have not much faith in you hyacinth i be sure that it be dead ah but many thing that seem more dead than that have the strangest way of suddenly break into life she say with a little sigh give it to I i will have it plant and then with a quick glance upward i wonder if you will be here to see it bloom i do not think that either of we will see it bloom in this world he answer laugh and take he leave chapter xxxv have arthur be a little less wrap up in thought of angelum and a little more alive to the fact that be engage or even marry to one woman do not necessarily prevent complication arise with another it might have occur to he to doubt the prudence of the course of life that he be pursue at madeira and as it be it be impossible to acquit he of show a want of knowledge of the world amount almost to folly for he should have know upon general principle that for a man in he position a grizzly bear would have be a safer daily companion than a young and lovely widow and the north pole a more suitable place of residence than madeira but he simply do not think about the matter and as thin ice have a treacherous way of not crack till it suddenly break so outward appearance give he no indication of he danger and yet the fact be full of evil promise for as time go on mildr carr fall headlong in love with he there be no particular reason why she should have do so she might have have score of man handsomer cleverer more distinguish for the ask or rather for the wait to be ask beyond a certain ability of mind a take manner and a sympathetic thoughtful face with that tinge of melancholy upon it which woman sometimes find dangerously interesting there be nothing so remarkable about arthur that a woman possess she manifold attraction and opportunity should unsought and without inquiry lavish she affection upon he there be only one satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon which indeed be a very common one and that be that he be she fate the one man whom she be to love in the world for no woman worth the name ever _ love _ two however many she may happen to marry for this curious difference would appear to exist between the sex the man can attach himself though in vary degree to several woman in the course of a lifetime whilst the woman the true pure-hearted woman can not so adapt she best affection once give like the law of the mede and persian it altereth not mildr feel when she eye first meet arthur 's in donald currie 's office that this man be for she different from all other man though she do not put the thought in word even to herself and from that hour till she embark on board the boat he be continually in she mind a fact which so irritated she that she nearly miss the steamer on purpose only change she mind at the last moment and then when she have help he to carry miss terry to she cabin they hand have accidentally meet and the contact have send a thrill through she frame such as she have never feel before the next development that she could trace be she jealousy of the black-eyed girl whom she see he help about the deck and she consequent rudeness up to she present age mildr carr have never know a single touch of love : she have not even feel particularly interested in she numerous admirer but now this marble galatea have by some freak of fate find a woman 's heart awkwardly enough without the semblance of a supplication on the part of he whom she destine to play pygmalion and when she examine herself by the light of the flame thus newly kindle she shrink back dismay like one who peep over the crater of a volcano commence its fiery work she have believe she heart to be callous to all affection of this nature it have seem as dead as the mummied hyacinth and now it be a living suffer thing and all alight with love she have taste of a new wine and it burn she and be bitter sweet and yet she long for more and thus by slow and sad degree she learn that she life which have for thirty year flow on its quiet way unshadowed by love 's wing must henceforth own he dominion and be a slave to he sorrow and caprice no wonder that she grow afraid but mildr be a woman of keen insight into character and it do not require that she power of observation should be sharpen by the condition of she affection to show she that however deeply she might be in love with arthur heigham he be not one little bit in love with she know the almost irresistible strength of she own beauty and attraction she quickly come to the conclusion -- and it be one that send a cold chill through she -- that there must be some other woman block the path to he heart for some reason or other arthur have never speak to she of angelum either because a man very rarely volunteer information to a woman concern he exist relationship with another of she sex know that to do so would be to depreciate he value in she eye or from a instinctive knowledge that the subject would not be a agreeable one or perhaps because the whole matter be too sacred to he but she on she part be determine to probe he secret to the bottom so one sleepy afternoon when they be sit on the museum verandah about six week after the date of they arrival in the island she take she opportunity mildr be sit or rather half lie in a cane-work chair gaze out over the peaceful sea and arthur look at she thought what a lovely woman she be and wonder what it be that have make she face and eye so much softer and more attractive of late miss terry be also there complain of the heat but presently she move off after a imaginary beetle and they be alone oh by-the-by mr heigham mildr say presently i be go to ask you a question if only i can remember what it be try to remember what it be about ` shoe sealing-wax cabbage or king ' do it come under any of those head ah i remember now if you have add ` queen ' you would not have be far out what i want to ask you -- and she turn she large brown eye full upon he and yawn slightly dear I agatha be right it _ be _ hot well i be wait to give you any information in my power oh to be sure the question well it be a very simple one who be you engage to arthur nearly spring off he chair with astonishment what make you think that i be engage he ask she break into a merry peal of laughter ah if he could have know what that laugh cost she what make I think that you be engage she answer in a tone of raillery why of course you would have be at my foot long ago if it have not be so come do not be reticent i shall not laugh at you what be she like -lrb- generally a woman 's first question about a rival -rrb- be she as good-looking -- well as i be say -- for though you may not think it i have be think good-looking she be quite different from you she be very tall and fair like a angel in a picture you know oh then there be a ` she ' and a ` she like a angel ' very different _ indeed _ from I i should think how nicely i catch you out and she laugh again why do you want to catch I out say arthur on whose ear mr carr 's tone jar he could not tell why feminine curiosity and a natural anxiety to fathom the reason of you sigh that be all but never mind mr heigham you and i shall not quarrel because you be engage to be marry you shall tell I the story when you like for i be sure there be a story -- no not this afternoon the sun have give I a headache and i be go to sleep it off other people 's love-story be very interesting to I the more so because i have reach the respectable age of thirty without be the subject of one myself and again she laugh this time at she own falsehood but when he have go there be no laughter in she eye nothing but tear bitter burn tear agatha say mildr that evening i be sick of this place i want to go to the isle of wight it must be quite nice there now we will go by the next currie boat my dear mildr reply miss terry aghast if you be go back so soon why do you not leave I behind you and just as we be get so nicely settle here too and i shall be so sorry to say good-bye to that young heigham he be such a nice young man why do not you marry he i really think you like he but perhaps he be come to the isle of wight too oh that dreadful bay mildr wince at miss terry 's allusion to arthur of whom that lady have grow extremely fond i be very sorry dear she say hastily but i be bore to death and it be such a bad insect year : so really you must begin to pack up miss terry begin to pack accordingly but when next she allude to the subject of they departure mildr affect surprise and ask she what she mean the astonished agatha refer she to she own word and be meet by a laughing disclaimer why you surely do not think that i be in earnest do you i be only a little cross well really mildr you have get so strange lately that i never know when you be in earnest and when you be not though for my part i be very glad to stay in peace and quiet strange grown strange have i say mr carr look dreamily out of a window that command the carriage-drive with she hand cross behind she yes i think that you be right i think that i have lose the old mildred somewhere or other and pick up a new one whom i do not understand ah indeed remark miss terry in the most matter-of-fact way without have the faintest idea of what she friend be drive at how it rain i suppose that he will not come to-day he who be he why how stupid you be mr heigham of course so you always mean he when you say ` he ' yes of course i do if it be not ungrammatical it be miserable this afternoon i feel wretched why actually here he come and she tear off like a school-girl into the hall to meet he ah indeed again remark miss terry solemnly to the empty wall i be not such a fool as i look i suppose that mr heigham would not come to the isle of wight it be perhaps needless to say that mr carr have never be more in earnest in she life than when she announce she intention of depart to the isle of wight the discovery that she suspicion about arthur have but too sure a foundation have be a crush blow to she hope and she have form a wise resolution to see no more of he happy would it have be for she if she could have find the moral courage to act up to it and go away a wiser if a sadder woman but this be not to be the more she contemplate it the more do she passion -- which be now both wild and deep -- take hold upon she heart eat into it like acid into steel and grave one name there in ineffaceable letter she could not bear the thought of parting from he and feel or think she feel that she happiness be already too deeply pledge to allow she to throw up the card without a effort fortune favor the brave perhaps after all it would declare itself for she she be modest in she aspiration she do not expect that he would ever give she the love he bear this other woman she only ask to live in the sunlight of he presence and would be glad to take he at he own price or indeed at any price man she know be by nature as unstable as water and will mostly melt beneath the eye of more woman than one as readily as ice before a fire when the sun have hide he face yes she would play the game out : she would not throw away she life 's happiness without a effort after all matter might have be worse : he might have be actually marry but she know that she hand be a difficult one to lead from though she also know that she hold the great trump -- unusual beauty practically unlimited wealth and considerable fascination of manner she part must be to attract without repel charm without alarming fascinate by slow degree till at length he be involve in a net from which there be no escape and above all never to allow he to suspect she motive till the ripe moment come it be a hard task for a proud woman to set herself and in a manner she be proud but alas with the best of we when love come in at the door pride reason and sometimes honor fly out the window and so miss terry hear no more talk of the isle of wight thenceforward under the frank and open guise of friendship mildr contrived to keep arthur continually at she side she do more she draw from he all the history of he engagement to angelum and listen with word of sympathy on she lip and wrath and bitter jealousy in she heart to he enraptured description of she rival 's beauty and perfection so benighted be he indeed that once he go so far as to suggest that he should when he and angelum be marry come to madeira to spend they honeymoon and dilate on the pleasant trip which they three might take together truly think mildr to herself that would be delightful once too he even show she a tress of angelum 's hair and strange to say she find that there still linger in she bosom a sufficient measure of vulgar first principle to cause she to long to snatch it from he and throw it into the sea but as it be she smile faintly and admire openly and then go to the glass to look at she own nut - brown tress never have she be so dissatisfied with they and yet she hair be consider lovely and a aesthetic hair-dresser have once call it a poem blind fool she mutter stamp she little foot upon the floor why do he torture I so mildred forget that all love be blind and that none be ever blinder or more headstrong than she own and so this second calypso of a lovely isle set herself almost as unblushingly as she prototype to get we very unheroic ulyss into she toil and penelope poor penelope she sit at home and span and defy she would-be lover but as yet ulyss -- i mean arthur -- be conscious of none of those thing he be by nature a easy-going young gentleman who take matter as he find they and ask no question and he find they very pleasant at madeira or rather at the quinta carr for he do everything except sleep there within its precinct he be everywhere surround with that atmosphere of subtle and refined flattery flattery address chiefly to the intellect that be one of the most effective weapon of a clever woman soon the drawing-room table be load with he favorite book and no song but such as he approve be order from london he discover one evening for instance that mildr look best at night in black and silver and next morning mr worth receive a telegram request he to forward without delay a large consignment of dress in which those color predominate on another occasion he casually throw out a suggestion about the erection of a terrace in the garden and shortly afterwards be surprise to find a small army of portuguese labourer engage upon the work he have make this suggestion in total ignorance of the science of garden engineering and its execution necessitate the removal of vast quantity of soil and the blasting of many ton of rock the contractor employ by mr carr point out how the terrace could be make equally well at a fifth of the expense but it do not happen to take exactly the direction that arthur have indicate so she would have none of it he word be law and because he have speak the whole place be for a month overrun with dirty labourer whilst to the great detriment of miss terry 's remaining nerve and even to the slight discomfort of he royal highness himself the air resound all day long with the terrific bang of the blast powder but so long as he be please with the progress of the improvement mildr feel no discomfort nor would she allow any one else to express any it even aggravate she to see miss terry put she hand to she head and jump whenever a particularly large piece of ordnance be discharge and she would vow that it must be affectation because she never even notice it in short mildr carr possess to a extraordinary degree that faculty for blind unreasoning adoration which be so characteristic of the sex a adoration that be at once magnificent in the entirety of its own self-sacrifice and extremely selfish when she think that she could please arthur the state of agatha 's nerve become a matter of supreme indifference to she and in the same way have she be a absolute monarch she would have spend the life of thousand and shake empire till throne come tumble down like apple in the wind if she have believe that she could thereby advance herself in he affection but as it never occur to arthur that mr carr might be in love with he he see nothing abnormal about all this not that he be conceit for nobody be ever less so but it be wonderful what a amount of flattery and attention man will accept from woman as they simple right if the other sex possess the faculty of admiration we in compensation be perfectly endowed with that of receive it with careless ease and when we fall in with some goddess who be foolish enough to worship _ we _ and to whom _ we _ should be on we knee we merely label she sympathetic and say that she understand we from all of which wise reflection the reader will gather that we friend arthur be not a hundred mile off a awkward situation chapter xxxvi one day some three week after arthur have go angelum stroll down the tunnel walk now in the height of summer almost dark with the shade of the lime-tree and settle herself on one of the stone seat under caresfoot 's staff she have a book in hand but it soon become clear that she have come to this secluded spot to think rather than read for it fall unopened from she hand and she gray eye be full of a far-off look as they gaze across the lake glittering in the sunlight away towards the hazy purple outline of the distant hill she face be quite calm but it be not that of a happy person indeed it give a distinct idea of mental suffer all grief however acute be subject to fix gradation and angelum be yet in the second stage first there be the acute stage when the heart ache with a physical pain and the mind fill with a wild yearning or tortured by a unceasing anxiety well - nigh give beneath the abnormal strain this do not last long or it would kill or drive we to the mad-house then come that long epoch of dull misery endure till at last kindly nature in pity rub off the rough extreme of we calamity and by slow but sure degree soften agony into sorrow this be what she be now pass through and -- as all highly organize nature like she own be especially in youth very sensitive to those more exquisite vibration of pain and happiness that leave mind of a coarser fiber comparatively unmoved -- it may be take for grant that she be suffer sufficiently acutely perhaps she have never quite realize how necessary arthur have become to she how deep he love have send its fiber into she heart and inner self until he be violently wrench away from she and she lose all sight and knowledge of he in the darkness of the outside world still she have make no show of she sorrow but once when pigott tell she some pathetic story of the death of a little child in the village she burst into a paroxysm of weep the pity for another 's pain have loose the flood-gate of she own but it be a performance that she do not repeat but angelum have she anxiety as well as she grief and it be over these former that she be think as she sit on the great stone under the oak love be a wonderful quickener of the perception and ignorant as she be of all the world 's way the more she think over the term impose by she father upon she engagement the more distrustful do she grow lady bellamy too have be to see she twice and on each occasion have inspire she with a lively sense of fear and repugnance during the first of these visit she have show a perfect acquaintance with the circumstance of she engagement she flirtation with mr heigham as she be please to call it during the second call too she have be full of strange remark about she cousin george talk mysteriously of a change that have come over he since he illness and of he be under a new influence nor be this all for on the very next day when she be out walk with pigott in the village she have meet george himself and he have insist upon enter into a long rambling conversation with she and on look at she in a way that make she feel perfectly sick oh aleck she say aloud to the dog that be sit by she side with he head upon she knee for he be now she constant companion i wonder where you master be you master and mine aleck would to god that he be back here to protect I for i be grow afraid i do not know of what aleck and there be eleven long silent month to wait at this moment the dog raise he head listen and spring round with a angry woof angelum rise up with a flash of hope in she eye turn and face george caresfoot he be still pale and shrivel from the effect of he illness but otherwise little change except that the light-blue eye glitter with a fierce determination and that the feature have attain that fixity and strength which sometimes come to those who be bent heart and soul upon a enterprise be it good or evil so i have find you out at last cousin angelum what be you not go to shake hand with I angela touch he finger with she own my father be not here she say thank you my dear cousin but i do not come to see you father of whom i have see plenty in the course of my life and shall doubtless see more i come to see you of whom i can never see enough i do not

feel she must not show that she be afraid i shall hope to make you do so before long he reply with a meaning glance but you be not very polite you know you do not offer I a seat i beg you pardon i do not know that you want to sit down i can only offer you a choice of those stone then call that brute away and i will sit down the dog be not a brute as you mean it but i should not speak of he like that if i be you he be sensible as a human being and might resent it angelum know that george be a coward about dog and at that moment as though to confirm she word aleck growl slightly ah indeed well he be certainly a handsome dog and he sit down suspiciously will not you come and sit down thank you i prefer to stand do you know what you look like stand there with you arm cross you look like a angry goddess if you mean that seriously i do not understand you if it be a compliment i do not like compliment you be not very friendly say george whose temper be fast get the better of he i be sorry i do not wish to be unfriendly so i hear that my ward have be stay here whilst i be ill yes he be stay here and i be also tell that there be some boy-and-girl love affair between you i suppose that he indulge in a flirtation to wile away the time angelum turn upon he too angry to speak well you need not look at I like that you surely never expect to see he again do you if we both live i shall certainly see he again indeed i shall in any case you will never see he again why not because he be only flirt and play the fool with you he be a notorious flirt and to my certain knowledge have be engage to two woman before i do not believe that that be true or if it be true it be not all the truth but true or untrue i be not go to discuss mr heigham with you or allow myself to be influence by story tell behind he back angelum say george rise and seize she hand she turn quite pale and a shudder pass over she frame leave my hand alone and never dare to touch I again this be the second time that you have try to insult I so answer george furious with outraged pride and baffle passion you set up you will against mine do you very well you shall see i will crush you to powder insult you indeed how often do that young blackguard insult you i warrant he do more than take you hand if answer angelum you mean mr heigham i shall leave you to consider whether that term be not more applicable to the person who do he best to outrage a unprotected woman and take advantage of the absent than to the gentleman against whom you have use it and dart on he one glance of supreme contempt she sweep away like a angry queen leave to he meditation george shake he fist towards where she have vanish very well my fine lady very well he say aloud you treat I as so much dirt do you you shall smart for this so sure as my name be george caresfoot only wait till you be in my power and you shall learn that i be never yet defy with impunity oh and you shall learn many other thing also from that time forward angelum be for a period of two month or more subject to a organize persecution as harassing as it be cruel george waylay she everywhere and twice actually succeed in enter into conversation with she but on both occasion she manage to escape from he before he could proceed any further so persistently do he hunt she that at last the wretched girl be drive to hide herself away in odd corner of the house and wood in order to keep out of he way then he take to write she letter and send handsome present all of which she return poor angelum it be hard both to lose she lover and to suffer daily from the persecution of she hateful cousin which be now push forward so openly and with such pertinacity as to fill she with vague alarm what make she position worse be that she have no one in whom to confide for mr fraser have not yet return pigott indeed know more or less what be go on but she could do nothing except bewail arthur 's absence and tell she not to mind there remain she father but with he she have never be on sufficiently intimate term for confidence indeed as time go on the suspicion gather strength in she mind that he be privy to george 's advance and that those advance have something to do with the harsh term impose upon arthur and herself but at last matter grow so bad that have no other refuge she determine to appeal to he for protection father she say boldly one day to philip as he be sit write in he study my cousin george be persecute I every day i have bear it as long as i can but i can bear it no longer i have come to ask you to protect I from he why angelum i should have think that you be perfectly capable of protect yourself what be he persecute you about what do he want to marry I i suppose answer angelum blush to she eye well that be a very complimentary wish on he part and i can tell you what it be angelum if only you could get that young heigham out of you head you might do a deal worse it be quite useless to talk to I like that she answer coldly well that be you affair but it be very ridiculous of you to come and ask I to protect you the woman must indeed be a fool who can not protect herself and so the interview end next day lady bellamy call again my dear child she say to angela you be not look well this business worry you no doubt it be the old struggle between duty and inclination that we have most of we go through well there be one consolation nobody who ever do he or she duty regardless of inclination ever regret it in the end what do you mean lady bellamy when you talk about my duty i mean the plain duty that lie before you of marry you cousin george and of throw up this young heigham i recognize no such duty my dear angelum do look at the matter from a sensible point of view think what a good thing it would be for you father and remember too that it would re-unite all the property if ever a girl have a clear duty to perform you have since you insist so much upon my ` duty ' i must say that it seem to I that a honest girl in my position have three duty to consider and not one as you say lady bellamy first there be she duty to the man she love for she the greatest duty of any in the world next she duty to herself for she happiness and self-respect be involve in she decision and lastly she duty to she family i put the family last because after all it be she who get marry not she family lady bellamy smile a little you argue well but there be one thing that you overlook though i be sorry to have to pain you by say it young mr heigham be no better than he should be i have make inquiry about he and think that i ought to tell you that what do you mean i mean that he life young as he be have not be so creditable as it might have be he have be the hero of one or two little affair i can tell you about they if you like lady bellamy you story be either true or untrue if true i should take no notice of they because they must have happen before he love I if untrue they would be a mere waste of breath so i think that we may dispense with the story -- they would influence I no more than the hum of next summer 's gnat lady bellamy smile again you be a curious woman she say but suppose that there be to be a repetition of these little story _ after _ he love you what would you say then angelum look troubled and think awhile he could never go far from I she answer what do you mean i mean that i hold the string of he heart in my hand and i have only to lift they to draw he back to I -- so no other woman no living force can keep he from I if i choose to bid he come suppose that to be so how about the self-respect you speak of just now could you bear to take you lover back from the hand of another woman that would entirely depend upon the circumstance and upon what be just to the other woman you would not then throw he up without question lady bellamy i may be very ignorant and simple but i be neither mad nor a fool what do you suppose that my life would be worth to I if i throw arthur up if i remain single it would be a ache void as it be now and if i marry any other man whilst he still live it would become a daily and shameful humiliation such as i have rather die than endure lady bellamy glance up from under she heavy-lidded eye a thought have evidently strike she but she do not express it then i be to tell you cousin george that you will have absolutely nothing to do with he yes and beg he to cease persecute I it be quite useless if there be no arthur and no other man in the world i would not marry he i detest he -- i can not tell you how i detest he it be amusing to hear you talk so and to think that you will certainly be mrs george caresfoot within nine month never answer angelum passionately stamp she foot upon the floor what make you say such horrible thing i reflect answer lady bellamy with a ominous smile that george caresfoot have make up he mind to marry you and that i have make up mine to help he to do so and that you will strong as it certainly be be as compare with we unite will what a straw be to a gale the straw can not travel against the wind it _ must _ go with it and you _ must _ marry george caresfoot you will as certainly come to the altar-rail with he as you will to you death-bed it be write in you face good-bye for the first time angelum 's courage really give way as she hear these dreadful word she remember how she herself have call lady bellamy a embodiment of the spirit of power and now she feel that the comparison be just the woman be power incarnate and she word which from anybody else she would have laugh at send a cold chill through she she be a fine creature both in mind and body reflect lady bellamy as she step into she carriage really though i try to hate she i can find it in my heart to be sorry for she indeed i be not sure that i do not like she certainly i respect she but she have come in my path and must be crush -- my own safety demand it at least she be worth crush and the game be fair for perhaps she will crush I i should not be surprise there be a judgment in those gray eye of hers -- qui vivra verra home william chapter xxxvii angelum 's appeal for protection set philip thinking as the reader be aware he sole motive in consent to become as it be a sleep partner in the shameful plot of which he innocent daughter be the object be to obtain possession of he lose inheritance and it now occur to he that even should that plot succeed which he very greatly doubt nothing have as yet be settle as to the term upon which it be to be reconvey to he the whole affair be excessively repugnant to he : indeed he regard the prospect of its success with little less than terror only he greed over-master he fear but on one point he be very clear : it should not succeed except upon the very best of term for himself he daughter should not be sacrifice unless the price pay for the victim be positively princely such guilt be not to be incur for a bagatelle if george married angelum the isleworth estate must pass back into he hand for a very low sum indeed but would he cousin be willing to accept such a sum that be the rub and that too be what must be make clear without any further delay he have no wish to see angelum put to needless suffering suffering which would not bring a equivalent with it and which might on the contrary entail consequence upon himself that he shudder to think of curiously enough however he have of late be signally free from he superstitious fear indeed since the night when he have so astonished arthur by he outbreak about the shadow on the wall no fit have come to trouble he and he be begin to look upon the whole thing as a evil dream a nightmare that he have at last live down but still the nightmare might return and he be not go to run the risk unless he be very well pay for it and so he determine to offer a price so low for the property that no man in he sens would accept it and then write a note to george ask he to come over on the follow evening after dinner as he wish to speak to he on a matter of business there he say to himself that will make a end of the affair and i will get young heigham back and they can be marry george can never take what i mean to offer if he should the egyptian will be spoil indeed and the game will be worth the candle not that i have any responsibility about it however i shall put no pressure on angelum she must choose for herself and philip go to bed quite feel as though he have do a virtuous action george come punctually enough on the follow evening which be that of the day of lady bellamy 's conversation with angelum a conversation which have so upset the latter that she have already go to she room not know anything of she cousin 's propose visit the night be one of those dreadfully oppressive one that sometimes visit we in the course of a english summer the day have be hot and sultry and with the fall of the evening the little breeze that stir in the thunder-laden air have die away leave the temperature at much the same point that be to be expect in a tropical valley and render the heat of the house almost unbearable how do you do george say philip hot be not it yes there will be a tempest soon not before midnight i think shall we go and walk down by the lake it will be cooler there and we shall be quite undisturbed wall have ear sometimes you know very well but where be angelum i meet she on the stair just now and she say that she be go to bed -- get a headache i believe shall we start so soon as they be well away from the house philip break the ice some month back i have a conversation with lady bellamy on the subject of a proposal that you make to I through she for angelum 's hand it be about that i wish to speak to you now first i must ask if you still wish to go on with the business certainly i wish it more than ever well as i intimate to lady bellamy i do not at all approve of you suit angelum be already subject to my consent very suitably engage to you late ward a young fellow whom whatever you may think about he i like very much and i can assure you that it will require the very strongest inducement to make I even allow such a thing in any case i will have nothing to do with influence angelum she be a perfectly free agent which mean i suppose that you intend to screw down the price in want to marry angelum go on philip you must remember that you fly high she be a very lovely woman and what be more will some day or other be exceedingly well off whilst you -- you must excuse I for be candid but this be a mere matter of business and i be only talk of you in the light of a possible son-in-law -- you be a middle-aged man not prepossess in appearance break in health and however well you may have keep up you reputation in these part as you and i well know without a single shred of character leave altogether not a man to who a father would marry he daughter of he own free will or one with whom a young girl be likely to find happiness you draw a flattering picture of I i must say not at all only a true one well if i be all you say how be it that you be prepare to allow you daughter to marry I at all i will tell you because the rights of property should take precedence of the interest of a single individual because my father and you between you cozen I out of my lawful own and this be the only way that i see of come by it again what do it matter in any case after you death the land will come back to angelum and she child no george it will not if ever the isleworth estate come into my hand they shall not pass again to any child of yours what would you do with they then marry and get child of my own george whistle well i must say that you intention be amiable but you have not get the estate yet my dear cousin no and never shall have most likely but let we come to the point although i do not approve of you advance i be willing to waive my objection and accept you as a son-in-law if you can win angelum 's consent provide that before the marriage you consent to give I clear transfer at a price of all the isleworth estate with the exception of the mansion and the pleasure-grounds very good but now about the price that be the real point they have take a path that run down through the shrubbery to the side of the lake and then turn up towards caresfoot 's staff before answer george 's remark philip propose that they should sit down and suit the action to the word place himself upon the trunk of a fall tree that lay by the water 's edge just outside the spread of the branch of the great oak and command a view of the area beneath they the moon will come out again presently he say when george have follow he example she have get behind that thunder-cloud ah as a bright flash of lightning pass from heaven to earth i think that we should get a storm it will be here in half a hour all this philip say to gain time he have not quite make up he mind what price to offer never mind the lightning what do you offer for the property inclusive of timber and with all improvement -- just as it stand in short one hundred thousand pound cash say philip deliberately george spring from he seat and sit down again before he answer do you think that i be drunk or a fool that you come to I with such a ridiculous offer why the probate valuation be two hundred thousand and that be very low i offer one hundred thousand and be willing to settle thirty thousand absolutely on the girl should she marry you and twenty thousand more on my death that be my offer -- take it or leave it talk sense man you term be preposterous i tell you that preposterous or not i will not go beyond they if you do not like they well and good leave they alone and i 'll put myself in communication with young heigham to-morrow and tell he that he can come and marry the girl as soon as he like for my part i be very glad to have the business settle you ask I to sacrifice half my property groan george my property you mean that you steal but i do not ask you to do anything one way or the other i be to understand that you refuse my offer give I a minute to think and george hide he face in he hand and philip look at he with hatred gleam in he dark eye mutter between he tooth i believe that my turn have come at last when some thirty seconds have pass in silence the attention of the pair be attract by the crack of dead leaf that sound quite startling in the intense stillness of the night and next second a tall figure in white glide up to the water 's edge and stand still within half a dozen pace of they involuntarily philip grip he cousin 's arm but neither of they move the sky have rapidly cloud up and the faint light that struggle from the moon only serve to show that the figure appear to be lift its arm in another second that be go too and the place be totally dark wait till the moon come out and we shall see what it be whisper george and as he speak there come from the direction of the figure a rustling sound as of fall garment what can it be whisper philip they be not leave long in doubt for at that instant a vivid flash from the thunder-cloud turn the darkness into the most brilliant day and reveal a woman stand up to she knee in the water with she arm lift knot she long hair it be angelum for one moment the fierce light shone upon the stately form that gleam whiter than ivory -- white as snow against the dense background of the brushwood and as it pass they hear she sink into the water softly as a swan and strike out with steady stroke towards the center of the lake it be only angelum say philip when the sound of the stroke grow faint phew what a state she give I be she safe ask george in a husky voice have not i better get a boat she need no help from you she be quite capable of look after herself especially in the water i can tell you philip answer sharply nothing more be say till they reach the house when on enter the light study philip notice that he cousin 's face be flush and he hand shake like aspen leave why what be the matter with you man he ask nothing -- nothing i be only rather cold give I some brandy cold on such a night as this that be curious say philip as he get the spirit from a cupboard george drink about a wine-glassful neat and seem to recover himself i accept you offer for the land philip he say presently he cousin look at he curiously and a brilliant idea strike he you agree then to take _ fifty _ thousand pound for the isleworth estate in the event of you marry my daughter the sale to be complete before the marriage take place fifty thousand no a hundred thousand -- you say a hundred thousand just now you must have misunderstand I or i must have make a mistake what i mean be _ fifty thousand _ and you to put a thousand down as earnest money -- to be forfeit whether the affair come off or not george ground he tooth and clutch at he red hair proceedings that he cousin watch with a great deal of quiet enjoyment when at length he speak it be in a low hoarse voice quite unlike he usual hard tone : damn you he say you have I at you mercy take the land for the money if you like though it will nearly ruin I that woman have turn my head i _ must _ marry she or i shall go mad very good that be you affair remember that i have no responsibility in the matter and that i be not go to put any pressure on angelum if you want to marry she you must win she within the next eight month then that be settle i suppose that you will pay in the thousand to-morrow the storm be come up fast so i will not keep you good night and they separate george to drive home -- with fever in he heart and the thunderstorm of which he hear nothing rattle round he -- and philip to make he way to bed with the dream of he life advance a step nearer realization that be a lucky swim of angelum 's to-night he think fifty thousand pound for the estate he be right he must be go mad but will he get she to marry he i wonder if he do i shall cry quit with he indeed chapter xxxviii george have speak no falsehood when he say that he feel as though he must marry angelum or go mad indeed it be a striking proof of how necessary he think that step to be to he happiness that he have be willing to consent to he cousin 's shylock-like term about the sale of the property although they would in they result degrade he from he position as a large land proprietor and make a comparatively poor man of he the danger or suffer that could induce a caresfoot to half ruin himself with he eye open have need to be of a extraordinarily press nature love 's empire be this globe and all mankind the most refined and the most degrade the cleverest and the most stupid be all liable to become he faithful subject he can alike command the devotion of a archbishop and a south-sea islander of the most immaculate maiden lady -lrb- whatever she age -rrb- and of the savage zulu girl from the pole to the equator and from the equator to the further pole there be no monarch like love where he set he foot the rock bloom with flower or the garden become a wilderness accord to he good - will and pleasure and at he whisper all other allegiance melt away like rope of mud he be the real arbiter of the destiny of the world but to each nature of all the million beneath he sway love come in a fitting guise to some as a angel messenger tell of sympathy and peace and a strange new hope to other drape in sad robe indeed but still divine thus when he visit such a one as george caresfoot it be as a potent fiend whose mission be to enter through man 's lower nature to torture and destroy to scorch the heart with fearful heat and then to crush it and leave its owner 's bosom choke with bitter dust and so far as george be concern there be no doubt but what the work be do right well for under the influence of what be with doubtful propriety know as the tender passion that estimable character be rapidly drift within a measurable distance of a lunatic asylum the check and repulse that he have meet with instead of cool he ardor have only the effect of inflame it to a extraordinary degree angelum 's scornful dislike as water throw upon burn oil do but diffuse the flame of he passion throughout the whole system of he mind till he grow wild with its heat and violence she glorious beauty daily take a still stronger hold upon he imagination till it scorch into he very soul for whole night he could not sleep for whole day he would scarcely eat or do anything but walk walk walk and try to devise means to win she to he side the irritation of the mind produce its natural effect upon he conduct and he would burst into fit of the most causeless fury in one of these he dismiss every servant in the house and so evil be he reputation among that class that he have great difficulty in obtain other to take they place in another he hurl a heavy pot contain a azalea-bush at the head of one of the gardener and have to compromise a action for assault in short the lunatic asylum loom very near indeed for a week or so after the memorable night of he interview with philip a interview that he at least would never forget george be quite unable try as he would to get a single word with angelum at last one day when he be drive by a seldom-used road past the field near the abbey house on he way from roxham chance give he the opportunity that he have for so long seek without success for far up a by-lane that lead to a turnip-field he eye catch sight of the flutter of a gray dress vanish round a corner something in the make of which suggest to he that angelum be its wearer give the rein to the servant and bidding he drive on home he get out of the dog-cart and hurry up the grassy track and on turn the corner come suddenly upon the object of he search she be stand on the bank of the hedge-row and struggle with a bough of honeysuckle from which she wish to pluck its last remain autumn bloom so engage be she that she do not hear he step and it be not until he hard voice grate on she ear that she know that she be trap catch at last you have give I a pretty hunt angela the violent start she give effectually carry out she purpose as regard the honeysuckle which snap in two under the strain of she backward jerk and she turn round upon he pant with fear and exertion

it he determination frighten she and she take refuge in a armor of calm and freezing contempt i do not understand you she say on the contrary you understand I very well you always avoid I i can never see you try how i will perhaps he go on still talk quite quietly if you know what a hell there be in my heart and brain you would not treat I so i tell you that i be in torture and the muscle of the pallid face twitch in a way that go far to confirm he word i do not understand you meaning unless indeed you be try to frighten and insult I as you have do before answer angelum poor girl she do not know what else to say she be not of a nervous disposition but there be something about george 's manner that alarm she very much and she glance anxiously around to see if any one be within call but the place be lonely as the grave there be no need for you to look for help i wish neither to frighten nor insult you my suit be a honorable one enough i wish you to promise to marry I that be all you must and shall promise it i will take no refusal you be make for I and i for you it be quite useless for you to resist I for you must marry I at last i love you and by that right you belong to I i

do not say you will not for god 's sake do not say you will not say george with a sudden change of manner from the confident to the supplicatory look i beg you not to on my knee and he actually fling himself down on the grass roadway and grovel before she in a abandonment of passion hideous to behold she turn very pale and answer he in a cold quiet voice every syllable of which fall upon he like the stroke of a knife such a thing would be quite impossible for many reason but i need only repeat you one that you be already aware of i be engage to mr heigham bah that be nothing i know that but you will not throw away such a love as i have to offer for the waver affection of a boy we can soon get rid of he write and tell he that you have change you mind listen angelum he go on catch she by the skirt of she dress he be not rich he have only get enough for a bare living i have five time the money and you shall help to spend it do not marry a young beggar like that you will not get value for yourself it will pay you ever so much better to marry I george be convince from he experience of the sex that every woman could be buy if only you bid high enough but as the sequel show he could not well have use a worse argument to a person like angelum or one more likely to excite the indignation that fear of he together with a certain respect for the evident genuineness of he suffering have hitherto keep in suppression she wrench she dress free from he leave a portion of its fabric in he hand be you not ashamed she say she voice tremble with indignation and she eye fill with angry tear be you not ashamed to talk to I like this _ you _ my own father 's cousin and yourself old enough to be my father i tell you that my love be already give which would have be a sufficient answer

a matter of some importance she say that be indeed a unusual occurrence answer sir john rub he dry hand and smile it be not my own affair : listen and she give he a full accurate and clear account of all that have take place with reference to george 's determination to marry angelum not omit the most trivial detail sir john express no surprise he be a very old bird be sir john one for whom every net be spread in vain whether in or out of he sight nothing in this world provide that it do not affect he own comfort or safety could affect he bland and appreciative smile he be never surprise once or twice he put a shrewd question to elucidate some point in the narrative and that be all when he wife be finish he say well anne you have tell a very interesting and amusing little history doubly so if you will permit I to say it see that it be tell of george caresfoot by lady bellamy but it seem that you joint effort have fail what be it that you wish I to do i wish to ask you if you can suggest any plan that will not fail you be very cunning in you way and you advice may be good let I see young heigham be in madeira be he not i be sure i do not know but i do and he extract a note-book from a drawer let I see i think i have a entry somewhere here ah here we be ` arthur p heigham esq passenger per _ warwick castle _ to madeira June 16 ' -lrb- copy from passenger-list _ western daily news _

plan then yes answer sir john with great deliberation i think i see my way but i must have time to think of it i will speak to you about it to-morrow when lady bellamy have go the little man rise peeped round to see that nobody be within hearing and then rub he dry hand with infinite zest say aloud in a voice that be quite solemn in the intensity of its satisfaction the lord have deliver mine enemy into mine hand chapter xl two day after sir john have be take into confidence philip receive a visit from lady bellamy that cause he a good deal of discomfort after talk to he on general subject for awhile she rise to go by the way mr caresfoot she say i really have almost forget the object of my visit you may remember a conversation we have together some time ago when i be the means of pay a debt owe to you philip nodded then you will not have forget that one of the article of we little verbal convention be that if it should be consider to the interest of all the party concerned you daughter 's old nurse be not to remain in you house i remember well do you know i can not help think that it must be a bad thing for angelum to have so much of the society of a ill-educated and not very refine person like pigott i really advise you to get rid of she she have be with I for twenty year and my daughter be devote to she i can not turn she off it be always painful to dismiss a old servant -- almost as bad as discard a old dress but when a dress be wear out it must be throw away surely the same apply to servant i do not see how i be to send she away i can quite understand you feeling but then you see a agreement imply obligation on both side do not it especially a agreement ` for value receive ' as the lawyer say philip wince perceptibly i wish i have never have anything to do with you agreement oh if you think it over i do not think that you will say so well that be settle i suppose she will go pretty soon i be glad to see you look so well -- very different from you cousin i assure you i do not think much of he state of health good-bye remember I to angelum by the way i do not know if you have hear that george have meet with a repulse in that direction he do not intend to press matter any more at present but of course the agreement hold all the same nobody know what the morrow may bring forth where you and my amiable cousin be concerned i shall be much surprised if it do not bring forth villany thought philip as soon as he hear the front door close i suppose that it must be do about pigott curse that woman with she sorceress face i wish i have never put myself into she power the iron hand can be feel pretty plainly through she velvet glove life be never altogether cloud over and that morning angelum 's horizon have be brighten by two big ray of sunshine that come to shed they cheer light on the gray monotony of she surroundings for of late notwithstanding its occasional spasm of fierce excitement she life have be as monotonous as it be miserable always the same anxious grief the same fear the same longing press hourly round she like phantom in the mist -- no not like phantom like real live thing peep at she from the dark sometimes indeed the presentiment and intangible terror that be gradually strengthen they hold upon she would get beyond she control and arouse in she a restless desire for action -- any action it do not matter what -- that would take she away out of these dull hour of unwholesome mental growth it be this longing to be do something that drive she fevered physically with the stifle air of the summer night and mentally by thought of she absent lover and recollection of lady bellamy 's ominous word down to the border of the lake on the evening of george 's visit to she father and once there prompt she to try to forget she trouble for awhile in the exercise of a art of which she have from childhood be a mistress the same feeling it be too that lead she to spend long hour of the day and even of the night when by rights she should have be asleep immerse in endless mathematical study and in solve or attempt to solve almost impossible problem she find that the strenuous effort of the brain act as a counter-irritant to the fret of she trouble and though it may seem a odd thing to say mathematics alone owe to the intense application they require exercise a soothing effect upon she but as one can not constantly sleep induce by chloral without pay for it in some shape or form angelum 's relief from she care be obtain at no small cost to she health when the same brain however well develop it may be have both to study hard and suffer much there must be a waste of tissue somewhere in angelum 's case the outward and visible result of this state of thing be to make she grow thinner and the alternate mental effect to increasingly rarefy a intellect already too ethereal for this work-a-day world and to plunge its owner into fit of depression which be render dreadful by sudden foreboding of evil that would leap to life in the recess of she mind and for a moment cast a lurid glare upon its gloom such as at night the lightning give to the blackness which surround it it be in one of the worst of these fit she cloudy day as she would call they to pigott that good news find she as she be dress pigott bring she a letter which recognize lady bellamy 's bold handwriting she open in fear and tremble it contain a short note and another letter the note run as follow : dear angelum i enclose you a letter from you cousin george which contain what i suppose you will consider good news _ for you own sake _ i beg you not to send it back unopen as you do the last a b for a moment angelum be tempt to mistrust this enclosure and almost come to the determination to throw it into the fire feeling sure that a serpent lurk in the grass and that it be a cunningly disguise love-letter but curiosity overcome she and she open it as gingerly as though it be infected unfold the sheet with the handle of she hair-brush its contents be destine to give she a surprise they run thus : isleworth hall September 20 my dear cousin after what pass between we a few day ago you will perhaps be surprise at hearing from I but if you have the patience to read this short letter its contents will not i fear be altogether displease to you they be very simple i write to say that i accept you verdict and that you need fear no further advance from I whether i quite deserve all the bitter word you pour out upon I i leave you to judge at leisure see that my only crime be that i love you to most woman that offence would not have seem so unpardonable but that be as it may be after what you say there be only one course leave for a man who have any pride -- and that be to withdraw so let the past be dead between we i shall never allude to it again wish you happiness in the path of life which you have choose i remain you affectionate cousin george caresfoot it would have be difficult for any one to have receive a more perfectly satisfactory letter than this be to angelum pigott she call out feel the absolute necessity of a confidant in she joy and forget that that worthy soul have nothing but the most general knowledge of george 's advance he have give I up just think he be go to let I alone i declare that i feel quite fond of he and who might you be talk of miss why my cousin george of course he be go to let I alone i tell you which see how as he be not fit to touch you with a pair of tong be about the least as he can do miss and as for let you alone i do not know as he ever propose do anything else but that remind I miss though i be sure i do not know why it should how as mr hawkin as be put in to look after the vicarage while the reverend fraser be away tell I last night how as she have get a telegraft the sight of which she say knock she all faint like till she turn just as yellow as the cover to say nothing of four - and-six porterage the which however she intend to recover from the reverend -- lord where be i i be sure i do not know pigott but i suppose you be go to tell I what be in the telegram yes miss that be right but my head do seem to wool up somehow so at time that i fare to lose my way well pigott what be in the telegram lord miss how you do hurry one beg you pardon only that the reverend fraser -- not but what mr hawkin do say that it can not be true because the word war not in he write nor nothing like as she have good reason to know see that -- yes but what about mr fraser pigott be not he well the telegraft do not say as i remember miss bless I i forget if it be to-day or to-morrow oh pigott groan angelum do tell I what be in the telegram why miss surely i tell you that the thing say though i fancy likely to be in error -- what almost shout angelum why that the reverend fraser would be home by the midday train and would like a beefsteak for lunch not mention however anything about the onion which be very puzzling to mr -- oh i be glad why could you not tell I before cousin george disposed of and mr fraser come back why thing be look quite bright again at least they would be if only arthur be here and she rejoicing end in a sigh as soon as she think that he would have finish he beefsteak with or without the onion angelum walk down to the vicarage and break in upon mr fraser with something of she old gladsome warmth run up to he without wait to be announce she seize he by both hand and so you be back at last what a long time you have be away oh i be so glad to see you mr fraser who it strike she look older since he absence turn first a little red and then a little pale and say yes angela here i be back again in the old shop it be very good of you to come so soon to see I now sit down and tell I all about yourself whilst i go on with my unpacking but bless I my dear what be the matter with you you look thin and as though you be not happy and -- where have you smile go to angelum never mind I you must tell I all about yourself first where have you be and what have you be do all these long month oh i have be enjoy myself over half the civilized globe he answer with a somewhat force laugh switzerland italy and spain have all be benefit by my presence but i get tire of it so here i be back in my proper sphere and delighted to again behold these dear familiar face and he point to he ample collection of classic but let I hear about yourself angela i be tire of no 1 i can assure you oh mine be a long story you will scarcely find patience to listen to it ah i think that there be a story from you face then i think that i can guess what it be about young lady ' story generally turn upon the same pivot and he laugh a little softly and sit down in a corner well out of the light now my dear i be ready to give you my best attention angelum blush very deeply and look studiously out of the window begin with many hesitation to tell she story well mr fraser you must understand first of all -- i mean you know that i must tell you that -- desperately that i be engage ah there be a something so sharp and sudden about this exclamation that angelum turn round quickly what be the matter have you hurt yourself yes but go on angelum it be a awkward story to tell especially the george complication part of it and to any one else she feel that she would have find it almost impossible to tell it but in mr fraser she be she know sure of a sympathetic listener have she know too that the mere mention of she lover 's name be a stab to she listener 's heart and that every expression of she own deep and enduring love and each tone of endearment be new and ingenious torture she might well have be confuse for so it be although he be fifty year of age mr fraser have not educate angelum with impunity he have pay the penalty that must have result to any heart-whole man not absolutely a fossil who have be bring into close contact with such a woman as angelum she loveliness appeal to he sense of beauty she goodness to he heart and she learning to he intellectual sympathy what wonder that he learn by imperceptible degree to love she the wonder would have be if he have not the reader need not fear however he shall not be trouble with any long account of mr fraser 's misfortune for it never come to light or obtruded itself upon the world or even upon its object he be one of those earnest secret and self-sacrificing passion of which if we only know it there exist a good many round about we passion which to all appearance tend to nothing and be entirely without object unless it to be make the individual on whom they be inflict a little less happy or a little more miserable as the case may be than he or she would otherwise have be it be to strive to conquer this passion which in he heart he call dishonourable that mr fraser have go abroad right away from angelum where he have wrestle with it and pray against it and at last as he think subdue it but now on he first sight of she it rise again in all its former strength and rush through he be like a storm and he realize that such love be of those thing that can not die and perhaps it be a question if he really wish to lose it it be a poor thing indeed a very poor thing but he own there be something so divine about all true love that there lurk a conviction at the bottom of the heart of most of we that it be better to love however much we suffer than not to love at all perhaps after all those really to be pity be the people who be not capable of any such sensation but what mr fraser suffer listen that autumn afternoon to angelum 's tale of another 's love and of she own deep return of that love no man but himself ever know yet still he hear and be not shake in he loyal-heartedness and comfort and console she give she the best advice in he power like the noble christian gentleman that he be show she too that there be little need of anxiety and every ground for hope that thing would come to a happy and successful issue the martyr 's abnegation of self be not yet dead in the world at last angelum come to the letter that she have that very morning receive from george mr fraser read it carefully at any rate he say he be behave like a gentleman now on the whole that be a nice letter you will be trouble with he no more yes answer angelum and then flush up at the memory of george 's argument in the lane but it be certainly time that he do for he have no business oh he have no business to speak to I as he speak and he a man old enough to be my father mr fraser 's pale cheek color a little do not be hard upon he because he be old angelum -- which by the way he be not he be nearly ten year my junior -- for i fear that old man be just as liable to be make fool of by a pretty face as young one from that moment not know the man 's real character mr fraser secretly entertain a certain sympathy for george 's suffering arise no doubt from a fellow-feel it seem to he that he could understand a man go very far indeed when he object be to win angelum : not that he would have do it himself but he know the temptation and what it cost to struggle against it it be nearly dark when at length angelum rise to go warmly press he hand and thank he in she own sweet way for he goodness and kind counsel and then decline he offer of escort and say that she would come and see he again on the morrow she depart on she homeward path the first thing that meet she gaze on the hall-table at the abbey house be a note address to herself in a handwriting that she have see in many wash bill but never before on a envelope she open it in vague alarm it run as follow : miss -- yore father have just dismiss I say that he be too pore to keep I any longer which be a matter as i hold my own opinion on and that i be too uneddicated to be in yore company which be a perfect truth but miss not feel any how ekal to bid you good-bye in person after bring you up by hand and do for you these many year i take the liberty to write to you miss to say good-bye and god bless you my beautiful angel and i shall be to be find down at the old housen at the end of the drift as my pore husband leave I which be fortinately just empty and p ` rap you will come and see I at time miss yore obedient servant pigott i open this again to say how as i have tie up you thing a bit afore i leave leave mine till to-morrow when if live i shall send for they if you please miss you will find yore clean night-shift in the left hand drawyer and sorry be i that i can not be there to lay it out for you i shall take the liberty to send up for you wash as it can not be trust to any one angelum read the letter through and then sink back upon a chair and burst into a storm of tear partially recover herself however she rise and enter she father 's study be this true she ask still sob be what true ask philip indifferently and affect not to see she distress that you have send pigott away yes yes you see angelum -- do you mean that she be really to stop away of course i do i really must be allow angelum -- forgive I father but i do not want to listen to you reason and excuse she eye be quite dry now that woman nurse my die mother and play a mother 's part to I she be as you know my only woman friend and yet you throw she away like a worn-out shoe no doubt you have you reason and i hope that they be satisfactory to you but i tell you reason or no reason you have act in a way that be cowardly and cruel and cast one indignant glance at he she leave the room philip quail before he daughter 's anger thank goodness she be go and that job be do with i be downright afraid of she and the worst of it be she speak the truth say philip to himself as the door close ten day after this incident angelum hear casually from mr fraser that sir john and lady bellamy be go on a short trip abroad for the benefit of the former 's health if she think about the matter at all it be to feel rather glad angelum do not like lady bellamy indeed she fear she of george she neither hear nor see anything he have also go away chapter xli meanwhile at madeira matter be go on much as we leave they there have indeed be little appreciable change in the situation for he part we friend arthur continue to dance or rather stroll along the edge of he flowery precipice and find the view pleasant and the air brace and no doubt thing be very nicely arrange for he satisfaction and have it not be for the ever-present thought of angelum -- for he do think of she a great deal and with deep longing -- he should have enjoy himself thoroughly for every day be beautiful and every day bring its amusement with it perhaps on arrive at the quinta carr about eleven o'clock he would find that the steam launch be wait for they in a little bay where the cliff on which the house stand curved inwards then a merry party of young english folk all collect together by mr carr that morning by the dint of superhuman effort they would scramble down the step cut in the rock and steam off to some neighbouring islet to eat luncheon and wander about collect shell and flower and beetle till sunset and then steam back again through the spicy evening air laughing and flirt and make the night melodious with they song or else the horse would be order out and they would wander over the lonely mountain in the interior of the island talking of mummy and all thing human of angelum and all thing divine and sometimes in the course of these conversation arthur would in a brotherly way call mr carr mildr while occasionally in the tone of a spinster aunt she would address he as arthur a practice that once acquire she soon find be like all other bad habit not easy to get rid of for somehow in all these expedition she be continually at he side strive and not without success to weave herself into the substance of he life and to make herself indispensable to he till at last he grow to look upon she almost as a sister but beyond this he never go and to she advance he be as cold as ice simply because he never notice they and she be afraid of make they more obvious for fear that she would frighten he away he think it the most natural thing in the world that he and mildr should live together like brother and sister and be very fond of each other as sich whilst she think he -- just what he be -- the blindest of fool and then love he the more for he folly the sisterly relationship do not possess the same charm for mildr that it do for arthur they look at matter from different point of view one morning peeping through a big telescope that be fix in the window of the little boudoir which form a entrance lobby to the museum mr carr see a cloud of smoke upon the horizon presently the point of a mast poke up through the vapor as though the vessel be rise out of the ocean then two more masthead and a red and black funnel and last of all a great gray hull hurrah call out mr carr with one eye still fix to the telescope and the remainder of she little face all screw up in she effort to keep the other close it be the mail i can see the donald currie flag a white c on a blue ground well i be sure mildr there be no need for you to make you face look like a monkey if it be you look just as though the corner of you mouth be change place with you eyebrow agatha you be dreadfully rude when the fairy take you endowment in hand they certainly do not forget the gift of plain speech i shall appeal to mr heigham do i look like a monkey mr heigham no on second thought i will not wait for the inevitable compliment arthur hold you tongue and i will tell you something that must be the new boat the _ garth castle _ and i want to see over she captain smithson who be bring she out have get a box of thing for I what do you say if we kill two bird with one stone go and see the vessel and get we luncheon on board i be at you ladyship 's service answer arthur lazily but would you like to have the compliment apropo of the monkey i have think of something extremely neat now not on any account i hate compliment that be not mean and she eye give a little flash which put a point to she word agatha i suppose that you will come well yes dear the bay look pretty smooth smooth yes you might sail across it in a paper ship yawn arthur for goodness ' sake do not look so lazy mr heigham but ring the bell -- not that one the electric one -- and let we order the launch at once the mail will be at anchor in about a hour arthur do as he be bid and within that time they be steam through the throng of boat already surround the steamer my gracious mildred suddenly exclaim agatha do you see who that be there lean over the bulwark oh he be go but so sure as i be a living woman it be lord minster and lady florence thingumebob he sister you know the pretty one mildr look vex and glance involuntarily at arthur who be steer the launch for a moment she hesitate about go on and glance again at arthur the look seem to inspire she for she say nothing and presently he bring the boat deftly alongside the gangway ladder the captain of the ship have already come to the side to meet she have recognize she from the bridge indeed there be scarcely a man in donald currie 's service who do not know mr carr at any rate by sight how do you do mr carr be you come on to south africa with we no captain smithson i or rather we be come to lunch and to see you new boat and last but not least to claim my box mr carr will you ever forgive I i have lose it produce my box captain smithson or i will never speak to you again i 'll do more i 'll go over to the union line in which case i be afraid donald currie would never speak to I again i must certainly try to find that box and he whisper a order to a quartermaster well it be very kind of you to come and lunch and i hope that you and you friend will do so with I till then good-by i must be off as soon as they get on the quarter-deck arthur perceive a tall well-preserved man with a eyeglass whom he seem to know bear down upon they follow by a charming-looking girl about three-and - twenty year of age remarkable for she pleasant eye and the humorous expression of she mouth how do you do mr carr say the tall man i suppose that you hear that we be come it be very good of you to come and meet we i have not the slightest idea that you be come and i do not come to meet you lord minster i come to lunch answer mr carr rather coldly nasty one for jame that very murmur lady florence hope it will do he good i be determine to come and look you up as soon as i get time but the house sit very late however i have get a fortnight here now and shall see plenty of you a good deal too much i daresay lord minster but let I introduce you to mr heigham lord minster glance casually at arthur and lift he hat about a eighth of a inch be about to resume he conversation when arthur who be rather nettle by this treatment say i think i have have the pleasure of meeting you before lord minster we be stop together at the stanley fox last autumn stanley fox ah quite so forgive my forgetfulness but one meet so many people you see and he turn round to where mr carr have be but that lady have take the opportunity to retreat lord minster at once follow she well if my brother have forget you mr heigham i have not say lady florence now come forward for the first time do not you remember when we go nutting together and i tumble into the pond indeed i do lady florence and i can not tell you how pleased i be to see you again be you here for long a indefinite time : a old aunt of mine mr velley be come out by next mail and i be go to stop with she when my brother go back be you stay with mr carr oh no only i know she very well do you admire she immensely then you will not like jame -- i mean my brother why not because he also admire she immensely we both admire the view from here very much indeed but that be no reason why you and i should not like each other no but then you see

to mr heigham what do you already know each other oh yes mr carr we be old friend oh indeed that be very charming for you yes it be say lady florence frankly well we must be off now florence all right jame i be ready will you both come and dine with I to-night san facon there will be nobody else except agatha and mr heigham ask mrs carr we shall be delight say lord minster _ au revoir _ then nod lady florence to arthur and they separate when after lunch and see round the ship miss terry and arthur find themselves in the steam launch wait for mr carr who be say good-by to the captain and look after she precious box arthur take the opportunity to ask he companion what she know of lord minster oh not much that be nothing in particular except that he be the son of a sugar-broker or something who be make a peer for some reason or other and i suppose that be why he be so stick up because all the other peer i ever meet be just like other people he be very clever too be in the government now and always hang about after mildr he want to marry she you know and i expect that he will at last but i hope he will not i do not like he he always look at one as though one be dirt the deuce he do ejaculate arthur he heart fill on the instant with envy hatred malice and all uncharitableness towards lord minster he have not the slightest wish to marry mildr himself but he boil at the mere thought of anybody else do so lady florence be right there be a difference between lady and landscape at that moment mildr herself arrive but so disgusted be he that he would scarcely speak to she and on arrive at the landing stage he at once depart to the hotel and even try to get out of come to dinner that night but this be overrule good say mildr to herself with a smile i have find out how to vex he at dinner that evening lord minster who have of course take he hostess in open the conversation by ask she how she have be employ herself at madeira better than you have at st stephen 's lord minster at any rate i have not be forwarding scheme for highway robbery and the national disgrace she answer laugh i suppose that you mean the irish land act and the transvaal convention i have hear several lady speak of they like that and i be really come to the conclusion that you sex be entirely devoid of political instinct what do you mean by political instinct lord minster ask arthur by political instinct he reply i understand a proper appreciation of the science and object of government goodness I what be they ask mrs carr well the science of government consist roughly speak in know how to get into office and remain there when once in its object be to guess and give expression to the prevail popular feeling or whim with the loss of as few vote as possible accord to that definition say arthur all national question be or should be treat by those who understand the ` science and object of government ' on a semi-financial basis i mean they should be deal with as a investor deal with he fund in order to make as much out of they as possible not to bring real benefit to the country you put the matter rather awkwardly but i think i follow you i will try to explain in the first place all the old-fashioned jingo nonsense about patriotism and the ` honor of the country ' have if people only know it quite explode it only linger in a certain section of the land gentry and a proportion of the upper middle class and have no serious weight with lead politician how about lord beaconsfield well he be perhaps a exception but then he be a man with so large a mind -- i say it though i detest he -- that he could actually by a sort of political prescience see into the far future and shape he course accordingly but even in he case i do not believe that he be actuate by patriotism but rather by a keener insight into human affair than most man possess and yet he come terribly to grief because he outflew he age the will of the country -- which mean the will of between five hundred thousand and a million hungry fluctuate elector -- could not wait for the development of he imperial scheme they want plunder in the present not honor and prosperity for the empire in the future the instinct of robbery be perhaps the strongest in human nature and those who would rule humanity on its present basis must pander to it or fail the party of progress mean the party that can give most spoil take from those that have to those that have not that be why mr gladstone be such a truly great man he understand better than any one of he age how to excite the greed of hungry voter and to guide it for he own end what be the midlothian campaign but a crusade of plunder first he excite the desire then he promise to satisfy it of course that be impossible but at the time he be believe and he promise float we triumphantly into power the same argument apply to that body of elector whose motive power be sentiment -- they folly must be pander to for instance the transvaal convention that mr carr mention be a admirable example of how such pandering be do no man of experience can have believe that such a agreement could be wise or that it can result in anything but trouble and humiliation but the trouble and humiliation will not come just yet and in the meanwhile a sop be throw to cerberus political memory be short and when exposure come it will be easy to fix the blame upon the other side it be because we appreciate these fact that in the end we must prevail the liberal party or rather the radical section which be to the great liberal party what the helm be to the ship appeal to the baser instinct and more press appetite of the people the conservative only to they tradition and higher aspiration in the same way that religion appeal to the spirit and the worship of mammon to the sens the shibboleth of the one be ` self-interest ' of the other ` national honor ' the first appeal to the many the second to the finer few and i must leave you to judge which will carry the day and if ever you become prime minister shall you rule england upon these principle ask mrs carr certainly it be because i have master they that i be what i be i owe everything to they consequently in my view they be the finest of all principle then heaven help england soliloquized arthur rudely and so say we all add lady florence who be a strong conservative my dear young people answer lord minster with a superior smile england be quite capable of look after herself i have to look after myself she will at any rate last my time and my motto be that one should get something out of one 's country not attempt to do she service that would in all probability never be recognize or if recognize left unrewarded arthur be about to answer with more sharpness than discretion but mr carr interpose well lord minster we have to thank you for a very cynical and lucid explanation of the object of you party if they really be its object will you give I some wine after dinner mr carr devoted herself almost exclusively to lord minster leave arthur to talk to lady florence lord minster be not slow to avail himself of the opportunity i have be think of you remark to I in london about the crossing-sweeper he begin oh for heaven 's sake do not drag that wretched man out of he grave lord minster i really have forget what i say about he i hope mr carr that you have forget a good deal you say that day i may as well take this opportunity -- no please do not lord minster she answer know very well what be come i be so tired to-night oh in that case i can easily postpone my statement i have a whole fortnight before I mr carr secretly determine that it should remain as much as possible at he own exclusive disposal but she do not say so shortly after this arthur take he leave after shake hand very coldly with she nor do he come to the quinta next day as he have conceive too great a detestation of lord minster to risk meet he a detestation which he attribute solely to that rise member of the government 's political principle which jar very much with he own better and better say mr carr to herself as she take off she dress but lord minster be really odious i can not stand he for long chapter xlii why arthur i have almost forget what you be like say mildr when that young gentleman at last put in a appearance at the quinta where have you be to all this time i -- oh i have be write letter say arthur then they must have be very long one do not tell fib arthur you have not stop away from here for a day and a half in order to write letter what be the matter with you well if you must know mildred i detest you friend lord minster the mere sight of he set my tooth on edge and i do not want to meet he i only come here to-day because lady florence tell I that they be go up to the convent this afternoon so you have be to see lady florence no i meet she buying fruit yesterday and go for a walk with she in the interval of the letter-writing yes well do you know i detest lady florence that be very unkind of you she be charming from you point of view perhaps as she brother be from mine do you mean to tell I that you think that horrid fellow charming ask arthur in disgust why should i not oh for the matter of that there be no reason why you should not but i can not congratulate you either on you friend or you taste leave my taste out of the question why do you call lord minster my friend because miss terry tell I that he be she say that he be always propose to you and that you would probably marry he in the end mildr blush faintly she have no business to tell you but for the matter of that so have many other man it do not follow that because they choose to propose to I they be my friend no but then they have not marry you no more have he but while we be talk of it why should i not marry lord minster he can give I position influence everything that be dear to a woman except the rarest of all gift -- love but be love so rare mildred yes the love that it can satisfy a woman either to receive or to give especially the latter for in this we be more bless in give than in receive it be but very rarely that the most fortunate of we get a chance of accept such love as i mean and we can only give it once in we life but you have not tell I you reason against my marry lord minster because he be a mean-spirited selfish man if he be not he could not have talk as he do last night because you do not love he mildr you can not love such a man as that if he be fifty time a member of the government what do it matter to you arthur she say in a voice of indescribable softness bend she sunny head low over she work whether i love he or not my do so would not make you heart beat the faster i do not wish you to marry he he say confusedly she raise she head and look full at he with eye which shine like star through a summer mist that be enough arthur she answer in a tone of gentle submission if you do not wish it i will not and rise she leave the room arthur blush furiously at she word and a new sensation creep over he surely he say to himself she can not -- no of course she only mean that she will take my advice but though he dismiss the suspicion thus readily it leave something that he could not quite define behind it he have after the manner of young man be woman be concerned thought that he understand mildr thoroughly now he come to the modest conclusion that he know very little about she on the follow afternoon when he be at the quinta talk as usual to mr carr he see lord minster come up the step of the portico dress in much the same way and with exactly the same air as he be accustom to assume when he mount those of the reform or occasionally if he think that the hungry elector want pander to those of the new national club hullo say arthur here come lord minster in he war paint frock coat tall hat eye-glass and all good-bye why do you go away arthur stop and protect I say mildr laugh oh no indeed i do not want to spoil sport i would not interfere with you amusement on any account mildr look a little vexed well you will come back to dinner that depend upon what happen i tell you what would happen arthur good-bye perhaps it be as well to get it over at once think mildr in the hall arthur meet lord minster and they pass with a gesture of recognition so infinitesimally small that it almost fade into the nothingness of a cut so far as he could condescend to notice so low a thing at all he lordship have conceive a great dislike for arthur how do you do lord minster say mildr cordially i hear that you go to the convent yesterday what do you think of the view the view mr carr -- be there a view i do not notice it indeed i only go up there at all to please florence i do not like that sort of thing if you do not like rough it i be afraid that you do not enjoy you voyage out well no i do not think i do and there be a low fellow on board who have be ruin by the retrocession of the transvaal and who hear that i be in the government take every possible opportunity to tell I publicly that he wife and child be almost in a state of starvation as though i care about he confound wife and child he be positively brutal no certainly i do not enjoy it however i be reward by find you here i be very much flattered lord minster fix he eye-glass firmly in he eye plant he hand at the bottom of he trousers pocket and clear he throat place himself in the attitude that be so familiar to the house and begin mr carr i tell you when last i have the pleasure of see you that i should take the first opportunity of renew a conversation that i be force to suspend in order to attend if my memory serve I a very important committee meeting i be therefore surprised indeed i may almost say hurt when i find that you have suddenly flit from london indeed lord minster i will not however take up the time of this -- i mean you time by recapitulate all that i tell you on that occasion the fact be so to speak all upon the table and i will merely touch upon the main head of my case my prospects be these : i be now a member of the cabinet and enjoy owe to the unusual but calculated recklessness of my non-official public utterance a extraordinary popularity with a large section of the country the hungry section to which i allude last night it be probable that the course of the present government be pretty nearly run the country be sick of it and those who put it into power have not get enough out of it a dissolution be therefore a event of the near future the conservative will come in but they have no power of organization and very little political talent at they back above all they be deficient in energy probably because there be nothing that they can destroy and therefore no pickings to struggle for in short they be not ` capaces imperii ' the want of these quality and of leader will very soon undermine they hold upon the country always a slight one and assist by a few other push man i anticipate by carefully play into the hand of the irish party which will really rule england in the future be able as one of the leader of the opposition to consummate they downfall then will come my opportunity and if luck go with I i shall be first lord of the treasury within half a dozen year but now come the difficulty though i be so popular with the country i be for some reason quite inexplicable to myself rather at a -- hum -- a discount amongst my colleague and that influential section of society to which they belong now in order to succeed to the full extent that i have plan it be absolutely essential that i should win the countenance of this class and the only way that i can see of do it be by marry some woman charming enough to disarm dislike beautiful enough to command admiration rich enough to entertain profusely and clever enough to rule england those desideratum be all to a striking degree unite in you person mr carr and i have therefore much pleasure in ask you to become my wife you have as i understand you lord minster make a very admirable statement of how desirable it be for yourself that you should marry I but it be not so clear what advantage i should reap by marry you why the advantage be obvious : if by you help i can become prime minister you would become the wife of the prime minister the prospect fail to dazzle I i have everything that i want why should i strive to reach a grandeur to which i be not bear and which to speak the truth i regard with a very complete indifference but there be another point in all you speech you have say nothing of any affection that you have to offer not a single word of love -- you have be content to expatiate on the profit that a matrimonial investment would bring to yourself and by reflection to the other contract party love ask lord minster with a expression of genuine surprise why you talk like a character in a novel now tell I mr carr _ what _ be love it be difficult to define lord minster but as you ask I to do so i will try love to a woman be what the sun be to the world it be she life she animating principle without which she must droop and if the plant be very tender die except under its influence a woman can never attain she full growth never touch the height of she possibility or bloom into the plenitude of she moral beauty a loveless marriage dwarf we nature a marriage where love be develop they to they utmost and what be love to a man well i should say that nine of a man 's passion be merely episode in he career the mile-stone that mark he path the tenth or the first be he philosopher 's stone that turn all thing to gold or if the charm do not work leave he heart break and bankrupt a cold monument of failure i do not quite follow you and i must say that speak for myself i never feel anything of all this say lord minster blankly i know you do not lord minster you only passion tend towards political triumph and personal aggrandisement we be at the two pole you see and i fear that we can never never meet upon a common matrimonial line but do not be down-heart about it you will find plenty more woman who fulfil all you requirement and will be very happy to take you at you own valuation if only a woman be necessary to success you need not look far and forgive I if i say that i believe it will not make much difference to you who she be but all the same lord minster i will venture to give you a piece of advice : next time you propose address yourself a little more to the lady 's affection and a little less to she interest and mr carr rise as though to show that the interview be at a end be i then to understand that my offer be definitely refuse ask lord minster stiffly i be afraid so and i be sure that you will on reflection see how utterly unsuited we be to each other possibly mr carr possibly at present all that i see be that you have have a great opportunity and have fail to avail yourself of it my only consolation be that the loss will be yours and my only regret be that i have have the trouble of come to this place for nothing however there be a ship due to-morrow and i shall sail in she i be sorry to have be the cause of bring you here lord minster and still more sorry that you should feel oblige to cut short you stay good-bye lord minster we part friend i hope oh certainly mr carr i wish you a very good morning mr carr and he lordship march out of mildr 's life there go my chance of become the wife of a prime minister and make a figure in history say that lady as she watch he tall figure stalk stiffly down the avenue well i be glad of it i would just as soon have marry a speech-making figure-head stuff full of the purest radical principle on the follow day arthur meet lady florence again in the town where have you be to lady florence he say to see my brother off she answer without any sign of deep grief what have he go already yes you friend mr carr have be too many for poor jame what do you mean that he have be propose yes and get more than he bargain for be he cut up he no but he vanity be you see mr heigham it be this way my brother may be a very great man and a pillar of the state and all that sort of thing i do not say he be not but from personal experience i _ know _ that he be a awful prig and think that all woman be machine construct to advance the comfort of you noble sex well he have come down a peg or two that be all and he do not like it good - bye i be in a hurry lady florence be nothing if not outspoken chapter xliii a week or so after the departure of lord minster mildr suggest that they should on the follow day vary they amusement by go up to the convent a building perch on the hill some thousand foot above the town of funchal in palanquin or rather hammock swing upon long pole arthur who have never yet travel in these luxurious conveyance jump at the idea and even miss terry when she discover that she be to be carry make no objection the party be complete by the addition of a newly-married couple of whom mr carr have know something at home and who have come to madeira to spend the honeymoon lady florence also have be ask but rather to arthur 's disappointment she could not come when the long line of swing hammock each with its two sturdy bearer be marshal and the adventurous voyager have settle themselves in they they really form quite a impose procession head as it be by the extra-sized one that carry miss terry who complain bitterly that the thing wobble and make she feel sick but to arthur 's mind there be something effeminate in allow himself a strong active man to be cart up hill as steep as the side of a house by two perspire wretch so hot as it be he to the intense amusement of he bearer elect to get out and walk the newly-married man follow he example and for a while they go on together till presently the latter gravitate towards he wife 's palanquin and overcome at so long a separation squeeze she hand between the curtain not wish to intrude himself on they conjugal felicity arthur in he turn gravitate to the side of mr carr who be be lightly swing along in the second palanquin some twenty yard behind miss terry 's shortly afterwards they observe a signal of distress be fly by that lady whose arm be to be see violently agitate she green veil from between the curtain of she hammock which immediately come to a dead stop what be it cry arthur and mildr in a breath as they arrive on the scene of the suppose disaster my dear mildr will you be so kind as to tell that man -lrb- point to she front bearer a stout flabby individual -rrb- that he must not go on carry I i must have a cooler man it make I positively ill to see he puff and blow and drip under my nose like a fresh basted joint miss terry 's realistic description of she bearer 's appearance which be to say the least of it limp and moist be no exaggeration but then she herself as arthur well remember be no feather-weight especially when as in the present case she have to be cart up the side of a nearly perpendicular hill some mile long a fact very well exemplify by the condition of the bearer my dear agatha reply mildr laugh what be to be do of course the man be hot you be not a feather-weight but what be to be do i do not know but i will not go on with he it be simply disgust he might let himself out as a watering-cart but we can not get another here then he must cool himself the other might come and fan he i will not go on till he be cool and that be flat he will take hour to cool and meanwhile we be broil on this hot road you really must come on agatha i have it say arthur miss terry must turn herself round with she head towards the back of the hammock and then she will not see he to this arrangement the aggrieved lady be after some difficulty persuade to accede and the procession start again they destination reach they picnic as they have arrange and then separate the bride and bridegroom stroll off in one direction and mildr and arthur in another whilst miss terry mount guard over the plate and dish presently arthur and mildr come to a little english-looking grove of pine and oak that extend down a gentle slope and be border by a steep bank at the foot of which great fern and beautiful madeira flower twine themselves into a shelter from the heat here they sit down and gaze at the splendid and many-tinted view set in its background of emerald ocean what a view it be say arthur look mildr how dark the clump of sugar-cane look against the green of the vine and how pretty the red roof of the town be peep out of the grove of fruit-tree do you see the great shadow throw upon the sea by that cliff how deep and cool the water look within it and how it sparkle where the sun strike yes it be beautiful and the pine smell sweet i wish angelum could see it he say half to himself mildr who be lie back lazily among the fern she hat off she eye close so that the long dark lash lay upon she cheek and she head rest on she arm suddenly start up what be the matter nothing you wake I from a sort of dream that be all this spring i remember go with she to look at a view near the abbey house and say -- what i often think when i look at anything beautiful and full of life -- that it depress one to know that all this be so much food for death and its beauty a thing that to-day be and to-morrow be not and what do she say she say that to she it speak of immortality and that in everything around she she see evidence of eternal life she must be very fortunate shall i tell you of what it remind I what of neither death nor immortality but of the full happy pulsing existence of the hour and of the beautiful world that pessimist like yourself and mystic like you angelum think so poorly of but which be really so glorious and so rich in joy why this sunlight and those flower and the wide sparkle of that sea be each and all a happiness and the health in we vein and the beauty in we eye deep pleasure that we never realize till we lose they death indeed come to we all but why add to its terror by thinking of they whilst it be far off and as for life after death it be a faint vague thing more likely to be horrible than happy this world be we only reality the only thing that we can grasp here alone we _ know _ that we can enjoy and yet how we waste we short opportunity for enjoyment soon youth will have slip away and we shall be too old for love rose fade fastest arthur when the sun be bright in the evening when they have fall and the ground be red with wither petal do you not think we shall wish that we have gather more yours be a pleasant philosophy mildr he say struggle faintly in he own mind against she conclusion but at this moment somehow he finger touch she own and be presently lock fast within she little palm and for the first time in he life they sit hand in hand but happily for he he do not venture to look into she eye and before many minute have pass miss terry 's voice be hear call he loudly i suppose that you must go say mildr with a shade of vexation in she voice and a good many shades upon she face or she will be blunder down here i will come too it be time for tea on arrive at the spot whence the sound proceed they find miss terry surround by a crowd of laughing and excited bearer and pour out a flood of the most vigorous english upon a unfortunate islander who stand a silver mug in each hand bowing and shrug he shoulder and enunciate with every variety of movement indicative of humiliation these mystic word : mee washeeuppee signora washeeuppee -- e what _ be _ the matter now agatha matter why i wake up and find this man steal the cup i charge he at once with my umbrella but he dodge and i fall down and the umbrella have go over the rock there take he up at once arthur -- there be the steal property on he person hand he over to justice good gracious agatha what be you think about the poor man only want to wash the thing out then i should like to know why he could not tell I so in plain english say miss terry retire discomfited amidst shout of laughter from the whole party include the suppose thief after tea they all set out on a grand beetle-hunting expedition and so intent be they upon this fascinating pursuit that they do not note the flight of time till suddenly mildr pull out she watch give a pretty cry of alarm do you know what time it be good people half-past six and the custance be to dine with we at a quarter-past-seven it will take we a good hour to get down what _ shall _ we do i know say arthur there be two sledge just below i see they as we come up they will take we down to funchal in a quarter of a hour and we can get to the quinta by about seven arthur you be invaluable the very thing come on all of you quick now these sledge be peculiar to madeira be make on the principle of the bullock car with the difference that they travel down the smooth stone-paved roadway by they own momentum guide by two skilled conductor each with one foot naked to prevent he slip who hold the rope and when the sledge begin to travel more swiftly than they can follow mount upon the project end of the runner and be carry with it by means of the swift and exhilarating rush of these sledge the traveller traverse the distance that it take some hour to climb in a very few minute indeed he journey up and down may be very well compare with that of the well-known british sailor who take five hour to get up majuba mountain but accord to he own forcibly tell story come down again with a almost incredible rapidity it may therefore be imagine that sledge - travel in madeira be not very well suit to nervous voyager miss terry have at time see these wheelless vehicle shoot from the top of a mountain to the bottom like a balloon with the gas out and have also hear of occasional accident in connection with they stoutly she vow that nothing should induce she to trust she neck to one of they but you must agatha or else be leave behind they be as safe as a church and i can not leave the custance to wait till half-past eight for dinner come get in arthur can go in front and hold you i will sit behind thus admonish -- miss terry enter groan arthur take he seat beside she and mr carr hers in a sort of dickey behind the newly - married pair who do not half like it possess themselves of the smaller sledge determine to brave extinction in each other 's arm then the conductor seize the rope and plant they one naked foot firmly before they await the signal to depart stop say miss terry lift the recover umbrella that man have forget to put on he shoe and stock on he right leg he will cut he foot and besides it do not look respectable to be see fly through a place with a one-legged ragamuffin -- let she go shout arthur and they do to some purpose for in a minute they be pass down that hill like a flash of light wood and house appear and vanish like the vision of a dream and the soft air go singing away on either side of they as they cleave it fly downward at a angle of thirty degree and leave nothing behind they but the sound of miss terry 's lamentation soon they near the bottom but there be yet a dip -- the deepest of they all with a sharp turn at the end of it -- to be traverse away go the little connubial sled in front like a pigeon down the wind away they speed after it like a eagle in pursuit _ crack _ go the little sledge into the corner and out shoot the happy pair _ crash _ go the big sledge into it and arthur become conscious of a wild yell of a green veil flutter through the air and of a fall as on to a feather-bed miss terry 's superior weight have bring she to she mother earth the first and he after a higher heavenward flight have light upon the top of she he pick she up and sit she down against a wall to recover she breath and then fish mildr dirty and bruised but as usual laugh out of a gutter the loving pair have already rise and in a agony of mutual anxiety be rub each other 's shin and then he start back with a cry for there before he survey the disaster with a air of mingled amusement and benevolence stand -- sir john and lady bellamy have it be the prince and princess of evil -- if as be probable there be a princess -- arthur could scarcely have be more astounded somehow he have always in he thought regard sir john and lady bellamy when he think about they at all as possess indeed individual character and tendency but as completely adscripti gleba of the neighborhood of the abbey house as that house itself he would as soon have expect to see caresfoot 's staff re-rooted in the soil of madeira as to find they stroll about funchal he rub he eye perhaps he think he have be knock silly and be labor under a hallucination no there be no doubt about it there they be just the same as he have see they at isleworth except that if possible sir john look even more like a ripe apple than usual while the sun have brown he wife 's egyptian face and give she a last finish as a perfect type of cleopatra nor be the recognition on he side only for next second he hand be grasp first by sir john and then by lady bellamy when we last meet mr heigham say the gentleman with a benevolent beam i think i express a wish that we might soon renew we acquaintance but i little thought under what circumstance we next meeting would take place and he point to the overturn sledge and the prostrate sledger you have have a very merciful escape chime in lady bellamy cordially with so many hard stone about affair might have end differently now then mr heigham we have better set to and run that be if agatha have get a run leave in she or we shall be late after all thank goodness nobody be hurt but we must find a hammock for agatha for to judge from she groan she think she be be my nose -- oh i beg you pardon and mr carr stop short observe for the first time that he be talk to stranger do not let I detain you if you be in a hurry i be so thankful that nobody be hurt say lady bellamy i believe that we be stop at the same hotel mr heigham i see you name in the book so we shall have plenty of opportunity of meeting but arthur feel that there be one question which he must ask before he go on whether or no it exceed the strict letter of he agreement with philip so call to mr carr that he be come he say with a blush how be miss caresfoot when -- when you last see she lady bellamy perfectly well she answer smile and more lovely than ever add she husband thank you for that news it be the best i have hear for some time good-bye for the present we shall meet to-morrow at breakfast and he run on after the other happier than he have be for month feel that he have come again within call of angelum and as though he have never sit hand in hand with mildr carr chapter xliv at breakfast on the follow morning arthur as he have anticipate meet the bellamy sir john come down first array in true english fashion in a tourist suit of gray and presently lady bellamy follow as she enter dress in trail white and walk slowly up the long table every eye be turn upon she for she be one of those woman who attract attention as surely and unconsciously as a magnet attract iron arthur look with the rest think that he have never see a stranger or at the same time a more impose - look woman time have not yet touch she beauty or impaired she vigorous constitution and at forty she be still at the zenith of she charm the dark hair that throw out glint light of copper when the sun strike it still curl in its clustering ringlet and show no line of gray while the mysterious heavy-lidded eye and the coral lip be as full of rich life and beauty as they have be when she and hilda von holtzhausen first meet at rewtham house on she face too be the same expression of quiet power of conscious superiority and calm command that have always distinguish it arthur try to think what it remind he of and remember that the same look be to be see upon the stone feature of some of the egyptian statue in mildred 's museum how splendid lady bellamy look he say almost unconsciously to he neighbor sir john do not answer and arthur glance up to learn the reason see that he also be watch the approach of he wife and that he face be contorted with a sudden spasm of intense malice and hatred whilst he little pig-like eye glitter threateningly he have not even hear the remark arthur would have like to whistle he have surprise a secret how do you do mr heigham i hope that you be not bruise after you tumble yesterday good morning john arthur rise and shake hand i never be more surprised in my life he say than when i see you and sir john at the top of the street there may i ask what bring you to madeira health sir health answer the little man cough catarrh influenza and all that be damn -- ah infernal my husband mr heigham strike in lady bellamy in she full rich tone have a severe threatening of chest disease and the doctor recommend a trip to some warmer climate unfortunately however he business arrangement will not permit of a long stay we only stop here three week at most i be sorry to hear that you be not well sir john oh it be nothing very much answer lady bellamy for he only he require care what a lovely garden this be -- be it not by the way i forget to inquire after the lady who share you tumble i hope that they be none the worse i be much strike with one of they the very pretty person with the brown hair whom you pull out of the gutter oh mr carr yes she be pretty after breakfast arthur volunteer to take lady bellamy round the garden with the ulterior object of extract some more information about angelum it must be remember that he have no cause to mistrust that lady nor have he any knowledge of the event which have recently happen in the neighborhood of the abbey house he be therefore perfectly frank with she i suppose that you have hear of my engagement lady bellamy oh yes mr heigham it be quite a subject of conversation in the roxham neighborhood angelum caresfoot be a sweet and very beautiful girl and i congratulate you much you know then of its condition yes i hear of they and think they ridiculous indeed i try at angelum 's suggestion to do you a good turn with philip caresfoot and get he to modify they but he would not he be a curious man philip and when he once get a thing into he head it be beyond the power of most people to drive it out again i suppose that you be spend you year of probation here well yes -- i be try to get through the time in that way but it be slow work i think you seem pretty happy yesterday she answer smile arthur blush oh yes i may appear to be but tell I all about angelum i have really very little to tell she seem to be live as usual and look well she friend mr fraser have come back but i must be go in i have promise to go out walk with sir john _ au revoir _ mr heigham leave to himself arthur remember that he also have a appointment to keep -- namely to meet mildr by the cathedral step and go with she to choose some madeira jewellery a undertaking which she do not feel competent to carry out without he assistance when he reach the cathedral he find she rather cross at have be keep wait for ten minute it be very rude of you she say but i suppose that you be so take up with the conversation of you friend that you forget the time by the way who be they anybody you have tell I about in the pause of select the jewellery arthur tell she all he know about the bellamy and of they connection with the neighborhood of the abbey house the story cause mildr to open she brown eye and look thoughtful just as they come out of the shop who should they run into but the bellamy themselves chaffer for madeira work with a woman in the street arthur stop and speak to they and then introduce mr carr who after a little conversation ask they up to lunch after this mildr and lady bellamy meet a good deal the two woman interested each other one night when the bellamy have be about ten day in madeira the conversation take a personal turn sir john and arthur be sit over they wine -lrb- they be dine with mr carr -rrb- agatha terry be fast asleep on a sofa so that lady bellamy and mildr seat upon lounging-chair by a table with a light on it place by a open window be practically alone oh by the way lady bellamy say mildr after a pause i believe that you be acquaint with the young lady to whom mr heigham be engage she have mean to say to be marry but the word stick in she throat oh yes i know she well i be so glad i be quite curious to hear what she be like one can never put much faith in lover ' rapture you know do you mean in person or in character both well angelum caresfoot be as lovely a woman as ever i see with a noble figure well-set head and magnificent eye and hair mildr turn a little pale and bit she lip as to she character i can hardly describe it she live in a atmosphere of she own a atmosphere that i can not reach or at any rate can not breathe but if you can imagine a woman whose mind be enrich with learning as profound as that of the first classical scholar of the day and tinge with a originality all she own a woman whose faith be as steady as that star and whose love be deep as the sea and as definite as its tide who live to higher end than those we strive for whose whole life indeed give one the idea that it be the shadow -- imperfect perhaps but still the shadow -- of a immortal light : then you will get some idea of angelum caresfoot she be a woman intellectually physically and spiritually immeasurably above the man on whom she have set she affection that can not be say mildr softly like draw to like she must have find something in he some better part some affinity of which you know nothing after this she fall into silence presently lady bellamy raise she eye just now fill up with the great pupil and fix they on mildr you be think she say slowly that angelum caresfoot be a formidable rival mildred start how can you pretend to read my thought she laugh a little i be a adept at the art do not be down-heart i should not be surprise if after all the engagement between mr heigham and angelum caresfoot should come to nothing of course i speak in perfect confidence of course well the marriage be not altogether agreeable to the father who would prefer another and more suitable match but unfortunately there be no way of shake the young lady 's determination indeed but i think that with assistance a way might be find they eye meet and this time mildred take up the parable should i be wrong lady bellamy if i suppose that you have not come to madeira solely for pleasure a wise person always try to combine business and pleasure and in this case the business combine be in connection with mr heigham 's engagement exactly and suppose that i be to tell he this have i not know that you would on no account tell mr heigham i should not have tell you and how do you know that i will answer you question by another do you ever yet know a woman who love a man willingly help he to the arm of a rival unless indeed she be force to it she add with something like a sigh mildr carr 's snowy bosom heave tumultuously and the rose-leaf hue fade from she cheek you mean that i be in love with arthur heigham on what do you base that belief on a base as broad as the pyramid of which you be talk at dinner public report not nearly so mislead a guide as people think you face you voice you eye all betray you why do you always try to get near he to touch he -- answer I that i have see you do it three time this evening once you hand he a book in order to touch he hand beneath it but there be no need to enumerate what you doubtless very well remember no nice woman mr carr ever like to continually touch a man unless she love he you be always listen for he voice and step you be listen for they now you eye follow he face as a dog do he master 's -- when you speak to he you voice be a caress in itself shall i go on i think that it be unnecessary whether you be right or not i will give you the credit of be a close observer to observe with I be at once a task and a amusement and the habit be one that lead I to accurate conclusion as i think you will admit the conclusion i have come to in you case be that you do not wish to see arthur heigham marry to another woman i speak just now of assistance -- i have none to give i will give none how could i look he in the face you be strangely scrupulous for a woman in you position i have always try to behave like a honorable woman lady bellamy and i do not feel inclined to do otherwise now perhaps you will think differently when it come to the point but in the meanwhile remember that people who will not help themselves can not expect to be help once and for all lady bellamy understand I i fight for my own hand with the weapon which nature and fortune have give I and by myself i will stand or fall i will join in no scheme to separate arthur from this woman if i can not win he for myself by myself i will at any rate lose he fairly i will respect what you have tell I but i will do no more lady bellamy smile as she answer -- i really admire you courage it be quite quixotic hush here come the gentleman chapter xlv a few day after the dinner at the quinta carr the bellamy ' visit to madeira draw to a close on the evening before they departure arthur volunteer to take lady bellamy down to the parade to hear the band play after they have walk about a while under the shade of the magnolia-tree which be star all over with creamy cup of bloom and sufficiently inspect the gay throng of portuguese inhabitant and english visitor make gayer still by the amazingly gorgeous uniform of the official arthur spy two chair in a comparatively quiet corner and suggest that they should sit down lady bellamy he say after hesitate a while you be a woman of the world and i believe a friend of my own i want to ask you advice about something it be entirely at you service mr heigham well really it be very awkward -- shall i turn my head so as not to see you blush do not laugh at I lady bellamy of course you will say nothing of this if you doubt my discretion mr heigham do not choose I as a confidante you be go unless i be mistaken to speak to I about mr carr yes it be about she but how do you know that you always seem to be able to read one 's thought before one speak do you know sometimes i think that she have take a fancy to I do you see and i want to ask you what you think about it well suppose that she have most young man mr heigham would not talk of such a thing in a tone befitting a great catastrophe but if i be not enter too deeply into particulars what make you think so well really i do not exactly know she sometimes give I a general idea oh then there have be nothing tangible well yes once she take my hand or i take hers i do not know which but i do not think much of that because it be the sort of thing that be always happen do not you know and nine time out of ten mean nothing at all but why i ask you about it be that if there be anything of the sort i have better cut and run out of this because it would not be fair to stop either to she or to angelum or myself it would be dangerous you see play with such a woman as mildr so you would go away if you think that she take any warmer interest in you than lady generally do in man engage to be marry certainly i should well then i think that i can set you mind at ease i have observe mr carr pretty closely and in the way you suppose she care for you no more than she do for you coat she be no doubt a bit of a flirt and very likely wish to get you to fall in love with she -- a natural ambition on the part of a woman but as for be in love with you herself the idea be absurd woman of the world do not fall in love so readily they be too much take up with think about themselves to have time to think about anybody else with they it be all self self self from morning till night besides look at the common-sense side of the thing do you suppose it likely that a person of mr carr 's wealth and beauty who have only to lift she hand to have all london at she foot be likely to fix she affection upon a young man whom she know be already engage to be marry and who -- forgive I if i say so -- have not get the same recommendation to she favor that many of she suitor have it be of course quite possible that mr carr 's society may be dangerous to you in which case it might be wise for you to go but i really do not think that you need feel any anxiety on she account she find you a charming companion and in some way a useful one and that be all when you go somebody else will soon fill the vacant space then that be all right say arthur though somehow he do not feel as wildly delighted as he should have do at hear it so clearly demonstrate that mildr do not care a brass button about he but then that be human nature between eighteen and thirty-five ninety per cent of the man in the world would like to center in themselves the affection of every young and pretty woman they know even if there be not the ghost of a chance of they marry one of they the same tendency be to be observe conversely in the other sex only in they case with a still smaller proportion of exception by the way ask arthur presently how be my late guardian mr george caresfoot not at all well i be sorry to say i be very anxious about he health he be in the south of england now for a change i be sorry he be ill do you know i daresay you will think I absurd but you have take a weight off my mind i always have a idea that he want to marry angelum and sometimes i be afraid that i have suspect that philip caresfoot cart I off in order to give he a chance you see philip be uncommonly fond of money and george be rich what a absurd idea mr heigham why george look upon matrimony as a institution of the evil one he admire angelum i know -- he always do admire a pretty face but as for dream of marry a girl half he age and he own cousin into the bargain it be about the last thing that he would do i be glad to hear it i be sure i have be uncomfortable enough think about he sometimes lady bellamy will you do something for I what be that mr heigham tell angelum all about I but would that be quite honorable mr heigham -- under the condition of you engagement i mean you never promise not to talk about I i only promise not to attempt verbal or written communication with angelum well i will tell she that i meet you and that you be well and if philip will allow I i will tell she more but of course i do not know if he will or not what ring be that you wear it be one that angela give I when we become engage it be she mother 's will you let I look at it arthur hold out he hand the ring be a antique a large emerald cut like a seal and heavily set in a band of dull gold on the face of the stone be engrave some mysterious character what be that engrave on the stone i be not sure but angela tell I that mr fraser have take a impression of it and forward it to a great oriental scholar he friend say that the stone must be extremely ancient as the character be a form of sanscrit and that he believe the word to mean ` for ever ' or ` eternity ' angelum say that it have be in she mother 's family for generation and be suppose to have be bring from the east about the year 1700 that be all i know about it the motto be better suit to a wedding-ring than to a engagement stone say lady bellamy with one of she dark smile why because engagement be like promise and pie-crust make to be break i hope that will not be the case with ours however say arthur attempt a laugh i hope not i be sure but never pin you faith absolutely to any woman or you will regret it always accept she oath and protestation as you would a political statement politely and with a appearance of perfect faith but with a certain grain of mistrust woman 's fidelity be in the main a fiction we be faithful just as man be so long as it suit we to be so with this difference however man play false from passion or impulse woman from calculation you do not draw a please picture of you own sex when be the truth please it be only when we clothe its nakedness with the rag of imagination or sweeten it with fiction that it can please of itself it be so ugly a thing that society in its refinement will not even hear it but prefer to employ a corresponding formulum thus all passion however vile be call by the name of ` love ' all superstitious terror and grovel attempt to conciliate the unseen be know as ` religion ' while selfish greed and the hungry lust for power masquerade as laudable ` ambition ' man and woman especially woman hate the truth because like the electric light it show they as they be and that be vile it have grow so strange to they from disuse that like pilate they do not even know what it be i be go to say however that if you care to trust I with it i think i see how i can take a message to angelum for you -- without either cause you to break you promise or do anything dishonourable myself how well if you like i will take she that ring i think that be a very generous offer on my part for i do not like the responsibility but what be the use of take she the ring it be something that there can be no mistake about that be all a speak message from yourself but do not give it I if you do not like perhaps you have rather not i do not like parting with it at all i confess but i should dearly like to send she something i suppose that you would not take a letter you would not write one mr heigham no of course i forget that accursed promise here take the ring and say all you can to angela with it you promise that you will certainly i promise that i will say all i can you be very good and kind i wish to heaven that i be go to marlshire with you if you only know how i long to see she again i think that it would break my heart if anything happen to separate we and he lip quiver at the thought lady bellamy turn she sombre face upon he -- there be compassion in she eye if you bear angelum caresfoot so great a love be guide by I and shake it off strangle it -- be rid of it anyhow for fulfil affection of that nature would carry a larger happiness with it than be allow in a world plan expressly to secure the greatest misery of the greatest number there be a fate which fight against it its minister be human folly and passion you have see many marriage tell I how many have you know out of a novel where the people marry they true love in novel they always do it be another of society 's pleasant fiction but real life be like a novel without the third volume i do not want to alarm you mr heigham but because i like you i ask you to steel you mind to disappointment so that if a blow come it may not crush you what do you mean lady bellamy do you know of any impending trouble i certainly not i only talk on general principle do not be over - confident and _ never _ trust a woman come let we get home next morning when arthur come down to breakfast the bellamy have sail the mail have come in from the cape at midnight and leave again at dawn take they with it chapter xlvi the departure of the bellamy leave arthur in very low spirit he sensation be similar to those which one can well imagine a ancient greek might have experience who have send to consult the delphic oracle have get for he pain a very unsatisfactory reply foreshadow evil but not actually define they lady bellamy be in some way connect with the idea of a oracle in he mind she look oracular she dark face and inscrutable eye the stamp of power upon she brow all suggest that she be a mistress of the black art she word too be mysterious and fraught with bitter wisdom and a deep knowledge distil from the poisonous weed of life arthur feel with something like a shudder that if lady bellamy prophesy evil evil be follow hard upon she word and in warn he not to place he whole heart 's happiness upon one venture lest it should meet with shipwreck he be sure that she be prophesy with a knowledge of the future deny to ordinary mortal how earnestly too she have caution he against put absolute faith in angelum -- so earnestly indeed that she talk have leave a flavor of distrust in he mind yet how could he mistrust angelum nor be he comfort by a remark that fall from mildr carr the afternoon follow the departure of the mail raise she eye she glance at he hand what be you look at he say be not that queer emerald you wear you engagement ring yes what have you do with it i give it to lady bellamy to give to angela what for to show she that i be alive and well i may not write you know you be very confide what do you mean nothing at least i mean that i do not think that i should care to hand over my engagement ring so easily it might be misapply you know this view of the matter help to fill up the cup of arthur 's nervous anxiety and he vainly ply mildr with question to get she to elucidate she meaning and state she cause of suspicion if she have any but she would say nothing more on the subject which then drop and be not allude to again between they after the bellamy ' departure the time wear on at madeira without bring about any appreciable change in the situation but mildr saw that they visit have rob she of any advantage she have gain over arthur for they have as it be bring angelum 's atmosphere with they and faint though it be it suffice to overpower she influence he make no move forward and seem to have entirely forget the episode on the hill when he have go so very near disaster on the contrary he appear to she to grow increasingly preoccupy as time go on and to look upon she more and more in the light of a sister till at length she patience wear thin as for she passion it grow almost unrestrainable in its confinement now she drift like a rudderless vessel on a sea which rage continuously and know no space of calm and so little oil be pour upon the troubled water there be so few break in the storm-wall that rise black between she and the desire haven of she rest indeed she begin to doubt if even she poor power of charming he as at first she have be able to do with the sparkle of she wit and the half - unconscious display of she natural grace be not on the wane and if she be not near to lose she precarious foothold in he esteem and affection the thought that he might be tire of she strike she like a freezing wind and for a moment turn she heart to ice poor mildr higher than ever above she head bloom that blue rise she long to pluck would she ever reach it after all she strive even to gather one poor leaf one withered petal the path which lead to it be very hard to climb and below the breaker boil would it after all be she fate to fall down into that gulf of which the sorrowful water could bring neither death nor forgetfulness and so christmas come and go one day when they be all sit in the drawing-room some eight week after the bellamy have leave and mildr be let she mind run on such thought as these arthur who have be read a novel get up and open the folding-door at the end of the room which separate it from the second drawing-room and also the further door between that room and the dining-room then he return and stand at the top of the big drawing-room take a bird 's - eye view of the whole suite what _ be _ you do arthur i be reflect mildr that with such a suite of apartment at you command it be a sin and a shame not to give a ball i will give a ball if you like arthur will you dance with I if i do how many time he say laugh well i will be moderate -- three time let I see -- the first waltz the waltz before supper and the last galop you will dance I off my head it be dangerous to waltz with any one so pretty he say in that banter tone he often take with she and which aggravate she intensely it be more likely that my own head will suffer as i dance so rarely then that be a bargain certainly dear I mildr how silly you be you be like a schoolgirl say miss terry agatha be put out because you do not offer to dance three time with she oh but i will though if she like three quadrille and so the matter pass off in mutual badinage but mildr do not forget she intention on the contrary society at madeira be soon profoundly agitate by the intelligence that the lady croesus mr carr be about to give a magnificent ball and so ill-natured -- or rather so give to jump to conclusion -- be society that it be freely say it be in order to celebrate she engagement to arthur heigham arthur hear nothing of this one be always the last to hear thing about oneself mildred know of it however but whether from indifference or from some hidden motive she neither take any step to contradict it herself nor would she allow miss terry to do so nonsense she say let they talk to contradict such thing only make people believe they the more mind now agatha not a word of this to mr heigham it would put he out well mildr i should have think that you would be put out too i -- oh no worse thing might happen and she shrug she shoulder at length the much-expected evening come and the arrive guest find that the ball have be plan on a scale such as madeira have never before behold the night be lovely and sufficiently still to admit of the illumination of the garden by means of chinese lantern that glow all around in hundred and be even hang like golden fruit amongst the topmost leaf of the lofty cabbage palm and from the tallest spray of the bamboo within the scene be equally beautiful the suite of three reception-room have be throw into one two for dancing and one for use as a sitting-room they be quite full for the madeira season be at its height and all the english visitor who be anybody be there there happen too to be a man-of-war in the harbor every man-jack or rather every officer-jack of which with the exception of those on watch -- and they be to be relieve later on -- be there and prepare to enjoy himself with a gusto characteristic of the british sailor-man the room too be by no means devoid of beauty but by far the loveliest woman in they be mrs carr herself she be simply dress in a perfectly-fitting black satin gown loop up with diamond star that show off the exquisite fairness of she skin to great perfection she ornament be also diamond but such diamond -- not little flower and bird construct of tiny stone but large single gem each the size of a hazel-nut on she head she wear a tiara of these eleven stone in all five on each side and surmount over the center of the forehead by a enormous gem as large as a small walnut which standing by itself above the level of the other flash and blaze like a fairy star around she neck wrist and waist be similar point of concentrated light that shine against the black satin as she move give she a truly magnificent appearance never before have mildr carr look so perfectly lovely for she face and form be well worthy of the gem and dress indeed most of the man there that night think she eye as beautiful as she diamond the ball open with a quadrille but in this mr carr do not dance be employ in the reception of she guest then follow a waltz and as its first strain strike up several applicant come to compete for the honor of she hand but she decline they all say that she be already engage and presently arthur look very tall and quite the typical young englishman in he dress-clothes come hurry up you be late mr heigham she say the music have begin yes i be awfully sorry i be dance with lady florence and could not find she old aunt indeed to I mrs velley be pretty conspicuous with that green thing on she head but come along we be waste time put he arm round she waist they sail away together amidst of the murmur of the disappointed applicant lucky dog say one infernal puppy mutter another arthur enjoy he waltz very much for the room though full be not crowd and mildr waltz well still he be a little uneasy for he feel that in be choose to dance the first waltz with the giver of this splendid entertainment over the head of so many of he superior in rank and position he be be put rather out of he place he do not as a rule take any great degree of notice of mildr 's appearance but to-night it strike he as unusually charming you look very beautiful to-night mildr he say when they halt for breath and what splendid diamond you have on she flush with pleasure at he compliment you must not laugh at my diamond i know that i be too insignificant to wear such jewel i have two mind about put they on laugh at they indeed i should as soon think of laugh at the bank of england they be splendid yes she say bitterly they would be splendid on you angelum they want a splendid woman to carry they off oddly enough he be think the same thing : so have nothing to say he go on dancing presently the waltz come to a end and mildr be oblige to hurry off to receive the portuguese governor who have just put in a appearance arthur look at he card and find that he be down for the next galop with lady florence claverley we dance again lady florence really mr heigham this be quite shocking if everybody do not know that you belong body and soul to the lovely widow i should be accuse of flirt with you who be it make I promise to dance five time i do i want to make mr carr angry why should my dancing five or fifty dance with you make mr carr angry lady florence shrug she pretty shoulder be you blind she say arthur feel uncomfortable in due course however the last waltz before supper come round and he as agree upon dance it with he hostess as the strain of the music die away the door of the supper-room and tent be throw open now arthur say mildr take I in to supper he hesitate the portuguese governor -- he begin she stamp she little foot and she eye give a ominous flash must i ask you twice she say then he yield though the fact of be for the second time that night place in a unnecessarily prominent position make he feel more uncomfortable than ever for they be seat at the head of the top table mildr carr be in the exact center with himself on she right and the portuguese governor on the leave to arthur 's left be lady florence who take a opportunity to assure he solemnly that he really bear he blush honor very nicely and to ask he how he like the high place at feast the supper pass off as brilliantly as most successful supper do mr carr look charming and she conversation sparkle like she own champagne but it seem to he that as in the case of the wine there be too much sting in it the wine be a little too dry and she talk a little too full of suppress sarcasm though he could not quite tell what it be aim at any more than he could trace the source of the champagne bubble supper do he lead she back to the ball-room the second extra be just begin and she stand as though she be expect he to ask she to dance it i be sorry mildr but i must go now i be engage this dance indeed -- who to this be very coldly say lady florence he answer confusedly though there really be no reason why he should be ashamed she look at he steadily oh i forget for to-night you be she monopoly good-bye a little while after this arthur think that he have have about enough dancing for awhile and go and sit by himself in a secluded spot under the shadow of a tree-fern in a temporary conservatory put up outside a bow-window the chinese lantern that hang upon the fern have go out leave he chair in total darkness presently a couple whom he do not recognize for he only see they back stray in and place themselves on a bench before he in such a way as to entirely cut off he retreat he be make up he mind to disturb they when they begin a conversation in which the squeeze of hand and mild term of endearment play a part fear to interrupt lest he should disturb they equanimity he judge it best to stop where he be presently however they talk take a turn that prove intensely interesting to he it be something as follow : -- _ she _ have you see the hero of the evening _ he _ who do you mean the portuguese governor in he war-paint _ she _ no of course not you do not call he a hero do you i mean we hostess 's _ fiance _ the nice-looking young fellow who take she in to supper _ he _ oh yes i do not think much of he lucky dog but he must be rather mean they say that he be engage to a girl in england and have throw she over for the widow _ she _ ah you be jealous i know that you would like to be in he shoe come confess _ he _ you be very unkind why should i be jealous when -- _ she _ well you need not hurt my hand and will you _ never _ remember that black show against white _ he _ it be awfully hot here let 's go into the garden -lrb- _ exuent _ -rrb- chapter xlvii arthur emerge from he hiding-place horror-struck at hear what be be say about he and wonder so far as he be at the moment capable of accurate thought how long this report have be go about and whether by any chance it have reach the ear of the bellamy if it have the mischief might be very serious in the confusion of he mind only two thing be clear to he -- one be that both for mildr 's and he own sake he must leave madeira at once and secondly that he would dance no more with she that night meanwhile the ball be draw to a close and presently he hear the strain of the last galop strike up after the band have be play for a minute or two a natural curiosity draw he to the door of the ball-room to see if mildr be dance with anybody else here he find lady florence look rather disconsolate how be it that you be not dance she ask he murmur something inaudible about partner well we be in the same box what do you think i promise this galop to captain clemence and now there he be vainly try to persuade mr carr who will not look at he and appear to be wait for somebody else -- you i should think -- to give he the dance i will be even with he though just then the music reach a peculiarly seductive passage oh come along say lady florence quite regardless of the propriety and before arthur well know where he be he be whirling round the room mr carr be stand at the top corner where the crush oblige he to slacken he pace and as he do so he catch she eye she be talk to lady florence 's faithless partner with a smile upon she lip but one glance at she face suffice to tell he that she be in a royal rage and what be more with himself he partner notice it too and be amuse unless i be mistaken mr heigham you have come into trouble look at mr carr and she laugh but that be not all either from sheer mischief or from curiosity to see what would happen she insist upon stop as the dance draw to a close by mildr 's corner that lady however prove herself equal to the occasion mr heigham she say sweetly do you know that that be we dance oh be it he reply feel very much a fool yes certainly it be but with such a temptation to error -- and she smile towards lady florence -- it be not wonderful that you make a mistake and as you look so contrite you shall be forgive agatha there be a dear just ask that man to go up to the band and tell they to play another waltz ` la berceuse ' before ` god save the queen ' arthur feel all the while though she be talk so suavely that she be in a state of suppress rage once he glance at she and see that she eye seem to flash but she anger only make she look more lovely supply as it do a add dignity and charm to she sweet feature nor do she allow it to have full play mildr feel that the crisis in she fortune be far too serious to admit of be trifle with she know how unlikely it be that she would ever have a better chance with arthur than she have now for the mirror tell she that she be look she loveliest which be very lovely indeed in addition she be surround by every seductive circumstance that could assist to compel a young man however much engage to commit himself by some act or word of folly the sound and sight of beauty the rich odour of flower the music 's voluptuous swell and last but not least the pressure of she gracious form and the glance from she eye which alone be enough to make fool of ninety-nine out of every hundred young man in europe -- all these thing combine to help she and to they must be add she determination that concentrated strength of will employ to a single end which if there be any truth in the theory of the action of mind on mind can not fail to influence the individual on whom it be direct now arthur the room be very nearly clear for it be draw towards daylight when they float away together oh what a waltz that be the incarnate spirit of the dance take possession of they she waltz divinely and there be scarcely anything to check they progress on on they speed with fly foot as the music rise and fall above they and soon thing begin to change for arthur all sense of embarrassment and regret vanish from he mind which now appear to be capable of hold but one idea of the simplest and yet the most soar nature he think that he be in heaven with mildr carr on still on now he see nothing but she shell-like face and the large flash of the circle diamond feel nothing but the pressure of she form and she odorous breath upon he cheek hear nothing but the soft sound of she breathing closer he clasp she there be no sense of weariness in he foot or oppression in he lung he could have dance for ever but all too soon the music cease with a crash and they be stand with quick breath and sparkling eye by the spot that they have start from close by miss terry be sit yawning agatha say good-bye to those people for I i must get a breath of fresh air give I a glass of water please arthur he do so and by way of compose he own nerve take a tumbler of champagne he have no longer any thought of anxiety or danger and

stake -- and lose good-bye he go without a word chapter xlviii reader have you ever in the winter or early spring come from a hot - house where you have admire some rich tropical bloom and then in walk by the hedgerow suddenly see a pure primrose open its sweet eye and look bravely into bitter weather 's face if so you will if it be you habit to notice flower have experience some such sensation as take possession of my mind when i pass from the story of mildr as she be then storm-tossed and loving to angelum as loving indeed and yet more anxious but simple-minded as a child and not doubtful for the end they be both flower indeed and both beautiful but between they there be a wide difference the one in the richness of she splendor gaze upon the close place where she queen it and be satisfy with the beauty round she or if not satisfied she could imagine none different the limit of that little spot form the horizon of she mind -- she know no world beyond the other full of possibility shed sweetness even on the blast which cut she and look up for shelter towards the blue sky she know endure eternally above the drive cloud whilst sir john bellamy 's health be be recruit at madeira angelum 's daily life pursue a even and comparatively speak a happy course she miss pigott much but then she often go to see she and by way of compensation if she have go so have george caresfoot and lady bellamy mr fraser too have come back to fill a space in the void of she loneliness and for he presence she be very grateful indeed none but herself could know the comfort and strength she gather from he friendship none but himself could know what it cost he to comfort she but he do not shrink from the duty indeed it give he a melancholy satisfaction he love she quite as dearly and with as deep a longing as mildred carr do arthur but how different be he end of ultimately supplant he rival he never dream he aim be to assist he to bring the full cup of joy untainted to he lip and so he read with she and talk with she and be sick at heart and she thank he and consecrate all she most sacred thought to the memory of she absent lover and all she quick energy to self-preparation for he come possess she soul in patience and thus she young life begin to bloom again with a fresh promise the close of each depart day be the signal for the lifting of a portion of she load for it bring she a day nearer to she lover 's arm subtract something from the long tale of barren hour since to she all hour seem most barren that be not quicken by he presence indeed no arctic winter could be colder and more devoid of light and life than this time of absence be to she and have it not be for the warm splendor of she hope shoot its beautiful promise in unreal gleam across the blackness of she horizon she feel as though she must have freeze and die for hope elusive as she be often bear a fairer outward mien than the realization to which she point and like a fond deceiver serve to keep the heart alive till the first bitterness be overpast and school in trouble it can know she false and yet remain unbroken but sometimes angelum 's mood would change and then to she strained and sensitive mind this dead calm and cessation of event would seem to resemble that ominous moment when in tropic sea the fierce outrider of the tempest have pass howl away clothe in fly foam then come a calm and for a space there be blue sky and the sail flap drearily against the mast and the vessel only rock from the violence of she past plunge while the scream of the sea-bird be hear with unnatural clearness for there be no sound nor motion in the air intenser still grow the silence and the water almost cease from toss but the seaman know that presently with a sudden roar the army of the wind and wave will leap upon he and that a struggle for life be at hand such fear however do not often take she for unlike arthur she be naturally of a hopeful mind and when they do mr fraser would find means to comfort she but this be soon to change one afternoon -- it be christmas eve -- angelum go down the village to see pigott now comfortably establish in the house she long depart husband have leave she it be a miserable December day a damp unpleasant ghost of a day and all the sky be pack with cloud while the surface of the earth be wrap in mist rain and snow fall noiselessly by turn indeed the only sound in the air be the loud drip of water from the tree on the dead leaf beneath the whole outlook be melancholy in the extreme while angelum be in she old nurse 's cottage the snow fall in earnest for a hour or so and then hold up again and when she come out the mist have recover its supremacy and now the snow be melting come miss you must be get home or it will be dark shall i come with you a bit no thank you pigott i be not afraid of the dark and i ought to know my way about these part good-night dear the prevail dismalness of the scene oppress she and she make up she mind to go and see mr fraser instead of return at present to she lonely home with this view leave the main road that run through rewtham bratham and isleworth to roxham she turn up a little bye-lane which lead to the foot of the lake just as she do so she hear the deaden footfall of a fast-trotting horse accompany by the faint roll of carriage-wheel over the snow as she turn half involuntarily to see who it be that travel so fast the creep mist be drive aside by a puff of wind and she see a splendid blood - horse draw a open victorium trot past she at at least twelve mile a hour but quickly as it pass it be not too quick for she to recognize lady bellamy wrap up in fur she dark stern face look on straight before she as though the mist have no power to dim _ she _ sight next second the dark close in and the carriage have vanish like a dream in the direction of isleworth angelum shiver the dark afternoon seem to have grow darker to she so she _ be _ back she say to herself i feel that she be back she make I feel afraid go on she way she come to a spot where the path fork one track lead to a plank with a hand-rail span the stream that feed the lake and the other to some stepping-stone by cross which and follow the path on the other side a short cut could be make to the rectory the bridge and the stepping-stone be not more than twenty yard apart but so intent be angelum upon she own thought and upon place she foot accurately on the stone that she do not notice a little man with a red comforter who be lean on the hand-rail engage apparently in meditation the little man however notice she for he give a violent start and apparently be about to call out to she when he change he mind he be sir john bellamy better let she go perhaps john he say address he own effigy in the water after all it will be best for you to let thing to take they course and not to burn you own finger or commit yourself in any way john you will trap they more securely so if you be to warn the girl now you would only expose they if you wait till he have marry she you will altogether destroy they with the help of that young heigham and perhaps by that time you will have touch

speak of hers to mr fraser a consultation be go on in a back study at isleworth that might almost have justify it the fire be the only light in the room and gather round it talk very low they feature throw alternately into strong light and dark shadow be george caresfoot and sir john and lady bellamy it be evident from the strong expression of interest almost of excitement on they face that they be talk of some matter of great importance sir john be as usual perch on the edge of he chair rub he dry hand and elicit occasional spark in the shape of remark but he be no longer merry indeed he look ill at ease george he red hair all rumpled up and he long limb thrust out towards the fire speak scarcely at all but glue he little bloodshot eye alternately on the face of he companion and only contribute a occasional chuckle but the soul of this witch ' gathering be evidently lady bellamy she be stand up and energetically detail some scheme the great pupil of she eye expand and contract as the unholy flame within they rise and fall then that be settle she say at last george nod bellamy say nothing i suppose that silence give consent very well i will take the first step to-morrow i do

dreadfully wicked thing and that nothing but evil can come of it do not say that i have not warn you come stop that devil 's talk growl george devil 's talk -- that be a good word george for it be of the devil 's wages that i be tell you now listen i be go to prophecy a curse will fall upon this house and all within it would you like to have a sign that i speak the truth then wait she be stand up she hand stretch out and in the dim light she look like some heathen princess urge a bloody sacrifice to she god she foreboding terrify she hearer and by a common impulse they rise and move away from she at that moment a strange thing happen a gust of wind make its way from some entrance in the back of the house burst open the door of the room in which they be and enter with a cold flap as of wing next second a terrible crash resound from the other end of the room george turn white as a sheet and sink into a chair cursing feebly bellamy give a sort of howl of terror and shrink up to he wife almost fall into the fire in he effort to get behind she lady bellamy alone remain erect and undaunted laugh aloud come one of you brave conspirator against a defenceless girl strike a light for the place be as dark as a vault and let we see what have happen i tell you that you should have a sign after several effort george succeed in do as she bid he and hold a candle forward in he tremble hand come do not be foolish she say a picture have fall that be all he advance to look at it and then benefit he companion with a further assortment of curse the picture on examination prove to be a large one that he have some year previously have paint of isleworth with the bellamy and himself in the foreground the frame be shatter and all the center of the canvass tear out by the weight of its fall on to a life-sized and beautiful statue of andromeda chained to a rock await she fate with a stare look of agonized terror in she eye a omen a very palpable omen say lady bellamy with one of she dark smile isleworth and ourselves destroy by be smash against a marble girl who rise uninjured from the wreck eh john do not touch I you sorceress reply sir john who be shake with fear i believe that you be satan in person you be strangely complimentary even for a husband perhaps i be but i know you dark way and you dealings with you master and i tell you both what it be i have do with the job i will

tooth and he eye almost start out of he head but if i be you i should get he to drive I a little straighter that be all you be poor creature both of you say lady bellamy but we will then decide to go on fiat ` injurium ' ruat coelum say sir john who know a little latin and frighten as he be could not resist the temptation to air it and then they go and leave george still contemplate the horror - stricken face of the nude marble virgin whose eye appear to gaze upon the ruin of he picture next morning be christmas day lady bellamy go to church as behove a good christian and listen to the divine message of peace on earth and good-will towards man so for the matter of that do george and so do angelum after church lady bellamy go home to lunch but she be in no mood for eat so she leave the table and order the victorium to be round in half a hour after church too angela and mr fraser eat they christmas dinner angelum 's melancholy have to some extent melt beneath the genial influence of the christmas-tide and she mind have take comfort from the word of peace and everlasting love that she have hear that morning and for awhile at any rate she have forget she foreboding the unaccustomed splendor of the dinner too have divert she attention for she be easily please with such thing and altogether she be in a more comfortable frame of mind than she have be on the previous evening and be incline to indulge in a pleasant talk with mr fraser upon various subject mostly classical and arthurian she have already crack some filbert for he pluck by herself in the autumn and specially save in a damp jar and be about to settle herself in a chair by the fire when suddenly she turn white and stand quite still hark she say do you hear it hear what lady bellamy 's horse -- the big black horse that trot so fast i can hear nothing angelum but i can she be on the high-road yet she will be here very soon that horse trot fast nonsense angela it be some other horse but as he speak the sound of a powerful animal trot very rapidly become distinctly audible it have come -- the evil news -- and she have bring it rubbish dear somebody to see you father no doubt a minute elapse and then mr jakes now the only servant in the house be hear shuffling along the passage follow by a firm light step do not leave I say angelum to mr fraser god give I strength to bear it she go on beneath she breath she be still stand stare vacantly towards the door pale and she bosom heave the intensity of she anxiety have to some extent communicate itself to mr fraser for there be few thing so catch as anxiety except enthusiasm he too have rise and be stand in a attitude of expectancy lady bellamy to see yer say mr jakes push she head through the half-opened door next second she have enter i must apologize for disturbing you at dinner angelum she begin hurriedly and then stop and also stand still there be something very curious about she reception she think both mr fraser and angelum might have be cut out of stone for neither move standing thus in the silence of expectancy the three make a strange picture on lady bellamy 's face there be a look of stern determination and suppress excitement such as become one about to commit a crime at last she break the silence i come to bring you bad news angelum she say what have you to say tell I quick no stop hear I before you speak if you have come here with any evil in you heart or with the intention to deceive or betray pause before you answer i be a lonely and almost friendless woman and have no claim except upon you compassion but it be not always well to deal ill with such as i since we have at last a friend whose vengeance you too must fear so by the love of christ and by the presence of the god who make you speak to I only such truth as you will utter at he judgment now answer i be ready at she word speak with a earnestness and in a voice which make they almost awful a momentary expression of fear sweep across lady bellamy 's face but it go as quickly as it come and the hard determine look return the mysterious eye grow cold and glitter the head erect itself at that moment lady bellamy distinctly remind mr fraser of a hooded cobra about to strike be i to speak before mr fraser speak what be the good of this high-flown talk angelum you seem to know my news before i give it and believe I it pain I very much to have to give it _ he be dead angelum _ the cobra have strike but as yet the poison have scarcely begin to work there be only numbness mr fraser give a gasp and half drop half fall into he chair the noise attract angelum 's attention and press she hand to she forehead she turn towards he with a ghost of a laugh do i not tell you that this evil woman would bring evil news then address lady bellamy but stop you forget what i say to you you do not speak the truth arthur dead how can arthur be dead and i alive how be it that i do not know he be dead oh for shame it be not true he be not dead this seem to I to be a thankless as well as a painful task say lady bellamy hoarsely but if you will not believe I look here you know this i suppose i take it as he ask I to do from he dead hand that it might be give back to you if mr heigham be dead say mr fraser how do you know it where do he die and what of i know it mr fraser because it be my sad duty to nurse he through he last illness at madeira he die of enteric fever i have get a copy of he burial certificate here which i have take from the portuguese book he seem to have have no relation live poor young man but sir john communicate with the family lawyer here be the certificate and she hand mr fraser a paper write in portuguese and officially stamp you say break in angelum that you take this ring from he dead hand the hand on which i place it i do not believe you you beguile it from he live hand it can not be that he be dead for if he be i should have feel it oh arthur and in she misery she stretch out she arm and turn she agonized eye upwards if you be dead come to I and let I see you spirit face and hear the whisper of you wing have you no voice in the silence you see he do not come he be not dead if he be dead heaven could not hold he from my side or if it could it would have draw I up to he my love my love say mr fraser in a scared voice it be not god 's will that the dead should come back to we thus -- my poor angelum why will you not believe I this be so very painful do you suppose that i want to torture you by say what be not true about you love the idea be absurd i have mean to keep it till you be calmer but i have a letter for you read it and convince yourself angelum almost snatch the paper from she outstretched hand it run thus in character almost illegible from weakness : -- dearest -- good-bye i be die of fever lady bellamy will take back you ring when it be over try to forget I and be happy too weak to write more good-bye god -- at the foot of this broken and almost illegible letter be scrawl the word arthur angelum read it slowly and then at length the poison do its work she do not speak wildly any more or call upon arthur she be sting back to sense but all the light go out of she eye it be he write she say slowly i beg you pardon it be good of you to nurse he then press the paper to she bosom with one hand with the other she grope she way towards the door it be very dark she say lady bellamy 's eye give a flash of triumph and then she stand watch the pitiable exhibition of human misery as curiously as ever a roman matron do a expire gladiator when angelum be near the door the letter still press against she heart she speak again the blow come from god angelum and the religion and spiritual theory which you believe in will bring you consolation most likely it be a blessing in disguise -- a thing that you will in time even learn to be thankful for lady bellamy have overact she part the word do not ring true they jar upon mr fraser much more do they jar upon angelum 's torn nerve she pale cheek flush and she turn and speak but there be no anger in she face nothing but sorrow that dignified and unfathomable love lose in its own depths only the eye seem as sightless as those of one walk in she sleep when you hour of dreadful trouble come as it will come pray god that there may be none to mock you as you mock I and she turn like a stricken thing and go slowly out blindly grope she way along she last word have hit the victor hard who can say what hide string they touch or what prescience of evil they awaken but they go nigh to fell she clutch the mantel-piece lady bellamy gasp for air then recover a little she say : thank god that be over mr fraser scarcely see this last incident so overwhelmed be he at the sight of angelum 's agony that he have cover he face with he hand when he lift it again lady bellamy be go and he be alone chapter l three month have pass since that awful christmas day angelum be heart-broken and after the first burst of she despair turn herself to the only consolation which be leave she it be not of this world she do not question the truth of the dreadful news that lady bellamy have bring she and if ever a doubt do arise in she breast a glance at the ring and the letter effectually quell it nor do she get brain-fever or any other illness she young and healthy frame be too strong a citadel to be take out of hand by sorrow and this to she be one of the most wonderful thing in she affliction it have come and crush she and life still go on much as before the sun of she system have fall and yet the system be not appreciably derange it be dreadful to she to think that arthur be dead but a add sting lay in the fact that she be not dead too oh how glad she would have be to die since death have become the gate through which she need must pass to reach she lover 's side for it have be give to angelum living so much alone and think so long and deeply upon these great mystery of we be to soar to the height of a noble faith to the intense purity of she mind a living heaven present itself a comfortable place very different from the vague and formularised abstraction with which we be for the most part satisfied where arthur and she mother be wait to greet she and where the great light of the godhead would shine around they all she grow to hate she life the dull barrier of the flesh that stand between she and she end still she eat and drink enough to support it still dress with the same perfect neatness as before still live in short as though arthur have not die and the light and color have not go out of she world one day -- it be in march -- she be sit in mr fraser 's study read the shakespeare which arthur have give to she and in the woe of other strive to forget she own but the attempt prove a failure she could not concentrate she thought they would continually wander away into space in search of arthur she be dress in black from the day that she hear she lover be dead she would wear no other color and as she gaze with she hand idly clasp before she out at the drive sleet and snow mr fraser think that he have never see statue picture or woman of such sweet yet majestic beauty but it have be filch from the feature of a immortal the spirit-look which at time have visit she from a child now continually shine upon she face and to the sight of sinful man she eye seem almost awful in they solemn calm and purity she smile but seldom now and when she do it be in those gray eye that the radiance begin : she feature scarcely seem to move what be you think of angelum i be think mr fraser that it be only fourteen week to-day since arthur die and that it be very likely that i shall live another forty or fifty year before i see he i be only twenty-one and i be so strong even this shock have not hurt I why should you want to die because all the beauty and light have go out of my life because i prefer to trust myself into the hand of god rather than to the tender mercy of the world because he be there and i be here and i be tire of wait have you no fear of death i have never fear death and least of all do i fear it now why the veriest coward would not shrink back when the man she love be wait for she and i be not a coward and if i be tell that i must die within a hour i could say ` how beautiful upon the mountain be the foot of he that bringeth good tiding that publisheth peace ' can not you understand I if all you life and soul be wrap up in one person and she die would you not long to go to she mr fraser make no reply for a while but in he turn gaze out at the drift snow surely not more immaculately pure than this woman who could love with so divine a love at length he speak angelum do you know that it be wrong to talk so you have no right to set yourself up against the decree of the almighty in he wisdom he be work out end of which you be one of the instrument who be you that you should rebel no one -- a grain a atom a wind-tossed feather but what be i to do with my life how be i to occupy all the come year with you ability that be a question easy to answer work write take the place in scholastic or social literature which i have train you to fill for you fame and fortune lie in a inkstand you mind be a golden key that will open to you sight all that be worth see in the world and pass you into its most pleasant place you can become a famous woman angela she turn upon he sadly i have such idea for arthur 's sake i wish to do something great indeed i have already form a plan but mr fraser like many another when i lose my love i lose my ambition too both lie bury in he grave i have nothing leave to work for i do not care for fame or money for myself they would only have be valuable to give to he at twenty-one i seem to have do with the world 's reward and punishment its blank and prize its satisfaction and desire even before i have learn what they be my hope be as dull and leaden as that sky and yet the sun be behind it yes that be my only hope the sun be behind it though we can not see it do not talk to I of ambition mr fraser i be broken-spirited and my only ambition be for rest the rest he give to he beloved -- rest angelum that be the cry of we all we strive for rest and here we never find it you suffer but do not think that you be alone everybody suffer in they degree though perhaps such as you with the nerve of you mind bare to the roughness of the world 's weather feel mental pain the more acutely but my dear there be few really refine man and woman of sensitive organization who have not at time send up that prayer for rest any rest even eternal sleep it be the price they pay for they refinement but they be not alone if the heart 's cry of every be who endure in this great universe could be collect into a single prayer that prayer would be ` thou who make we in pity give we rest ' yes we suffer no doubt all of we and implore a peace that do not come we must learn ` how black be night when golden day be do how drear the blindness that have see the sun ' you can tell I that but tell I you who be a clergyman and stronger to stand against sorrow than i how can we win even a partial peace and draw the sting from suffer if you know a way however hard tell it I for do you know and she put she hand to she head and a vacant look come into she eye i think that if i have to endure much more of the anguish which i sometimes suffer or get any more shock i shall go mad i try to look to the future only and to rise superior to my sorrow and to a certain extent i succeed but my mind will not always carry the strain put upon it but fall heavily to earth like a winged bird then it be that deprive of its higher food and leave to feed upon its own sadness and to brood upon the bare fact of the death of the man i loved -- i sometimes think as man be not often love -- that my spirit almost break down if you can tell I any cure anything which will bring I comfort i shall indeed be grateful to you i think i can angela if you will no longer devote yourself to study you have only to look round to find another answer to you question as to what you be to do be there no poor in these part for you to visit can not you hand make clothes to cover those who have none be there no sickness that you can nurse no sorrow that you can comfort i know that even in this parish there be many home where you presence would be as welcome as a sunbeam in winter remember angelum that grief can be selfish as well as pleasure you be right mr fraser you always be right i think i be selfish in my trouble but it be a fault that i will try to mend indeed to look at it in that light only my time be of no benefit to myself i may as well devote it to other if you do you labor will bring its own reward for in help other to bear they load you will wonderfully lighten you own nor need you go far to begin why do you not see more of you own father you be naturally bind to love he yet it be but rarely that you speak to he my father you know he do not like I my presence be always a source of irritation to he he can not even bear I to look at he oh surely that must be you fancy probably he think you do not care about he he have always be a strange and wayward man i know but you should remember that he have have bitter disappointment in life and try to soften he and win he to other thought do this and you will soon find that he will be glad enough of you company i will try to do as you say mr fraser but i confess i have only small hope of any success in that direction have you any parish work i can do nor do the matter end there as be so often the case where parish work and young lady be concerned angelum set to she charitable duty with a steady determination that make she service very valuable she undertake the sole management of a clothing club in itself a maddening thing to ordinary mortal and have a eye to the distribution of the parish coal of mother ' meeting and other cheerful parochial entertainment she become the life and soul give up she mathematics and classical reading she take to knit baby ' vest and sock instead indeed the number of article which she nimble finger turn out in a fortnight be a pleasant surprise for the cold toe of the baby and as mr fraser have prophesy she find that she labor be of a sort which bring a certain reward chapter li on one point however angelum 's effort fail completely she could make no headway with she father he shrink more than ever from she society and at last ask she to oblige he by allow he to follow he own path in peace of arthur 's death he have never speak to she or she to he but she know that he have hear of it philip have hear of it thus on that christmas afternoon he have be take he daily exercise when he meet lady bellamy return from the abbey house the carriage stop and she get out to speak to he have you be to the abbey house to pay a christmas visit he ask it be very kind of you to come and see we so soon after you return i be the bearer of bad news so i do not loiter bad news what be it mr heigham be dead she answer watch he face narrowly dead impossible he die of enteric fever at madeira i have just be to break the news to angelum oh indeed she will be pained she be very fond of he you know lady bellamy smile contemptuously do you ever see any one put to the extremest torture if you have you can guess how you daughter be ` pained ' philip winced well i can not help it it be no affair of mine good-bye and then as soon as she be out of hearing i wonder if she lie or if she have murder he george must have be put on the screw into the particulars of arthur heigham 's death or suppose death he never inquire why should he it be no affair of he he have long ago wash he hand of the whole matter and leave thing to take they chance if he be dead well and good he be very sorry for he if he be alive well and good also in that case he would no doubt arrive on the appoint date to marry angelum but notwithstanding all this unanswerable reasoning he still find it quite impossible to look he daughter in the face she eye still burn he ay even more than ever do they burn for she widow dress and brow be agony to he and rent he heart not with remorse but fear but still he greed keep the upper hand though death by mental torture must result yet he would glut himself with he desire more than ever he hunger for those wide land which if only thing fall out right would become he at so ridiculous a price decidedly arthur heigham 's death be no affair of he about six week before angelum 's conversation with mr fraser which end in she undertaking parish work a rumor have get about that george caresfoot have be take ill very seriously ill it be say that a chill have settle on he lung which have never be very strong since he fever and that he have in short go into a consumption of george angelum have neither see nor hear anything for some time -- not since she receive the welcome letter in which he relinquish he suit she have indeed with that natural readiness of the human mind to forget unpleasant occurrence think but little about he of late since she mind have be more fully occupy with other and more press thing still she vaguely wonder at time if he be really so ill as she father think one day she be walk home by the path round the lake after pay a visit to a sick child in the village when she suddenly come face to face with she father she expect that he would as usual pass on without address she and draw to one side of the path to allow he to do so but to she surprise he stop where have you be angelum to see ellen mim she be very ill poor child you have better be careful you will be catch scarlet fever or something -- there be a great deal about i be not at all afraid yes but you never think that you may bring it home to I i never think that there be any likelihood of my bring anything to you we see so little of each other well well i have be to isleworth to see you cousin george he be very ill you tell I that he be ill some time back what be it that be really the matter with he gallop consumption he can not last long poor man why do he not go to a warmer climate i do not know -- that be he affair but it be a serious matter for I if he die under present circumstance all the isleworth estate which be mine by right must pass away from the family forever why must they pass away because you grandfather with a refined ingenuity make a provision in he will that george be not to leave they back to I as he be tell I this afternoon he be anxious to do if he be to die now with a will in my favor or without any will at all they would all go to some far away cousin in scotland he die of heart-disease do he not -- my grandfather i mean philip 's face grow black as night and he shoot a quick glance of suspicion at he daughter i be say he go on without answer she question that george may sell the land or settle it but must not leave it to I or you nor can i take under a intestacy angelum do not understand these legal intricacy and know about as much about the law of intestacy as she do of egyptian inscription well she say consolingly i be very sorry but it can not be help can it the girl be a bear fool mutter philip beneath he breath and pass on a week or so afterwards just when the primrose and lent-lily be at the meridian of they beauty and all the air be full of song angelum hear more about she cousin george mr fraser be one day send for to isleworth lady bellamy bring he the message say that george be in such a state of health that he wish to see a clergyman i never see a worse case he say to angela on he return he do not leave the house but lie in a darkened room cough and spit blood he be i should say go off fast but he refuse to see a doctor he frame of mind however be most christian and he seem to have reconcile himself to the prospect of a speedy release poor man say angelum sympathetically he send and ask to see you do he not well -- yes but when i get there he talk more about the thing of this world than of the next he be greatly distressed about you father i daresay you have hear how you cousin george supplanted you father in the succession to the isleworth estate you grandfather disinherit he you know because of he marriage with you mother now that he be die he see the injustice of this but be prevent by the term of you grandfather 's will from restore the land to you branch of the family so it must pass to some distant cousin -- at least so i understand the matter you always tell I that it be easy to drive a coach and four through will and settlement and legal thing if he be so anxious to do so can he not find a way out of the difficulty -- i mean some honorable way no i believe not except a impossible one and mr fraser smile a rather force smile what be that ask angelum carelessly well that he should -- should marry _ you _ before he die at least you know he say that that be the only way in which he could legally transfer the estate angelum start and turn pale then i be afraid the estate will never be transfer how would that help he well he say he could then enter into a nominal sale of the estate to you father and settle the money on you and why could he not do this without marry I i do not know i do not understand much about these thing i be not a business man but it be impossible for some reason or another but of course it be absurd good night my dear do not overdo it in the parish another week pass without any particular news of george 's illness except that he be get weaker when one day lady bellamy appear at the abbey house where she have not be since that dreadful christmas day angelum feel quite cold when she see she enter and she greet be as cold as herself i hope that you bring I no more bad news she say no angelum except that you cousin george be die but that be scarcely likely to distress you i be sorry be you there be no particular reason why you should be you do not like he no i do not like he it be a pity though because i have come to ask you to marry he upon my word lady bellamy you seem to be the choose messenger of everything that be wretched last time you come to this house it be to tell I of dear arthur 's death and now it be to ask I to marry a man whom i detest i think that i have tell both you and he that i will not marry he i have go as near marry as i ever mean to in this world really angela you be most unjust to I do you suppose that it be any pleasure to I to have such a sad duty to perform however it be refresh to hear you talk so vigorously clearly the loss of you lover have not affect you spirit angelum wince beneath the taunt but make no reply but if you will condescend to look at the matter with a single grain of common-sense you will see that circumstance have utterly change since you refuse to marry george then mr heigham be alive poor fellow and then too george want to marry you as a wife now he be merely anxious to marry you that he may be enable to make reparation to you father he be a fast-dying man you would never be he wife except in name the grave would be he only marriage-bed do you not understand the difference perfectly but do _ you _ not understand that whether in deed or in name i can not outrage my dead arthur 's memory by be for a hour the wife of that man do _ you _ not know that the marriage service require a woman to swear to ` love honor and obey ' till death part whether it be a day or a lifetime away can i even as a mere form swear to love when i loathe honor when i despise obey when my whole life would rise in rebellion against obedience what be these estate to I that i should do such violence to my conscience and my memory estate of what use be they to one whose future lie in the ward of a hospital or a sisterhood i will have nothing to do with this marriage lady bellamy well i must say angelum you do not make much ado about ruin you father to gratify you own sentimental whim it must be a comfortable thing to have child to help one in one 's old age angelum reflect on mr fraser 's word about she duty to she father and for the second time that day she wince beneath lady bellamy 's taunt but as she return no answer she visitor have no alternative but to drop the subject and depart before she go however she have a few word with philip urge the serious state of george 's health and the term of he grandfather 's will which prevent he from leave the estate to himself as a reason why he should put pressure on angelum somewhat but not altogether to she surprise he refuse in these term : i do not know to what depths you have go in this business and it be no affair of mine to inquire but i have keep to my share of the bargain and i expect you to keep to yours if you can bring about the marriage with george well or ill on the term i have agree upon with he i shall throw no obstacle in the way but as for my try to force angelum into it i should never take the responsibility of do so nor would she listen to I if she speak to I on the subject i shall point out how the family will be advantage and leave the matter to she further i will not go chapter lii three day after she conversation with lady bellamy angelum receive the following letter : -- isleworth hall roxham may 2 dear cousin angelum my kind and devoted friend lady bellamy have tell I that she have speak to you on a subject which be very near to my heart and that you have distinctly decline to have anything to do with it of course i know that the matter lie entirely within you own discretion but i still venture to lay the follow point before you there have i be aware be some painful passage between we -- passage which under present circumstance have much better be forget so first i ask you to put they quite out of you mind and to judge of what i have to propose from a very different point of view i write angelum to ask you to marry I it be true -lrb- since unfortunately my health will not allow I to ask you in person -rrb- but it be a very different offer from that which i make you in the lane when you so bitterly refuse I now i be solely anxious that the marriage should take place in order that i may be enable to avoid the stringent provision of you grandfather 's will which whilst forbid I to leave these estate back to you father or he issue fortunately do not forbid a fictitious sale and the settlement of the sum or otherwise but i will not trouble you with these legal detail in short i supplanted you father in youth and i be now anxious to make every reparation in my power and at present i be quite unable to make any independently of this it pain I to think of the estate pass away from the old stock and i should like to know that you who have be the only woman whom i have feel true affection for will one day come into possession of it of course as you understand the marriage would be _ nothing but a form _ and if as i be tell you object to its be go through with the ceremony of the church it could be make equally legal at a registry office but please understand angelum that i do not wish to press you : it be for you to judge only you must judge quickly for i be a fast - die man and be anxious to get this matter off my mind one way or other in order that i may be able to give it fully to the consideration of subject of more vital importance to one in my condition than marry and give in marriage ever dear cousin angelum affectionately yours george caresfoot p -- remember you have you father to consider in this matter as well as yourself the receipt of this letter plunge angelum into the greatest distress of mind it be couch in a tone so courteous and so moderate that it carry with it conviction of its sincerity and truth if she only have be concern she would not long have hesitate but the idea of she duty to she father rise up before she like a cloud what be she true duty under the circumstance there be the rub she take the letter to mr fraser and ask he advice he read it carefully and think a long while before he answer the idea of angelum be unite to anybody in marriage even as a matter of form be naturally abominable to he but he be far too honorable and conscientious a man to allow he personal likes or dislike to interfere with whatever he consider to be he duty but in the end he find it impossible to give any fixed opinion my dear he say all that i can suggest be that you should take it to you father and hear what he have get to say after all it be he who must have you true welfare most at heart it be into he hand that i hear you mother in peculiarly solemn word consign you and you interest take it to you father dear there be no counsel like that of a father have mr fraser be the father this would doubtless have be true enough but though he have know he for so many year and be privy to much of he history he do not yet understand philip caresfoot he own open and guileless nature do not easily suspect evil in another more especially when that other be the father of she whom he look upon as the earthly incarnation of all that be holy and pure angelum sigh and obey -- sigh from doubt obey from duty she hand the letter to philip without a word -- without a word he read it i want you opinion father she say i wish to do what be right you know how painful what have happen have be for I you know -- or if you do not know you must have guess -- how completely shatter my life be as for this marriage the whole thing be repugnant to I personally i have rather sacrifice fifty property than go through it but i know that i ought to think of other mr fraser tell I that it be my duty to consult you that you will naturally have my interest most at heart that it be into you hand and to you care that my mother consign I on she deathbed father -- and she clasp she hand and look he full in the face with she earnest eye -- mr fraser be right it must be for you to decide i will trust you entirely and leave the burden of decision to you honor and generosity only i say spare I if you can philip rise and go to look out of the window that he might hide the evident agitation of he face and the tremor of he limb he feel that the crucial moment have come all he poor sophistry all he miserable shuffling and attempt to fix the responsibility of he act on other have recoil upon he own head she have come to he and lay the burden on he heart what should he answer for a moment the shades -- for with he they be only shades -- of good angel gain the upper hand and he be about to turn and look she in the face -- for then he feel he could have look she in the face -- and bid she have nothing to do with george and he proposal but even in the act of turn to obey the impulse he eye fall upon the roof of isleworth hall which standing on a eminence could easily be see from the abbey house and he mind quicker than the eye fly to the outlook place upon that roof where he have so often climb as a boy and survey the fair champaign country beyond it meadow and wood fallow and cornland all of which be for he involve in that answer he do not stop turn but -- so quick be the working of the mind -- he change the nature of he answer the real presence of the demon of greed chase away the poor angelic shadow it would not be much of a sacrifice for you angela to go through this form he be a die man and you need not even change you name the land be mine by right and will be yours it will break my heart to lose they after all these year of toiling to save enough to buy they but i do not wish to force you in short i leave the matter to you generosity as you would have leave it to mine and suppose that i be to marry my cousin george and he be not to die after all what would be my position then you must clearly understand that to save we all from starvation i would never be he wife you need not trouble yourself with the question he be a dead man in two month ' time he will be in the family vault she bow she head and leave he -- leave he with he hot and glowing greed behind which creep a terror next morning george caresfoot receive the following letter : bratham abbey may 5 dear cousin george in reply to you letter i must tell you that i be willing to go through the form of marriage with you -- at a registry-office not in church -- in order to enable you to carry out the property arrangement you wish to make you must however clearly understand that i do not do this on my own account but simply and solely to benefit my father who have leave the matter to my ` generosity ' i must ask you as a preliminary step to make a copy of and sign the enclosed letter address to I we life be in the hand of god and it be possible that you might be restore to health in such a event however improbable it may seem it can not be make too plain that i be not and have never in any sense undertake to be you wife truly yours angelum caresfoot the enclosure run as follow : i george caresfoot hereby solemnly promise before god that under no possible circumstance will i attempt to avail myself of any rights over my cousin angelum caresfoot and that i will leave she as soon as the formal ceremony be conclude and never again attempt to see she except by she own wish the so-called marriage be only contemplate in order to enable I to carry out certain business arrangement which in view of the fail state of my health i be anxious to enter into this letter and its curious enclosure surely the oddest marriage contract which be ever pen george tremble with excitement thrust into the hand of lady bellamy she read they with a dark smile the bird be springe she say quietly it have be a close thing but i tell you that i should not fail as i have warn you of what will follow you success sign this paper -- this waste-paper -- and return it chapter liii by return of post angelum receive she strange agreement duly copy and sign and after this the preparation for the marriage go on rapidly but where such a large transaction be concern as the sale of between three and four thousand acre of land copyhold and freehold together with sundry rent-charge and the lordship of six manor thing can not be do in a minute both george and philip and they respective lawyer -- sir john would have nothing to do with the matter -- do they best to expedite matter but unfortunately some legal difficulty arise in connection with the transfer and who can hurry the ponderous and capricious machinery of the law at length it become clear to all concerned except angelum that it would be impossible for the marriage to take place before the eighth of June and it also become clear that that be the last possible day on which it could take place george begged philip -lrb- by letter be too ill to come and see he -rrb- to allow the marriage to be go through with at once and have the business transaction finish afterwards but to this philip would not consent the title-deed he say must be in he possession before it take place otherwise he would have no marriage george have therefore no option but to accept he term when angelum be tell of the date fix for the ceremony -- she would not allow the word marriage to be mention in connection with it -- she at first create considerable consternation by quietly announce that she would not have it perform until the tenth of June at last however when matter be grow serious and when she have treat all the pressure that it be possible to put upon she with quiet indifference -- for as usual she father decline to interfere but contented himself with play a strictly passive part -- she suddenly of she own mere motion abolish the difficulty by consent to appear before the registrar on the eighth of June as george wish she reason for have object to this date in the first instance will be easily guess it be the day before the anniversary of arthur 's departure a anniversary which it be she fancy to dedicate solely to he memory but as the delay appear -- though she could not altogether understand why -- to put other to great inconvenience and as george 's state of health have become such as to render postponement even for a couple of day of doubtful expediency and as moreover she decide on reflection that she could better give she thought to she dead lover when she have go through with the grim farce that hang over she she suddenly change she mind occasionally they bring she document to sign and she sign they without a question but on the whole she treat the affair with considerable apathy the truth be that it be repugnant to she mind which she prefer to occupy with other and very different thought so she let it go she know that she be go to do a thing which be dreadful to she because she believe it to be she duty but she comfort herself with the reflection that she be amply secure against all possible contingency by she previous agreement with george angelum 's knowledge of the marriage-law of she country and of what constitute a legal document be not extensive for this same reason because it be distasteful she have never say anything of she contemplated marriage to pigott and it be quite unknown in the neighborhood since the miss lee scandal and he consequent disinheritance nobody have visit philip caresfoot and those who take interest in he or he affair be few indeed the matter have be keep a dead secret but on the seventh of June be the day previous to the ceremony angelum go down to she nurse 's cottage and tell she what be about to be do suppress however from various motive all mention of she agreement with george it add to she depression to find that pigott be unaccountably disturb at the news well miss she say -- lord to think that i sha 'n' t be able to call you that no longer -- i have not get nothing in particular to say agin it see that sure enough the man 's a-dying as i have on good authority from my own aunt 's cousin she that do the servant ' wash up at the hall and mighty bad she do it beg of she pardon for the disparagement and so he will not trouble you for long and somehow it do seem as though you have not get no choice leave in the matter just as though everybody and everything be a-quietly push you into it but miss somehow i do not like it to be plain a marriage as be not no marriage be not altogether natural like and in a office too along with a man as you would not touch with a pair of tong and that man on he last leg i be right down sorry if i make you feel uncomfortable dearie but bless I i do not know how it be but when a thing stick in my mind i be as bind to hawk it up as though it be a bone in my throat i do not like it any more than you do nurse but perhaps you do not understand all about the property be concern and about its have to pass away from my father if i do not do this i care nothing about the property but he leave it to ` my generosity ' arthur be dead and he leave it to ` my generosity ' nurse what could i do well miss you be act accord to what you think right and due to you father which be more nor i do and poor dead mr arthur up in heaven there will make a note of that there be not no manner of doubt and somehow it do seem that thing can not be allow to go wrong with you my dear see how you be a-sacrificing of yourself and of you wish to benefit other this conversation do not tend to put angelum into better spirit but she feel that it be now too late to recede whilst angelum be talk to pigott sir john and lady bellamy be pay a call at isleworth they find george lie on the sofa in the dining-room in which though it be the first week in June a fire be burn on the hearth he bear all the sign of a man in the last stage of consumption the hollow cough the emaciation and the hectic hue upon he face all speak with no uncertain voice well caresfoot you scarcely look like a bridegroom i must say say little sir john look as pleased as though he have make a eminently cheerful remark no but i be stronger than i look marriage will cure I humph will it then you will be signally fortunate do not croak bellamy i be happy to-day -- there be fire dancing along my vein just think this time to-morrow angelum will be my legal wife well you appear to have give a good price for the privilege if what anne tell I be correct to sell the isleworth estate for fifty thousand be to sell they for a hundred and fifty thousand less than they be worth consequently the girl cost you a hundred and fifty thousand pound -- a long figure that for one girl bah you be a cold-blooded fellow bellamy can not you understand that there be a positive delight in ruin oneself for the woman one love and then think how she will love I when she come to understand what she have cost I i can see she now she will come and kiss I -- mind you kiss I of she own free will -- and say ` george you be a noble fellow george you be a lover that any woman may be proud of no price be too heavy for you ' yes that be what she will say that sort of thing you know sir john 's merry little eye twinkle with inexpressible amusement and he wife 's full lip curl with unutterable contempt you be count you kiss before they be pay for she say do philip come here this afternoon to sign the deed yes they be in the next room will you come and see they yes i will will you come john no thank you i do not wish to be treat to any more of you ladyship 's omen i have long ago wash my hand of the whole business i will stop here and read the _ time _ they go out george lean on lady bellamy 's arm no sooner have they go than sir john put down the _ time _ and listen intently then he rise and slip the bolt of that door which open into the hall thereby halve he chance of interruption next listen at every step he round face which be solemn enough now stretch forward and look for all the world like that of some whiskered puss advance on a cream-jug he creep on tiptoe to the iron safe in the corner of the room arrive there he listen again and then draw a little key from he pocket and insert it in the lock it turn without difficulty beau-ti-ful murmured sir john but now come the rub take another key he insert it in the lock of the subdivision it would not turn one more chance he say as he try a second ah and open come the lid rapidly he extract two thick bundle of letter they be in lady bellamy 's handwriting then he relock the subdivision and the safe itself and put the key away in he trousers and the packet in he coat-tail pocket one in each that they might not bulge suspiciously next he unbolt the door and return give way to paroxysm of exultation too deep for word at last he say stretch he fat little fist towards the room where george be with lady bellamy at last after twenty year of wait you be in my power my lady time _ have _ bring its revenge and if before you be forty-eight hour older you do not make acquaintance with a bitterness worse than death then my name be not john bellamy i will repay you every jot and with interest too my lady then he calm himself and ring a bell tell the servant to tell lady bellamy that he have walk on home when a hour and a half later she reach rewtham house she find that she husband have be suddenly summon to london on a matter of business that night in she desolation angelum cast herself upon the floor with outstretched arm and weep for she dead lover and for the shame which overshadow she and the moon travel up the sky strike she shine coldly on she snowy robe and round form -- glint on the stormy gold of she loose hair -- flood all the room with light : till the white floor gleam like a silver shrine and she lay there a weep saint then she rise and creep to such rest as utter weariness of body and mind can give all that night too george caresfoot paced hungry-eyed up and down up and down the length of he great room he gaze fix on the window which command bratham like that of some caged tiger on a desire prey to-morrow he keep mutter till the first ray of the rise sun fall blood-red upon he waste form and then bathing he thin hand in its beam he sink down exhaust cry exultingly not to-morrow but _ to-day _ that night lady bellamy sit at a open window rise continually to turn she dark eye upon the starry heaven above she it be of no use she say at last my knowledge fail I my calculation be baffle by a quantity i can not trace i be face to face with a combination that i can not solve let I try once more ah suppose that the unknown quantity be a directing will which at the crisis shatter law and override even the immutability of the unchanging star i have hear of such a thing let I change the position of we oppose planet and then see it would all be clear as day george vanish that i know before she sail triumphant through overshadow influence towards a silver sky and i be it death that await I no but some great change there the pale light of my fading star would fall into she bright track bah my science fail i can no longer prophesy my knowledge only tell I of great event of what use be such knowledge as that well come what may fate will find one spirit that do not fear he as for this and she point towards the symbol and calculation i have do with it henceforth i will devote myself to the only real power which can enlighten we yet there be humiliation in failure after so many year of study it be folly to follow a partial truth of which we miss the keynote though we sometimes blunder on its harmony chapter liv the arrangement for the morrow be that angelum and she father be to take a fly to roxham where the registry office be and whither george be also to be convey in a close carriage that the ceremony be then to be go through after which the party be to separate and return to they respective home mr fraser have be ask to attend but have excuse himself from do so in pursuance of this program angelum and she father leave the abbey house about ten o'clock and drive in silence to the town strange as it may seem angelum have never be in a town before and in the curious condition of she mind the new sight of busy street interested she greatly and serve to divert she attention till they reach the door of the office she alight and be show with philip into a waiting-room and here for some unexplained reason a great fear take hold of she a terror of this ceremony which now loom large and life-like before she father she say suddenly after a moment of irresolution i be go home i will not go on with this business what can you mean angelum i mean what i say i never realize how dreadful it all be till now it have come upon I like a revelation come i be go angelum do not be a fool you forget that george will be here in a minute and that the settlement be all sign then he can go back again and the settlement can be tear up i will not go on with it philip be by this time almost beside himself with anxiety after have thus with thought and toil and by the aid of a bless chance lift this delicious cup to he lip be it to be dash from he be the sweet dream so near approach to realization in which he have be wrap for so many day all to be dissipate into thin air be he to lose the land after all after he have finger -- oh how lovingly -- the yellow title-deed for alas the sale depend on the marriage it could not be neither fate nor angelum could be so cruel he turn upon she with the boldness of despair angelum you must not go on like this after have agree to the thing of you own free will think of what it involve for I if you refuse to marry he now at the last moment i shall lose the isleworth estate heaven to think that so much property should be dependent upon the mere whim of a girl can not you have a little consideration for other beside yourself do you really mean to sacrifice the hope of my whole life to throw away the only opportunity i can ever have of right my wrong in order to gratify a sentimental whim for god 's sake think a little first before you sacrifice I you promise to do it never before have angelum see she

he be lean on the arm of lady bellamy who greet angelum with a smile which the latter fancy have something of triumph in it with the exception of the messenger who play the part of clerk in this civil ceremony there be nobody else in the room no greeting be interchange and in another moment angelum be stand dress in she funeral black by george 's side before the registrar and the ceremony have begin but from that moment although she beautiful face preserve its composure she scarcely see or hear anything of what be go on it be as though all the stream of think in she brain have burst they bank and mingle in a great and turbulent current she be fill with thought but could seize upon no one idea whilst within she mind she hear a sound as of the continuous whir of broken machinery object and individual real and imagine present themselves before she mental vision expand till they fill the heaven with they bulk and then shrink and shrink and vanish into nothing the word wife strike upon she ear and seem to go wail away wife wife wife through all the illimitable hall of sound till they be fill with echo and sound itself fall dead against the silence of the star it be do she awake to find herself a married woman lady bellamy step forward with the same half-triumphant smile with which she have greet angelum hover about she lip let I congratulate you _ mr _ caresfoot she say indeed

begin to drink wine furiously curse she he say as the fume mount into he brain curse she she be try to frighten I with she infernal magic but she sha 'n' t i know what she be at but i will be beforehand with she and stagger under the mingled influence of drink and excitement he rise and leave the house lady bellamy sit in the drawing-room and wait for she carriage at last she hear the wheel upon the gravel then she rise and rapidly do something to the great lamp upon the paper-strewn table as she shut the door she turn that will do she say in the hall she meet the servant come to announce the carriage be you master still in the dining-room she ask no my lady she laugh a little and civilly bid the man good-night chapter lv outside the door of the registry-office angelum and she father have to make they way through a crowd of small boy who have by some means or other find out that a wedding be go on inside and stand wait there animated by the intention of cheer the bride and the certain hope of sixpence but when they see angelum she stately form robe in black and she sweet face betray the anguish of she mind the sight shock they sense of the fitness of thing and they slip off without a word indeed a butcher 's boy with a turn for expressive language remark in indignation to another of he craft so soon as they have recover they spirit call that a weddin ' bill why it be more like a -- funeral with the plume off and as for the gal though she be a ` clipper ' she face be as pale as a ` long ` un 's ' angelum never quite know how she get back to the abbey house she only remember that she be by herself in the fly she father prefer to travel on the box alone with the coachman nor could she ever quite remember how she get through the remainder of that day she be quite maze but at length it pass and the night come and she be thankful for the night about nine o'clock she go up to she bedroom at the top of the house it have serve as a nursery for many generation of caresfoot indeed during the last three century hundred of little foot have patter over the old worm-eaten board but the little foot have long since go to dust and the only sign of child 's play and merriment leave about the place be the numberless scratch nick and letter cut in the old panelling and even on the beam which support the low ceiling it be a lonesome room for a young girl or indeed for anybody whose nerve be not of the strongest nobody sleep upon that floor or in the room beneath it philip occupy a little closet which join he study on the ground floor all the other room be close and tenant only by rat that make unearthly noise in they emptiness as for jakes and he wife the only servant on the place they occupy a room over the washhouse which be separate from the main building angelum be therefore practically alone in a great house and might have be murder a dozen time over without the fact be discover for hour this do not however trouble she much simply because she pay no heed to the noise in the house and be singularly free from fear of any kind on reach she room she sit down and begin to think of arthur and as she think she mind grow clearer and more at peace indeed it seem to she that she dead lover be near and as though she could distinguish pulsation of thought which come from he impinge on she system and bring he presence with they it be a common sensation and occur to many people of sensitive organization when asleep or think on some one with whom they be in a high state of sympathy and doubtless indicate some occult communication but as it chance it have never before visit angelum in this form and she abandon herself to its influence with delight it thrill she through and through how long she sit thus she could not tell but presently the communication whatever it be stop as suddenly as though the connect link have be sever the current direct by she will would no longer do she bidding they could not find they object or fright by some adverse influence recoil in confusion on she brain several time she try to renew this subtle intercourse that be so palpable and real and yet so different from anything else in the world but fail then she rise feel very tired for those who thus draw upon the vital energy must pay the penalty of exhaustion she take she bible and read she nightly chapter and then undressed and say she prayer pray with unusual earnestness that it might please the almighty in he wisdom to take she to where she lover be she prayer do she rise put on a white dress wrapper and seat herself before the glass unloose she hair then she begin to brush it pause presently to think how arthur have admire its color and the ripple on it she have be much more careful of she hair since then and smile sadly to herself at she folly for be so think thus she fall into a reverie and sit so still that a great gray rat come noiselessly out of he hole in a corner of the room and advance into the circle of light round the dressing-table sit up on he hind leg to see if he be alone suddenly he turn and scuttle back to he hole in evident alarm and at the same second angelum think that she hear a sound of a different character from those she be accustom to in the old house -- a sound like the creaking of a boot it pass however but leave a indefinable dread creep over she and chill the blood in she vein she begin to expect something she know not what and be fascinate by the expectation she would have rise to lock the door but all strength seem to have leave she she be paralyse by the near sense of evil then come a silence as intense as it be lonely it be a ghastly moment she back be towards the doorway for she dressing-table be immediately opposite the door which be raise some four foot above the level of the landing and approach by as many step gradually she eye become rivet on the glass before she for in it she think that she see the door move next second she be sure that it _ be _ move very slowly the hinge take a age to turn what could be behind it at last it be open and in the glass angelum see frame in darkness _ the head and shoulder of george caresfoot _ at first she believe that she mind deceive she that it be a apparition no there be no mistake but the respirator the hollow cough and decrepitude of the morning -- where be they with horror in she heart she turn and face he see that he be observe he stagger into the room with a step which be half drunken and half jaunty but which belie the conflict of passion write on he brow he speak -- he voice sound hoarse and hollow and be ill-tuned to he word you do not expect I perhaps -- wonder how i get here jake let I in he have get a proper respect for marital rights have jakes you look so pretty i could not make up my mind to disturb you quite a romantic meeting be it not you be a die man how do you come here die my dear wife not a bit of it i be no more die than you be i have be ill it be true but that be only because you have fret I so the die be only a little ruse to get you consent all be fair in love and war you know and of course you never really believe in that precious agreement that be nothing but a bit of maidenly shyness eh angela stand still as a stone a look of horror on she face then you do not know what you have cost I you father 's price be a hundred and fifty thousand at least that be what it come to the old shark it be not every man who would come down like for a girl now be it it show a generous mind do not it still she utter not a syllable angelum he say change he tone to one of hoarse earnestness do not look at I like that because even if you be a bit put out at the trick i have play you just think it be because i love you so much angelum i could not help it i could not really it be not every man who would go through all that i have go through for you it be no joke to sham consumption for three month i can tell you but we will have many a laugh over that why do not you answer I instead of stand there just like the andromeda in my study the simile be a apt one the statue of the girl await she awful fate wear the same hopeless helpless look of vacant terror which be upon angelum 's face now but its mention recall lady bellamy and the ominous incident in which that statue have figure and he hasten to drown recollection in action come he say you will forgive I will not you it be all do for love of you and he move towards she as he come she seem to collect she energy the fear leave she face and in its stead there shine a great and awful blaze of indignation she brush be still in she hand and as he draw near she dash it full into he face it be but a light thing and only stagger he but it give she time to pass he and reach the still open door bare - foot she flee like the wind down the passage and down the stair utter a oath he follow she but as she go she remember that she could not run upon the gravel with she naked foot and with this in she mind she turn to bay by a large window that give light to the first-floor landing immediately opposite which be the portrait of devil caresfoot it be unbolted and with a single movement of the hand she fling it open and stand panting by it in the full light of the moon in another moment he be upon she furious at the blow and he face contorted with passion stop she cry and listen to I before i will allow you to touch I with a single finger i will spring from here i would rather thrust myself into the hand of providence than into yours monster and perjure liar that you be he stop as she bid he and commence to pace round and round she in a semicircle glaring at she with wild eye if you jump from there he say you will only break you limb it be not high enough to kill you you be my wife do not you understand you be my legal wife the law be on my side no one can help you no one you be mine in the sight of the whole world but not yours in the sight of god it be to he that i now appeal get back she stretch out she arm and with she golden hair glimmer in the moonlight she white robe and the anger on she face look like some avenge angel drive a fiend to hell he shrink away from she and there come a pause and save for they heavy breathing stillness again fall upon the house whilst the picture that hang above they seem in the half light to follow they with its fierce eye as though it be a living thing the landing where they stand look upon the hall below at the end of which be philip 's study suddenly its door burst open and philip himself pass through it grasp a candlestick in one hand and some parchment in the other he feature be dreadful to see resemble those of a dumb thing in torture he eye protrude he livid lip move but no sound come from they he stagger across the hall with terror stare from he face father father call angelum but he take no notice -- he do not even seem to hear presently they hear the candlestick throw with a clash upon the hall pavement then the front door slam and he be go and at that moment a great ruddy glow shoot up the western sky then a tongue of flame then another and another see say angelum with a solemn laugh i do not appeal for help in vain isleworth hall be in flame chapter lvi arthur do not delay he departure from madeira the morning follow mildr 's ball he embark on board a portuguese boat a very dirty craft which smell of garlic and rancid oil and sail for lisbon he arrive there safely and moon about that city for a while himself a monument of serious reflection and then strike across into spain where he spend a month or so inspect the historical beauty of that fall country thence he penetrate across the pyrenee into southern france which be pleasant in the spring month here he remain another month meeting with no adventure worthy of any note and improve he knowledge of the french language tire at last of this he travel to pari and go to the theater but find he own thought too absorb to allow of he take any keen interest in they sensationalism so after a brief stay he make he way up to brittany and normandy and go in for inspect old castle and cathedral and finally end up he continental travels by spend a week on the island rock of saint michel this place pleased he more than any he have visit he like to wander about among the massive granite pillar of that noble ecclesiastical fortress and at night to watch the phosphoric tide come rush in with all the speed of a race-horse over the wide sand which separate it from the mainland there the thirty-first day of may find he and he bethink he that it be time to return to london and see about get the settlement draw and order the wedding bouquet to speak the truth he think more about the bouquet than the settlement he arrive in london on the first of June and go to see he family lawyer a certain mr borley who have be solicitor to the trust during he minority bless I heigham how like you father you have grow say that legal gentleman as soon as arthur be ensconce in the client 's chair -- a chair that have it be endow with the gift of speech could have tell some surprising story it seem only the other day that he be sit there dictate the term of he will and yet that be before the crimean war more than twenty year ago well my boy what be it arthur thus encourage enter into a rather blunder recital of the circumstance of he engagement mr borley do not say much but from he manner and occasional comment it be evident that he consider the whole story very odd -- regard it indeed with some suspicion i must tell you frankly mr heigham he say at last i do not quite understand this business the young lady no doubt be charming -- young lady look at they from my client ' point of view always be -- but i can not say i like you story about she father why do you not tell I all this before i might then have be able to give you some advice worth have or at any rate to make a few confidential -- he lay great emphasis on the word confidential -- inquiry arthur reply that it have not occur to he to do so umph pity -- great pity but there be no time for that sort of thing now if you think you be go to get marry on the tenth so i suppose the only thing to do be to go through with it and await the upshot what do you wish do arthur explain he view which apparently include settle all he property on he bride in the most absolute fashion possible to this mr borley forcibly object and in the end arthur have to give way and make such arrangement as the old gentleman think proper -- arrangement differ considerably from those propose by himself this interview over he have other and pleasanter duty to perform such as order he wedding clothes make arrangement with a florist for the bridal bouquet and last but not least have he mother 's diamond re-set as a present for he bride but still the day go very slowly there seem to be no end to they he have no relation to go and see and in he present anxious excited state he prefer to avoid he friend and club acquaintance fifth sixth seventh never do a schoolboy await the come of the day that mark the advent of he holiday with such intense anxiety at length the eighth of June arrive month before he have settle what he program should be on that day he promise as the reader may remember forbid he to see angelum till the ninth that be at any hour after twelve on the night of the eighth or practically as early as possible on the follow morning now the earliest train would not get he down to roxham till eleven o'clock which would involve a wicked waste of four or five hour of daylight that might be spend with angelum so he wisely resolve to start on the evening of the eighth by a train leave paddington at six o'clock and reach roxham at nine the day he spend in sign the settlement finally interview the florist and give he direction as to forwarding the wedding - bouquet which be to be compose of orange-blossom lily of the valley and stephanoi and in get the marriage-license but notwithstanding these manifold employment he manage to be three - quarter of a hour before he train the longest forty-five minute he ever spend he have write to the proprietor of the inn at rewtham where he have sleep a year ago the night after he have leave isleworth to send a gig to meet he at the station and on arrive at roxham a porter tell he that a trap be wait for he on emerge from the station even in the darkness he be able to recognize the outline of the identical vehicle which have convey he to the abbey house some thirteen month ago whilst the sound of a ancient quavering voice inform he that the jehu be likewise the same he luggage be soon bundle up behind and the steady-going old nag depart into the darkness well sam do you remember I well no sir i can not rightly say how i do : wait a bit bea not you the gemman as travels in the dry line and as i seed a-kissing the chambermaid no i do not travel at present and i have not kiss a chambermaid for some time do you remember drive a gentleman over to the abbey house a year or so ago why yes in course i do lord now and be you he and we seed old devil 's caresfoot 's granddaughter ah many 's the time that he have damned I and all so soft and pleasant like but it be he eye that do the trick they be awful just awful and you give I half-a - crown you do but somehow i think i hear summat about you sir but i can not rightly remember what it be my head not be so good as it use to perhaps you hear what i be go to be marry no i do not think how as it be that neither well never mind I have you see miss caresfoot -- the young lady you see the day you drive I to the abbey house -- anywhere about lately arthur wait for the old man 's linger answer with all he heart upon he lip lor ' yes sir that i have i see she this morning drive through the roxham market-place and how do she look a bit pale i think sir but well enough and wonnerful handsome arthur give a sigh of relief he feel like a man who have just come scatheless through some horrible crisis and once more know the sweet sensation of safety what a load the old man 's word have lift from he mind in he active imagination he have picture all sort of evil which might have happen to angelum during he year of absence lover be always prone to such imagining and not altogether without reason for there would seem to be a special power of evil that devote itself to the derangement of they affair and the ingenious disappointment of they hope but now the vague dread be go angelum be not spirit away or dead and to know she alive be to know she faithful as they drive along the old ostler continue to volunteer various scrap of information which fall upon he ear unheeded till presently he attention be catch by the name caresfoot what about he he ask quickly he be a-dying they do say which of they why the red-haired one he as life up at the hall yonder poor fellow say arthur feeling quite fond of george in he happiness they have by this time reach the inn where he have some supper for old sam 's good news have bring back he appetite which of late have not be quite up to par and then go straight to he room that face towards the abbey house it be he notice the same in which he have sleep the year before and look at the bed he remember he dream and smile as he think that the wood be pass and before he lay nothing but the flowery meadow mildr carr too cross he mind but of she he do not think much not that he be by any means heartless -- indeed what have happen have pained he acutely the more so because he own conscience tell he he have be a fool he be very sorry but love be here below one of the most selfish of the passion he have not time to be sorry just then for just on the horizon he could distinguish a dense mass which be the tree surround the abbey house and between the tree there glimmer a faint light which might proceed from some rise star or from angelum 's window he prefer to believe it be the latter the propinquity make he very happy what be she do he wonder -- sit by she window and thinking of he he would ask she on the morrow it be worth while go through that year of separation in order to taste the joy of meet it seem like a dream to think that within six-and-thirty hour he would probably be angelum 's husband and how nobody in the world would be able to take she away from he he stretch out he arm towards she my darling my darling he cry aloud into the still night my darling my darling the echo answer sadly chapter lvii that night arthur dream no evil dream but he think he hear a sound outside he door and some one speak of fire hearing nothing more he turn and go to sleep again wake in the early dawn he feel ere yet he sens fully come a happy sense of something he know not what a rosy shadow of come joy such as will only with more intensity fall upon we quicken faculty when death end we soul begin to stir as we awaken to eternity he spring from he bed and he eye fall on a morocco case upon the dressing-table it contain the diamond which he have have re-set as a wedding present to angelum they be nothing compare with mildr carr 's but still extremely handsome they beauty be enhance by the elegance of the setting which be in the shape of a snake with emerald head and ruby eye so construct as to clasp tightly round angelum 's shapely throat the sight of the jewellery at once recall he present circumstance and he know that the long hour of trial be pass -- he be about to meet angelum have dress himself as quickly as he could he take up the jewel-case but find it too large to stow away he open it and take out the necklace cram it into he pocket thus arm he slip down the stair past the open common room where the light shone through the crack in the shutter on a dismal array of sticky beer-mug and spirit glass down the sanded passage into the village street it be full daylight now and the sun never look upon a lovelier morning the air be warm but there be that sharp freshness in it which be needful to make summer weather perfect and which we always miss by breakfast at nine o'clock the sky be blue just fleck with little cloud the dewdrop sparkle upon every leaf and blade of grass touch of mist cling about the hollow and the sweet breath of the awaken earth be full of the perfect scent of a english June which be in its way even more delicious than the spicy odour of the tropics it be a morning to make sick man well and man happy and atheist believer in a creative hand how much more than do it fire arthur 's pulse already bound with youth and health with a untold joy he feel like a child again so free from care so happy except that he heart swell with a love beyond the knowledge of child he quick temperament have rebound from the depths of unequal depression into which it so often fall to the height of a happy assurance the tantalus cup be at he lip at last and he would drink he full be sure he eye flash and sparkle he foot fall light and quick as a antelope 's he brown cheek glow -- never have he look so handsome angelum would not forget she promise she would be wait for he by the lake he be sure of that and thither he make he way through the morning sunshine they be happy moment presently he pass into the parish of bratham and he eye fall upon a neat red brick cottage a garden plant with sunflower and a bright gravel path run to the rustic gate he think the garden charmingly old-fashioned and have just enter a mental note to ask angelum who live there when the door open and figure he know emerge bear a mat in one hand and a mopstick in the other he be some way off and at first could not quite distinguish who it be but before she have come to the gate he recognize pigott by this time she have step into the road and be make elaborate preparation to dust she mat so that she do not see he till he speak to she how be you pigott what may you be do down here why be you not up at the abbey she give a cry and the mat and mopstick fall from she hand mr heigham she say in a awed voice that chill he blood what have bring you back and why do you come to I i never wrong you what be you talk about i have come to marry angelum of course we be go to be marry to-morrow oh then it be really _ you _ sir _ and she marry yesterday -- oh good god _ do not laugh at I nurse -- please do not laugh it -- it upset I why do you shake so what do you mean mean -- i mean that my angelum _ marry she cousin george caresfoot at roxham yesterday _ heaven forgive I for have to tell it you reader have you ever mortally wound a head of large game you hear you bullet thud upon the living flesh and see the creature throw up its head and stagger for a moment and then plunge forward with desperate speed crash through bush and reed as though they be meadow-grass follow he awhile and you will find he stand quite still breathe in great sigh he back humped and he eye dim the gore trickle from he nostril he be die -- but be careful he mean mischief before he die any great shock mental or physical be apt to reduce man to the level of he brother beast arthur for instance behave very much like a wounded buffalo as soon as the stun of the blow pass away and the rend pain begin to make itself feel for a few seconds he gaze before he stupid and helpless then he face turn quite gray the eye and nostril gape wide and a curious rigidity take possession of he muscle the road he be follow lead to a branch lane the same that angelum be turn up that misty christmas eve when she see lady bellamy glide past in she carriage this lane have in former age no doubt to judge from its numerous curve be a ancient forest-path and it run to the little bridge over the stream that feed the lake -- a point that by travel as the crow fly from pigott 's cottage might be reach in half the time this fact arthur seem at that dreadful moment to suddenly realize more probably from natural instinct than from any particular knowledge of the lay of the land he do not speak again to pigott and she be too frightened at he face to speak to he he only look at she but she never forget that look so long as she live then he turn like a mad thing and go _ crash _ through the thick fence that hedge the road and run at full speed towards the lake diverge neither to the right nor to the left but break he way without the slightest apparent difficulty through everything that oppose he very soon he come to the little bridge and here strike by some new instinct he halt he do not appear to be out of breath but he lean on the rail of the bridge and groan like a die man he ghastly face make a blot in the mimic scenery of the place which be really very pretty the bridge command no view for the little creek it span and into which the stream run give a turn before it grow into the neck of the lake but it be hedge in by greenery and the still pool beneath it be star with water-lily turn they innocent eye up to the blue sky and look as peaceful as though there be no stormy wind or water in the world to toss they amongst these water-lily a moorhen have build she nest and presently she come cluck out right under arthur 's foot follow by ten or a dozen little hurrying black ball each tip with sealing-wax red she look very happy with she brood -- as happy as the lily and the blue sky -- and the sight make he savage he take up a large stone that lay by he and throw it at she it hit she on the back and kill she and arthur laugh loud as he watch she struggle and then lie still while the motherless chick hurry frightened away and yet since he be a boy he have never till now wantonly injure any living creature presently the dead water-hen float out of sight and he rouse himself straighten he clothes which have be somewhat tear and derange and with a steady step and a fix smile upon he lip go forward no longer at a run but walk quietly up the path that lead to the big oak and shaded glen in five minute he be there again he pause and look there be something to see on one of the stone seat dress in black she face deathly pale she head rest on she hand and trouble in she eye sit angelum on the other be she constant companion the dog which he have give she he remember how a little more than a year before she have surprise he in the same way and he have look upon she and love she he could even smile at the strange irony of fate that have under such curiously reverse circumstance bring he back to surprise she to look upon she and hate she she move uneasily and glance round but he be hide by a bush then she half rise pause irresolutely and as though struggle against something foolish sit determinedly down again when arthur have do smile he come forward a few step into the open feeling that he face be all draw and change as indeed it be it be the face of a man of fifty he eye be fire and he heart be ice she turn she head and look up with a shrink in she eye as though she fear to see something hateful -- a shrink which turn first to wonder then to dread then to a lively joy and then again to awe she rise mechanically with a great gasp she lip part as though to speak but no word come the dog too see he

tire of everything except the success which crown a struggle well i have way of escape you know nothing of do you worst i be not afraid of you and she lean back easily in she chair and look at he with wearied and indifferent eye little sir john ground he tooth and twist he pippen-like face into a scowl that look absurdly out of place on anything so jovial curse you he say even now you dare to defy I do you know you woman fiend that at this moment i almost think i love you of course i know it if you do not love I you would not take all this trouble to try to crush I but this conversation be very long shall we put a end to it sir john sit still a moment thinking and gaze at the splendid sphinx-browed creature before he with a mixture of hatred and respect then he rise and speak anne you be a wonderful woman i can not do it i can not utterly ruin you you must be expose -- i could not help that if i would -- and we must separate but i will be generous to you i will allow you five hundred a year and you shall live where you like you shall not starve she laugh a little as she answer i be starve now : it be long past luncheon time as for you five hundred a year that you will give I out of

than yours to humble I i may be a bad woman i daresay i be but you will find too late that there be few in the world like I for year you have shine with a reflect light when the light go out you will go out too get back into you native mud the mental slime out of which i pick you contemptible creature that you be and when you have lose I learn to measure the loss by the depths to which you will sink i reject you offer i mock at you threat for they will recoil on you own head i despise you and i have do with you john bellamy good - bye and with a proud curtsey she sweep from the room that evening it be rumor that sir john bellamy have separate from he wife owe to circumstance which have come to he knowledge in connection with george caresfoot 's death chapter lx that same afternoon lady bellamy order out the victorium with the fast trot horse and drive to the abbey house she find philip pacing up and down the gravel in front of the gray old place which have that morning add one more to the long list of human tragedy its wall have witness he face be pale and contorted by mental suffering and as soon as he recognize lady bellamy he make a effort to escape she stop he i suppose it be here mr caresfoot it what the body yes i wish to see it philip hesitate a minute and then lead the way to he study the corpse have be lay upon the table just as it have be take from the water indeed the wet still fall in heavy drop from the clothes on to the ground it be to be remove to roxham that evening to await the inquest on the morrow the shutter of the room have be close lest the light should strike too fiercely on the ghastly sight but even in the twilight lady bellamy could discern every detail of its outline clearly mark by the wet patch on the sheet which be throw loosely over it on a chair by the side of the table above the level of which its head rise give it the appearance of be in the act of climb on to it lay the carcass of the dog its tooth still firmly set in the dead man 's arm they have be unable to unlock the savage grip without hacking its jaw asunder and this it be not think advisable to do till after the inquest at the door philip pause as though he do not mean to enter come in say lady bellamy surely you be not afraid of a dead man i fear the dead a great deal more than i do the living he mutter but come in and shut the door as soon as she eye have grow accustomed to the light lady bellamy go up to the body and draw off the sheet gaze long and steadily at the mutilate face on the lip of which the bloody froth still stand i tell he last night she say presently to philip that we should never meet again alive but i do not think to see he so soon like this do you know that i once love that thing that shatter brain direct the only will to which i ever bow but the love go out for ever last night the chain snap and now i can look upon this sight without a single sigh or a regret with nothing but loathing and disgust there lie the man who ruin I -- do you know it i do not care who know it now -- ruin I with he eye open not care anything about I there lie the hard task-master whom i serve through so many year the villain who drive I against my will into this last crime which have thus bring its reward the dog give he he just due look its tooth still hold he as fast perhaps as the memory of he crime will hold he where he have go regret he sorrow for he no oh no i can curse he as he lie villain monster devil that he be she pause and even in the dim light philip could see she bosom heave and she great eye flash with the fierceness of she excitement you should not talk so of the dead he say you be right she answer he have go beyond the reach of my word but the thought of all the misery i have suffer at he hand make I for a moment mad cover it up again the vile frame which hold a viler soul to the earth with the one to undreamed of sorrow with the other each to its appoint place how do it run -- ` the wages of sin be death ' yes that be right he be dead the blow fall first on he that be right and i be about to die and you -- what will happen to you the juda of the plot eh you do not think that you will enjoy you blood-money in peace do you what do you mean asked philip nervously she wild way frighten he mean why that you be the sorriest knave of all this man be at least lead on to crime by passion bellamy enter into it to work out a secret revenge poor fool i act because i could not help myself at first and then for the sake of the game itself for when i take a thing in my hand i _ will _ succeed but you philip caresfoot you sell you own flesh and blood for money or money 's worth and you be the worst of all -- worse than george for even a brutal love be a nobler thing than avarice like yours well as the sin be so will the punishment be it be a lie i think that he be dead you think that arthur heigham be dead -- then i read you thought very wrongly when we meet upon the road on christmas day you wish to think that he be dead but you do not think it even now you conscience be make a coward of you and as you say just now for you the silence of the dead be more terrible than the accusation of the living i know a little about you philip do you not see shadow on you wall and do not depart voice come to haunt you in you sleep i know you do and i will tell you this -- the _ thing _ which you have suffer from at time shall henceforth be you continual companion if you can pray pray with all you strength that you daughter may not die for if she do she shadow will always be there to haunt you with the rest why do you tremble so at the mere mention of a spirit stand still and i will show you one i can if i like philip could stand it no longer with a curse he burst out of the room presently she follow he and find he stand in front of the house wipe the cold perspiration from he forehead you accurse woman he say go and never come near this house again i never shall come to this house again she answer ah here be my carriage good-bye philip caresfoot you be a very wealthy man now -- worth i do not know how many thousand a year you have be singularly fortunate -- you have accomplish you end few people can do that may the accomplishment bring happiness with it if you wish it to do so stifle you conscience and do not let you superstition affect you but by the way you know french do you not then here be a maxim that in parting i recommend to you attention -- it have some truth in it : il y a une page effrayante dans le livre des destinees humaine : on y light en tete ce mots ` les desirs accomplis ' and she be go i owe he a debt for tempting george on in that business think lady bellamy to herself as she roll swiftly down the avenue of giant walnut but i think that i have repay it the thorn i have plant will fester in he flesh till he die of the sore superstition run wild in he weak mind will make the world a hell for he and that be what i wish presently she stop the carriage and walk to the top of a little knoll command what have be isleworth hill but be now a black smoking blot on the landscape the white front of the house be still stand though riven from top to bottom and through its empty window-place the westering sun pour great stream of fire which look like flame shine through the eye-socket of a gigantic skull i do that well she say and yet how blind i be i should have know that he speak the truth when he say the letter be not there my skill fail I -- it always do fail at need i think the fire would reach they somehow when she arrive at rewtham house she find that sir john have leave take luggage with he and state that he be go to put up at a inn at roxham on the hall-table too lay a summons to attend the inquest on the body of george caresfoot which be to take place on the morrow she tear it across then she go up and dress herself for dinner with such splendor that she maid think it necessary to remind she that there be no company come no she say with a strange smile but i be go out to-night give I my sapphire necklace she sit through dinner and afterwards go into the drawing-room and open a despatch-box read and burn a great number of papers there go the key to my knowledge she say aloud as they flicker and fall into ash no one shall reap the fruit of my labor and yet it be a pity -- i be on the right track and though i could never have succeed another might i have the key though i could not find the lock i must go through with it now i can not live deprive both of success and of my secret power and i could never begin and climb that stair again then from a secret drawer in the despatch-box she extract a little phial tightly stopper and sealing-waxed she examine it closely and look at the liquid in it against the light my medicine have take no harm during this twenty year she think it still look what it be -- strong enough to kill a giant and subtle enough to leave little trace upon a child then she shut up the despatch-box and put it away and go to the open window look up at the star and then down at the shadow fling by the cloud as they sweep across the moon shadow she muse below and gleam of light between the shadow -- that be like we life light above -- pure clear eternal -- that be like the wider life and between the two -- the night and above they both -- the star in the immensity where shall i find my place oh that i might sleep eternally yes that would be best of all -- to sink into sleep never end unbroken and unbreakable to be absorb into the cool vastness of the night and lie in she great arm for ever oh night whom i have ever love you bring you sleep to wearied million -- bring _ I _ sleep eternal but no the star be above the night and above the star be -- what yes the hour i dread like every other mortal with my body and yet dare to long for with my spirit have come i be about to cast off time and pass into eternity to spring from the giddy height of space into the uncertain arm of the infinite yet a few minute and my essence my vital part will start upon its endless course and pass far above those star will find the fount of that knowledge of which it have already sip and drink and drink till it grow like a god and can look upon the truth and not be blind such be my high hope and yet -- if there be a hell my life have be evil my sin many what if there be a avenge power wait as some think to grind I into powder and then endow each crushed particle with individual sense of endless misery what if there be a hell in a few minute or what will seem but a few minute -- for surely to the disembodied spirit time can not exist though it sleep a billion year it will be as a breath -- i shall have solve the problem i shall know what all the panic-stricken million madly ask and ask in vain yes i shall know if _ there be a hell _ well if there be then i shall rule there for power be native to my soul let I hesitate no longer but go and solve the problem before i grow afraid afraid -- i be not afraid ' i have immortal longing in I ' who be it say that oh cleopatra be cleopatra more beautiful than i be i wonder i be sure that she be not so great for have i be she antony should have drive caesar out of egypt oh if i could have love with a pure and perfect love as other woman may and intertwine my destiny with that of some _ great _ man -- some being of a nature kindred to my own -- i should have be good and happy and he should have rule this country but fate and fortune grow afraid of what i should do link my life to a soulless brute and alas like he i have fall -- fall irretrievably she close the window and come into the room ring the bell bring I some wine she say to the servant i do not feel well what wine my lady champagne the wine be bring and stand uncorked upon the table that will do she say tell my maid not to sit up for I : it will be late before i go to bed to-night the man bow and go and she pour out some of the sparkling wine and then take the little phial open it with difficulty and empty its contents into the glass the wine boil up furiously turn milk-white and then clear again but the poison have destroy its sparkle -- it be dead as ditch-water that be strange she say i never see that effect before next she take the phial and powdered it into a pinch of tiny dust with a whale 's tooth that lay upon the table the dust she take to the window and throw out a little at a time lady bellamy wish to die as she have live a mystery then she come and stand over the deadly draught she have compound and think sometimes aloud and sometimes to herself i have hear it say that suicide be coward let those who say it stand as i stand to-night with death lie in the little circle of a glass before they and they will know whether they be coward or if they be spirit of a braver sort than those who can bear to drudge to the bitter end of life it be not yet too late i can throw that stuff away i can leave this place and begin life anew in some other country my jewel will give I the means and for the matter of that i can always win as much money as i want but no then i must begin again and for that i have not the patience or the time besides i long to _ know _ to solve the mystery come let I make a end i will chance it spirit like my own wear they life only while it do not

throw george caresfoot into the bramble-bush arthur walk steadily back to the inn where he arrive quite compose in manner at about half-past seven old sam the ostler be in the yard wash a trap he go

be you sam well i thank yer for seventy-two that be not particular ill have you a gentleman of the name of heigham staying here i be he say arthur do you want I no sir only the station-master at roxham ask I to drop this here as it be marked immediate and he hand arthur a box arthur thank he and take it go up to he room leave old sam delighted to find a new listener to he story of the fire it be from the florist and contain the bouquet he have mean to give angelum on she wedding-day it have cost he a good deal of think that bouquet to say nothing of five guinea of the coin of the realm and he feel a certain curiosity to look at it though to do so give he something of the same sensation that we experience in read a letter write by some loved hand which we know grow cold before the line it trace could reach we he take the box to he room and open it the bouquet be a lovely thing and do credit even to covent garden and the mass of stephanoi and orange-bloom relieve here and there by rise spray of lilies-of-the-valley fill the whole room with fragrance he draw it from the zinc-well in which it be pack in moss and cotton-wool and wonder what he should do with it he could not leave such a thing about nor would he take it away suddenly a idea strike he and he repack it in its case as carefully as he could in the original moss and cotton-wool and then look about for the sheet of tissue-paper that should complete the cover he have destroy it and have to search for a substitute in so do he eye fall upon a long envelope on he dressing-table and he smile it contain he marriage licence and he bethink he that it be a very fair substitute for tissue-paper and quite as worthless he extract it and place it over the flower close up the box then he carefully direct it to mr george caresfoot abbey house and ring the bell desire the boot to find a messenger to take it over when he have do all this he sit down and wonder what could have come to he that he could take pleasure in do a cruel action only worthy of a jealous woman perhaps of all the bitter cup which be hold to we lip in this sad world there be none more bitter than that which it be he lot to drink of now to begin with the blow fall in youth when we love or hate or act with a ardor and a entire devotion that we give to nothing in after-life it be then that the heart put forth its most tender and yet its most lusty shoot and if they be crush the whole plant suffer and sometimes bleed to death arthur have to a extent quite unrealized by himself until he lose she centre all he life in this woman and it be no exaggeration to say as he have say to she that she have murder he heart and wither up all that be best in it she have do more she have inflict the most cruel injury upon he that a woman can inflict upon a man she have shake he belief in she sex at large he feel sit there in he desolation that now he have lose angelum he could never be the same man he would otherwise have be she cruel desertion have shatter the tinted glass through which youth look at the world and he now before he day see it as it be grim and hard and full of coarse reality and do not yet know that time would again soften down the sharpest of the rough outline and throw a garment of its own over the nakedness of life he be a generous - hearted man and not a vain one and have he think that angelum have cease to care for he and love this other man he could have find it in he heart to forgive she and even to sympathize with she but he could not think this something tell he that it be not so she have contract herself into a shameful loveless marriage and to gain end quite foreign to all love have raise a barrier between they which have no right to exist and yet one that in this world could he think never be remove misfortune rain upon we from every quarter of the sky but so long as they come from the sky we can bear they for they be beyond the control of we own volition and must be accept as we accept the gale or the lightning it be the trouble which spring from we own folly and weakness or from that of those with whom we life be intertwine which really crush we now arthur know enough of the world to be aware that there be no folly to equal that of a woman who of she own free will truly loving one man whom she can marry if she will sit deliberately give herself to another it be not only a folly it be a crime and like most crime for this life a irretrievable mistake long before he get back to london the first unwholesome exaltation of mind that always follow a great misfortune and which may perhaps be compare with the excitement that for awhile cover the shameful sense of defeat in a army have evaporate and he begin to realize the crush awfulness of the blow which have fall on he and to fear lest it should drive he mad he look round he little horizon for some straw of comfort at which to catch and could find none nothing but dreadful thought and sickening vision and then suddenly just as he be sink into the dulness of despair there come like the fist gleam of light in chaotic darkness the memory of mildr carr truly she have speak prophetically he idol have be utterly cast down and crush to powder by a hand stronger than he own he would go to she in he suffer perhaps she could find means to comfort he when he reach town he take a hansom and go to look for some room he would not return to those he have leave on the previous afternoon for the sympathetic landlord have help he to pack up the wedding clothes and have admire the wedding gift arthur feel that he could not face he again he find some to suit he in duke street st jame and leave he thing there thence he drive to fenchurch street and take a passage to madeira the clerk the same one who have give he he ticket about a year before remembered he perfectly and ask he how he get on with mr carr but when he passage be take he be disgust to find that the mail do not sail for another five day he look at he watch it be only half-past one o'clock he could scarcely believe what have happen have only occur that morning only seven hour ago it seem to he that he have stand face to face with angelum not that morning but year ago and mile away on some desolate shore which lay on the other side of a dead ocean of pain and yet it be only seven hour if the hour go with such heavy wing how would the day pass and the month and the year what should he do with himself in he condition perpetual activity be as necessary to he as air he must do something to dull the sharp edge of he suffering or the sword of madness which hang over he by such a slender thread would fall suddenly he bethink he of a man whom he have know slightly up at cambridge a man of wealth and evil reputation this man would he feel be able to put he in a way of get through he time he know he address and thither he drive four day later a figure shrink shaky and look prematurely old with the glaze of intoxication scarcely fade from he eye walk into mr borley 's office that respectable gentleman look and look again good heaven he say at length it be not arthur heigham yes it be though say a unequal voice i have come for some money i have get none leave and i be go to madeira to-morrow my dear boy what have happen to you you look so very strange i have be expect to see you marriage in the paper why it be only a few day ago that you leave to be marry a few day a few year you mean i have be jilt that be all nothing to speak of you know but i have rather not talk about it if you do not mind i be like a nag with a flay back do not like the sight of the saddle at present and poor arthur mentally and physically exhaust put he head down on he arm and gulp the old lawyer take in the situation at a glance hard hit he say to himself and go on to the burst and then aloud well well that have happen to many a man in fact you might not believe it but it once happen to I and i do not look much the worse do i but we will not talk about it the less say of a bad business the better that be my maxim and so you be go abroad again have you get any friend at madeira arthur nod and you want some more money let I see i send you 200 pound last week that be for my wedding tour i have spend it now you can guess how i have spend it pleasant contrast be not it give rise to moral reflection come come heigham you must not give way like that these thing happen to most man in the course of they life and if they be wise it teach they that gingerbread be not all gilt and to set down woman at they proper value and appreciate a good one if it please providence to give they one in course of time do not you go make a fool of yourself over this girl 's pretty face handsome be as handsome do these thing be hard to bear i know but you do not make they any better by pitch you own reputation after a girl 's want of stability i know that you be quite right and i be much oblige to you for you kind advice but we will not say anything more about it i suppose that you can let I have some money oh yes if you want it though i think we shall have to overdraw what do you want two hundred here be the cheque i be anxious about that young fellow say mr borley to himself in the pause between arthur 's departure and the entry of the next client i hope he disappointment will not send he to the dog he be not of the sort who take it easy like i do for instance dear I that be a long while ago now i wonder what the detail of he little affair be and who the girl marry captain shuffle yes show he in chapter lxii next morning arthur cash he cheque and start on he travels he have no very clear idea why he be go back to madeira or what he mean to do when he get there but then at this painful stage of he existence none of he idea could be call clear though he do not realize it what he be search for be sympathy female sympathy of course for in trouble member of either sex gravitate instinctively to the other for comfort perhaps they do not quite trust they own or perhaps they be afraid of be laugh at arthur 's be not one of those nature that can lock they grief within the bosom and let they lie there till in process of time they shrivel away except among member of the peerage as picture in current literature these stern proud creature be not common man whether he figure in the world as a peer or a hedge-carpenter be as a matter of fact mentally as well as physically gregarious and adverse to loneliness either in he joy or sorrow decidedly too the homoeopathic system must be found on great natural fact and there be philosophy bear of the observation of human nature in the somewhat vulgar proverb that recommend a hair of the dog that bit you otherwise nine man out of every ten who have be badly treat or think that they have be badly treat by a woman would not at once rush headlong for refuge to another a proceeding which also in nine case out of ten end in make confusion worse confound arthur though he be not aware of it be exemplify a natural law that have not yet be properly explain but even if he have know it it be doubtful if the knowledge would have make he any happier for it be irritating to reflect that we be the slave of natural law that we action be not the outcome of we own volition but of a vague force work silently as the gulf stream -- since such knowledge make a man measure he weakness and so strike at he tenderest point he vanity but whilst we have be reflect together my reader and i arthur be make he way to madeira so we may as well all come to a halt off funchal very shortly after the vessel have drop she anchor arthur be greet by he friend the manager of mile ' hotel glad to see you sir though i can not say that you look well i scarcely expect to find anybody for we at this time of year business be very slack in the summer yes i suppose that madeira be pretty empty there be nobody here at all sir be mrs carr go then ask arthur in some alarm no she be still here she have not be away this year but she have be very quiet no party or anything which make people think that she have lose money by this time the boat be rise on the roll of the last billow to be catch next moment by a dozen hand and drag up the shingle it be evening or rather verge that way and from under the magnolia - tree below the cathedral there come the sound of the band summon the inhabitant of funchal to congregate chatter and flirt i think say arthur that i will ask you to take my thing up to the hotel i will come by-and-by i should like the same room i have before if it be empty very good mr heigham you will have the place nearly all to yourself now have see he baggage depart arthur turn and resist the importunity of beggar guide and parrot-seller who have not yet recognize he as a old hand make he way towards the quinta carr how well he know the street and house even to the withered face of the woman who sit by the door and yet he seem to have grow old since he have see they ten minute of sharp walk bring he to the gate of the quinta and he pause before they and think how a few month ago he have quit they miserable at the grief of another now to re-enter they utterly crush by he own he walk on through the beautiful garden to the house the hall-door stand open he do not wait to ring but drive by some impulse enter after the glare of the sun which at that time of the year be powerful even in its decline the carefully shaded hall seem quite dark but by degree he eye adapt themselves to the altered light and begin to distinguish the familiar outline of the furniture next they travel to the door of the drawing-room where another sight await they for there herself a perfect picture standing in the doorway for a frame she hand outstretch in welcome and a loving smile upon she lip be mildr i be wait for you she say gently i think that you would come mildred my idol have be cast down and as you tell I to do i have come back to you dear she answer you be very welcome and then come miss terry pleased with all she honest heart to see he and utterly ignorant of the fierce current that sweep under the smooth surface of they little social sea miss terry be not by nature a keen observer dear I mr heigham who would have think of see you again so soon you _ be _ brave to cross the bay so often -lrb- she thought run a great deal on the bay of biscay -rrb- but i do not think you look quite well you have such black line under you eye and i declare there be a gray hair oh i assure you you favorite bay be enough to turn anybody 's hair gray miss terry and so talk cheerfully they go in to the pleasant little dinner mildr lean over so slightly on he arm and gaze into he sad face with full and happy eye after all that he have go through it seem to arthur as though he have drop into a haven of rest see here say mildr when they rise from table a wonder have come to pass since you desert we look sceptic that you be and she lead he to the window and lift a glass shade which protect a flower-pot show he a green spike peeping from the soil what be that what be it -- why it be the mummy hyacinth which you declare that we should never see blossom in this world it have bud whether or not it will blossom who can say it be a omen he say with a little laugh and for the first time that evening they eye meet come into the garden and you can smoke on the museum verandah it be pleasant there these hot night it be dangerous you garden she laugh softly you have prove yourself superior to danger then they pass out together the evening be still and very sultry not a breath stir the silence of the night the magnolia the moon - flower and a thousand other bloom pour out they fragrance upon the surround air where it lay in rich patch like perfume throw on water a thin mist veil the sea and the little wavelet strike with a sorrowful sound against the rock below tell I all about it arthur she have settle herself upon a long low chair and as she lean back the starlight glance white upon she arm and bosom there be not much to tell it be a common story -- at least i believe so she throw I over and the day before i should have marry she married another man well well i see she the morning follow she marriage i do not remember what i say but i believe i speak what be in my mind she faint and i leave she ah you speak harshly perhaps speak harshly now that i have have time to think of it i wish that i could have have ten imagination to shape my thought and ten tongue to speak they with do you understand what this woman have do she have sell herself to a brute -- oh mildr such a brute -- she have desert I for a man who be not even a gentleman perhaps she be force into it force -- nonsense we be not in the middle age a good woman should have be force to drown herself before she consent to commit such a sacrilege against herself as to marry a man she hate but she ` my love my dive my undefiled ' -- she whom i think whiter than the snow -- she could do this and do it deliberately i have rather have see she dead and myself dead with she do not you take a rather exaggerated view arthur do not you think perhaps that some of the fault lie with you for overrate woman believe I so far as my experience go and i have see a good many the majority of they do not possess the exalted purity of mind you and many very young man attribute to they they be on the contrary for the most part quite ready to exercise a wise discretion in the matter of marriage even when the feeble tendency which represent they affection point another way a little pressure go a long way with they they be always glad to make the most of it it be the dust they throw up to hide they retreat you angelum for instance be no doubt and probably still be very fond of you you be a charming young man with nice eye and a take way with woman and she would very much have like to marry you but then she also like she cousin 's estate she could not have both and be force to choose she choose the latter you should take a common-sense view of the matter you be not the first who have suffer woman especially young woman who do not understand the value of affection must be very much in love before they submit to the self-sacrifice that be suppose to be characteristic of they and what man talk of as stain upon they they do not consider as such they know if they know nothing else that a good income and a establishment will make they perfectly clean in the opinion of they own small world -- a little world of sham and form that care nothing for the spirit of the moral law provide the letter be act up to it be by this that they mark they standard of personal virtue not by the high rule you man imagine for they there be no social fuller 's soap so effectual as money and position you speak like a book and give you own sex a high character tell I then would you do such a thing i arthur how can you ask I i have rather be tear to piece by wild horse i speak of the majority of the woman not of they all ah and yet she could do it and i think she better than you i do not think that you should speak bitterly of she arthur i think that you should be sorry for she sorry for she why because from what i have gather about she she be not quite a ordinary young woman : however badly she may have treat you she be a person of refine feeling and susceptibility be it not so without a doubt well then you should pity she because she will bitterly expiate she mistake for myself i do not pity she much because i will not waste my sympathy on a fool for to my mind the woman who could do what she have do and deliberately throw away everything that can make life really worth live to we woman be a most contemptible fool but you love she and therefore you should be sorry for she but why because she be a woman who at one-and-twenty have bury all the higher part of life who have of she own act for ever deprive herself of joy that nothing else can bring she love true love be almost the only expression of which we woman be capable of all the nobler instinct and vague yearning after what be higher and better than the thing we see and feel around we when we love most and love happily then we be at we topmost bent and soar further above the earth than anything else can carry we consequently when a woman be faithless to she love which be the purest and most honorable part of she the very best thing to which she can attain she clip she wing and can fly no more but must be toss like a cripple gull hither and thither upon the stormy surface of she little sea of course i speak of woman of the higher stamp many perhaps most will feel nothing of all this in a little while they will grow content with they dull round and the alien nature which they have mate with and in they child and they petty care and dissipation will forget that they possess a higher part if indeed they do possess it like everything else in the world they find they level but with woman like you angelum it be another thing for they time only serve to increasingly unveil the medusa-headed truth till at last they see it as it be and they heart turn to stone back with a sick longing to see a face that be go from they they become lose spirit wander everlastingly in the emptiness they have choose and find no rest even she child will not console she arthur utter a smother exclamation do not start arthur you _ must _ accustom yourself to the fact that that woman have pass away from you and be as completely the personal property of another man as that chair be mine but there the subject be a painful one to you shall we change it it be one that you seem to have study pretty deeply yes because i have realize its importance to a woman for some year i have long to be able to fall in love and when at last i do so arthur and here she voice grow very soft it be with a man who could care nothing for I such have be my unlucky chance that a woman herself belove and herself worthily beloved could throw she bless opportunity away be to I a thing inconceivable and that arthur be what you angelum have do chapter lxiii then you will not marry now mildr say arthur after a pause no arthur no one no one arthur he rise and lean over the railing of the verandah look at the sea the mist that hide it be drift and eddy hither and thither before little puff of wind and the clear sky be clouding up there be go to be a storm he say presently yes i think so the air feel like it he hesitate a while and look down at she she seem very lovely in the half light as indeed she be she too look up at he inquiringly at last he speak mildr you say just now that you would not marry anybody will you make a exception -- will you marry I it be she turn to pause now you be very good she murmur no i be not at all good you know how the case stand you know that i still love angelum and that i shall in all probability always love she i can not help that but if you will have I mildr i will try to be a good husband to you and to make you happy will you marry I dear no arthur why not have you then cease to care for I no dear i love you more than ever you can not dream how much i do love you then why will you not marry I be it because of this business no and raise herself in the low chair she look at he with intense earnestness that be not the reason i will not marry you because i have become a better woman since you go away because i do not wish to ruin you life you ask I to do so now in all sincerity but you do not know what you ask you come from the scene of as bitter a disappointment as can befall a man and you be a little touch by the contrasting warmth of you reception here a little move by my evident interest and perhaps a little influence by my good look though _ they _ be nothing much supposing that i consent suppose i say ` arthur i will put my hand in yours and be you wife ' and that we be marry to-morrow do you think when the freshness of the thing have wear off that you would be happy with I i do not you would soon get horribly tired of I arthur for the little leaven that leaven the whole lump be want you do not love I and the redundance of my affection would weary you and for my part i should find it difficult to continually struggle against a impalpable rival though indeed i should be very willing to put up with that i be sorry you think so yes arthur i do think so but you do not know what it cost I to say it i be deliberately shut the door which bar I from my heaven i be throw away the chance i strove so hard to win that will tell you how much i think it do you know i must be a strange contradiction when i know you be engage to another woman i strain my every nerve to win you from she while the object be still to be gain i feel no compunction i be fetter by no scruple i want to steal you from she and marry you myself but now that all this be change and that you of you own free will come and offer to make I you wife i for the first time feel how wrong it would be of I to take advantage of you in a moment of pique and disappointment and bind you for life to a nature which you do not really understand to a violent and a jealous woman too late when you life be hamper and you future spoil you would discover that you hate I arthur dear i will not consent to bind you to I by any tie that can not be break hush mildr you should not say such thing about yourself if you be as violent and jealous as you say you be also a very noble - hearted woman for none other would so sacrifice herself perhaps you be right i do not know but whether you be right or wrong i can not tell you how you have make I respect you dear those be the most comfortable word i have ever hear after what have pass between we i scarcely think to win you respect then you will not marry I mildr no that be you fixed determination it be ah well he sigh i suppose that i have better ` top my boom ' again do what i mean i have better leave madeira why should you leave madeira he hesitate a little before reply well because if i do not marry you and still come here people will talk they do before you know be you afraid of be talk about then i oh dear no what can it matter to I now and suppose i be to tell you that what ` people ' say with or without foundation be as much a matter of indifference to I as the blowing of next summer 's breeze would you still consider it necessary to leave madeira i do not know he again rise and lean over the verandah rail it be go to be a wild night he say presently yes the wind will spoil all the magnolia pick I that bud it be too good to be waste he obey and just as he step back on to the verandah a fierce rush of wind come up from the sea and go howl away behind they i love a storm she murmur as he bring the flower to she it make I feel so strong and she stretch out she perfect arm as though to catch the wind what be i to do with this magnolia give it to I i will pin it in my dress -- no do you fasten it for I the chair in which she be lounge be so low that to do as she bid he arthur be force to kneel beside she kneeling thus the sweet upturned face be but just beneath he own the breath from the curved lip play amongst he hair and again there creep over he that feeling of fascination of utter helplessness that he have once before resist but this time he do not attempt to resist and no vision come to save he slowly draw by the beauty of she tender eye he yield to the spell and soon she lip be press upon he own and the white arm have close around he neck whilst the crushed magnolia bloom shed its perfume round they fiercer sweep the storm the lightning flash and the gale catch the crest of the rise wave dash they in spray to where they sit dear he say presently you must not stop here the spray be wet you i wish that it would drown I she answer almost fiercely i shall never be so happy again you think that you love I now i should like to die before you learn to hate I come let we go in chapter lxiv when mildr receive lady bellamy 's telegram she be so sure that it would prove the forerunner of arthur 's arrival at madeira that she have at once set about make arrangement for he amusement it so happen that there be at the time a very beautiful sea-going steam yacht of about two hundred and fifty ton burden lie in the roadstead she belong to a nobleman who be suddenly recall to england by mail-steamer and through a series of chance mildr be enable to buy she a bargain the crew of the depart nobleman also continue in she service the morning after the storm break sweet and clear and except that the flower be somewhat shatter all nature look the fresher for its violent visitation arthur who have come up early to the quinta mildr and miss terry be all seat at breakfast in a room that look out to the sea which although the wind have die away still run rather high they make a pretty picture as they sit round the english-looking breakfast-table with the light pour in upon they from the open window miss terry with she usual expression of good - humored solemnity pour out the tea and mildr and arthur who sit exactly opposite to each other drinking it never have the former look more lovely than she do that morning my dear say agatha to she what have you do to yourself you look beautiful do i dear then it be because i be happy agatha be quite right thought arthur she do look beautiful there be such depth and rest in she clear eye such a wealth of happy triumph write on she feature she might have sit that morning as a study of the venus victrix she talk too be as bright as herself she laugh and shine and sparkle like the rain-drop on the bamboo spray that rock in the sunshine and whenever she address herself to arthur which be often enough every sentence seem wrap in tender meaning she whole life go out towards he a palpable thing she wait on he word and bask in he smile mildr carr do nothing by half arthur be the least cheerful of the three though at time he try he best to join in mildred 's merriment any one who know he well could have tell that he be suffer from one of he fit of constitutional melancholy and a physiognomist look at the somewhat dreamy eye and pensive face would probably have add that he neither be nor ever would be a entirely happy man by degree however he seem to get the better of he thought whatever they might be now arthur if you be quite awake begin or rather go on mildred perhaps you will come to the window i have something to show you here i be at you service what may it be good now look do you see that little vessel in the bay beneath there to the right of leeuw rock yes and uncommonly pretty she be what of she what of she why she be my yacht you yacht goodness gracious mildr you do not mean to say that you have be buy a yacht and tell I nothing about it just think well i call that sly yes my dear agatha i have a yacht and a ready-made crew and the very prettiest saloon in the world and

goodness sake do not overwhelm we and what be you go to do with you white elephant now that you have get it do with it why ride on it of course ` lady and gentleman ' or rather ` lady and gentleman '

you have do that already say arthur _ sotto voce _ mildr i will not go and that be flat my dear you mean that you be afraid of be flat but agatha seriously you must come nobody be sick in those semi-tropical water and if you will not i suppose it would not be quite the thing for arthur and i to go alone and then my dear just think what a splendid place the canary must be for insect why ask agatha solemnly because of all the little bird it have to support but i think they live on hemp-seed oh no -- not in they native land well i suppose i must go but i really believe that you will kill I with you mania for sea-voyage mildr i suppose you will take to balloon next that be by no mean a bad idea i should like to see you in a balloon agatha mildr i know where to draw the line into a

to the _ mildr carr _ and get snub for he pain the _ evening star _ be a beautiful craft build on fine line but for all that a wonderful boat in a heavy sea she be a three-masted schooner square-rigged forward of large beam she fitting below be perfect down to the paint panel after watteau in the saloon and the electric bell and she be rig either to sail or steam as might be most convenient on the present occasion as there be not the slightest hurry and no danger of a lee-shore it be determine that they should not avail themselves of the steam-power so the propeller be hoist up and everything get ready for that most delightful thing a long cruise under canvas arthur be perfectly charm with everything he see and so be agatha terry until they get under way when she discover that a mail - steamer be a joke compare with the yacht in the matter of motion in short the unfortunate agatha be soon reduce to she normal condition of torpor mildr always declare that she hibernate on board ship like a dormouse or a bear she be not very sea-sick she simply lay and sleep eat very little and think not at all by the way say arthur as they sail out of the bay i never give any

sit upon the moonlit deck the little vessel be under all she canvas for the breeze be light and skim over the water like a gull with its wing spread in the low light madeira be nothing but a blot on the sky-line the crew be forward with the solitary exception of the man steer the vessel from he elevated position on the bridge and sit as they be abaft the deck-cabin the two be utterly alone between the great silence of the star and of the sea she look into he face and it be tender towards she -- that night be make for lover -- and tear of happiness stand in she eye she take he hand in hers and she head nestle upon he breast i should like to sail on for ever so quite alone with you i never again wish to see the land or the sun or any other sea than this or any other eye than yours

happy now -- so happy that i scarcely dare to speak for fear lest i should break the spell and i feel so good -- so much nearer heaven when i think of all my past life it seem like a stupid dream full of little nothing of which i can not recall any memory except that they be empty and without mean but the future be worse than the past because it look fair and snake always hide in flower it make I afraid how do i know what the future will bring i wish that the present -- the pleasant certain present that i hold with my hand -- could last for ever who do know mildr if the human race could see the pleasant surprise in store for it individually i believe that it would drown itself _ en masse _ who have not sometimes catch at the skirt of to-day and cry ` stay a little -- do not let to-morrow come yet ' you know the line -- ' o temp suspend ton vol et vous heure propice suspendez votre cour laissez nous savourer les rapides delices des plus beaux de nos jours ' lamartine only crystallize a universal aspiration when he write that oh arthur i tell you of love and happiness wide as the great sea round we and you talk of ` universal aspiration ' it be the first cold breath from that grey-skied future that i fear oh dear i wonder -- you do not know how i wonder -- if should you ask I again i shall ever with a clear conscience be able to say ` arthur i will marry you ' my dear i ask you to be my wife last night and what i say then i say again now in any case until you dismiss I i consider myself bind to you but i tell you frankly that i should myself prefer that you would marry I for both we sake how cold and correct you be how clearly you realize the position in which i be likely to be put and in what a gentlemanlike way you assure I that you honor will always keep you bind to I that be a weak thread arthur in matter of the heart let angelum reappear as my rival -- would honor keep you to my side honor forsooth it be like a nurse 's bogey in the cupboard -- it be a shibboleth man use to frighten naughty woman with which for themselves be almost devoid of mean even in this light i can see you face flush at she name what chance shall i ever have against she do not speak of she mildred let she memory be dead between we she who belong to I before god and whom i believe in as i believe in my god she offer I the most deadly insult that a woman can offer to a man she love -- she sell herself what do i care what the price be whether it be money or position or convenience or the approbation of she surroundings the result be the same never mention she name to I again i tell you that i hate she what a tirade there be warmth enough about you now i shall be careful how i touch on the subject again but you very energy show that you be deceive yourself i wish i could hear you speak of I like that because then i should know you love I oh if she only know it -- she have she revenge for all you bitter word you be lash to she chariot-wheel arthur you do _ not _ hate she on the contrary you still long to see she face it be still you secret and most cherish hope that you will meet she again either in this or another world you love she as much as ever if she be dead you could bear it but the sharpest sting of you suffering lie in the humiliating sense that you be force to worship a god you know to be false and to give you own pure love to a woman whom you see debased he put he hand to he face and groan aloud you be right he say i would rather have know she dead than know she as she be but there be no reason why i should bear you with all this arthur you be nothing if not considerate and i do not pretend that this be a very pleasant conversation for I but i begin it so i suppose i must endure to see you groan for another woman you say she go on with a sudden flash of passion that you should like to see she dead i say that i should like to kill she for she have strike I a double blow -- she have injure you whom i love and she have beggar I of you affection oh arthur she continue change she voice and throw a caress arm about he neck have you no heart leave to give _ I _ be there no linger spark that _ i _ can cherish and blow to flame i will never treat you so dear learn to love I and i will marry you and make you happy make you forget this faithless woman with the angel face i will -- here she voice break down in sob and in the starlight the great tear glisten upon she coral-tinted face like dew-drop on a pomegranate 's blush rind there there dear i will try to forget do not cry and he touch she on the forehead with he lip she stop and then say with just the faintest tinge of bitterness in she voice : if it have be angelum who cry you would not be so cold you would have kiss away she tear who can say what hide chord of feel those word touch or what memory they awake but they effect upon arthur be striking he spring up upon the deck he eye blaze and he face white with anger how often he say must i forbid you to mention the name of that woman to I do you take a pleasure in torture I curse she may she eat out she empty heart in solitude and find no living thing to comfort she may she suffer as she make I suffer till she life become a hell -- be quiet arthur it be shameful to say such thing he stop and after the sharp ring of he voice that echo like the cry wring from a person in intense pain the loneliness and quiet of the night be very deep and then a answer come to he mad unmanly imprecation for suddenly the air round they be fill with the sound of he own name utter in such wild despair accent as once hear be not likely to be forget accent which seem to be around they and over they and hear in they own brain and yet to come travel from immeasurable distance across the waste of water _ arthur arthur _ the sound that have spring from nothing die away into nothingness again and the moonlight glance and the water heave and give no sign of the place of its birth it have come and go awful untraceable and in the place of its solemnity reign silence absolute they look at each other with scared eye _ as i be a living man that voice be angelum 's _ this be all he say chapter lxvi dr williamson be a rise young practitioner at roxham and what be more a gentleman and a doctor of real ability on the night that lady bellamy take the poison he sit up very late till the dawn in fact work up he book of reference with a view to make himself as much the master as possible of the symptom and most approve treatment in such case of insanity as appear to resemble angelum caresfoot 's he have be call in to see she by mr fraser and have come away intensely interested from a medical point of view and very much puzzle at length he shut up he book with a sigh -- for like most book though full of generality they do not tell he much -- and go to bed before he have be asleep very long however the surgery bell be violently ring and have dress himself with the rapidity characteristic of doctor and schoolboy he descend to find a frightened footman wait outside from whom he gather that something dreadful have happen to lady bellamy who have be find lie apparently dead upon the floor of she drawing-room provide himself with some powerful restorative and a portable electric battery he drive rapidly over to rewtham house here he find the patient lay upon a sofa in the room where she have be find and surround by a mob of terrify and half-dressed servant at first he think life be quite extinct but presently he fancy that he could detect a faint tremor of the heart he apply the most powerful of he restorative and administer a sharp current from the battery and after a considerable time be reward by see the patient open she eye -- but only to shut they again immediately direct he assistant to continue the treatment he try to elicit some information from the servant as to what have happen but all he could gather be that the maid have receive a message not to sit up this make he suspicious of a attempt at suicide and just then he eye fall upon a wineglass that lay upon the floor break at the shank he take it up in the bowl there be still a drop or two of liquid he smell it then dip he finger in and taste it with the result that he tongue be burnt and become rough and numb then he suspicion be confirm presently lady bellamy open she eye again and this time there be intelligence in they she gaze round she with a wonder air next she speak where be i in you own drawing-room lady bellamy be quiet now you will be better presently she try first to move she head then she arm then she lower limb but they would not stir by this time she faculty be wide awake be you the doctor she say yes lady bellamy then tell I why can not i move my arm he lift she hand it fall again like a lump of lead -- and dr williamson look very grave then he apply a current of electricity do you feel that he ask she shake she head why can not i move do not trifle with I tell I quick dr williamson be a young man and have not quite conquered nervousness in he confusion he mutter something about paralysis how be it that i be not dead i have bring you back to life but pray do not talk you fool why could you not let I die you mean that you have bring my mind to life and leave my body dead i feel now that i be quite paralyse he could not answer she what she say be only too true and he look tell she so she gaze steadily at he for a moment as he bent over she and realize all the horror of she position and for the first time in she life she proud spirit absolutely give way for a few seconds she be silent and then without any change come over the expression of she feature -- for the wild gaze with which she have face eternity be for ever freeze there -- she break out into a succession of the most heart-rending shriek that it have ever be he lot to listen to at last she stop exhaust kill I she whisper hoarsely kill I it be a dreadful scene as the doctor afterwards conclude rightly or wrongly a very curious thing have happen to lady bellamy either the poison she have take -- and they be never able to discover what its exact nature be nor would she enlighten they -- have grow less deadly during all the year that she have keep it or she have partially defeat she object by take a overdose or as seem more probable there be some acid in the wine in which it have be mix that have have the strange effect of render it to a certain degree innocuous its result however be as she guess to render she a hopeless paralytic for life at length the patient sink into the coma of exhaustion and dr williamson be able to leave she in the care of a brother practitioner whom he have send for and in that of he assistant sir john have be send for but have not arrive it be then eleven o'clock and at one the doctor be summon as a witness to attend the inquest on george caresfoot he have therefore two hour at he disposal and these he determine to utilise by drive round to see angelum who be still lie at mr fraser 's vicarage mr fraser hear he come and meet he in the little drive he briefly tell he what he have just see and what in he opinion lady bellamy 's fate must be -- one of live death the clergyman 's remark be characteristic and yet he say there be people in the world who say that there be no god how be mr caresfoot ask the doctor she have a dreadful fit of rave this morning and we have to tie she down in bed she be quieter now poor dear there listen at that moment through the open window of the bedroom they hear a sweet though untrained voice begin to sing it be angelum 's and she be sing snatch of a old-fashioned sailor-song one of several which arthur have teach she : fare ye well and adieu to all you spanish lady fare ye well and adieu to ye lady of spain for we have receive order to return to old england but we hope in a short time to see you again \* \* \* we heave we ship to with the wind at sou ` west my boy we heave we ship to for to strike sounding clear it be forty-five fathom and a gray sandy bottom then we fill we main topsail and up channel do steer \* \* \* the signal be make for the grand fleet to anchor all in the downs that night for to meet so cast off you shank-painter let go you cat 's - topper hawl up you clew-garnet let fly tack and sheet without wait to hear any more they go up the stair and enter the bedroom the first person they see be pigott who have be send for to nurse angelum standing by the side of the bed and a trained nurse at a little table at the foot mix some medicine on the bed itself lay angelum shear of all she beautiful hair she face flush as with fever except where a blue weal bear witness to the blow from she husband 's cruel whip she head throw back and a strange light in she wild eye she be tie down in the bed with a broad horse-girth stretch across she breast but she have wrench one arm free and with it be beat time to she song on the bed-clothes she catch sight of mr fraser at once and seem to recognize he for she stop she singing and laugh that be a pretty old song be not it she say somebody teach it I -- who be it somebody -- a long while ago but i know another -- i know another you 'll like it you be a clergyman you know and she begin again : say the parson one day as i cursed a jew now do you not know that that be a sin of you sailor i fear there be but a few that st peter to heaven will ever let in say i mr parson to tell you my mind few sailor to knock be ever yet see those who travel by land may steer against wind but we shape a course for fiddler 's green suddenly she stop and she mind wander off to the scene of two day previous with arthur by the lake and she begin to quote the word wring from the bitterness of he heart ` you miserable woman do you know what you be shame upon you be you not marry yesterday ' it be quite true arthur -- oh yes quite true say what you like of I arthur -- i deserve it all but oh arthur i love you so do not be hard upon I -- i love you so dear kill I if you like dear but do not talk to I so i shall go mad -- i shall go mad and she break into a flood of weep poor dear she have be go on like that off and on all night it clean break my heart to see it and that be the holy truth and pigott look very much as though she be go to cry herself by this time angelum have cease weep and be brooding sullenly with she face bury in the pillow there be absolutely nothing to be do say the doctor we can only trust to she fine constitution and youth to pull she through she have receive a series of dreadful mental shock and it be very doubtful if she will ever get over they it be a pity to think that such a splendid creature may become permanently insane be it not you must be very careful pigott that she do not do herself a injury she be just in the state that she may throw herself out of the window or cut she throat and now i must be go i will call in again to-night mr fraser accompany he down to the gate where he have leave he trap before they get out of the front door angelum have rouse herself again and they could hear she beginning to quote homer and then break out into snatch of she sailor-song ` high aloft amongst the rig sing the loud exult gale ' that be like I i sing too and then follow peal upon peal of mad laughter a very sad case she have a poor chance i fear mr fraser be too much affect to answer he chapter lxvii public feeling in marlshire be much excite about the caresfoot tragedy and when it become know that lady bellamy have attempt to commit suicide the excitement be treble it be not often that the dullest and most highly respectable part of a eminently dull and respectable county get such a chance of cheerful and interesting conversation as these two event give rise to we may be sure that the godsend be duly appreciate indeed the whole story be up to this hour a favorite subject of conversation in those part of course the member of the polite society of the neighborhood of roxham be divide into two camp the man all think that angelum have be shamefully treat the elder and most intensely respectable lady for the most part incline to the other side of the question it not be they habit to look at matter from the same point of view in which they present themselves to a man 's nicer sense of honor they could see no great harm in george caresfoot 's stratagem a man so rich they argue be perfectly entitle to buy he wife the marriage have be arrange like they own on the soundest property basis and the woman who rise in rebellion against a husband merely because she love another man or some such romantic nonsense deserve all she get go mad have she -- well it be a warning and these aristocratic matron sniff and turn up they nose they feel that angelum by go mad and create a public excitement have enter a mute protest against the recognize rule of marriage sale - and-barter as practice in this country -- and zululand have daughter to dispose of they resent this and poor angelum be for year afterwards speak of among they as that immoral girl but the lower and more human stratum of society do not sympathize with this feeling on the contrary they be all for angelum and the dog aleck who be suppose to have chock that carroty warmint george the inquest on george 's body be hold at roxham and be the object of the greatest possible interest indeed the public excitement be so great that the coroner be perhaps insensibly influence by it and allow the inquiry to travel a little beyond its profess object of ascertain the actual cause of death with the result that many of the detail of the wicked plot from which angelum have be the principal sufferer become public property needless to say that they do not soothe the feeling of a excited crowd when philip after spend one of the worst half-hour of he life in the witness-box at length escape with such shred of reputation as he have hitherto possess altogether tear off he back he greet from the mob outside the court may fairly be describe as a warm one as the witness ' door close behind he he find himself at one end of a long lane that be hedge on both side by face not without a touch of ferocity about they and with difficulty keep clear by the available force of the five roxham policeman who sell he daughter shout a great fellow in he ear let I come there be a dear man and have a look at juda say a skinny little woman with a squint to a individual who block she view the crowd catch at the word juda it shout go and hang yourself judas juda how philip get out of that he never quite know but he do get out somehow meanwhile sir john bellamy be be examine in court and notwithstanding the almost aggressive innocence of he appearance he be not have a very good time it chance that he have fall into the hand of a rival lawyer who hate he like poison and have good reason to hate he it be wonderful by the way how enemy do spring up round a man in trouble like dog who bite a wounded companion to death and on the same principle he be defenceless this gentleman would insist on conduct the witness ' examination on the basis that he know all about the fraud practice with reference to the suppose death of arthur heigham now it will be remember that sir john in he last interview with lady bellamy have declare that there be no tittle of evidence against he and that it would be impossible to implicate he in the exposure that must overtake she to a certain extent he be right but on one point he have overshoot himself for at that very inquest mr fraser state on oath that he -lrb- mr fraser -rrb- have speak of arthur heigham 's death in the presence of sir john bellamy and have not be contradict in vain do sir john protest that mr fraser must be mistaken both the jury and the public look at the probability of the matter and though he protestation be accept in silence when he leave the witness-box there be not a man in court but be morally certain that he have be privy to the plot and so far as reputation be concern he be a ruin man and yet legally there be not a jot of evidence against he but public opinion require that a scapegoat should be find and it be now he lot to figure as that unlucky animal by the time he reach the exit into the street the impression that he have have a hand in the business have in some mysterious way communicate itself to the mob outside many a member of which have some old grudge to settle with lawyer bellamy if only chance put a opportunity in they way as he step through the door utterly ignorant of the greet which await he he ear be assail by a awful yell follow by a storm of hoot and hiss sir john turn pale and look for a means of escape but the policeman who have let he out have lock the door behind he and all round he be the angry mob here come the -- that start the swim roar a voice as soon as there be a momentary lull gentleman -- pipe sir john with all the pippin hue go from he cheek and rub he white hand together nervously yah he poison he own poor wife shout a woman with a baby lady -- go on sir john in agonized tone pelt he yell a sweet little boy of ten or so suit the action to the word and plant a rotten egg full upon sir john 's impose brow no no say the woman who have nickname philip juda why do not you drop he in the pond there be only two foot of water and it be soft fall on the mud you can pelt he _ afterwards _ the idea be receive with acclamation and notwithstanding he own effort to the contrary back as they be by those of the five policeman before he know where he be sir john find himself be hustle by a lot of sturdy fellow towards the filthy duck-pond like a aristocrat to the guillotine they soon arrive and then follow the most painful experience of all he life one of which the very think would ever afterwards move he most profoundly two strong man utterly heedless of he yell and lamentation take he by the heel and two yet stronger than they catch he by he plump and tender wrist and then under the direction of the woman with the squint they begin to swing he from side to side as soon as the lady directress consider that the impetus be sufficient she say now and away he go like a swallow only to land when he fly power be exhaust plump in the middle of the duck-pond some ten seconds afterwards a pillar of slimy mud arise and stagger towards the bank where a crowd of little boy each holding something offensive in he right hand be eagerly await its arrival the squint-eyed woman contemplate the figure with the most intense satisfaction he sell I up once she murmur but we be quit now that be it lad let he have it but we will drop a veil over this too painful scene sir john bellamy be unwell for some day afterwards when he recover he shake the dust of roxham off he shoe for ever chapter lxviii a fortnight or so afterwards when the public excitement occasion by the caresfoot tragedy have be partially eclipse by a particularly thrilling child-murder and suicide a change for the better take place in angelum 's condition one night after a unusually violent fit of rave she suddenly go to sleep about twelve o'clock and sleep all that night and all the next day about half-past nine on the follow evening the watcher in she room -- namely pigott mr fraser and dr williamson who be try to make out what this deep sleep mean -- be suddenly astonish at see she sit up in she bed in a listen attitude as though she could hear something that interested she intensely for the webbing that tie she down have be temporarily remove and then cry in a tone of the most living anguish and yet with a world of passionate remonstrance in she voice _ arthur arthur _ then she sink down again for a few minute it be the same night that mildr and arthur sit together on the deck of the _ evening star _ presently she open she eye and the doctor see that there be no longer any madness in they only great trouble she glance first fall upon pigott run she say run and stop he he can not have go far bring he back to I quick or he will be go who do you mean dear arthur of course -- arthur hush angelum say mr fraser he have be go a long time you have be very ill she do not say anything but turn she face to the pillow and weep apparently as much from exhaustion as from any other cause and then drop off to sleep again she reason be save say dr williamson as soon as they be outside the door thanks be to providence and you doctor thanks to providence alone it be a case in which i could do little or nothing it be a most merciful deliverance all that you have to do now be to keep she perfectly quiet and above all do not let she father come near she at present i will call in and tell he lady bellamy oh about the same she be a strange woman she never complain and rarely speak -- though twice i have hear she break out shockingly there will never be any alternation in she case till the last alteration good-bye i will look round to-morrow after this angelum 's recovery be comparatively speak rapid though of course the effect of so severe a shock to the nervous system could not be shake off in a day though she be no longer mad she be still in a disturbed state of mind and subject to strange dream or vision one in particular that visit she several night in a succession make a great impression upon she first it would seem to she that she be wide awake in the middle of the night and there would creep over she a sense of unmeasured space infinite silence and intense solitude she would think that she be stand on a dais at the end of a vast hall down which run endless row of pillar support a inky sky which be the roof there be no light in the hall yet she could clearly see there be no sound but she could hear the silence only a soft radiance shone from she eye and brow she be not afraid though lonely but she feel that something would presently come to make a end of solitude and so she stand for many year or age -- she could not tell which -- try to fathom the mystery of that great place and watch the light that stream from she forehead strike upon the marble floor and pillar or thread the darkness like a shooting star only to reveal new depths of blackness beyond those it pierce at length there come softly fall from the sky-roof which never stir to any pass breeze a flake of snow larger than a dive 's wing but it be blood-red and in its center shine a wonderful light that make its passage through the darkness a track of glory as it pass gently downwards without sound she think that it throw the shadow of a human face it light upon the marble floor and the red snow melt there and turn to blood but the light that have be its heart shone on pure and steady look up again she see that the vault above she be thick with thousand upon thousand of these flake each glowing like a crimson lamp and each throw its own shadow one of the shadow be like george and she shudder as it pass and ever as they touch the marble pavement the flake melt and become blood and some of the light go out but the most part burnt on till at length there be no longer any floor but a dead-sea of blood on which float a myriad point of fire and then it all grow clear to she for a voice in she mind speak and say that this be one of god 's storehouse for human soul that the light be the soul and the red in the snow which turn to blood be the sin which have during its earthly passage stain its first purity the sea of blood before she be the sum of the scarlet wickedness of she age from every soul there come some to swell its awful water at length the red snow cease to fall and a sound that be not a voice but yet speak peal through the silence ask if all be ready the voice that have speak in she mind answer no he have not come who be to see then look upward she see mile on mile away a bright be with half-shut wing flash fast towards she and she know that it be arthur and the loneliness leave she he light a breathing radiance by she side and again the great sound pealed let in the living water and cleanse away the sin of this generation it echo and die away and there follow a tumult like the flow of a angry sea a mighty wind sweep past she and after it a ocean of molten crystal come rush through the illimitable hall the sea and the wind purge away the blood and put out the lamp leave behind they a glow of light like that upon she brow and where the lamp have be stand myriad of seraphic being whilst from ten thousand tongue run forth a paean of celestial song then everything vanish and deep gloom that be not however dark to she settled round they take arthur by the hand she spread she white wing and circle upward far far they sail till they reach a giant peak that split space in twain here they alight and watch the mass of cloud tear through the gulf on either side of they and look beyond and below gaze upon the shine world that people space beneath they from the cloud-drift to the right and leave come a noise as of the soughing of many wing but they do not know what cause it till presently the vapor lift and they see that alongside of and beneath they two separate stream of soul be pass on outstretched pinion : one stream that to they left proceeding to they earthly home and one that to the right return from they those who go wear grief upon they shadowy face and have sad - color wing but those who return seem for the most part happy and they wing be tip with splendor the never-ending stream that come flow from a far-off glory and that which return have pass the divide cliff on which they stand be change into a multitude of the red snow-flake with the glowing heart and drop gently downwards so they stand in happy peace never tire from millennium to millennium they watch new world collect out of chaos they see they speed upon they high aerial course till grow hoary they foundation-rock crumble with age they waste away into the vastness whence they have gather to be replace by fresh creation that in they turn take form teem with life wax wane and vanish at length there come a end and the soughing of wing be silent for ever no more soul go downward and none come up from the earth then the distant glory from which the soul have come move towards they with awful muttering and robe in lightning and space be fill with spirit one of whom sweeping past they cry with a loud voice child time be dead now be the beginning of knowledge and she turn to arthur who have grow more radiant than the star which gleam upon he forehead and kiss he then she would wake time pass on and gradually health and strength come back to angelum till at last she be as powerful in mind and -- if that be possible -- except that she be shear of she lovely hair more beautiful in body than she have be before she trouble overwhelm she of arthur she think a great deal -- indeed she think of little else but it be with a sort of hopelessness that preclude action nobody have mention he name to she as it be think wiser not to do so though pigott and mr fraser have in as gentle term as they could command tell she of the detail of the plot against she and of the consequence to the principal actor in it nor have she speak of he it seem to she that she have lose he for good that he could never come back to she after she have pass that he must hate she too much she suppose that in act as he do he be aware of all the circumstance of she marriage and could find no excuse for she she do not even know where he be and in she ignorance of the use of private detective and advertisement have no idea how to find out and so she suffer in silence and only see he in she dream she still stop at the vicarage with pigott nor have there as yet be any talk of she return to the abbey house indeed she have not see she father since the day of she marriage but now that she have recover she feel that something must be do about it wonder what it should be she one afternoon walk to the churchyard where she have not be since she illness and once there make she way naturally to she mother 's grave she be move very quietly and have almost reach the tree under which hilda caresfoot lay when she become aware that there be already somebody kneel by the grave with he head rest against the marble cross it be she father she shadow fall upon he he turn and see she and they stand look at each other she be shock at the dreadful alteration in he face it be now that of a old man nearly wear out with suffer he put he hand before he eye and say angelum how can i face you least of all here for a moment the memory of she bitter wrong swell in she heart for she now to a great extent understand what she father 's part in the plot have be and she regard he in silence father she say presently i have be in the hand of god and not in yours and though you have help to ruin my life and have very nearly drive I into a madhouse i can still say let the past be the past but why do you look so wretched you should look happy you have get the land -- my price you know and she laugh a little bitterly why do i look wretched because i be give over to a curse that you can not understand and i be not alone where be those who plot against you george dead bellamy go lady bellamy paralyse hand and foot and myself -- although i do not plot i only let they be -- accursed but if you can forget the past why do you not come back to my house of course i can not force you you be free and rich and can suit yourself i will come for a time if you wish -- if i can bring pigott with I you may bring twenty pigott for all i care -- so long as you will pay for they board he add with a touch of he old miserliness but what do you mean ` for a time ' i do not think i shall stop here long i think that i be go into a sisterhood oh well you be you own mistress and must do as you choose then i will come to-morrow and they part chapter lxix and so on the follow day angelum and pigott return to the abbey house but they both feel that it be a sad home-coming indeed if there have be no other cause for melancholy the sight of philip 's face be enough to excite it in the most happy-minded person not that angelum see much of he however for they still keep to they old habit of not live together all day she father be shut up in he room transact business that have reference to the accession of he property and the settlement of george 's affair for he cousin have die intestate so he take he personalty and wind up the estate as heir-at-law at night however he would go out and walk for mile and in all weather -- he seem to dread spending the dark hour at home when angelum have be back about a month in the old place she accidentally get a curious insight into she father 's mental suffering it so happen that one night find it impossible to sleep and be much oppress by sorrowful thought she think that she would read the hour away but the particular book she want to find be downstairs and it be two o'clock in the morning and chilly in the passage however anything be better than sleeplessness and the tyranny of sad thought and empty longing so throw on she dressing-gown she take a candle and set off think as she go how she have in the same guise flee before she husband she get she book and be return when she see that there be still a light in she father 's study and that the door be ajar at that moment it so happen that a unusually sharp draught come down one of the passage of the rambling old house catch she candle and extinguish it make she way to the study-door she push it open to see if anybody be there previous to ask for a light at first she could see nobody on the table which be cover with papers there stand two candle a brandy-bottle and a glass she be just move to the candle to get a light when she eye fall on what she at first believe to be a heap of clothes huddle together on the floor in the corner of the room further examination show that it be a man -- she could distinctly see the back of he hand she first idea be that she have surprise a thief and she stop feel frightened and not know what to do just then the bundle straighten itself a little and drop its hand reveal to she wonder gaze she own father 's face which wear the same awful look of abject fear which she have see upon it when he pass through the hall beneath she just before isleworth break into flame on the night of she marriage the eye appear to be start from the socket in a effort to clearly realize a undefinable horror the hair now daily grow greyer be partially erect and the pallid lip half - open as though to speak word that would not come he see she too but do not seem surprised at she presence cover up he eye again with one hand he shrink further back into he corner and with the other pointed to a large leather arm-chair in which pigott have tell she she grandfather have die look there he whisper hoarsely where father i see nothing there girl in the chair -- look how it glare at I angela stand aghast she be alarm in defiance of she own reason and begin to catch the contagion of superstition this be dreadful she say for heaven 's sake tell I what be the matter philip 's ghastly gaze again fix itself on the chair and he tooth begin to chatter _ great god _ he say _ it be come _ and utter a smother cry he fall on he face in a half faint the necessity for action bring angelum to herself seize the water-bottle she splash some water into she father 's face he come to himself almost instantly where be i he say ah i remember i have not be quite well you must not think anything of that what be you do down here at this time of night pass I that bottle and he take nearly half a tumbler of raw brandy there i be quite right again now i have a bad attack of indigestion that be all good night angelum go without a word she understand now what she father have mean when he say that he be accursed but she could not help wonder whether the brandy have anything to do with he indigestion on the follow day the doctor come to see she it strike angelum that he come oftener than be necessary the fact be that he would gladly have attend she grati all year round a doctor do not often get the chance of visit such a patient you do not look quite so well to-day he say no she answer with a little smile i have bad dream last night ah i think so you should try to avoid that sort of thing you be far too imaginative already one can not run away from one 's dream murder will out in sleep well i have a message for you who from lady bellamy you know that she be paralyse yes well she want you to go and see she shall you go angelum think a little and answer yes i think so you must be prepare for some bitter language if she speak at all very likely she will beg you to get she some poison to kill herself with i have be oblige to take the greatest precaution to prevent she from obtain any i be not very sensitive but once or twice she have positively make I shiver with the thing she say she can never say anything more dreadful to I than she have say already dr williamson perhaps not go if you like if you be revengeful -- which i be sure you be not -- you would have good reason to be satisfy at what you will see medically speak it be a sad case accordingly that every afternoon angelum accompany by pigott start off for rewtham house where lady bellamy still live or rather exist it be she first outing since the inquest on george caresfoot have cause she and she history to become publicly notorious and as she walk along she be surprise to find that she be the object of popular sympathy every man she meet touch or take off he hat accord to he degree and as soon as she have pass turn round and stare at she some fine folk whom she do not know -- indeed she know no one though it have be the fashion to send and inquire during she illness -- drive past in a open carriage and pair and she see a gentleman on the front seat whisper something to the lady bring round they head towards she as simultaneously as though they both work on a single wire even the child come out of the village school set up a cheer as she pass good gracious pigott what be it all about she ask at last well you see miss they talk of you in the papers as the ` abbey house heroine ' -- and heroine be rare in these part overwhelm with so much attention angelum be thankful when at last they reach rewtham house pigott go into the housekeeper 's room and angelum be at once show up into the drawing-room the servant announce she name to a black - robed figure lie on a sofa and close the door come here angelum caresfoot say a well-known voice and see how fate have repay the woman who try to ruin you she advance and look at the deathly face still as darkly beautiful as ever on which be fix that strange look of wild expectancy that it have wear when its owner take the poison yes look at I think what i be and then what i be and learn how the spirit of evil pay those who serve he i think to kill myself but death be deny I and now i live as you see I i be a outcast from the society of my kind -- not that i ever care for that except to rule it i can not stir hand or foot i can not write i can scarcely read i can not even die my only resource be the bitter sea of thought that seethe eternally in this stricken frame like fire pent in the womb of a volcano yes angela caresfoot and like the fire too sometimes it overflow and then i can blaspheme and rave aloud till my voice fail that be the only power which be leave to I angela utter a exclamation of pity pity -- do not pity I i will not be pity by you mock I if you will it be you turn now you prophesy that it would come now it be here at any rate you be still comfortable in you own house say angelum nervously anxious to change the subject and not know what to say oh yes i have money enough if that be what you mean my husband threaten to leave I destitute but fear of public opinion -- and i hear that he have run away and be not well think of now -- or perhaps of myself cripple as i be cause he to change he mind but do not let we talk of that poor creature i send for you here for a purpose where be you lover angelum turn pale and tremble what do you not know or be you tire of he tire of he i shall never be tire of he but he have go shall i tell you where to find he you would not if you could you would deceive I again no oddly enough i shall not i have no longer any object in do so when i be bent upon marry you to george caresfoot i lash myself into hate you now i hate you no longer i respect you -- indeed i have do so all along then why do you work I such a bitter wrong because i be force to believe I or not as you will i be not go to tell you the story -- at any rate not now i can only repeat that i be force to where be arthur in madeira do you remember once tell I that you have only to lift you hand -- so -- ah i forget i can not lift mine -- to draw he back to you that no other woman in the world could keep he from you if you choose to bid he come yes i remember then if you wish to get he back you have better exercise you power for he have go to another woman who be she what be she like she be a young widow -- a mr carr she be desperately in love with he -- very beautiful and very rich beautiful how do you mean tell I exactly what she be like she have brown eye brown hair a lovely complexion and a perfect figure angelum glance rapidly at she own reflection in the glass and sigh then i fear that i shall have no chance against she -- none you be a fool if you be alone in the same room with she nobody would see she for look at you angela sigh again this time from relief but there be worse than that very possibly he have marry she ah then it be all over why if he love you as much as you think you can bring he back to you married or unmarried perhaps yes i think i could but i would not why if he love you and you love he you have a right to he among all the sham and fiction that we call law there be only one true -- the law of nature by virtue of which you belong to each other no there be a higher law -- the law of duty by means of which we try to curb the impulse of nature the woman who have win he have a right to consideration then to gratify a foolish prejudice you be prepare to lose he forever no lady bellamy if i think that i be to lose he for ever i might be tempt to do what be wrong in order to be with he for a time but i do not think that i only lose he for a time that i may gain he for ever in this world he be separate from I in the world to come my rights will assert themselves and we shall be together and never part any more lady bellamy look at she wonderingly for she eye could still express she emotion you be a fine creature she say and if you believe that perhaps it will be true for you since faith must be the measure of realization but after all he may not have marry she that will be for you to find out how can i find out by write to he of course -- to the care of mr carr madeira that be sure to find he thank you how can i thank you enough it seem to I that you owe I few thanks you be always foolish about what tend to secure you own happiness or you would have think of this before there be a pause and then angelum rise to go be you go yes go i be not fit company for such as you perhaps we shall not meet again but in thinking of all the injury that i have do you remember that my punishment be proportionate to my sin they tell I that i may live for year angelum gaze at the splendid wreck beneath she and a infinite pity swell in she gentle heart stoop she kiss she on the forehead a wild astonishment fill lady bellamy 's great dark eye child child what be you do you do not know what i be or you would not kiss I yes lady bellamy she say quietly i do that be i know what you have be but i want to forget that perhaps you will one day be able to forget it too i do not wish to preach but perhaps after all this terrible misfortune may lead you to something better thank god there be forgiveness for we all she word touch some forget chord in the stricken woman 's heart and two big tear roll down the frozen cheek they be the first anne bellamy have weep for many a day you voice she say have a music that awake the echo from a time when i be good and pure like you but that time have go for ever surely lady bellamy the heart that can remember it can also strive to reach another like it if you have descend the cliff whence those echo spring into a valley however deep there be still another cliff before you that you may climb it be easy to descend but we need wing to climb look at I angela my body be not more cripple and shear of power than my dark spirit be of wing how can _ i _ climb angelum bent low beside she and whisper a few word in she ear then rise with a shy blush upon she face lady bellamy shut she eye presently she open they again do not speak any more of this to I now she say i must have time the instinct of year can not be brush away in a day if you know all the sin i have commit perhaps you would think too that for such as i be there be no forgiveness and no hope whilst there be life there be hope and as i once hear mr fraser say the real key to forgiveness be the desire to be forgive again lady bellamy shut she eye and thought and when she draw up they heavy lid angelum see that there be something of a peaceful look about they stand so she say to angelum there where the light fall upon you face that will do now shall i tell you what i read there on you forehead sit resolute power to grasp and almost measureless capacity to imagine in you eye there be a sympathy not to be guess by being of a coarser fiber those eye could look at heaven and not be dazzle you whole face speak of a purity and single-mindedness which i can read but can not understand you mind reject the glitter bubble that man follow and seek the solid truth you spirit be in tune with thing of light and air it can float to the extremest height of we mental atmosphere and thence can almost gaze into the infinite beyond pure but not cold thirst for a wider knowledge and at time breathe the air of a higher world resolute but patient proud and yet humble to learn holy but aspiring conscious of gift you do not know how to use girl you rise as near to what be divine as a mortal may i have always think so now i be sure of it lady bellamy hush i have a reason for what i say i do not ask you to waste time by listen to senseless panegyric listen : i will tell you what i have never tell to a living soul before for year i have be a student of a lore almost forget in this country -- a lore which once fully acquire will put the power that lie hide in nature at the command of its possessor that will even enable he to look beyond nature and perhaps so far as the duration of existence be concern for awhile to triumph over it that lore you can learn though it baffle I my intellect and determination enable I to find the cue to it and to stumble on some of its secret but i could not follow they too late i learn that only the good and pure can do that much of the result of year of toil i destroy the other night but i still know enough to empower you to reconstruct what i annihilated you can learn more in one year than i learn in ten i be grateful to you and if you wish it i will show you the way angelum listen open-eyed lady bellamy be right she be greedy of knowledge and the power that spring from knowledge but would it not be wrong she say there can be nothing wrong in what the ruling wisdom allow we to acquire without the help of what be evil but do not be deceive such knowledge and power as this be not a thing to be trifle with to obtain a mastery over it you must devote you life to it you must give it ` allegiance whole not strain to suit desire ' no earthly passion must come to trouble the fix serenity of you aspiration that be one but only one of the reason of my failure you must leave you arthur to mr carr and henceforward put he as much out of you mind as possible and this that you may be able to separate yourself from earthly bond and hope and fear trouble water reflect a broken image i must then choose between this knowledge and my love yes and you will do well if you choose the knowledge for before you die -- if indeed you do not in the end for a certain period overcome even death -- you will be more of a angel than a woman on the one hand then this proud and dizzy destiny await you on the other every-day joy and sorrow share by all the world and a ordinary attachment to a man against whom i have indeed nothing to say but who be not you equal and who be at the best full of weakness that you should despise but lady bellamy he weakness be a part of himself and i love he all just as he be weakness need love more than what be strong perhaps but in return for you love i offer you no empty cup i do not ask you to follow fantastic theory -- of that i will soon convince you shall i show you the semblance of you arthur and mr carr as they be at this moment no lady bellamy no i have choose you offer after year of devotion to make I _ almost like a angel _ the temptation be very great and it fascinate I but i hope if i can succeed in live a good life to become altogether a angel when i die why then should i attempt to filch fragment of a knowledge that will one day be all my own -- if indeed it be right to do so whilst i be here arthur 's love be more to I than such knowledge can ever be if he be marry i may learn to think differently and try to soothe my mind by force it to run in these hide groove till then i choose arthur and my petty hope and fear for after all they be the natural heritage of my humanity lady bellamy think for awhile and answer i begin to think that the great power who make we have mix even he most perfect work with a element of weakness lest they should soar too high and see too far the prick of a pin will bring a balloon to earth and a earthly passion angelum will prevent you from soar to the cloud so be it you have have you chance it be only one more disappointment chapter lxx angelum go home very thoughtful the next three day she spend in write first she write a clear and methodical account of all the event that have happen since arthur 's first departure more than a year ago and attach to it copy of the various document that have pass between herself and george include one of the undertaking that she husband have sign before the marriage this account be in the form of a statement which she sign and take it to mr fraser read it to he and get he to sign it too it take she two whole day to write and when it be do she label it to be read first on the third day she write the following letter to go with the statement : for the first time in my life arthur i take up my pen to write to you and in truth the difficulty of the task before I as well as my own want of skill tend to bewilder I and though i have much upon my mind to say i scarcely know if it will reach you -- if indeed this letter be ever destine to lie open in you hand -- in a intelligible form the statement that i enclose however will -- in case you do not already know they -- tell you all the detail of what have happen since you leave I more than a year ago from it you will learn how cruelly i be deceive into marry george caresfoot believe you dead oh through all eternity never shall i forget that fearful night nor cease to thank god for my merciful escape from the fiend whom i have marry and then come the morning and bring you -- the dead -- alive before my eye and whilst i stand in the first tumult of my amaze -- forgetful of everything but that it be you my own my beloved arthur no spirit but you in flesh and blood -- whilst i yet stand thus stricken to silence by the shock of a unutterable joy -- you break upon I with those dreadful word so that i choke feeling how just they must seem to you and could not answer and yet it sometimes fill I with wonder and indignation to think of they wonder that you could believe I so mad as to throw away the love of my life and indignation that you could deem I so lose as to dishonor it they drive I mad those word and from that moment forward i remember nothing but a chaos of the mind heave endlessly like the sea but all this have pass and i be thankful to say that i be quite well again now still i should not have write to you arthur i do not even know where you be and i never think of recover you after what have pass i look upon you as altogether lose to I for this world but a few day ago i go at she own request to see lady bellamy all she say to I i will not now repeat lest i should render this letter too wearisome to read though a great deal of it be strange enough to be well worth repetition in the upshot however she say that i have better write to you and tell I where to write and so i write to you dear there be also another thing that she tell I of sad import for myself but which i must not shrink to face she say that there live at madeira where you be a lady who be in love with you and be herself both beautiful and wealthy to whom you would have go for comfort in you trouble and in all probability have marry now arthur i do not know if this be the case but if so i hasten to say that i do not blame you you smart under what must have seem to you a intolerable wrong and you go for consolation to she who have it to offer in a man that be perhaps natural though it be not a woman 's way if it be so i say from my heart be as happy as you can but remember what i tell you long ago and do not fall into any delusion on the matter do not imagine because circumstance have shape themselves thus therefore i be to be put out of you mind and forget for this be not so i can not be forget though for a while i may be justly discard it be possible that for this world you have pass out of my reach but in the next i shall claim you as my own yes arthur i have make up my mind to lose you for this life as a fitting reward for my folly but do not think that i do so without a pang for believe I since my mind emerge stronger and clearer from the storm through which it have pass bring back to I the full life and strength of my womanhood i have long for you with a ever - increase longing i be not ashamed to own that i would give world to feel you arm about I and you kiss upon my lip why should i be be i not yours body and soul but dear it have be give to I perhaps as a compensation for all i have undergo and that be still leave for I to undergo to grasp a more enduring end than that of earthly ecstasy : for i can look forward with a confident assurance to the day when we shall embrace upon the threshold of the infinite do not call this foolish imagination or call it imagination if you will -- for what be imagination be it not the connect link between we and we soul and recall memory of we home imagination what would we higher life be without it it be what the mind be to the body it be the soul 's _ think _ so in my imagination -- since i know no better term -- i foresee that heavenly hour and i be not jealous for the earthly moment nor indeed have i altogether lose you for at time in the stillness of the night when the earthly part be plunge in sleep and my spirit be release from the thraldom of the sens it at indefinite period have the power to summon you beloved form to its presence and in this communion nature vindicate she faithfulness thus through the long night rest come upon I with you presence and at last there will come a greater rest at last -- have live misunderstand -- we shall die alone and then the real life or life will begin it be not always night for the dawn be set beyond the night and through the gate of dawn we shall journey to the day it be not always night even in the womb of darkness throb the promise of the morning i often wonder arthur how and what this change will be shall we be even as we be but still through unnumbered age grow slowly on to the divine or cast off the very semblance of mortality shall we rise at one wide sweep to the pinnacle of fulfil time there to learn the purpose and mark the measure of all be how can i know but this i believe that whatever the change however wide and deep the darkness which stretch between what be and what be not yet we can not lose ourselves therein identity will still be ours and memory the janus-headed will still pursue we call to we mind the enact evil and that good which have be must always be for we be immortal and though we put off the mortal dress -- yes though we form become as variable as the cloud and assume proportion of which we can not dream -- yet shall memory companion we and identity remain for we be each fashion apart for ever and build about with such a iron wall of individual life that all the force of time and change can not so much as shake it and while i be myself and yet in any shape endure of this be certain -- the love that be a part of I will endure also oh herein be set my hope -- nay not my hope for hope upon the tongue whisper doubt within the heart but the most fixed unchanging star of all my heaven it be not always night for the dawn be set beyond the night and oh my heart 's beloved at daybreak we shall meet again oh arthur even now i long for the purer air and flash sympathy of that vast hereafter when the strong sense of knowledge shall scarcely find a limit ere it overleap it when visible power shall radiate from we be and live on together through countless existence period and sphere we shall progress from majesty to ever-growing majesty oh for the day when you and i messenger from the seat of power shall sail high above these darkling world and see into each other 's soul shall learn what love 's communion be do not think I foolish dear for write to you thus i do not wish to make you the victim of a outburst of thought that you may think hysterical but perhaps i may never be able to write to you again in this way you wife if you be marry may be jealous or other thing may occur to prevent it i feel it therefore necessary to tell you my inmost thought now whilst i can so that you may always remember they during the long come year and especially when you draw near to the end of the journey i hope dearest arthur that nothing will ever make you forget they and also that for the sake of the pure love you will for ever bear I you will always live up to you noblest and you best for in this way we meeting will be make more perfect of course it be possible that you may still be free and after you know that i be not quite so much to blame as you may have think still willing to give you name to I it be a bless hope but i scarcely dare to dwell upon it the other day i be read a book mr fraser lend I which take my fancy very much it be so full of contradiction the unexpected always happen in it and there be both grief and laughter in its page it do not end quite well or quite badly or rather it have _ no _ end and deep down underneath the plotless story only peep up now and again when the actor be trouble there run a vein of real sorrow and sad unchanging love there be a hero in this odd book which be so like life -- who by the way be no hero at all but a curious restless creature who seem to have miss he mark in life and go along look for old truth and new idea with he eye so fix upon the star that he be always stumble over the pebble in he path and think that they be rock he be a sensitive man too and as weak as he be sensitive and often fall into pitfall and do what he should not and yet for all that he have a quaint and gentle mind and there be something to like in he -- at least so think the woman in that book there be a heroine too who be all that a heroine should be very sweet and very beautiful and she really have a heart only she would not let it beat and of course the hero and heroine love each other : of course too they both behave badly and thing go wrong or there would have be no book but i tell you this story because once in a rather touching scene this hero who make such a mess of thing set forth one of the idea that he have find and think new but which be really so very old he tell the heroine that he have read in the star that happiness have only one key and that its name be ` love ' that amidst all the mutability and disillusion of we life the pure love of a man and woman alone stand firm and beautiful alone defy change and disappointment that it be the heaven-sent salve for all we trouble the remedy for we mistake the magic glass reflect only what be true and good but in the end she fact overcome he theory and he might have spare himself the trouble of tell and for all he star-gazing this hero have no real philosophy but in he grief and unresting pain go and throw himself into the biggest pitfall that he could find and would have perish there have not a good angel come and drag he out again and brush the mud off he clothes and take he by the hand lead he along a safer path and so for awhile he drop out of the story which say that when he be not think of the lose heroine he be perhaps happier than he deserve to be now arthur i think that this foolish hero be right and the sensible heroine he worship so blindly wrong if you be still unmarried and still care to put he theory to the test i believe that we also can make as beautiful a thing of we life as he think that he and he heroine could and ourselves supremely happy in each other 's perfect love may perhaps be able to add to the happiness of some of we fellow-traveller that be i think as noble a end as a a man and woman can set before themselves but if on the other hand you be tie to this other woman who love you by tie that can not be break or that honor will not let you break or if you be unforgiving and no longer wish to marry I as i wish to marry you then till that bright hour of immortal hope -- farewell yes arthur farewell till the gate of time have close for we -- till in the presence of god we father i shall for ever call you mine alas i be so weak that my tear fall as i write the word perhaps i may never speak or write to you again so once more my dearest my beloved my earthly treasure and my heavenly hope farewell may the blessing of god be as constantly around you as my thought and may he teach you that these be not foolish word but rather the faint shadow of a undying light i send back the ring that be use to trick I with perhaps whatever happen you will wear it for my sake it be you know a symbol of eternity angelum caresfoot chapter lxxi just as angelum be engage in finish she long letter to arthur -- surely one of the strangest ever write by a girl to the man she love -- mr fraser be read a epistle which have reach he by that afternoon 's post we will look over he shoulder and see what be in it it be a letter date from the vicarage of one of the poorest parish in the great dock district in the east of london it begin -- dear sir i shall be only too thankful to entertain you proposal for a exchange of living more especially as at first sight it would seem that all the advantage be on my side the fact be that the incessant strain of work here have at last break down my health to such a degree that the doctor tell I plainly i must choose between the comparative rest of a country parish or the certainty of pass to a completer quiet before my time also now that my child be grow up i be very anxious to remove they from the sight and sound and taint moral atmosphere of this poverty - stricken and degraded quarter but however that may be i should not be do my duty to you if i do not warn you that this be no parish for a man of you age to undertake unless for strong reason -lrb- for i see by the clergy list that you be a year or so older than myself -rrb- the work be positively ceaseless and often of a most shocking and thankless character and there be almost no respectable inhabitant for nobody life in the parish except those who be too poor to live elsewhere the stipend too be as you be aware not large however if in face of these disadvantage you still entertain the idea of a exchange perhaps we have better meet the letter then enter into detail i think that will suit I very well say mr fraser aloud to himself as he put it down it will not greatly matter if my health do break down and i ought to have go long ago ` positively ceaseless ' he say the work be well ceaseless work be the only thing that can stifle thought and yet it will be hard come up by the root after all these year ah I this be a queer world and a sad one for some of we i will write to the bishop at once from which it will be gather that thing have not be go well with mr fraser meanwhile angela put she statement and the accompany letter into a large envelope then she take the queer emerald ring off she finger and as there be nobody look she kiss it and wrap it up in a piece of cotton-wool and stow it away in the letter and seal it up next she address it in she clear miniature handwriting to arthur p heigham esq care of mr carr madeira as lady bellamy have tell she and call to pigott to come with she start off to the post-office to register and post she precious packet for the madeira mail leave southampton on the morrow she have just time to reach the office affix the three shilling ' worth of stamp that the letter take and register it when the postman come up and she see it stamp and bundle into he bag with the other just as though it be nothing instead of she whole life depend on it and away it go on its journey as much beyond recall as yesterday 's sin and so you have be a-writing to he miss say pigott as soon as they be out of the office yes pigott and she tell she what lady bellamy have say she listen attentively with a shrewd twinkle in she eye i be think dearie that it be a pity you do not post yourself that be the best letter it can not make no mistake nor fall into the hand of they it be not mean for what can you mean i be think miss that change of air be a wonderful good thing after sickness especially sea-air answer pigott oracularly i do not in the least understand you really pigott you drive I wild with you parable lord dear for all you be so clever you never could see half a inch into a brick wall and that with my meaning as clear as a haystick in a thunderstorm this last definition quite finish angelum why she wonder should a haystack be clearer in a thunderstorm than at any other time she look at she companion helplessly and be silent bless I what i have be tell as plain as plain can be be why do not you go to this mad -- mad -- what be the name -- i never can think of they foreign name i be like jakes and the flower : he say the smaller and ` footier ' they be the longer the name they stick on to they just to puzzle a body who -- madeira suggest angelum with the calmness of despair yes that be it -- madeiry well why do not you go to madeiry along with you letter to look after mr arthur like enough he be in a bit of a mess there so far as i know anything about they way young man always be in a general sort of way for everlasting a-caterwauling after some one or other for all the world like a tom on the tile more especial if they be in love with somebody else but dear I a sensible woman do not bother she head about that she just go and hook they out of it and then she know where they be and keep they there oh pigott never mind all these reflection though i be sure i do not know how you can think of such thing the idea of compare poor dear arthur with a tom-cat but tell I how can i go to madeira suppose that he be marry well then you would learn all about it for yourself and no gammoning and there would be a end to it one way or the other but would it be quite modest to run after he like that modest indeed and why should not a young lady travel for she health i have hear say that this madeiry be a wonderful place for the stomach the lung pigott -- the lung well then the lung but it do not matter they be not far off each other but pigott who could i go with i could not go alone go with why I of course i can hardly fancy you at sea pigott and why not miss i dare say i shall do as well as other folk there and if i do go to the bottom as seem likely there be plenty of room for a respectable person there i should hope look here dear you 'll never be happy unless you marry mr arthur so do not you go and throw away a chance just out of foolishness and for fear of what folk say that be how dozen of woman make a mess of it folk say one thing to-day and another to-morrow but you 'll remain you for all that maybe he be married and if so it be a bad business and there be a end of it but maybe too he be not as for that letter as likely as not the other one will put it in the fire i should i doubt if i be in she shoe so do not you lose any time for if he be not marry it 's like enough he soon will be angela feel that there be sense in what she old nurse say though the idea be a new one to she and it make she thoughtful i 'll think about it she say presently i wonder what mr fraser would say about it perhaps one thing and perhaps another he be good and kind but he have not get much head for these sort of thing he be always think of something else just look what a fool squire george -lrb- may he twist and turn in he grave -rrb- make of he you ask he if you like but you be guide by yourself dearie you head be worth six reverend fraser 's when you bring it to a thing but i must be off and count the linen that evening after tea angelum go down to mr fraser 's he be direct a envelope to the lord bishop of he diocese when she enter but he hurriedly put it away in the blotting-paper well angelum do you get you letter off yes mr fraser it be just in time to catch the mail to-morrow but do you know that be what i want to speak to you about pigott think that under all the circumstance -- here angelum hesitate a little -- she and i have better go to madeira and find out how thing stand and i almost think that she be right certainly answer mr fraser rise and look out of the window you have a great deal at stake you do not think that it would be immodest my dear angelum when in such a case as this a woman go to seek the man she love and whom she believe love she i do not myself see where there be room for immodesty no nor do i and i do love he so very dearly he be all my life to I mr fraser wince visibly what be the matter have you get a headache nothing only a twinge here and he point to he heart angelum look alarmed she take a womanly interest in anybody 's ailment i know what it be she say widow jame suffer from it you must take it in hand at once or it will become chronic after meal as hers be mr fraser smile grimly as he answer : i be afraid that i have neglect it too long -- it have become chronic already but about madeira have you then make up you mind to go yes i think that i shall go if he -- be marry you know -- i can always come back again and perhaps pigott be right the letter might miscarry and there be so much at stake when shall you go then by the next steamer i suppose they go every week i think i will tell my father that i be go to-morrow ah you will want money i suppose no i believe that i have plenty of money of my own now oh yes under you marriage settlement no doubt well my dear i be sure i hope that you journey will not be in vain do i tell you i have also write to mr heigham by this mail and tell he all i know about the matter that be very kind and thoughtful of you it be just like you answer angelum gently not at all not at all but you have never tell I how you get on with lady bellamy -- that be except what she tell you about mr heigham oh it be a strange interview what do you think she want to teach I i have not the faintest idea magic nonsense yes she do she tell I that she could read all sort of thing in my face and offer if i would give myself up to it to make I more than human pshaw it be a bit of charlatanism she want to frighten you no i think she believe what she say and i think that she have some sort of power she seem disappoint when i refuse and do you know it if it have not be for arthur i do not think that i should have refuse i love power or rather knowledge but then i love arthur more and why be he incompatible with knowledge i do not know but she say that to triumph over the mystery she wish to teach I i must free myself from earthly love and care i tell she that if arthur be marry i would think of it well angela to be frank i do not believe in lady bellamy 's magic and if its practice bring people to what she be i think it be best leave alone indeed i expect that the whole thing be a delusion arise from she condition but i think she be right when she tell you that to become a mistress of she art -- or indeed of any noble art -- you must separate yourself from earthly passion i owe you arthur a grudge as well as lady bellamy i hope angelum to see you rise like a star upon this age of insolence and infidelity i want you to be a great woman but that dream be all over now why mr fraser because my dear both history and observation teach we that great gift like yours partake of the character of a accident in a woman they be not natural to she and she do not wear such jewel easily -- they put she outside of she sex it be something as though a man be bear into the world with wing at first he would be very proud of they and go sail about in the sky to the admiration of the crowd beneath he but by-and-by he would grow tired of fly alone and after all it be not necessary to fly to transact the ordinary business of the world and perhaps at last he would learn to love somebody without wing somebody who could not fly and he would always want to be with she down on the homely earth and not alone up in the heavenly height if a woman have all the genius of plato or all the learning of solomon it would be forget at the touch of a baby 's finger well well we can not fight against human nature and i daresay that in a few year you will forget that you can read greek as well as you can english and be very near finding out a perfect way of square the circle perhaps it be best so lady bellamy may have read a great many fine thing in you face shall i tell you what i read there i read that you will marry you arthur and become a happy wife and a happier mother that you life will be one long story of unassuming kindness and that when at last you die you will become a sacred memory in many heart that be what i read the only magic you will ever wield angelum will be the magic of you goodness who know we can not read the future she answer and so you be go to madeira next week then this will be the last time that we shall meet -- before you go i mean -- for i be off to london to-morrow for a while on some business when next we meet if we do meet again angela you will be a married woman do not start dear there be nothing shocking about that but perhaps we shall not meet any more oh mr fraser why do you say such dreadful thing there be nothing dreadful about it angelum i be get on in life and be not so strong as i be and you be both young and strong and must in the ordinary course of thing outlive I for many year but whatever happen my dear i know that you always keep a warm corner in you memory for you old master and as for I i can honestly say that to have know and teach you have be the greatest privilege of a rather lonely life here angelum begin to cry do not cry my dear there be thank god another meeting-place than this and if i reach the shore of that great future before you i shall -- but there my dear it be time for you to be go home you must not stop here to listen to this melancholy talk go home angelum and think about you lover i be busy to-night give I a kiss dear and go presently she be go and he hear the front-door close behind she he go to the window and watch the tall form gradually grow fainter in the gloaming till it vanish altogether then he come back and sit down at he writing-table rest he grizzled head upon he hand and think presently he raise it and there be a sad smile flicker round the wrinkle of the nervous mouth and now for ` hard labor at the london dock ' he say aloud chapter lxxii nothing occur to mar the prosperity of the voyage of the _ evening star _ that beautiful little vessel decline to simplify the course of this history by go to the bottom with mildr and arthur as the imaginative reader may have perhaps expect she do not even get into a terrific storm in order to give arthur the opportunity of perform heroic feat and the writer of this history the chance of display a profound knowledge of the name of rope and spar on the contrary she glide on upon a sea so still that even miss terry be persuade to arouse herself from she torpor and come upon deck till at last one morning the giant peak of teneriffe soar high above its circle cloud break upon the view of she passenger here they stop for a week or so enjoy themselves very much in they new surroundings till at length arthur grow tired of the island which be of course the signal for they departure so they return reach madeira after a absence of close upon a month as they drop anchor in the little bay mildr come up to arthur and touch he with that gentle deference which she always show towards he ask he if he be not glad to be home again home he say i have no home oh arthur she answer why do you try to pain I be not my home yours also so soon as they land he start off to mile ' hotel to see if any letter have come for he during he absence and return look very much put out what be the matter arthur ask miss terry once again happy at feel she foot upon solid soil why those idiot at the hotel have return a letter send to I by my lawyer they think that i have leave madeira for good and the letter be marked ` if leave return to messr borley and son ' with the address and the mail go out this afternoon into the bargain so it will be a month before i can get it back again have arthur know that this letter contain clipping of the newspaper report of the inquest on george caresfoot of whose death even he be in total ignorance he would have have good reason to be put out never mind arthur say mildr 's clear voice at he elbow -- she be rarely much further from he than he shadow lawyer ' letter be not as a rule very interesting i never yet have one that would not keep come and see if you pavilion -- be not that a grand name -- be arrange to you liking and then let we go to dinner for agatha here be die of hunger -- she have to make up for she abstinence at sea i be always tell break in that lady that yachting be charming but i tell you frankly i have never be more miserable in my life than i be on board you _ evening star _ never mind dear you shall have a nice long rest before we start for the coast of spain and so arthur soon settle down again into the easy tenor of madeira life he now scarcely make a pretence of live at the hotel since during they cruise mildr have have a pavilion which stand in the garden luxuriously set up for he occupation here he be happy enough in a dull numb way and as the day go on something of the old light come back to he eye and he footfall again grow quick and strong as when it use to fall in the corridor of the abbey house of the past he never speak nor do mildr ever allude to angelum after that conversation at sea which have end so strangely she contented herself with attempt to supplant she and to a certain extent she be successful no man could have for very long remain obdurate to such beauty and such patient devotion and it be not wonderful that he grow in a way to love she but there be this peculiarity about the affair -- namely that the affection which he bear she be bear more of she stronger will than of he own feeling as be show by the fact that so long as he be actually with she and within the circle of she influence she power over he be predominant but the moment that he be out of she sight he thought would fall back into they original channel and the old sore would begin to run however much too he might be successful in get the mastery of this trouble by day at night they would assert themselves and from the constant and torment dream which they inspire he could find no means of escape for at least four night out of every seven from the moment that he close he eye till he open they again the morning it would seem to he that he have be in the company of angelum under every possible variety of circumstance talk to she walking with she meeting she suddenly or unexpectedly in crowded place or at dinner-party -- always she and no one else -- till at last poor arthur begin to wonder if he spirit take leave of he body in sleep and go to seek she and what be more find she or be it nothing but a fantasy he could not tell but at any rate it be a fact and it would have be hard to say if it distressed or rejoice he most occasionally too he would fall into a fit of brooding melancholy that would last he for a day or two and which mildr would find it quite impossible to dispel indeed when he get in that way she soon discover that the only thing to do be to leave he alone he be suffer acutely there be no doubt about that and when any animal suffer include man it be best leave in solitude a sick or wounded beast always turn out of the herd to recover or die when mildr see he in this state of mental desolation she would shake she head and sigh for it tell she that she be as far as ever from the golden gate of she eldorado as have be say hers be the strongest will and even if he have not will it she could have marry he any day she wish but odd as it may seem she be too conscientious she have determine that she would not marry he unless she be certain that he love she and to this resolution as yet she firmly hold whatever she fault may have be mildr carr have all the noble unselfishness that be so common in she sex for herself and she own reputation she care comparatively speak nothing whilst for arthur 's ultimate happiness she be very solicitous one evening -- it be one of arthur 's black day when he have get a fit of what mildr call angela fever -- they be walk together in the garden arthur in silence with he hand in he pocket and he pipe in he mouth and mildr hum a little tune by way of amusing herself when they come to the wall that edge the precipice arthur lean over it and gaze at the depths below do not dear you will tumble over say mildr in some alarm i think it would be a good thing if i do he answer moodily be you then so tired of the world -- and I no dear i be not tire of you forgive I mildr but i be dreadfully miserable i know that it be very ungracious and ungrateful of I but it be the fact you be think of _ she _ again arthur yes i have get a fit of it i suppose that she have not be out of my mind for a hour altogether during the last forty-eight hour talk of be haunt by a dead person it be infinitely worse be haunt by a live one i be very sorry for you dear do you suppose mildr that this will go on for all my life that i shall always be at the mercy of these bitter memory and thought i do not know arthur i hope not i wish i be dead -- i wish i be dead he break out passionately she have destroy my life all that be happy in I be dead only my body live on i be sure i do not know mildr how you can care for anything so worthless she kiss he and answer dearest i have rather love you as you be than any other man alive time do wonder perhaps in time you will get over it oh arthur when i think of what she have make you and what you might have be if you have never know she i long to tell that woman all my mind but you must be a man dear it be weak to give way to a mad passion such as this be now try to think of something else work at something i have no heart for it mildr i do not feel as though i could work and if you can not make I forget i be sure i do not know what will mildr sigh and do not answer though she speak hopefully about it to he she have little faith in he get over he passion for angelum now either she must marry he as he be or else let he go altogether but which the struggle between she affection and she idea of duty be very sore and as yet she could come to no conclusion one thing there be that trouble she considerably and this be that though madeira be almost empty there be enough people in it to get up a good deal of gossip about herself and arthur now it would have be difficult to find anybody more entirely careless of the judgment of society than mildr more especially as she great wealth and general popularity protect she from slight but for all she oddity she be a thorough woman of the world and she know none better that in pursuance of a almost invariable natural law there be nothing that lower a woman so much in the estimation of a man as the knowledge that she be talk about even though he himself be the cause of the talk this may be both illogical and unjust but it be none the less true but if mildr still hesitate arthur do not he be very anxious that they should be marry indeed he almost insist on it the position be one that be far from be agreeable to he for all such intimacy must from they very nature necessitate a certain amount of false swearing they be throughout a act lie and when the lie be act it must sometimes be speak now this be a state of affair that be repugnant to a honorable man and one that not unfrequently become perfectly intolerable many be the love-affair that come to a sudden end because the man find it impossible to permanently constitute himself a peregrinate falsehood but oddly enough it have be find difficult to persuade the other contract party of the validity of the excuse and however unjust it may be one have know of man who have see they defection energetically set down to more vulgar cause arthur be no exception to this rule he find himself in a false position and he hate it indeed he determine before long he would place it before mildr in the light of a alternative that he should either marry she or that a end should be put to they exist relation chapter lxxiii as the autumn come on a great south-west gale burst over madeira and go sweeping away up the bay of biscay it blow for three day and night and be one of the heaviest on record when it first begin the english mail be due but when it pass there be still no sign of she and prophet of evil be not want who go to and fro shake they head and suggest that she have probably founder in the bay two more day go by and there be still no sign of she though the telegraph tell they that she have leave southampton dock at the appoint time and date by this time people in madeira could talk of nothing else well arthur no sign of the _ roman _ say mildr on the fifth day no the _ garth castle _ be due in to-day perhaps she may have hear something of she yes say miss terry absently she may have fall in with some of the wreckage i must say that be a cheerful suggestion answer arthur she be a awful old tub and i daresay run before the gale for vigo that be all let we hope so say mildr doubtfully what be it john the housemaid wish to speak to you please ma'am very good i will come it have be hint that agatha terry be look absent on the morning in question there be a reason for it for some time past there have be grow up in the bosom of this excellent lady a consciousness that thing be not altogether as they should be miss terry be not clever indeed it may be say that she be dense but still she could not but see that there be something odd in the relation between arthur and mildr for instance it strike she as unusual that two person who be not marry nor even so far as she know engage should habitually call each other dear and even sometimes dearest but on the previous evening when engage in a search after that species of beetle that love the night she chance to come across the pair standing together on the museum verandah and to she horror she see even in that light that mildr 's arm be round arthur 's neck and she head be rest on he heart stand aghast she see more for presently mildr raise she hand and draw arthur 's head down to the level of she own kiss he upon the face there be no doubt about it it be a most deliberate kiss -- a kiss without any extenuate circumstance he be not even go away and agatha could only come to one conclusion that they be either go to be marry -- or they ought to be she seek no more beetle that evening but on the follow morning when mildr depart to see the housemaid leave arthur and herself together on the verandah she think it be she duty to seek a little information arthur she say with a beating heart i want to ask you something be you engage to mildr he hesitate and then answer no i suppose not miss terry nor married to she no why do you ask because i think you ought to be i quite agree with you i suppose that you have notice something yes i have i see she kissing you arthur he blush like a girl oh arthur she go on burst into tear do not let this sort of thing go on or poor mildr will lose she reputation and you must know what a dreadful thing that be for any woman why do not you marry she because she refuse to marry I and yet -- and yet she kiss you -- like that add miss terry as the peculiar fervor of the embrace in question come back to she recollection ah i do not know what to think best not think about it at all miss terry it will not bear reflection oh arthur how could you he look very uncomfortable as he answer -- i know that i must seem a dreadful brute to you i daresay i be but miss terry it would under all the circumstance be much more to the point if you insist on mildred 's marry I i dare not you do not know mildred she would never submit to it from I then i must and what be more i will do it now thank you arthur thank you i can not tell you how grateful i be to you there be no need to be grateful to the author of this mischief and suppose she refuse -- what will you do then then i think that i shall go away at once hush here she come well arthur what be you and agatha plot together you both look serious enough nothing mildr -- that be only another sea-voyage mildred glance at he uneasily she do not like the tone in he voice i have a bit of bad news for you arthur that fool that idiot jane -- and she stamp she little foot upon the pavement -- have upset the mummy hyacinth-pot and break the flower off just as it be come into bloom i have give she a quarter 's wages and she passage back to england and pack she off why mildr remonstrate miss terry what a fuss to make about a flower she turn on she almost fiercely i have rather have break my arm or anything short of my neck than that she should have break that flower arthur plant it and now the clumsy girl have destroy it and mildr look as though she be go to cry as there be nothing more to be say miss terry go away as soon as she be go mildred turn to arthur and say -- you be right arthur we shall never see it bloom in this world never mind about the flower dear it can not be help i want to speak to you of something more important miss terry see you kiss I last night and she not unnaturally be anxious to know what it all means and do you tell she yes it be mildr 's turn to blush now mildr you must listen to I this can not go on any more either you must marry I or -- or what or i must go away at present we whole life be a lie do you really wish I to marry you arthur i not only wish it i think it necessary have you nothing more to say than that yes i have to say that i will do my best to make you a good and faithful husband and that i be sure you will make I a good wife she drop she face upon she hand and think just then miss terry come hurry up oh arthur she say just think the _ roman _ be in after all but all she boat be go and they say that half of she passenger and crew be wash overboard do go down and see about it he hesitate a little go dear whisper mildr i want time to think i will give you my answer this afternoon mildr sit still on the verandah thinking but she have not be there many minute before a servant come with she english letter that have be bring by the unfortunate _ roman _ and at the same time inform she that the _ garth castle _ have be sight and would anchor in a few hour mildr reflect that it be not often they get two english mail in one day she begin idly turn over the packet before she of late letter have lose much of they interest for mildr presently however she hand make a movement of almost electric swiftness and the color leave she face as she seize a stout envelope direct in a hand of peculiar delicacy to arthur heigham esq care of mr carr madeira mildr know the handwriting she have see it in arthur 's pocket-book it be angela caresfoot 's next to it there be another letter address to arthur in a hand that she do not know but bear the same postmark bratham and roxham she put they both aside and then take up the thick letter and examine it it have two peculiarity -- first it be open have come unsealed in transit and be somewhat roughly tie up with a piece of twine and secondly it contain some article of jewellery indeed by dint of a little press on the outside paper she be able to form a pretty accurate opinion as to what it be it be a ring if she have turn pale before when she see the letter she be paler still now heaven she think why do she send he a ring have anything happen to she husband if she be a free woman i be lose mildred look at the letter lie open before she and a terrible temptation take possession of she she take it up and put it down again and then again she take it up wipe the cold perspiration from she forehead my whole life be at stake she think then she hesitate no longer but take the letter slip off the piece of twine and draw its contents from the envelope the first thing to fall out wrap in a little cotton-wool be the ring she look at it and recognize it as arthur 's engagement ring the same that lady bellamy have take with she then put aside the statement she deliberately unfold the letter and read it do not think too hardly of she my reader the temptation be very sore but when one yield to temptation retribution be not unfrequently hard upon its track and it would only have be necessary to watch mildred 's face to see that if she have sin the sin go hand in hand with punishment in turn it take a expression of astonishment grief awe and despair she read the letter to the last word then she take the statement and glance through it smile once or twice as she read next she replace everything in the envelope and take it together with the other letter address to arthur unbuttoned the top of she loose-bodied white dress and place they in she bosom it be over she say to herself i can never marry he now that woman be as far above I as the star and sooner or later he would find it all out he must go ah god he must go to marry _ she _ why should i not destroy these letter and marry he to-morrow bind he to I by a tie that no letter can ever break what purchase he presence at the price of he daily scorn oh such water be too bitter for I to drink i have sin against you arthur but i will sin no more good-bye my dear good-bye and she lay she throbbing head upon the rail of the verandah and weep bitterly chapter lxxiv about three o'clock that afternoon arthur return to the quinta have lunch on board the _ roman _ he find mildr sit in she favorite place on the museum verandah she be very pale and if he have watch she he would have see that she be tremble all over but he do not observe she particularly well he say it be all nonsense about half the crew be drown only one man be kill by the fall of a spar poor chap they run into vigo as i think the other mail be just come in -- but what be the matter mildr you look pale nothing dear i have a good deal to think of that be all ah yes well my love have you make up you mind why do i refuse to marry you before for you sake or mine arthur you say -- absurdly i think -- for mine and what i say i mean and what i mean i mean look I in the face dear and tell I upon you honor as a gentleman that you love I really love I and i will marry you to-morrow i be very fond of you mildr and i will make you a good and true husband precisely that be what i expect but it be _ not _ enough for I there be a time when i think that i could be well satisfied if you would only look kindly upon I but i suppose that _ l'appetit vient en mangeant _ for now you do that i be not satisfied i long to reign alone but that be not all i will not consent to tie you who do not love I to my apron-string for life believe I the time be very near when you would curse I if i do you say -- and she rise and stretch out she arm -- that you will either marry I or go i have make my choice i will not beat out my heart against a stone i will _ not _ marry you go arthur go a great anxiety come into he face do you fully understand what you be say mildr such tie as exist between we can not be lightly break but i will break they and my own heart with they before they become chain so heavy that you can not bear they arthur -- and she come up to he and put she hand upon he shoulder look with wild and sorrowful eye straight into he face -- tell I now dear -- do not palter or put I off with any courteous falsehood -- tell I as truly as you will speak upon the judgment-day do you still love angelum caresfoot as much as ever mildr you should not ask I such painful question it be not right of you it be right and you will soon know that it be answer I then if you must have it _ i do _ she face become quite hard slowly she take she hand from he shoulder and you have the effrontery to ask I to marry you with one breath and to tell I this with the next arthur you have better go do not consider yourself under any false obligation to I go and go quickly for god 's sake think what you be do mildr oh i have think -- i have think too much there be nothing left but to say good-bye yes it be a very cruel word do you know that you have pass over my life like a hurricane and wrench it up by the root really mildr you mystify I i do not understand you what can be the meaning of all this she look at he for a few seconds and then answer in a quiet matter-of-fact voice i forget arthur here be you english letter and she draw they from she bosom and give they to he perhaps they will explain thing a little meanwhile i will tell you something angelum caresfoot 's husband be dead indeed she be never _ really _ marry to he and then she turn and slowly walk towards the entrance of the museum in the boudoir however she strength seem to fail she and she sink on a chair arthur take the letter write by the woman he love and warm from the breast of the woman he be about to leave and stand speechless he heart stop for a moment and then send the blood bound through he vein like a flood of joy the shock be so great that for a second or two he stagger and nearly fall presently however he recover himself and another and very different thought overtake he put the letter into he pocket he follow mildr into the boudoir she be sit look very faint upon a chair she arm hang down helplessly by she side mildr he say hoarsely she look up with a faint air of surprise what be you not go mildr beyond what you have just say i know nothing of the contents of these letter but whatever they may be here and now before i read they i again offer to marry you i owe it to you and to my own sense of what be right that i should marry you he speak calmly and with evident sincerity do you know that i read you letter just now and have half a mind to burn it that i be little better than a thief i guess that you have read it and do you understand that you angelum be unmarried that she be never really marry at all -- and that she ask nothing better than to marry you i understand and you still offer to make I you wife i do what do you say a flood of light fill mildred 's eye as she rise and confront he i say arthur that you be a very noble gentleman and that though from this day i must be a miserable woman i shall always be proud to have love you listen my dear when i read that letter i feel that you angelum tower over I like the alp she snowy purity stain only by the reflect light of heaven i feel that i could not compete with such a woman as this that i could never hope to hold you from one so calmly faithful so dreadfully serene and i know that she have conquer rob I for time and as i fear leave I beggar for eternity in the magnificence of she undying power in the calm certainty of she command she fling I you life as though it be nothing ` take it ' she say ` he will never love you -- he be mine but i can afford to wait i shall claim he before the throne of god ' but now look you arthur if you can behave like the generous - hearted gentleman you be i will show you that i be not behind you in generosity i will _ not _ marry you i have do with you or to be more correct and she give a hard little laugh you have do with I go back to angela the beautiful woman with inscrutable gray eye who wait for you clothe in she eternal calm like a mountain in its snow i shall send she that tiara as a wedding-present it will become she well go back arthur but sometimes when you be cloy with unearthly virtue and perfection remember that a _ woman _ loved you there i have make you quite a speech you will always think of I in connection with fine word why do not you go arthur stand utterly confused and what will you do mildr i she answer with the same hard laugh oh do not trouble yourself about I i shall be a happy woman yet i mean to see life now -- go in for pleasure power ritualism whatever come first perhaps when we meet again i shall be lady minster or some other great lady and shall be able to tell you that i be very very happy a woman always like to tell she old lover that you know though she would not like he to believe it perhaps too -- and here she eye grow soft and she voice break into a sob -- i shall have a consolation you know nothing of he do not know what she mean indeed he be half-distracted with grief and doubt for a moment more they stand face each other in silence and then suddenly she fling she arm above she head and utter a low cry of grief turn and run swiftly down the stone passage into the museum arthur hesitate for a while and then follow she a painful sight await he in that silent chamber for there -- stretch on the ground before the statue of osiri like some hopeless sinner before a inexorable justice with she brown hair touch to gold by a ray of sunlight from the roof -- lay mildr as still as though she be dead he go to she and try to raise she but she wrench herself loose and in a abandonment of misery fling herself upon the ground again i think it be over she say and that you be go go dear or this will drive I mad perhaps sometimes you will write I he kneel beside she and kiss she and then he rise and go but for many a year be he haunt by that scene of human misery enact in the weird chamber of the dead never could he forget the sight of mildred lie in the sunlight with the marble face of mock calm look down upon she and the mortal frame of those who in they day have suffer
