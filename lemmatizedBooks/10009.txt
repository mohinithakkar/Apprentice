paddling and kick with its little bare arm and leg as such little people be very apt to do while be dress it be not we baby we have dispense with that luxury and yet it be a sweet little thing and nestle as closely in we heart as if it be we own it be we first grandchild the beginning of a third generation so that there be small danger of we name become extinct a friend of mine who unfortunately have no voice for song have a most excellent wife and beautiful baby and can not therefore be say to be without music at home it be he first descendant and everybody know that such be just the thing of which father be very apt to be proud he be spend a evening with a neighbor and be ask to sing he decline of course give as a reason that he never sing why mr h -- say a black-eyed little girl of seven -- why mr h -- do not you never sing to the baby sure enough i wonder if there ever be a civilized a human man who never sing to the baby i do not believe that there be ever such a paradox in nature as a man who have toss the baby up and down balanced it on he hand give it a ride on he foot and yet never sing to it i do not care a fig about melody of voice or science in quaver i be not talk about sweetness of tone what i mean to say be that i do not believe there be a man living even though he have no more voice than a raven who be human and yet never sing to the baby always assume that he have one a great institution i repeat half in soliloquy and half to my wife what in the world be you talk about say mr h -- as she take a pin from she mouth and fasten the band that encircle the waist of the baby the nurse be look quietly on quite willing that she work should be thus take off she hand will somebody tell I if there ever be a grandmother especially one who become such young who could sit by and see the nurse dress she first or even she tenth grandchild while it be a helpless little thing say a foot or a foot and a half long the nurse be so unhandy she tumble the baby about so roughly handle it so awkwardly she will certainly dress it too loosely or too tight or leave a pin that will prick it or some terrible calamity will happen so she take possession of the little thing and with a hand guide by experience and the instinct of affection put its thing on in a christian and comfortable way a great institution i repeat again i do believe the man have lose he wit remark mr h -- hand the baby to the nurse who ever hear of a baby less than three month old be call a institution never hear of such a thing in my life i reply though a much greater mistake might be make what then in the name of goodness have you be talk about inquire mr h -- the country of course i reply i have just return from a business trip to vermont -- who ever think that vermont would be traverse by railroad or that the echo which dwell among she precipice and mountain fastness would ever wake to the snort of the iron horse who ever think that the locomotive would go scream and thunder along the base of the green mountain hurl its ponderous train load with human freight along the narrow valley above which mountain peak hide they head in the cloud how old ethan allen and general stark old put and the other glorious name that enrich the page of we revolutionary history would open they eye in astonishment if they could come back from the other side of jordan and sit for a little while on they own tombstone in sight of the railroad and see the train as they go rush like a tornado along they native valley i have make up my mind that morning all at once to go into the country it be a sudden resolve but i act upon it go into the country be a very different thing from what it use to be there be no packing of trunk or take leave of friend you take you satchel or travel bag kiss you wife in a hurry at the door and jump aboard of the car the whistle sound the locomotive breathe hoarsely for a moment and you be off like a shot in ten minute the suburb be behind you the field and farm be fly to the rear you dash through the wood and see the tree dodge and leap behind and around each other perform the dance of the witch in most admire confusion in three hour you be among the hill of massachusett the mountain of vermont on the border of the majestic hudson in the beautiful valley of the mohawk a hundred mile from the good city of albany where you can tramp among the wild or tame thing of nature to you heart 's content i have for the moment no particular place in view what i want be to get outside of the city among the hill where i could see the old wood the stream the mountain and get a breath of fresh air such as i use to breathe i want to be free and comfortable for a month to lay around loose in a promiscuous way among the hill where beautiful lake lay sleep in they quiet loveliness where the river flow on they everlasting course through primeval forest where the moose the deer the panther and the wolf still range and where the speckled trout sport in the crystal water i have make up my mind to throw off the care and anxiety of business and visit that great institution spread out all around we by the almighty to make man healthier wiser better i have resolve to go into the country that be a fix fact but where there stand my rifle in one corner of the room and my fishing rod in the other the sight of these settle the matter i will go to the north i say go to the north say mr h -- do tell I if you have get another of you old hunting and fishing fit on you again yes i reply i have feel it come on for a week and i have get it bad very well say my wife if the fit be on you there be no use in remonstrate you valise will be ready by the morning train and so the matter be settle but i must have a companion somebody to talk to and with somebody who could appreciate the beauty of nature who love the old wood the wilderness and all the wild thing pertain to they to whom the forest the lake and tall mountain the river and stream would recall the long past to whom the forest song and sound would bring back the memory of old and make he a boy again so i sally out to find he i have scarcely traverse a square when i meet my friend the doctor with carpet bag in hand on he way to the depot whither away my friend i inquire as we shake hand into the country he reply very well but where into the country he repeat do not you comprehend into the country by the first train anywhere everywhere all along shore go with I say i for a month a month bless you simple soul every patient i have get will be well in less than half that time but let they i 'll be avenge on they another time but where do _ you _ go to my old haunt in the north i reply to follow the stag to he slip ` ry crag and to chase the bound roe but say he i have no rifle i have get four i have no fishing rod i have half a dozen at you service give I you hand say he i be with you and so the doctor be book suppose say the doctor we beat up smith and spalding and take they along smith have get one of he old fit of the hypo he send for I to-day and i prescribe a frugal diet and the country wild game and bleeding by the musquito will do he good spalding be entitle to a holiday for he be work himself into dyspepsia in this hot weather just the thing i reply and we start to find smith and spalding we find they and it be settle that they should go with we for a month among the mountain everybody know smith the good-natured eccentric smith smith the bachelor who have a income greatly beyond he moderate expenditure and enough of capital to spoil as he say the orphan child of he sister by way of save they from be throw upon the cold world with a fortune he declare he will spend every dollar of it _ himself _ simply out of regard for _ they _ but smith will do no such thing and the tenderness with which he be rear the two beautiful black-eyed raven-haired little girl prove that he will not but smith have no professional call or business and when he digestion trouble he he have vision of the alms-house and the potter ' field and of two mendicant little girl while he endorsement would be regard as good at the bank for a hundred thousand dollar spald as everybody within a hundred league of the capitol know be a lawyer of eminence full of good-nature always cheerful always instructive a troublesome opponent at the bar a man of genial sympathy and a big heart if i have give he as well as smith a _ nom de plume _ it be out of regard for they modesty we arrange to meet at the car the next morning at six each with a rifle and fishing rod to be away for a month among the deer and the trout float over lake the most beautiful and along river the pleasantest that the sun ever shine upon chapter ii hurrah for the country hurrah hurrah we be in the country -- the glorious country outside of the throng street away from pile up brick and mortar outside of the clank of machinery the rumble of carriage the roar of the escape pipe the scream of the steam whistle the tramp tramp of move thousand on the stone sidewalk away from the heated atmosphere of the city load with the smoke and dust and gas of furnace and the ten thousand manufactory of villainous smell we be beyond even the meadow and green field we be here alone with nature surround by old primeval thing tall forest tree mountain and valley be on the right hand and on the leave before we stretch away for mile be a beautiful lake its water calm and placid give back the bright heaven the old wood the fleecy cloud that drift across the sky from away down in its quiet depths beyond still be mountain range whose castellated peak stand out in sharp and bold relief on whose top the beam of the descend sun lie like a mantle of silver and gold glad voice be ring sound of merriment make the evening joyous with the music of the wild thing around we hark how from away off over the water the voice of the loon come clear and musical and shrill like the sound of a clarion and note how it be bear about by the echo from hill to hill hark again to that clank sound away up in the air metallic ringing like the tone of a bell it be the call of the cock of the wood as he fly rise and fall glance upward and downward in he billowy flight across the lake hark to that dull sound like blow upon some soft hollow half sonorous substance slow and measure at first but increase in rapidity until it roll like the beat of a muffle drum or the low growl of the far-off thunder it be the partridge drum upon he log hark still again to that quaver note resemble somewhat the voice of the tree-frog when the storm be gather but not so clear and shrill it be the call of the raccoon as he clamber up some old forest tree and seat himself among the lowest of its great limb listen to the almost human halloo the hoo hohoo hoo that come out from the clustering foliage of a ancient hemlock it be the solemn call of the owl as he sit among the limb look out from between the branch with he great round gray eye listen again and you will hear the voice of the catbird the brown thrush the chervink the little chickadee the wood robin the blue-jay the wood sparrow and a hundred other nameless bird that live and build they nest and sing among these old wood but go a little nearer the lake and you will have a concert that will drown all these voice in its tumultuous roar compare to these feeble strain it be the crash of julien 's hundred brazen instrument to the soft and sweet melody of ole bull 's violin come with I to this rocky promontory stand with I on this moss-covered boulder which form the point on either hand be a little bay the head of which be hide around among the wood see over against we on the limb of that dead fir tree which lean out over the water be a bald eagle straighten with he hooked beak the feather of he wing and pause now and then to look out over the water for some careless duck of which to make prey see he have leap from he perch have spread he broad pinion and be soar upward towards the sky see how he circle round and round mount higher and higher at every gyration he be like a speck in the air but see he be above the mountain now and how like a arrow he go straight forward with no visible motion to he wing he have lay he course for some lake deeper in the wilderness beyond that range of hill and he be there even while we be talk of he flight a swift bird the swiftest of all the bird be the eagle when he take he descend stoop from he place away up in the sky he cleave the air like a bullet and so swift be he career that the eye can scarcely trace he flight but hark all be still now save the piping note of the little peeper along the shore wait however a moment there hear that venerable podunker off to the right with he deep bass like the sound of a brazen serpent listen another deep voice on the left have fall in there another right over against we another and another still a dozen a hundred a thousand ten thousand a million of they close by we far off on the right hand and on the leave here there everywhere until above around we all through the wood all along the shore all over the lake be a solid roar impenetrable to any other sound surging and sway rolling and swell as if all the voice in the world be concentrate in one stupendous concert but hark the roar be die away voice after voice drop out here and there be one laggard in the song still drag out the chorus now all be still again save the note of the little peeper along the shore in two minute that band will strike up again the roar will go bellow over the lake through the wood to be throw from hill to hill to die away into silence again and so it will be through all the long night and until the sun look out from among the tree top in the morning touch that solemn look old croaker on yonder broad leaf of that pond lily with the end of you fishing rod while the music be at the highest he will send forth a quick discordant and crack cry like that of a greedy dog choke with a bone as he plunge for the bottom and note how suddenly that sound will be repeat and how quick the roar of the frog will be hush into silence that be a cry of alarm a note of danger and every frog within hear understand its import be it ask _ where _ we be i answer we be on the lower saranac lake just on the south point at the entrance of the romantic little bay at the head of which stand martin 's lake house the only human dwelling in sight of this beautiful sheet of water on the point where we now be long ago be the log shanty of a hunter and fisherman surround by a acre or two of clear land but its occupant move deeper into the wilderness over on the water of the rackett many year since the log shanty have rot away and a vigorous growth of brush and small timber now cover what once may have be call a field but the night shadow be begin to gather over the forest throw a sort of spectral gloom among the old wood give a distorted look to the trunk of the tree the low bush the turn up root and the boulder scatter over the ground see what ogre shape these thing assume as the darkness deepen look at that cedar bush with its dense foliage it be a crouching lion and as its branch wave in the gentle breeze he seem prepare for he leap and yonder boulder be a huge elephant the root that come out from the crevice be he trunk and the moss and lichen which hang down on either side be he pendant ear and see he have a great tower on he back wherein be seat a warrior in he ancient armor grasp battle-axe and spear beyond through that opening upon the bay be a castle loom darkly against the sky with massive tower and arched gateway such be the form which fancy give to these forest thing in the doubtful twilight of a summer evening while we have be look upon these unsubstantial shadow the sunlight have leave the mountain peak the star have come out in the sky and the moon have start on she course across the heaven let we rest on we oar a moment here in the bay to view the scenery around we as see by the mellow moonlight so calm so still so motionless be both air and water that we seem suspend between the sky above sparkling and glowing with million of bright star and the moon ride gloriously on she course and a sky beneath sparkling and glowing with like million of bright star and the same moon or its counterpart float away down in fathomless depths below we see how the same hillside the same line of forest tree the same range and mountain peak be reflect back from the stirless bosom of the lake there above and just on the upper line of that tall peak loom darkly and majestically in the distance hang a brilliant star sparkling and twinkling like the sheen of a diamond and right beneath away down just as far below the surface of the water as mountain peak and star be above it be another mountain peak and bright star twin by the mirror water see away down the lake that little island with its half dozen spruce tree cluster together how like a great war vessel it look with sail all set as see by the uncertain light of the moon and that other island off to the leave with the dead and barkless tree how like a tall ship with bare mast ride at anchor it seem that other island away to the right with its great boulder and bare rock rise straight up out of the water be a fortification a stronghold surround by a wall of solid masonry and bristle with cannon we can almost see the sentinel and hear he measure tramp as he travel he lonely round keep watch out over the water see all along the shore as you look up the bay towards the lake house how the million of firefly flash they tiny torch upward and downward this way and that mingle and cross and gyrate and whirling -- a troubled and billowy sea of million upon million of glowing and sparkling gem reader be you and i gifted with the spirit of poetry what inspiration would we not gather from the glory which surround we as we float of a summer evening over these beautiful lake sleep away out here in all they virgin loveliness among these old primeval thing but you ask what inspiration can there be in a moon and star that we see every night when the sky be cloudless in a desolate wilderness the roar of the frog the hooting of owl these useless water the phosphorescent flash of lightning bug these pile up rock and barren mountain can you grow corn on these hill or make pasture of these rocky lowland can you harness these river to great waterwheel or make reservoir of these lake can you convert these old forest into lumber or cordwood can you quarry these rock lay they up with mortar into house mill church public edifice can you make what you call these ` old primeval thing ' utilitarian can you make they minister to the progress of civilization or coin they into dollar pshaw you have spoil with you worldliness you greed for progress you thirst for gain a pleasant fancy a glorious dream as if everything in the heaven on the earth or in the water be to be measure by the dollar and cent standard and unless reducible to a representative of moneyed value to be throw as utterly worthless away let we row back to the lake house chapter iii the departure -- the stag hound -- the chase -- round lake from martin 's lake house we be to take we departure in the morning we have arrange for three boat and as many stalwart boatman two of these boat be for we own conveyance and one for we luggage and provision the latter to be send forward with we tent in advance so as to have a home ready for we always at we come when we choose to linger by the way these boatman be all jolly good-natured and pleasant people with a vast deal of practical sense and a valuable experience in woodcraft albeit they be rough and unpolished they heart be in the right place and they command we respect always for they kindness and attention to we want while they maintain at all time that sturdy independence which enter so largely into the character of the border man of we country they boat be construct of spruce or cedar board of a quarter of a inch in thickness clap-boarded as the expression be upon knee of the natural crook and weigh from ninety to one hundred and ten pound each they be carry around rapid or from river to river on the back of the boatman in this wise : a yoke be provide such as every man in the country especially all who have visit a sugar bush at the season of sugar making have see at the end of this yoke be a round iron projection make to fit into a socket in the upper rave of the boat the craft be turn bottom upward the yoke adjust to the shoulder the iron projection fit into the socket and the boatman march off with he boat like a turtle with he shell upon he back he will carry it thus sometimes half a mile before stop to rest with we be to go two staid and sober stag hound grave in aspect and train and experience almost in woodcraft as they master animal that have be rear together and who possess the rare instinct of return always to the shanty from which they start however far the chase may have lead they it be a glorious sound in the old forest the music of those two hound as they voice ring out bold and free like a bugle and go ring through the forest echo among the mountain and die away over the lake but of that hereafter we little fleet swing out upon the water while the sun be yet hang like a great torch among the top of the tree on the eastern hill it be a beautiful morning so fresh so genial so balmy a pleasant breeze come sweeping lazily over the lake and go sigh and moan among the old forest tree all around we be glad voice the partridge drum upon he log the squirrel chatter as they chase each other up and down the great trunk of the tree the loon lift up he clarion voice away out upon the water the eagle and the osprey scream as they hover high above we in the air while a thousand merry voice come from out the old wood all mingling in the harmony of nature 's gladness a loud and repeated hurrah burst from we all as we oar strike the water and send we little boat bound over the rippled surface of the beautiful saranac this be a indeed a beautiful sheet of water the shore be line with a dense and unbroken forest stretch back to the mountain which surround it the old wood stand then in all its primeval grandeur just as it grow the axe have not harm it nor have fire mar its beauty the island be cover with a lofty growth of live timber clothe in the deepest green there be not then as now upon some of they great dead tree reach out they long bare arm in verdureless desolation above a stinted undergrowth and pile up trunk char and blacken by the fire that have revel among they but all be green and thrifty and glorious in they robe of beauty thousand of happy songster carol gaily among they branch or hide themselves in the dense foliage of they wide-spreading arm the island be a marked feature of these northern lake lend a peculiar charm to they quiet beauty and one day when the iron horse shall go thunder through these mountain gorge the tourist will pause to make a record of they loveliness four or five mile down the lake be a beautiful bay stretch for near half a mile around a high promontory almost reach another bay wind around a like promontory beyond leave a peninsula of five hundred acre join to the main land by a narrow neck of some forty rod in width we first sport among the deer be to be the driving of this peninsula we station ourselves on the narrow isthmus within a few rod of each other while a boatman go round to the opposite side to lay on the dog we have be at we post perhaps half a hour when we hear the measure bound of a deer as he come crash through the forest we could see he white flag wave above the undergrowth as he come bound towards we neither smith nor spalding have ever see a deer in he native wood and they be by a previous arrangement to have the first shot if circumstance should permit it the noble animal come dash proudly on he way as if in contempt of the danger he be leave behind he of the greater danger into which he be rush he be entirely unconscious until the crack of smith 's rifle break upon he astonished ear he be unharmed however and quick as think he wheel and plunge back in the direction from which he come spalding 's rifle as it echo through the forest with the whistling of the ball in close proximity to he head add energy to he flight the rifle be scarcely reload when the deep baying of the hound be hear and two more deer come crash across the isthmus where we be station the foremost one go down before the doctor 's unerring rifle and cool aim while the other run the gauntlet of the three other rifle horribly frightened but unharmed away the hound be call off and with we game in one of the boat we row back around the promontory and pass on towards the saranac river which connect by a tortuous course of five mile the lower saranac with round lake midway between these two lake be a fall or rather rapid down which the river descend some ten foot in five or six rod through a narrow rocky channel around which the boat have to be carry while this be be do smith and spalding adjust they rod eager to make up in catch trout what they fail to achieve in the matter of venison and they succeed in twenty minute they have fifteen beautiful fish none weigh less than half a pound safely deposit on the broad flat rock at the head of the rapid one throw more say smith and i have do and he cast he fly across the still water just above the fall quick as think it be take by a two-pound trout landing net and gaff have be send forward with the baggage and without these it be a exciting and delicate thing to land that fish the game be to prevent he dash away down the rapid or diving beneath the shelve rock above the sharp edge of which would have sever the line like a knife skillfully and beautifully smith play he for a quarter of a hour until at last the fish turn he orange belly to the surface and cease to struggle he be drown we have in the morning direct the boatman in charge of the baggage to go on in advance and erect we tent on a island in round lake when we enter this beautiful sheet of water about four o'clock we see the white tent stand near the shore of the island with a column of smoke curl gracefully up among the tall tree that overshadow they when we arrive we find everything in order they be pitch in a pleasant spot look out to the west over the water while within be bed of green bough from the spruce and fir tree and bundle of bough tie up like faggot for pillow we first dinner in the wilderness be a pleasant one albeit the cookery be somewhat primitive with fresh venison and trout seasoned with sweet salt pork we get through with it uncomplainingly this little lake be a gem it be as its name purport round some four mile in diameter surround by a amphitheatre of hill beneath whose shadow it repose in placid and quiet beauty on the northeast ballface mountain rear its tall head far above the intervene range while away off in the east mount marcy and mount seward stand out dim and shadowy against the sky nearer be the keene range ragged and lofty they bare and rocky summit glisten in the sunlight while nearer still the hill rise sometimes with steep and ragged acclivity and sometimes gently from the shore here and there a valley wind away among the highland along which the mountain stream come bound down rapid or move in deep and sluggish but pure current towards the lake the rugged and sublime with the placid and beautiful in natural scenery be magnificently mingle in the surroundings of this little sheet of water chapter iv the doctor 's story -- a slippery fish -- a lawsuit and a compromise there seem to be a law or rather a habit pertain to forest life into which every one fall while upon excursion such as ours story occupy the place of book and tale of the marvellous furnish a substitute for the evening papers not that there should be any set rule or system in regard to the order of the matter but a sort of spontaneous movement a imply understanding grow out of the necessity of the position of isolation occupy by those who be away from the resource of civilization the doctor have a genius for story tell or rather a genius for invention which require only a moderate development of the organ of credulity on the part of he hearer to render he unrivalled there be a appearance of frank earnestness about he manner of relate he adventure which however improbable or even impossible as matter of fact they might be command for the moment absolute credence they have a curious fish in the st lawrence say the doctor as he knock the ash from he meerschaum and refill it known among the fisherman of that river as the lawyer i have never see it among any other of the water of this country and never there but once it never bite at a hook and be take only by gill-net or the seine everybody he continue have visit the thousand island or if everybody have not he have better go there at once he will find they in the heat of summer not only the coolest and most healthful retreat and the pleasantest scenery that the eye ever rest upon always except these beautiful lake but the best river fishing i know of on this continent he will not to be sure take the speckled trout that we find in this region but he will be among the black bass the pickerel muscalunge and striped bass in the greatest abundance and ready to answer promptly any reasonable demand which he may make upon they think of reel in a twenty-pound pickerel or a forty-pound muscalunge on a line three hundred foot in length play he for half a hour and landing he safely in you boat at last there be excitement for you worth talk about i stop over night at cape vincent last summer on my way to ` the thousand island ' on a fishing excursion of a week i be acquaint with a old fisherman of that place and agree to go out with he the next morning to see what luck he have with the fish i do not think much of that kind of fishing though it be well enough for those who make a business of it for the gill-net work as the old man say while the fisherman sleep and all he get in that way be clear gain well i rise early the next morning to go out with the old fisherman to he gill-net it would have do you good as it do I to see how merry every living thing be the bird how jolly they be and how refresh the breeze be that come steal over the water make one feel as if he would like to shout and hurrah in the buoyancy the brightness and glory of the morning but i be not go to be poetical about the sunrise and the singing bird we go out upon the river just as the sun come up with he great round red face for there be a light smoky haze float above the eastern horizon and throw he light like a stream of crimson flame across the water and the meadow lark perch upon he fence stake the blackbird upon he alderbush the brown thrush on the topmost spray of the wild thorn and the bob-o ' - link as he leap from the meadow and poise himself on he flutter wing in mid air all send up a shout of gladness as if hail the god of the morning we come to the net and begin to draw in you ought to have see the fish there be pickerel from four to ten pound in weight white fish black bass rock bass oswego bass and pike by the dozen and what be a stranger to I a queer look specimen of the piscatory tribe half bull-head and half eel with a cross of the lizard ` what on earth be that ' say i to the fisherman ` that ' say he ` be a species of ling we call it in these part a lawyer ' ' a lawyer ' say i ` why pray ' ' i do not know ' he reply ` unless it be because he be not of much use and be the slipriest fish that swim ' mark continue the doctor turn to spald i mean no personality i be simply give the old fisherman 's word not my own proceed with the case say spalding as he send a column of smoke curl upward from he lip and with a gravity that be refreshing well resume the doctor the lawyer be throw by themselves and one old fat fellow weigh perhaps five or six pound fix he great round glassy eye upon I and open he ugly mouth and i think i hear he say interrogatively ` well ' as if demand that the _ case _ should proceed at once ` well ' say i in reply ` what be out ' ` what be out ' he answer ' _ i be _ out -- i be out of my element -- out of water -- out of court -- and in this hot dry atmosphere almost out of breath but what have i be summon here for i demand a copy of the complaint ' ` my dear sir ' say i ` i be not a member of the court i do not belong to the bar -- i be not the plaintiff -- i be not in the profession nor on the bench i be neither sheriff constable nor juror i be only a spectator in the rackett wood among the lake and stream of that wild region with a rod and fly i be at home with the trout but -- ' ` oh ho ' he exclaim with a chuckle ` you be the chap i be consult about down near the mouth of the rackett the other day by a country trout who be on a journey to visit he relative in the stream of canada he show I a hole in he jaw make by you hook at the mouth of the bog river i have file a summons and complaint against you for assault and battery and beg to notify you of the fact ' ' i plead the general issue ' say i ` there be no such thing know to the code ' he reply ' i deny the fact then ' i exclaimed ` that will not do ' he rejoin ` the complaint be put in under oath and you must answer by affidavit of the truth of you denial ' you see my dilemma i remember the circumstance of hook a noble trout at the place allege and as the affair have be settle i 'll tell you how it be at the head of tupper 's lake one of the most beautiful sheet of water that the sun ever shine upon lie alone among the mountain surround by old primeval forest wall in by palisado of rock and stud with island the bog river enter this river come down from the hill away back in the wilderness sometimes rush with a roar over rock and through gorge sometimes plunge down precipice and sometimes move with a deep and sluggish current across a broad sweep of table land for several mile back of the lake and until a few rod of the shore it be a calm deep river it then rush down a steep shelve rock some twenty foot into a great rocky basin then down again over a shelve rock in a fall of twenty foot into another rocky basin and then again in another fall of twenty or thirty foot over a steep shelve rock shooting with a swift current far out into the lake these fall constitute a beautiful cascade and they roar may be hear of a calm summer evening for mile out on the placid water at the foot of these fall in the summer season the trout congregate beautiful large fellow from one to three pound in weight and a fly trail across the current or over the eddy just at its outer edge be a thing at which they be tolerably sure to rise well last summer i be out that way among the lake that lie sleep in beauty and along the stream that flow through the old wood play the savage and vagabondize in a promiscuous way the river be low and a broad rock smooth and bare slope gently to the water 's edge under which the stream whirl as it enter the lake and above which tall tree tower cast over it a pleasant shade present a tempting place to throw the fly i cast over the current and trail along towards the edge of the rock when a three-pounder rise from he place down in the deep water he do not come head foremost nor glancing upward but rise square up to the surface and pause a single instant dart forward like a arrow and seize the fly well away he plunge with the hook in he jaw bend my elastic rod like a reed the reel hiss as the line spin away eighty or a hundred foot across the current and far out into the lake but he be fast and after struggle for a time he partially surrender and i reel he in slowly and with a sullen struggle he be draw towards the shore sometimes with he head out of water and sometimes diving towards the bottom at last he catch sight of I and with renew energy he plunge away again clear across the current and out into the lake but the tension of the elastic rod work against he steadily and always be too much for he strength and again i reel he in struggle still though faintly slowly but steadily i reel he to my hand he be just by the edge of the rock almost within reach of my landing net when with a last desperate effort to escape he plunge towards the bottom make a dive under the rock the line come against its edge slip gratingly for a moment snap and the fish be go he be a beautiful trout and beautifully he play he deserve freedom on account of the energy with which he struggle for it you will see therefore that as i say i be in a dilemma the action against I be well bring i could not deny the truth of the fact charge against I in the complaint in this position of affair three alternative present themselves first a denial of the truth of the complaint but that involve perjury secondly admission of the fact charge but that involve conviction and thirdly a compromise and the latter one i adopt ` can not this thing be settle ' say i to the old lawyer fish of the st lawrence ` without litigation I and my four companion overboard place we in _ statu quo _ and the action shall be discontinue ' ` agree ' say i and i reach down to enter upon the performance of my part of the contract ` wait a moment ' say he curl up he shaky tail ` the cost -- who pay the cost ' ` the cost ' i reply ` each pay he own of course ' ` not so fast ' he exclaim ` not quite so fast you must pay the cost or the suit go on ' there be something human in the tenacity with which that old ` lawyer ' cling to the idea of cost there he be gasp for breath he life depend upon the result of the negotiation and still he insist upon the payment of cost as a condition of compromise probably out of regard for the interest of he client say spalding gravely but proceed with the case ` fisherman ' say i resume the doctor ` what be the cost of these five _ lawyer _ how much for the fee simple of the lot ' ` they be not worth but ninepence ' he reply ` good ' say i ` here be a shilling york currency ' ` agree ' say he and throw in a sucker by way of change ` anything more ' i ask of the old cormorant lawyer ` no ' he reply ` all right -- so toss we overboard and be quick for my breath be get a little short ' i throw they over one at a time the old fellow last and as he slip from my hand into the river he thrust he ugly face out of the water and say coolly ` good morning when you come we way again _ drop in _ ' ` no ' say i ` i 'll _ drop a line _ ' i remember how i ` drop in ' over on long lake one day and have no inclination to drop in to the st lawrence especially when there be old lawyer fish there to summon I for assault and battery on a ` shatagee trout ' doctor say hank martin one of we boatman who have be listen to the doctor 's narrative i do not want to be consider for ` ard or sassy but i would like to know how much of these kind of story we hire folk be obligate to believe well reply the doctor there be three of you in all and between you you must make up a reasonable case as spalding would say of faith in everything you may hear this you may do by divide it up among you very good say martin with imperturbable gravity i only want a fair understanding of the matter on the start chapter v a frightened animal -- troll for trout -- the boatman 's story we sit in front of we tent enjoy the delightful breeze that sweep quietly over the lake and watch the star as they steal out from the depths the whippoorwill pipe away in the old forest and the frog bellow like ten thousand buffalo along the shore the roar of they hoarse voice go roll over the lake through the old wood and surge up against the mountain to be throw back by the echo that dwell among the hill we have knock the ash from we pipe and be about retire to we tent for the night when a long wake in the water across the line of the moon 's reflection attract we attention it be evidently make by some animal swimming and the doctor and martin start in pursuit it prove to be a deer which be apparently make its way to a island midway across the lake they have no desire to slaughter it and they conclude to drive it ashore where we be they head it in the proper direction and follow the terrify animal as it swim for life towards the island on which we be encamp we understand they purpose and sit perfectly silent the deer strike the island directly in front of we tent and dash forward in wild affright right through the midst of we towards the thicket in we rear glad to be rid of he pursuer on the water as he bound past we we spring up and shout and if ever a dumb animal be astonish it be that deer he leap up a dozen foot into the air bleat out in the extremity of he terror and plunge madly forward as if a whole legion of fiend be at he tail the stag hound which be tie to a sapling by they fierce baying add vigor to he flight we hear he snort at every bind across the island and he plunge into the lake on the other side in the morning we send forward we boatman with the tent and baggage to a island on the upper saranac and coast this pleasant little lake on the right as you approach the head be a deep bay skirt by a natural meadow where the rank wild grass and the pond lily that grow along the shore furnish a rich pasture for the deer we see several feed quietly like sheep on the little plain and upon the lily pad in the edge of the water we paddle silently to within a dozen rod of they when as they discover we they dash snort and whistle away on the right of this meadow and among the tall forest tree be great boulder which pile up and partly obscure by the undergrowth resemble from the lake the massive ruin of some ancient fortification we land by a spring which come bubble up from beneath one of these great moss-covered rock to lunch it be a pleasant spot and while we sit there dozen of small bird of the size and general appearance of the cuckoo save in they hooked beak attract by the scent of we cold meat come hop tamely about on the lower limb of the forest tree around we they be call by we boatman meat hawk and have less fear of man than any wild bird that i have ever see we cross the carry place of a quarter of a mile around the rapid in which distance the river fall some sixty foot roar and tumble down ledge and boil in mad fury around boulder we enter the upper saranac at the hour appoint and find we tent pitch and a dinner of venison and trout await we on the island select for we encampment as the sun sink behind the hill the breeze die away and the lake lay without a ripple around as so calm so smooth and still that it seem to have sink quietly to sleep in its forest bed the fish be jump in every direction and while the rest of we sit smoking we meerchaum after dinner or rather supper smith rig he trolling rod and have catch half a dozen minnow he with martin row out upon the water to troll for the lake trout these be a very different fish from the speckled trout of the stream and river they have none of the golden speck of the latter are of a darker hue and much larger they be dot with brown spot like freckle upon the face of a fair-skinned girl they be shorter too in proportion to they weight than the speckled trout they be catch in these lake weigh from three to fifteen pound and instance have be know of they attaining to the weight of five and twenty it be a exciting sport to take one of these large fellow on a line of two hundred and fifty or three hundred foot in length they play beautifully when hooked and it require a good deal of coolness and skill to land they safely in you boat a trolling rod for these large fish should be much stiffer and stronger than those use for the fly on the river and stream and the reel should be stronger and higher gear than the common fly reel three hundred foot of line be necessary for the fish if he be a large one will sometimes determine upon a long flight and it will not do to exhaust you line in he career in that case he will snap it like a pack-thread a english bass rod be the best and with such and a large triple action reel the largest fish of these lake may be secure smith have troll scarcely a quarter of a mile when he hook be strike by a trout and then commence a struggle that be pleasant to witness no sooner have the fish discover that the hook be in he jaw than away he dash towards the middle of the lake the rod be bent into a semicircle but the game be fast with the butt firm between he knee and he thumb press the reel the sportsman give he a hundred and fifty foot of line when he effort begin to relax and as smith begin to reel he in a moment of dead pull a hold back like a obstinate mule occur the trout be slowly tow in the direction of the boat then as if madden by the force which impel he he dash furiously forward the reel answering to he movement and the line always teach he rise to the surface leap clear from the water shake he head furiously as if to throw loose the fastening from he jaw fail in this down he plunge fifty foot straight towards the bottom make the reel hiss by he mad effort to escape still the line be teach press always tow he towards the boat at every relaxation at last he rise to the surface panting and exhaust permit himself to be tow almost without a effort to within twenty foot of he captor when he see they all he fright and all he energy too seem to be restore and away he dash scive through the water a hundred and fifty foot out into the lake but the hook be in he jaw and he could not escape after half a hour of beautiful and exciting play he surrender or be drown and smith lift he with he landing net a splendid ten-pound trout into he boat by this time the shadow of twilight be gather over the lake and he come ashore a proud man be smith as he lift that fish from the boat and hand it over to the cook to be dress for breakfast and though we have see the whole performance from we tent yet he give we in glowing and graphic detail the history of he take that ten-pound trout captain say hank wood who have be quietly whitle out a new set of tent pin address smith you have a good time of it with that trout but it be nothing to a adventer of mine with a old mossy-back on this lake five year ago this summer how be that inquire smith and we all gather around to hear hank wood 's story i do not know how it be he begin as he seat himself on the log in front of the tent with one leg hang down and the other draw up with the heel of he boot catch on a projection in the bark he knee almost even with he nose and he finger lock across he shin i do not know exactly why but the catch of that trout make I think of a adventer i have on this very lake five year ago this summer it be curious how thing will lay around in a man 's memory every now and then startin ' up and presentin ' themselves ready to be talk about -- reel off -- as it be and then how quietly they coil themselves away to lay there till some new sight or sound or idea or feelin ' stir 'em into life and they come up again fresh and plain as ever some people talk about forget thing but i do not believe that any matter that get fairly anchor in a man 's mind can ever be forget until age have break the power of memory it be there and will stay there in spite of the ten thousand other thing that get pile in on top of it and some day it will come pop out like a cork just as good and distinct as new but i be talkin ' about a adventer i have with a trout five year ago here on the upper saranac i be livin ' over on the _ au sable _ then and come over to these part to spend a week or so and lay in a store of jerk venison and trout for the winter i bring along a bag of salt and two or three keg that would hold a hundred pound or so apiece and fill 'em too with as beautiful orange-meated fellow as you would see in a day 's drive the trout be plentier than they be now they have not be fish by all the sportin ' man in creation and they have a chance to grow to they nateral size you would not in they day row across any of these lake in the trollin ' season without hitchin ' on to a eight or ten and now and then to a twenty-pounder wal i be on the upper saranac up towards the head of the lake ten or twelve mile from here trollin ' with a old-fashioned line about as big as a pipe stem a hundred and fifty foot long and a hook to match nobody in they day tho ' t of sich contrivance as trollin ' - rod reel and minny-gang you hold you line in you finger and when you hook a fish you draw he in hand over hand in a human way it be in the latter part of June and the way the black fly swarm along the shore be a thing to set anybody a scratchin ' that happen to be around it be a clear still mornin ' and the sun as he go up into the heaven blaze away and as he walk across the sky if he do not pour down he heat like a furnace i would not say so i have tolerable good luck in the forenoon and land on a rocky island to cook dinner i make such a meal as a hungry man make when he be out all alone fishin ' and huntin ' about these water and start off across the lake with my trollin ' line to the length of a hundred foot or more draggin ' through the water behind I the breeze have freshen a little and my boat drift about fast enough for trollin ' and feelin ' a little drowsy i tie the end of the line to the cleet across the knee of the boat and lay down in the bottom with my hand out over the side holdin ' the line i have not lay there long when i feel a twitch as if something mighty big be medlin ' with the other end of the string i start up and undertake to pull in but you might as well undertake to drag a elephant with a thread i could not move he a hair pretty soon the boat begin to move up the lake in a way i do not at all like at first it go may be three mile a hour then five ten twenty forty sixty mile the hour round and round the lake as if hurl along by a million of locomotive we go skive around among the island into the bay along the shore away out across the lake cross and re-cross in every direction and if there be a place about this lake we do not visit i should like to have somebody tell I where it be you may think it make my hair stand out some to find myself flyin ' about like a streak of chain lightnin ' and to see the tree and rock flyin ' like mad the other way i try to untie the line but it be draw into a knot so hard that the old nick himself could not move it i look for my knife to cut it but it have somehow get overboard in we flight besides flyin ' about at the rate of sixty mile a hour keep a fellow pretty busy holdin ' on keepin ' he place in the boat after a hour or two we come to a pause and the old feller that be towin ' I about walk up to the surface and stickin ' he head out of the water ` good mornin '' say he in a very perlite sort of way ` good mornin '' say i back again ` how go it ' say he ` all right ' say i ` step this way and i 'll take the hook out of you gum ' ` thank you for nothing ' say he and he open he month like the entrance to a railroad tunnel and blame I if he have not take a double hitch of the line around he eye tooth while the hook hang harmless beside he jaw ` i have a little business down in the lower lake ' say he ` and must be movin '' and away he bolt like a steam engine down the lake when he straighten up my hat fly more than sixty yard behind I and the way i come down into the bottom of the boat be anything but pleasant away we tear down towards the outlet the boat cuttin ' and plowin ' through the water pilin ' it up in great furrow ten foot high on each side there be as you know sixty foot fall between the upper saranac and round lake and the river go boilin ' and roarin ' tumblin ' and heavin ' down the rapid and over the rock pitchin ' in some place square down a dozen foot among the boulder no sensible man would think of travellin ' that road in a little craft like mine unless he would make up he mind to see how it would seem to be drown or smash to piece agin the rock but right down the rapid we go swifter than a eagle in he stoop down over the boilin ' eddy down over the foamin ' surge down the perpendicular fall as if the old nick himself be kickin ' we on end how we get down i will not undertake to say but when i get breath and look out over the side of the boat i see the old wood and rock along the shore below the fall rushin ' up stream like a racehorse wal we enter round lake cross it in five minute and down the river we rush over the little fall at a bind and into the lower saranac i would get a little used to it by this time and though it be mighty hard work to catch my breath in such a wind as we make by we flight yet i manage to sit up and look around I it be curious to see how the island on the lower saranac dance about and how the shore run away behind while i be look at 'em and how the forest tree dodge and whirl and jump about one another as we tear along after tearin ' about the lake a spell we come to something like a halt and old mossyback stick he head out of water and openin ' he great glassy eye like the moon in a mist ` how do you like that ' say he in a jeerin ' sort of way ` all right ' say i ` go it while you be young ' i do not care about appearin ' skeered or uneasy but i would have give a couple of month 's wages just then to have be on dry land ` well ' say he ' i guess we 'll be gittin ' towards home ' and away he start for the upper saranac and up the river across round lake and right up over the rapid we go two or three time i make up my mind that i be a goner as the water pile up around I along over the fall but somehow we very speed make we boat glance upward at such time and skim along the surface like a duck we go boundin ' from hillock to hillock on the mad water till we enter the broad lake and go skive about again among the island all at once he seem to take a notion to go down towards the bottom so shortenin ' the line some fifty foot or more he hoist he great tail straight up towards the sky and down he go the boat stand up on end and somehow the water do not seem to close above we so rapid be we descent it be tight work as you may guess to hold on under such circumstance but i manage to keep my place how deep we go i wont undertake to say but this much be quite sartin we go down so far that i could not see out at the hole we go in at there be some mighty big fish away down in they part you may bet you life on that trout that it would not be pleasant to handle by-and-bye we start for daylight again the fish have to stand out of the way as we rush like a express train towards the surface they that do not we make a smash of one bull head i remember about twice as long as one of we boat be not quick enough the bow of the boat strike he about in the middle and cut he in two like a knife one old trout seem to have make up he mind for a fight and he chase we more than two mile with he jaw open like a great pair of clamp as if he have a mind to swallow we boat and all and from the size of the openin ' i be bold to say he would a do it too if he would have catch we but as we round a island he run head foremost jam against a rock that kind o ' stun he and he give in wal after we get to the surface the trout that be towin ' I seem to let on a extra amount of steam for a mile or so and let I say the way we go be a caution i have travel on the car in my day when they make every thing gee again but that kind o ' goin ' be not a circumstance to the way we tear along the water rise up on either hand more than twenty foot and go roarin ' and tumblin ' and hissin ' as if everything be goin ' to smash all at once the line be throw loose and the boat go straight ahead bow on to one of the small island up towards the head of the lake and when she strike i go through the air eend over eend clear across the island more than fifteen rod ca-splash into the lake on the other side human nater could not stand all that so startin ' up i find that while i would be layin ' in the bottom of the boat the wind have ri and be blowin ' a stiff gale the boat have drift across the lake and have strike broadside agin the shore and the wave be makin ' a clean breach into she at every surge i soon get she head on to the wave and feelin ' something mighty lively at the other eend of the line haul in a twelve-pounder pshaw exclaim one of the audience you have only be tell a dream in this long yarn we have be listen to wal reply the narrator some people that i have tell it to have suspicion that it might be so but every thing about it seem so nateral that i be almost ready to make my affidavy that it be sober fact one thing however i always have my doubt about : i never fully believe that _ i be actually pitch over that island _ i have hearn it say that when a man have eat a hearty dinner and go to sleep with the hot sun pourin ' right down on he he be apt to see and hear a good many strange thing before he wake up may be it be so with I chapter vi the upper saranac -- spectacle pond -- the accusation and the defense -- a octogenarian smoker we spend the next day in rowing about the upper saranac explore its beautiful bay and island we take as many trout in trolling occasionally as we need for dinner and supper it become a established law among we that we should kill no more game or fish than we need for supplies whatever they abundance or we temptation might be it require some self-denial to observe this law but we keep it with tolerable strictness there be time when we have a large supply of both venison and fish but there be seven man of we in all and we could despose of a good deal of flesh and fish in the twenty-four hour we have send we boat with the luggage across the indian carry place a path of a mile through the forest to the spectacle pond three little lake from which a stream know as stony brook rise this stream be navigable for small boat like ours five mile to the rackett river these lake contain from a hundred to a hundred and fifty acre each at the head of the upper pond be a beautiful cold spring near which upon cross the carry place at evening we find we tent pitch we arrive here about sundown somewhat wearied with we day 's excursion and with appetite fully equal to a plentiful supper which be soon in readiness for we you be get I into a bad habit spoil my moral in a physical sense say smith address we as we sit after supper around we camp-fire i find myself take to the pipe out here in these old wood with a relish i never have at home it seem to agree with I here and i expect by the time i get back to civilization i shall be as great a smoker as the doctor or spalding if i do i shall have to pay for it by indigestion and hypochondria thing that you of the fat kine know nothing about well reply the doctor you will only have to call on I as you do last month and then send for spald to draw you will as you do the next day when you be as well as i be except that kink in you head about you go to die why the truth be retort smith i have make up my mind after twelve hour consideration to take the medicine you leave and i appeal to h -- here if it be after that anything more than a reasonable precaution to be prepare for any contingency that might happen you medicine doctor and the testamentary disposition of a man 's worldly effect be very natural association very well say the doctor you 'll send for I again in a month after we return and in that case it may be that the money you pay spald for draw you will will not have be throw away but in regard to the use of the pipe i propose that we call upon spald for a legal opinion or a argument in its favor it be he business to defend criminal and i file a accusation against smoking generally except however from the indictment the use of the pipe as in some sort a necessity on all such excursion as ours i shall not undertake say spalding to enter into a labored defense of the use of tobacco in any form i only move for a mitigation of punishment and will state the circumstance upon which i base my appeal to the clemency of the court the exception in the indictment enable I to avoid the plea of necessity which i should have interpose found upon a huge forest meal and the abundance as well as impertinence of the musquito of these wood i call the other day upon a venerable friend and client who be travel the down hill of life quietly and though with the present summer he will have accomplish he three score year and ten he voice be as cheerful and he heart as young as they be decade ago when he manhood be in the glory and strength of its prime i find he sit in he great arm-chair smoking he accustomed pipe read the evening papers he seem to be so calm and happy as the smoke go wreathe up from he lip that i could not for the moment refrain from envy the calmness and repose which be visible all around he he have smoke he morning and evening pipe in he quiet way for nearly half a century when engage in the active business of life struggle with its care and fight its battle he always take half a hour in the morning and as long at evening to smoke he pipe and read the news of the day he scarcely ever when at home under any pressure of circumstance omit these two half hour of repose or as he excellent wife use to say of ` fumigation ' she pass to she rest year ago leave behind she the pleasant odor of a good name a memory cherish by all who know she man denounce the use of tobacco and i do not quarrel with they for do so say that it be a vile and a filthy habit be it so i will not now stop to deny it say that it be bad for the constitution ruinous to the health be it so i will not gainsay it still i never see a old man seat in he great arm chair with he grandchild play around he smoke he pipe and enjoy its to he pleasant perfume its soothing influence without regard that same pipe as a institution which i would hardly be willing to banish entirely from the world there be a good deal of philosophy too in a pipe if one will but take the trouble to study it great subject for moralize much food for reflection and all this outside of the physical enjoyment the soothing influence of a quiet pipe when the day be draw to a close and its care require some gentle force to banish they away it do not weaken the power of think nor stultify the brain it quiet the nerve make a man look in charity upon the world and to judge with a chastened lenity the shortcoming of he neighbor it reconcile he to he lot and send he to he pillow or about he labor with a calm deliberate cheerfulness very desirable to those who come under the law that require people to earn they bread by the sweat of they brow i say there be a good deal of philosophy in a pipe and i repeat it who can see the smoke go wreathing and curl upward from he lip in all sort of fantastic shape spread out thinner and thinner till it fade away and be lose among the invisible thing of the air without say to himself ` such be the vision of youth such the hope the grand scheme of life loom up in beautiful distinctness before the mind 's eye grow fainter and fainter as life wear away and then disappear forever such be the thing of this life beautiful as they appear unsubstantial shadow all ' and then as the fire consume the weed exhaust itself upon the substance which feed it burn lower and lower till it go out for lack of aliment who will not be remind of life itself the animated form the body instinct with vitality change and change as time sweep along till the spirit that give it vigor and comeliness and power and beauty be call away and it become at last mere dust and ash and then again when the pipe itself fall from the tooth or the table or the mantel or the shelf -- as fall it surely will sooner or later -- and be break and the fragment be throw out of the window or sweep out at the door who can fail to see in this the type of life 's closing scene the body break by disease and death carry away and hide in the earth to remain among the useless rubbish of the past to be see no more forever yes yes there be a great deal of philosophy in a pipe if people will take pain to study it i have a pleasant time of it once or twice a year with a old gentleman live away in the country one whom memory call up from the dim and shadowy twilight of my earliest recollection as a tall stalwart man already the head of a family with little child around he those who be then little child have grow up to be man and woman and have drift away upon the current of life themselves father and mother with gray hair gather upon they head i visit this venerable philosopher in he hearty and green old age every summer i see he now in my mind 's eye sit under the spreading branch of the tree plant by himself half a century ago which cast they shadow upon the pleasant lawn in front of he dwelling -- discuss politics moral history religion philosophy -- recount anecdote of the early settlement of the county of which he be a pioneer and i see how calmly and deliberately he smoke while he call up old memory from the shadowy past discourse wisely of the present or speak prophetically of the future i see he last in July of the past year and he seem to have change in nothing he have not grow older in outward seem he heart be as warm and genial as it be long long ago and cheerfulness calm and chasten marked as it have for year the conversation of a man who feel that he mission in life be accomplish ` why ' say he address I as a new thought seem to strike he ` why _ you _ head be grow gray i never notice it before it be almost as white as mine well well ' he continue as he tap the thumb nail of he left hand with the inverted bowl of he pipe knock the ash from it as he speak ` well well it will not be long until we will have smoke we last pipe mine at least will soon be break but what of that seventy-eight year be a long time to live in this world i have have my share of life and of the good pertain to it and shall have no right to complain when my pipe be break and its ash scatter ' such be the philosophy of a almost octogenarian smoker i move for a suspension of sentence say smith spalding 's defense of the weed induce I to withdraw the indictment against it leave punishment only for the excessive use of it the motion be carry unanimously and by way of confirm the decision we all refill we pipe and smoked till the star look down in they brightness from the fathomless depths of the sky chapter vii kink -- dirty dog -- the bark dog that be find dead in the yard -- the dog that bark himself to death the hallucination of smith say spalding after we have settle the matter of the pipe and be enjoy a fresh pull at the weed as describe by the doctor remind I of a slight attack of fever which i have some month ago and from which i recover partly through the aid of the doctor 's medicine and partly through the kindness of a young friend of mine and of the strange ` kink ' as you call they which get into my head between the fever and the doctor 's opiate thing be strangely mix up the real and the unreal group and mingle in a manner that give to all the just proportion and appearance of sober actuality i remember they as distinctly and they make as deep and abide impression upon my mind as if i have see they all they be impressed as palpably and indelibly upon my memory now as any actual event of my life well say the doctor suppose you give we one of these ` kink ' while we pipe be be smoke out as a ` opiate ' to send we all to sleep be it understand then spald begin that i like dog in a general way they be plain deal honest trusty folk in the aggregate albeit there be what tom benton call ` dirty dog ' these however be mostly human canine dog that walk on two leg and wear clothes such cur i _ do not _ like but there be such and they may be see and hear bark and snarl and snap in they envy at honest people ' heel every day let they bark mr benton be right they be ` dirty dog ' but a dog that look you honestly and frankly in the face that stand by he master and friend in all time of trial in sorrow as in joy in adversity as in prosperity in dark day as in bright day always cheerful always sincere earnest and truthful and so that he kindness be meet always happy i like he be you true nobility of nature below the human but there _ be _ ` cur of low degree ' dog of neither genial instinct nor breed senseless animal that belie the noble nature of they species be live libel upon they kind there be one of these over against my room at the time of the sickness i speak of i say _ be _ for thanks to the fate he be among the thing that have be he belong to history have be wipe out he be a bark dog when the moon be in the sky he bark at the moon when only the star shine out he bark at the star when cloud shut in both moon and star he bark at the cloud and when the darkness be so deep and black as to obscure even the cloud he bark at the darkness through all the long night he bark bark bark it be not a bark of defiance nor of alarm nor of astonishment nor of warn it be not a note of danger break the hush of midnight say that thief be abroad that murder be on its stealthy mission or that the wolf be on the walk it be a senseless monotonous idiotic bow wow nothing more nothing less all Monday night as i lay toss upon a bed of pain when fever be course through my vein and every pulse go plunge like a steam engine from the gorge heart to every extremity and my brain be like molten lead i hear that terrible bark it be my evil genius my destiny it mingle in every feverish dream become the embodiment of every vision i measure the period of its recurrence by the clock that stand in the corner of we room i count the ticking of its silence and i count the ticking of its continuance every swing of the pendulum become a distinct period of existence minute hour be nothing forty-four ticking i say and that bow wow will be hear again fifteen ticking i say and it will cease and so i go on until the hour seem to spread out into a boundless ocean of time that dog somehow become mix up with that old family clock that stand in the corner i hear he scratch and climb up among the weight writhe and twist he way among the machinery till there look out through the face of that old family clock distinct and palpable as the sun at noonday or the moon in a cloudless night i see the ogre head of that dog he great glassy fishy eye he half droop half erect ear he slaver jaw and as he gaze in a stupid meaningless stare upon I utter he everlasting bow wow tell I that the room be dark that not a ray of light penetrate the closed door or the curtained window what of that that dog 's head i repeat be there i see it if i ever see the sun the moon or the bright star i see it stare at I through all the gloom all the thick darkness and i hear its terrible bow wow ` get out ' i shout in horror ` what be the matter ' cry my wife spring up in a ecstasy of terror ` drive out that dog ' i reply ` what dog ' she inquire ` there ' i reply ` that dog there in the clock with he great stare glassy eye drive he out ' she light the gas and as it flash up there stand the old clock the pendulum swing back and forth the tick go on and its white old-fashioned face look out in calm serenity but the dog be go it be all natural as life the lighting of the gas have frighten the cur back to he yard and as the forty-fourth tick cease he bow wow be hear again and it last while the pendulum swing back and forth just fifteen time i take a cooling draft and count in feverish agony forty-four and fifteen till the daylight come creep in at the window fill with sepulchral greyness the room the bark cease and i sleep only to dream of snarl cur and ` dirty dog ' for a hour through all Tuesday i lay toss with pain fever be in every pulse my brain be seething burning lava i think and dream of nothing but mangy cur and ` dirty dog ' the night gather again and the rumble of the carriage and the thousand voice that break the stillness of a thronged city die away into silence the light be extinguish but again that horrible bark bark break the hush of midnight and worse than all the quicken sens of fever hear it answer from away over on arbor hill and again away up in state street and yet again over in lydius and still again away down by the river the east the north the west and the south have a voice and it be all concentrate in a ceaseless senseless idiotic bark i count again the ticking of the clock and each swing of the pendulum end in a bark as i lay there in the silence and desolation the restless toss anguish of fever those dog gather together in state at the cross of eagle just above my boarding-house and bark they come under my window and bark they look in between the curtain and bark they come into my room and there on the sofa on the rocking-chair on the table on the mantelpiece on the ottoman on the stove and on the top of the old clock be a dog and each bark and bark i see they all through the darkness plain as if it be noonday they be ` dirty dog ' filthy brute ill-favored mangy cur all and there they sit and bark at the clock bark at the mirror at the stove bark at one another and at I with the same monotonous meaningless idiotic bow wow as of old i have two rifle and a double-barrelled fowling-piece sit in the corner of the parlor adjoining we sleeping-room the gift of value friend my wife weary with the day 's watch have sink into slumber on the bed beside I i wake she gently ` make no noise ' i say ` but bring I the gun do it carefully ' ` what on earth do you want of the gun ' she inquire in alarm ` do not you see those infernal dog ' i answer ` bring I the gun and i 'll make short work with the howling cur ' ` why husband ' say she ` there be no dog here ' and as she light the gas the curs vanish away but i see they in the darkness it be only when the light flash through the room that they flee from it and i hear they bark in response to each other through all the long night till the dawn creep over the world again year ago i save a boy from the mesh of the law in which he evil way have involve he i admonish he of the end towards which he be hasten i show he that the path he be tread lead to destruction and he leave it as he say forever he apprentice himself to a useful trade and be now a intelligent mechanic out of he time a industrious sober youth of two and twenty support by he industry he mother and sister in comfort and respectability he hear of my sickness and on Wednesday morning call to see I proffer he service as a nurse and watchman prompt by gratitude for the past i decline he kindness for the present as i tell he casually of the dog whose midnight bark be kill I he call again on Thursday morning the bark have cease he inquire if i have be trouble with the yelping of that senseless cur and i answer truly that i have not that i have sleep soundly and wake with a softened pulse and a cool brain ` well ' say he ' i think you would rest easier i look into the yard as i come along and see a dead dog lie there i thought may be he have bark himself to death ' i do not at the time take in the full mean the hidden import of he word i drop away into slumber and dream of the dog that bark himself to death i see he vanish by piecemeal at each successive bark until nothing but he jaw be leave and as he last bark be utter these too vanish away and then all be still i awake and think that a dose of ` dog-button ' or a taste of strychnine administer with a tempting bit of cold steak or a piece of fresh lamb or a bone of mutton carefully drop in he way might have aid the operation be that as it may whatever of debt may have exist between my young friend and myself for past kind it be all wipe out by the news he bring I that a ` dead dog lay in the yard over the way ' chapter viii stony brook -- a good time with the trout -- rackett river -- tupper 's lake -- a question ask and answer the next morning we start down stony brook towards the rackett river intend to pitch we tent at night on the bank of tupper 's lake twenty-three mile distant before leave the spectacle pond we visit a little island at the north end of the middle pond contain perhaps half a acre this island have a few norway pine upon it be of a loose sandy soil and at the highest portion be some twenty foot above the level of the water it be a great resort for turtle in the season of deposit they egg we find thousand of they egg some on the surface and some bury in the sand and if one in a dozen of they bring forth a turtle there will be no lack of the animal in the neighborhood stony brook be a sluggish tortuous stream large enough to float we little boat and go meander most of the way for five mile among natural meadow overflow at high water or thinly timbered prairie when it enter the rackett i discover on a former visit to this wilderness when the water be very low a spring that come boil up near the center of the stream with a volume large enough almost to carry a mill it be at a point where a high sandy bluff along which the stream sweep terminate as we approach this spot i suggest to spalding who be in the bow of the boat to prepare he rod and fly we approach carefully along the willow on the opposite shore until in a position from which he could throw in the direction i indicate in the then stage of the water there be no appearance of a spring or any indication mark it as a spot where the trout would be at all likely to congregate and spalding be half inclined to believe that i be practise upon he want of knowledge of the habit of the fish of this region i have say nothing about the spring or the habit of the trout in gather wherever a cold stream enter a river or a spring come gush up in its bed i do not believe there be a trout within half a mile of we he say as he adjust he rod and fly never mind i reply throw you fly across towards that boulder on the bank and trail it home and you 'll see well say he here go and he throw in the direction indicate the fly have scarcely touch the water when a trout weigh a pound or over strike it with a rush that carry he clear out of the water after a little play he be land safely in the boat and another and another follow at almost every throw not once do the fly touch the water that it be not rise to by a fish by jove say spalding as he hand I the landing-net to take in he third or fourth trout this be sport you use the net and i 'll trail they to you let we make hay while the sun shine the other boat will soon be along and smith will be for dip he spoon into my dish i want to astonish he when he come we have secure eight beautiful fish when the doctor and smith round the point above we we motion they back and they boat lay upon its oar spald keep on throw he fly and trail the trout to I to secure with the landing-net hallo shout smith hold on there fair play my friend give I a hand in and he fall to adjust he rod and fly keep back you lubber reply spalding what do _ you _ know about trout-fishing you 'll frighten they all away by you awkwardness no you do not shout smith he rod now adjusted drop down boatman and we 'll see who be the lubber wait spalding do not throw if you be a true man until we can take a fair start and then the one that come out second best pay the piper the boat drop down to the proper position and the doctor who be seat in the stern hold it in place by press he paddle into the sand at the bottom while the boatman handle the landing net now exclaim smith as the fly drop upon the water together above the cold spring there be no lack of trout for one rise to the fly at every cast i say say the doctor how many have you in you boat sixteen i reply after count they we have get eight and i bar any more fishing the law have reach its limit no wanton waste of the good thing of god you know the rod be unjointed and lay away and such a string of trout as we have be rarely see outside of the saranac wood we procure fresh grass in which to lay we fish and green bough to cover they and float on down the stream enter the rackett at nine o'clock the rackett be a most beautiful river to I at least it be so for it flow on its tortuous and wind way for a hundred or more mile through a unbroken forest with all the old thing stand in they primeval grandeur along its bank the woodman 's axe have not mar the loveliness of its surroundings and no human hand have for all that distance be lay upon its mane or harness it to the great wheel make it a slave compelling it to be utilitarian to grind corn or throw the shuttle and spin it move on towards the mighty st lawrence as wild and halterless and free as when the great spirit send it forward on its everlasting flow the same scenery and the same voice be see and hear along its bank now as then and while man in he restlessness have change almost everything else the rackett and the thing that pertain to it when the earth be young remain unchanged but this will not be so long civilization be push its way even towards this wild and for all agricultural purpose sterile region and before many year even the rackett will be within its ever-extending circle when that time shall have arrive where shall we go to find the wood the wild thing the old forest and hear the sound which belong to nature in its primeval state whither shall we flee from civilization to take off the harness and be free for a season from the restraint the conventionality of society and rest from the hard struggle the care and toil the strife and competition of life have i my way i would mark out a circle of a hundred mile in diameter and throw around it the protect aegis of the constitution i would make it a forest forever it should be a misdemeanor to chop down a tree and a felony to clear a acre within its boundary the old wood should stand here always as god make they grow on until the earthworm eat away they root and the strong wind hurl they to the ground and new wood should be permit to supply the place of the old so long as the earth remain there be room enough for civilization in region better fit for it it have no business among these mountain these river and lake these gigantic boulder these tangled valley and dark mountain gorge let it go where labor will garner a richer harvest and industry reap a better reward for its toil it will be of stinted growth at best here i like these old wood say a gentleman whom i meet on the rackett last year i like they because one can do here just what he please he can wear a shirt a week have hole in he pantaloons and be out at elbow go with he boot unblacked drink whisky in the raw chew plug tobacco and smoke a black pipe and not lose he position in society now continue he tho ' i do not choose to do any of these thing yet i love the freedom now and then of do just all of they if i choose without human accountability the truth be that it be natural as well as necessary for every man to be a vagabond occasionally to throw off the restraint impose upon he by the necessity and conventionality of civilization and turn savage for a season -- and what place be leave for such transformation save these northern forest the idea be somewhat quaint but to I it smack of philosophy and i yield it a hearty assent i would consecrate these old forest these river and lake these mountain and valley to the vagabond spirit and make they a place wherein a man could turn savage and rest for a fortnight or a month from the toil and care of life we enter tupper 's lake towards six o'clock and see we white tent pitch upon the left bank some half a mile above the outlet where a little stream cold almost as icewater come down from a spring a short way back in the forest this lake some ten mile long and from one to three in width be one of the most beautiful sheet of water that the eye of man ever look upon the scenery about it be less bold than that of some of the other lake of this region the hill rise with a gentle acclivity from the shore behind they and far off rise rugged mountain range and further still the lofty peak of the adirondack loom up in dim and shadowy outline against the sky from every point and in every direction be view of placid and quiet beauty rarely equal valley stretch away among the highland gap in the hill through which the sunlight pour long after the shadow of the forest have elsewhere throw themselves across the lake island some bold and rocky rise in barren desolation right up from the deep water some cover with a dense and thrifty growth of evergreen tree with a soil matchless in fertility and some partaking of both the sterile and productive beautiful bay steal around bold promontory and hide away among the old wood these be the feature of this beautiful sheet of water which none see but to admire none visit but to praise and it lie here all alone surround by the old hill and forest bold bluff and rocky shore all as god make they with no mark of the hand of man about it save in a single spot on a secluded bay where live a solitary family in a log house surround by a acre or two from which the forest have be clear away will somebody tell I say smith as we sit on the log in front of we tent after supper smudge away the musquito with we pipe will somebody tell I what we come into this wilderness among these musquito and frog and owl for mind you i be not discontented i enjoy it hugely but what i want to know be _ why _ i do so i desire to understand the philosophy of the thing as the question involve in some sense a physiological fact reply the doctor it come within the range of my professional duty to understand and be able to answer it for you must know that the enjoyment of this region be primarily physical now i have a theory which be this -- that every man have a certain amount of vagabondism in he composition that will be pretty certain to break out in spot occasionally at all event it be so with I and from my observation of man i be strong in the faith that it be so with every one who be neither more nor less than human it be all a mistake to suppose that i come off here endure a heap of hardship and toil simply for the love of fishing and hunting though i confess to a weakness to a certain extent that way the charm of this region consist in the fact that it be the best place to play the vagabond and in which to do the savage for a season that i know of you can go bareheaded or barefoot without a coat or neckerchief get as ragged and untidy as you please without subject yourself to remark or offend the nice sense of propriety pertain to conventional life you be not responsible for what you say or do provide always that you do not offend against the abstract rule of decency or the requirement of natural decorum you can lay around loose the lazier you be the better the boatman in you employ like it if you choose to drift leisurely and quietly under the shadow of the hill along the shore examine the rock that lie there like a ruin wall or explore the beautiful and secluded bay that hide around behind the bluff or lay off under the shade of the fir tree on the island or smoke you cigar or pipe by the beautiful spring that come bubble up by the side of some moss-covered boulder or from beneath the tangled root of some gnarled birch or maple you can do any or all of these and have a man to help you for twelve shilling a day and board or you can do it just about as well alone you remember lonesome rock in the lower saranac a great boulder that lift its head some ten or fifteen foot above the surface away out near the middle of the lake around which the water be of unknown depth this rock which be always dark and bare be as you will remember of conical shape sharp pointed at the top and stand up about the size of a small hay-stack in the midst of the water do you remember the account that somebody give in a ragged but terse kind of verse of the ` gentleman in black ' who as he walk about ` backward and forward he switch he long rail as a gentleman switch he cane ' and of whose dress it be facetiously say : ` he coat be red and he breeches be blue with a hole behind for he tail to stick through ' another author say of he on one of he fishing excursion that ` he rod it be a sturdy mountain oak he line a cable which no storm e'er break he hook he bait with a dragon 's tail and sit upon a rock and bob would for whale ' well like the ebony gentleman you can if you choose sit upon lonesome rock enjoy you meditation and bob not for whale for whatever other fish may be find in the lower saranac i believe there be no whale but you can bob for trout whether you will catch any or not will depend very much on circumstance it be a capital place to cast the fly from or to sink you hook with a bait and if the trout do not choose to bite whose fault be that i should like to know and this remind I of a anecdote tell I by a gentleman i meet in June of last year on the rackett river among the black fly of a adventure he meet with on lonesome rock last season he have be troll around the lake in a boat alone without much success and conclude he would try deep fishing from this rock as he have hear that the trout be in the habit of congregate around its base so he row to the rock and as he suppose secure he boat and climb up its side seat himself on he boat cushion on the top he catch one fine fish at the first throw and take it for grant that he be go to have a good time of it among the trout when he mount the rock about eleven o'clock the sky be overcast and he catch three or four trout of good size in the course of half a hour but the sun come out bright and clear the fish alter they mind and refuse to have anything more to do with he hook he finally conclude to give up the business and seek the cooling shadow of the forest tree along the shore but he boat be go and upon look around he see it drift before a light breeze a quarter of a mile distant now when you remember that all around the lake be a wilderness save a single spot at the head of the bay where martin 's house stand three or four mile distant and when you remember also that no boat might be pass during the next twenty-four hour you will comprehend that he position be none of the pleasantest there he sit upon the top of he rock with scarcely room to turn around with a wide sweep of deep water between he and the nearest land the fish utterly refuse to bite and the sun blaze down upon he with heat like a furnace as it creep with its snail 's pace across the sky at first he be incline to smile at he ridiculous situation all alone there on the rock but as the wind die away and the sun pour he burning ray right down upon he and he pant and sweat under its sweltering influence he begin to feel a little more serious hour glide away and the sun creep slowly along down the heaven but still no boat make its appearance the sun hide itself behind the hill on the west and still he be alone the shadow creep up the mountain peak that stand up like grim giant away off in the east and twilight begin to throw its gray mantle over the lake still he be alone the darkness begin to gather around he the forest along the shore to lose they distinctness and to stand in sombre and shadowy outline above the water still no prospect of relief present itself the twilight fade from the west the star steal out in the heaven the milky way stretch its belt of light across the sky and there he sit alone still on he rock the night dew fall around he and the night voice of the forest come solemnly out over the water thing have now assume a serious aspect he could not stretch he limb save by stand erect and it seem inevitable that he must watch the star during the night as he have watch the sun during the day to sleep there be out of the question there be no room for a sleep posture and the danger of roll down the rock into the water keep he wide awake at length the pleasant sound of oar and voice in jolly converse fall upon he ear and he shout two sportsman be return from the upper lake and right welcome be the answer they return to he call he be glad enough to be release from he rock upon which as he say ` he have make up he mind that he should be compel to roost like a turkey on the ridge of a barn for the night ' to go back from this digression continue the doctor i repeat that every man have a vein of the vagabond a streak of the savage in he which can never be clean wipe out educate he polish he as you may it will be in he still and he will love to go off into the old wood at time to lay around loose for a season vagabondising among the wild and savage thing of the wilderness it be but indulge the original instinct of we nature true he will not relish he savage way a great while he old habit will lead he back to civilization to the luxury of a well-furnished room the quiet of a easy chair and the repose of a soft bed in a word to ` clean up ' and shave and dress so that when he look into a glass he will see the shadow of a gentleman chapter ix hunting by torch light -- a incompetent judge -- a new sound in the forest -- old sangamo 's donkey spalding and martin go out upon the lake after dark with one of the boat to hunt by torch light this be do by place a light torch or a lamp upon a standard place upright in the bow of the boat and so high that a man seat or lie upon the bottom of the craft will have he head below it he must himself be in someway shaded from the light which must be cast forward so that both the hunter and the boatman will be in the shadow a very common method be to make a box a foot or less square open or with a pane of glass on one side a stick three or four foot long be run through a auger hole in the top and bottom and wedge fast which form a standard the other end of the stick be run through a hole on the little deck on the forward part of the boat and place in a socket form for the purpose in the bottom and be wedge at the deck so as to make it steady the open or glass front of the box be turn forward and a common japan lamp place in a socket prepare for it in the box this of course throw the light forward while the occupant of the boat be in the shadow the hunter sit or more commonly lie at length on a bed of bough in the bottom of the boat with he rifle so far in front that the light will fall upon the forward sight a experienced boatman will paddle silently up to within twenty foot of a deer that may be feed along the shore the stupid animal will stand gaze in astonishment at the light until the boat almost touch he that hank martin say cullen one of the boatman as the hunter disappear into the darkness be a queer boy in he way you will notice that when he straighten up and take the kink out of he he stand six foot and over in he stocking and he arm hang down to he knee he be the strongest man in these wood and tolerably active when there be occasion for it he be a droll good-natured easy temper chap and do not get angry at trifle he be fond of a joke himself and will stand have a good many stick poke at he without get rile but when he do get he back up it be well enough to stand out of he way and not step on he shadow he never strike a man but once in real earnest and that be over in keeseville and on that occasion the people say the town clock have strike _ one _ the fellow he strike go eend over eend and then go down and when he go down he lay still -- he do not come to tine but what i be go to tell you be that hank and i be down at plattsburgh last fall and a big fellow who have take quite as much red eye as be for he good undertake to pick a quarrel with hank and give he a beat hank as i say be a peaceable man and much more give to fun than to fight keep good-natured and avoid a scrimmage as long as he could but he patience and he temper at last cave in and seize he opponent by the neck with he left hand and thrust he down upon the ground he begin very deliberately to cuff he with he right in a way that seem anything but pleasant to the individual upon whom he cuff be bestow ` enough enough ' cry he assailant ` let up enough enough ' ` hold you tongue you scoundrel ' reply hank as he keep on pommel he enemy ` hold you tongue i tell you you be not a judge of these thing i 'll let you know when you have get enough ' when he would give he what he think be about right he lift he on to he foot and hold he up face to face with himself a moment ` there ' say he ` look at I well so that you 'll know I when i come this way again and when you see my trail you would better travel some other road ' speaking of plattsburgh say the doctor remind I of a incident which occur to a friend and myself over in the chataugay wood between the chazy and the upper chataugay lake i be spend a few day at plattsburgh and hear a good deal of the trout and deer in and about those lake my friend and myself conclude to pay they a fly visit on the bank of the chazy and near the outlet a half-breed that be half french and half indian have build he a log cabin and clear about a acre of land around it he live stock consist of two homely lean and half-starved dog and as ragged and ill-looking a donkey as could be find in a week 's travel the half-breed be a sort of half fisherman and half hunter excel in nothing unless it be that he be the laziest man this side of the rocky mountain he succeed occasionally in kill a deer in the forest and when he do so he would lead he donkey to the place of slaughter and bring in the carcase on the long-eared animal 's back we be pass from the chazy to bradley 's lake and have sit down on the trunk of a fall tree to take a short breathing spell it be a warm afternoon and the air be calm not a breath stir the leaf on the old tree around we the forest sound be hushed save the tap of the woodpecker on he hollow tree or a occasional drum of a partridge on he log it be draw towards one of those calm still autumnal evening of which poet sing but which be to be meet with in all they glory only among the beautiful lake that lay sleep in the wild wood and surround by old primeval thing the path wound round a densely wood and sombre hollow the depths of which the eye could not penetrate but from out of which come the song of a stream that go cascade down the rock and ripple among the loose boulder that lay in its course beyond we through a opening in the tree we could see the lake sparkling and shine in the evening sunbeam and we be talk about the beauty of the view and the calmness and repose that seem rest upon all thing when of a sudden there come up from that shadowy dell a sound the most unearthly that ever break upon the astonished ear of mortal man i have hear the roar of the lion of the desert the yell of the hyena the trumpet of the elephant the scream of the panther the howl of the wolf it be like none of these but if you could imagine they all combine and concentrate into a single sound and usher together upon the air from a single throat shape like the long neck of some gigantic ichthiosaurus of the time of old you would have some faint idea of the strange sound that come roar up from that hollow way my friend be a man of courage and like myself have be around the world some have spend a good deal of time first and last in the wood be familiar with most of the legitimate forest sound and have hear all the ten thousand voice that belong in the wilderness but we have never before listen to a noise like that we look to we rifle and at one another and it may well be that we hat sit somewhat loosely upon we head from a involuntary rising of the hair ` what in the name of all that be mysterious ' cry my friend in amazement ` be that ' ` it be more than i know ' i reply as i place a fresh cap on my rifle after a few minute the sound be repeat and the hill seem to groan with affright as they send they back in wavy and quaver echo from they rugged side ` we must understand this ' say my friend as he lead the way with a cautious and stealthy movement towards the depths of the hollow whence the sound come and there by the stream on a little sand-bar stand old sangamo 's donkey by the side of a deer old sangamo himself be stretch at full length on the bank fast asleep how he could have sleep on with such a infernal roaring as that donkey make in those old wood six or eight mile outside of a fence be more than i can comprehend but he do sleep through it all and be waken only by a punch in the rib with the butt of my rifle instigate by pity for the poor donkey that be be eat up by the fly we help he to load the carcass of the deer on the back of he donkey and see he move off lazily towards home i have hear a good many strange noise in my day but never on any other occasion have i listen to anything to be at all compare with the noise make by the bray of old sangamo 's donkey in the chataugay wood as the doctor conclude he story the sharp crack of spalding 's rifle break the stillness of the night and go reverberate among the hill and die away over the lake it be but a short distance from we camp in a little bay hide away around a wooded promontory below we in a few minute the light be see round the point that hide the bay from we view and as the boat land in front of we tent spalding and martin lift from it a fine two year old deer shoot directly between the eye -lrb- illustration : how he could have sleep on with such a infernal roaring as that donkey make in those old wood six or eight mile outside of a fence be more than i can comprehend -- -rrb- there say spalding be the biggest or what _ be _ the biggest fool of a deer in these wood do you believe that he stand perfectly still gaze in stupid astonishment at we light until we be within a dozen foot of he when i drop he with that ball between the eye no reply smith i really do not believe any such thing it be true notwithstanding you lack of faith say spalding do you say that as counsel or as a gentleman inquire smith look you mr smith say spalding you be draw a distinction not warrant by the authority of the book -- as if a lawyer could not tell the truth like a gentleman i say it as both very well remark smith then i must believe it of course but understand hank martin it will be my turn to-morrow night and so the matter be settle that the next night hunting be to be do by smith h -- say the doctor as i be steal quietly out of the tent in the twilight of the next morning so as not to awaken my companion where now i be go to take some trout for breakfast with we venison i reply and where do you propose to take they he inquire come with I and i 'll show you i look the place out last evening and if you have do sleep we 'll have some sport agree say he and we paddle around the point into a little bay at the head of which a small but cold stream enter the lake the doctor sit in the bow and have adjust he rod i steer the boat carefully close along the shore to within reach of the mouth of the brook and direct he to cast across it the moment he fly touch the water half a dozen fish rise to it together it be eagerly seize by one weigh less than a quarter of a pound which be lift bodily into the boat he catch as fast as he could cast he fly they be the genuine brook trout none of they exceed a quarter of a pound in weight in half a hour we have secure as many as we need for breakfast and paddle back to take a morning nap while the meal be be prepare the sweetest fish that swim be the brook trout weigh from a quarter of a pound down roll in flour or meal and fry brown they have no equal the lake and river trout weigh from two to ten pound beautiful as they be have not that delicacy of flavor which belong to the genuine brook trout boil when freshly catch they be by no means to be speak lightly of they have few equal cook in that way but as a pan fish they be not to be compare with the genuine brook trout chapter x grindstone brook -- forest sound -- a funny tree cover with snow flake we cross over towards a deep bay on the west shore to where a stream come cascade down the rock and leap into the lake as if rejoice at find a resting-place in its quiet bosom the spot where this stream enter be in the deep shadow of the old forest tree that reach they leafy arm far out from the ledge on which they grow form a arch above and shut out the sunlight here the trout congregate to enjoy the cool water that come down from the hill above we approach it carefully and smith by way of experiment cast he fly across the current where the stream enter the lake it be seize by a beautiful fish weigh perhaps two pound we do not need he for the place where we propose to pitch we tent for the night would afford we all the fish require and after lift he into the boat with the landing-net and release the hook from he jaw we return he to the lake again two mile from the head of the lake on the east side be a deep bay at the head of which enter a little brook that come creep along for a mile among the tangled root of ancient hemlock and spruce singing gaily among the loose stone sometimes disappear entirely beneath bridge of moss and sometimes sparkling in the sunlight on its way to the lake this little stream we find swarm with speckled trout of the size of minnow and at its mouth the large trout congregate as we round one of the point that shut out the view of this bay from the lake we see two deer feed quietly upon the lily pad along the shore some quarter of a mile from we we drop quietly back behind the point where smith and one of the boatman prepare to take a shot at they martin take he seat in the stern with he paddle and smith lay stretch at length along the bottom of the boat upon bough prepare for the occasion with he rifle rest upon the forward end of the boat it be broad daylight and to paddle up within shooting distance of a deer under such circumstance in plain view of a animal the most wary be a delicate job but it may be do i have more than once be thus paddle within thirty yard of a deer while feed in the water the wind must be blow from the deer to the hunter or the scent will alarm the animal and he will go snort and bound away smith and martin pass silently out into the bay and move slowly towards where the deer be feed the boat in which we sit be permit to float out to a position from which we could see the sportsman as they approach the game slowly but steadily they move the paddle remain in the water scull the little craft along as if it be a log drift in the water the deer occasionally raise they head look all around evidently regard the boat as a harmless thing float in from the lake after gaze thus about they they stoop they head again and go on feeding as if no danger be near they the hunter drift within seventy or eighty yard of the game when a column of white smoke shot suddenly up from the bow of the boat and the report of smith 's rifle ring out sharp and clear over the lake we see where the ball strike the water just beyond the deer pass directly under its belly possibly high enough to graze its body at the flash and report of the rifle the animal leap high into the air bound in affright this way and that for a moment and then straighten itself for the wood we hear he snort as he go crash up the hillside reader should you ever drift out to this beautiful lake you will find on the ridge just above where bog river come tumble and roar and foam over the rock into the lake the char remains of a campfire build against a great log that be once the trunk of a tall forest tree if you should visit it within a year or two you will perhaps notice some fork stake stand a few foot from the place of the fire and a bed of withered and dry bough -lrb- now fresh and green -rrb- well we tent be stretch over those stake those bough be we bed and those char chunk be the remains of we campfire that send a sepulchral light among the forest tree around the sound that come upon the ear during the night in a far off place like this be peculiar the old owl hoot mournfully the frog bellow hoarsely along the reedy shore while the tree toad be quaver from among the branch of the scrubby tree that grow along the rocky bank the whippoorwill pipe shrilly in the forest depth the breeze murmur among the foliage of the tall old pine while the everlasting roar of the water as they go tumble down the rock be always hear however diversify these sound may be they all invite to repose they fall soothingly upon the ear and though all be distinctly hear yet strange as it may seem there be a strong impression upon the mind of the deep silence pervade the forest this impression be doubtless occasion by the utter dissimilarity between the voice one hear in the day from those which fall upon the ear in the night time the former be all joyous and happy full of gladness and merriment full of life and animation the latter solemn deep profound lulling to the sens not sorrowful nor sad yet still such as form a calm and quiet lullaby under the influence of which one glide away into slumber and sleep quietly until dawn then the voice of gladness break so tumultuously on the ear that he must be a sluggard indeed who can resist they waken influence how beautifully the sun go down behind the hill light up the western sky and the fleecy cloud float in the heaven with a blaze of glory throw a mantle of silver over the tall range and mountain peak that loom up in solemn grandeur away in the east and how stilly silently the star come out from the depths above and how brightly and truthfully they be give back from away down in depths beneath the placid water we have take half a dozen beautiful trout from the foot of the fall where the current shoot out into the lake we have eat they too and be sit in front of we tent smoke we evening pipe spald say the doctor how i wish we little boy be out here with we how they would enjoy themselves among these lake and river it be a hard lot that the child of we city have in life they struggle up to man and womanhood against fearful odds and the wonder be that they do not perish in they infancy that they be not blast as the blossom be when the cold east wind sweep over the earth you be right my friend reply spalding i should like to have we little boy and girl too for that matter with we for a few day out here on these lake it would be a lifetime to they measure time by the enjoyment it would afford they still they city habit might make they tire of this freedom in a week you and i enjoy it longer because it bring back old memory and relieve we from the toil of business and the restraint of conventional life you be right too in say that the lot of we city child be a hard one to live imprison between long row of brick wall breathe a atmosphere charge with the exhalation of ten thousand cooking stove the dust of forge and the smoke of furnace machine shop gas work filthy street and the thousand other manufactory of villainous smell where the summer air have no freshness no forest odor or sweetness gather from field of grain the meadow or the pasture to tramp only on stone sidewalk to know nothing of the pleasant path beneath the spreading branch of old primeval tree no soft grass for they little foot to press never to wander along the stream or the little brook to be stranger always to the beautiful thing spread out everywhere in the country in the summer time i always feel sad when i see the pale face of the little child of the great city and marvel how so many of they grow up to be man and woman it be a hard lot to be coop up in the city vegitate as it be in the shade where there be no grass for they little foot to press no fence to climb or field to ramble over or brook to wade or run water on which to float chip and wherein to watch the little chub and shiner dancing and play about or fresh pure air to breathe or bird to listen to it be a thousand pity that the city could not be empty every summer of they little people into the free and open country where they could run about and sport and play and have free range and plenty of elbow-room it would make they so much healthier and happier so much more cheerful they voice of gladness would ring out so much more joyously in the morning and they song be so much more sweet at night i remember a anecdote tell I of a little child bear in the great metropolis who have never until she fifth summer be outside of the paved street of new york she mother have friend reside in one of the up-river town own a beautiful farm overlook the hudson and in early may she pay they a visit take she little daughter with she mary of course be delighted like a bird free from its cage she fly about here there everywhere in-doors and out among the chicken and the pig the turkey and the lamb enjoy to the full the thousand new thing that she eye rest upon all around she and she young spirit in wild commotion under the brace influence of the country air mother mother she exclaim as she come dash into the parlor she beautiful curl float wildly over she shoulder and she bright eye wide open with wonder mother i mother come out here quick and see this funny tree all cover over with snow-flake and how sweet it smell all around it it be a plum tree in full blossom that little child have never see the beautiful spring blossom on the fruit tree i have no child of my own remark smith and therefore may not be regard as the best authority in regard to the manner of treat or rear child but i have often wonder at the very great mistake people sometimes make in regard to they there be parent who mean no wrong and yet who make no scruple of deceive they in reply to they simple questioning forget or regardless of the fact that a false answer to they innocent inquiry put in good faith and in the earnest pursuit of truth may plant a error in they mind which may take year of experience and often a painful amount of ridicule to eradicate i know a little boy year ago a thoughtful philosophic child who speculate in he simplicity upon what he see as great philosopher do in they wisdom upon the various phenomenon of nature he father have a great barn above which as be the fashion long ago perch upon a staff a few foot above the ridgepole be a weather-cock fashion out of a piece of board in the shape of a rooster ` father ' say the little boy one day ` what make that rooster always point he head one way when the cold wind blow and the other way when it be warm and pleasant ' ` he always look towards the place where the wind come from ' reply the father ` when he get too warm and the sun be too hot for he he turn he tail to the south and the north wind be sure to come down cold and chill to cool he off ' ` do he call the cold wind father and will it come when he look that way ' be the next inquiry ` certainly ' reply he father carelessly that be a wrong and a foolish answer that little boy rely in he simple faith upon the wisdom and truthfulness of he father believe for a long time that the weathercock on the top of the barn could bring the cold north or the warm south wind by turn upon its perch he be cure of he error only by be laugh at for he simplicity parent should never deceive they child by a careless or a wrong answer to the simple question put to they by these little searcher after knowledge i remember say the doctor and it be one of the earliest incident which my recollection have treasured that i be out one evening in autumn with a boy older than myself gather hazel nut the sun have sink behind the hill and the shadow of twilight be gather in the valley it be a beautiful and calm evening the solemn stillness of which be only break by the ` tza tza ' of thousand of katydid among the bush i ask my companion what it be that make the noise i hear and he suppose that i refer to sound that come up occasionally from the lake after listen for a moment answer that it be make by the wild goose in my simplicity i believe it and it be not until i catch the next season a katydid while it be in the act of singing that i discover that the music among the hazel bush be not make by the wild goose i never respect a man or woman say spalding whose heart do not warm towards little child who take no pleasure nor interest in they society who have no patience to listen to they simple thought express in they simple way ` mother ' say a little child of four or five year of age one evening when the summer air be warm and the sky be bright above as she sit beside she mother on a bench beneath the spreading branch of the tall old elm in front of the house ` mother what make the star come out only after the dark have come down and why do not the moon go up into the sky like the sun in the day time ' i listen anxiously for the reply i know the kind heart of that mother how truthful it be and how earnest and pure in its affection for its gentle and only darling ` sit here upon my lap mary ' say the mother ` and i will try and explain it all so that you will understand it ' and she tell the little child how god make the sun to rule the day and the moon and the star to rule the night how that the star be always in the sky but how the superior brightness of the sun put they out in the day time how the star that twinkle like little rush-light in the heaven be great world a thousand time larger than this earth make and place away up in the sky by the same great and good god who make the world we live in little mary be silent and attentive to the simple lecture until it be finish and then ask so simply and confidingly that i could not help smile to think that the mind of childhood should be run upon a subject and seek a solution of the same question which have puzzle the profoundest philosopher through all time : ` mother ' say the little one ` be there people in the moon and in the star they great world that look to we so like candle in the sky ' ` that question my child ' say the mother ' i can not answer ' ' i believe ' say the child that there _ be _ people in the moon and in all the star ' ` why ' ask she mother ` because i do not believe god would make such big and beautiful world without make people to live in they ' what more have the profoundest philosopher who ever live say to prove that those mighty world which be see in the heaven at night that be scatter all through the universe of god rolling forever on they everlasting round be people by live move sentient being chapter xi a convention break up in a bow -- the chairman eject we send forward we boatman with the luggage early in the morning up bog river towards mud lake the source of the right branch of that river lie some thirty mile deeper in the wilderness count the sinuosity of the stream and say to be the highest body of water in all this wild region we be to spend the day on tupper 's lake and follow he the next morning we boatman build for we accommodation a brush shanty in the place of we tent we row about this beautiful sheet of water explore its secluded bay and romantic island try experiment with the trout wherever a stream come down from the hill and troll for lake trout while cross the lake near the shore on the west bank perhaps half a mile from the fall be one of the coldest purest and most beautiful spring that i ever meet with it come up into a little basin some six or eight foot in diameter by two or three in depth the bottom be of loose white sand which be all in commotion by the constant boil up of the clear cold water from this basin a little stream go ripple and laugh to the lake towards evening we return to we shanty with abundance of fish for supper and breakfast take as i say in simply try experiment as to where they be to be find in the greatest abundance if any sportsman who may drift out this way be fond of take the speckled trout -- little fellow weigh from a quarter of a pound down the same he meet with in the stream of vermont in massachusett in northern pennsylvanium and western new york let he provide himself with angle-worm and row to the head of the lake a short distance east of where bog river enter say from a quarter to half a mile he will find a cold mountain stream let he rig for brook-fishing and take to that stream if he do not fill he basket in a little while he may set it down to the score of bad luck or some lack of skill on he part in take they for the brook trout be there in abundance across the lake from long island to the right as you go up the lake be a bay that go away in around a woody point at the head of this bay grindstone brook enter it be a smallish stream and come dash down over shelve rock some thirty foot and shoot out into the bay among broken rock and loose boulder the water of this stream be much colder than those of the lake let the sportsman row carefully up towards the mouth of this stream along towards evening of a hot day when the shadow of the hill reach far out over the lake and cast he fly across the little current and if he do not take as beautiful a string of river trout as can be find in these part let he set it down to the score of accident for the trout be there in the warm day of August if he have a curiosity to know what there be above these little fall let he try he angle-worm in the brook just over the ridge and he will find out i claim to have discover these choice fishing place some season since and have keep they for my own private use and amusement nobody seem to know of they when the trout refuse to be take elsewhere i have always find they here abundant greedy and ready to be take by any decently skillful effort i regard these place as in some sort my private property and i mention they privately and in confidence to the reader trust that my right will be respect we finish we evening meal while the sun be yet above the western hill and sit with we pipe around a smudge make upon the broad flat rock which recede with a gentle acclivity from the shore where the bog river enter the lake look out over the stirless water it be a beautiful view so calm so still and placid and yet so wild the island seem to stand out clear from the water to be lift up as it be from the lake so perfectly moveless and polished be its surface on a grassy point to the right and a hundred rod distant two deer be quietly feed while in a little bay on the leave a brood of young duck be sport and skim along the water in playful gyration around they staid and watchful mother on the outstretched arm of a dead tree on the island before we sit a bald eagle plume himself and high above the lake the osprey soar turn he piercing eye downward watch for he prey i have be think say smith as he refill he pipe of what the doctor be say the other evening about every body have a streak of the vagabond in he which make he relish a occasional tramp in the old wood among the natural thing thing that have not be mar by the barbarism so to speak of civilization i be inclined to believe he theory to be true but i see a difficulty in its practical work now suppose doctor that you and i be out here together vagabondize as you term it and you streak of the vagabond be twice as large as mine you would of course desire to play the savage twice as long as i should there would in that case be a marring of the harmony i should be anxious to get back to civilization while you be rather in you normal element would insist upon ` lay around loose ' as you say for mercy know how long gentleman say the doctor in reply only hear this fellow he be get homesick already he have no wife not a child in the world no business nothing to call he home save a superannuated pointer and a old tom cat and yet he would leave these glorious old wood these beautiful lake these river these trout and deer and all the glad music of the wild thing to-morrow and go back to the dust the poison atmosphere the eternal jostle and monotonous noise of the city truly a vagabond and a savage be smith he be afraid that he family he mangy old pointer and dropsical cat will suffer in he absence i scorn to answer such a accusation retort smith i shall treat it with dignified contempt as i do the doc medicine which i never take but always pay for just to keep he from starve and to make he imagine he cure I but speaking of cat remind I of a certain matter which occur not many year ago the doctor here if he testimony could be rely upon know that i use to be trouble with indigestion and be sometimes a little nervous -- a _ little _ nervous interrupted the doctor why he would be as crazy with the hypo as a march hare he would insist that he be go to die or to the almshouse he have make two or three dozen will to my certain knowledge under the firm conviction that he would be in the ground in a week a _ little _ nervous indeed well say smith we will not quarrel about the degree of my nervousness but in regard to what i be go to say about cat some year ago i occupy a suite of room in the second story of a house rent by a widow lady to whom i have be under some obligation in my boyhood and whom my mother always regard as she best friend -lrb- smith support the excellent old lady in comfort for a decade under pretence of board with she ministering to the last year of she life with the care and affection of a son -rrb- the landlord of the premise be the owner of a block of twelve house -- six on pearl street and six on broadway the lot meeting midway between the two street on the rear of these lot be the out-house all under a continuous flat roof some twelve foot high twenty wide and say a hundred and fifty foot long in the rear of the broadway dwelling-house be one story tea-room or third parlor the roof of which form a continuous platform upon which you can step from the second story of the house well say the doctor what of all that there be a great deal of it smith reply i do not pretend to know how many cat there be in the city of albany indeed i never hear that they be include in the census i do not undertake to say that they _ all _ congregate nightly on the roof of those out-house but if there be a cat in the sixth ward that do not have something to say on that roof every night i should like to make its acquaintance i be against cat i regard they as treacherous ungrateful animal and as have very small moral development generally i be against _ cat - _ terwauling especially in the night season when honest people have a right to they natural sleep i do not like to be wake up when round a pleasant dream by they growling and scream spit and whine groan and cry and the hundred other nameless noise by which they frighten sleep from we pillow well one night it may have be one o'clock or two or three i be awaken by the awfullest scream and sputter growling and swearing that ever startle a weary man from he slumber i leap out of bed under the impression that at least twenty little child have fall into as many tub of boiling water i throw open the window and step out upon the roof of the tea-room i do not intend to exaggerate but i honestly believe that there be less than three hundred cat over against I on the roof of the out-houses each one of which have a tail bigger than a bologna sausage he back crooked up like a oxbow and he great round eye gleam fiercely in the moonlight put in he very best in the way of catterwaul two of the largest one black as night and the other a dark gray or brindle appear to be particularly in earnest and the way they scold and scream and swear at each other be a sin to hear i will not undertake to report all they say a decent regard for the propriety of language compel I to give only a sketch of the debate ` you infernal big-tailed hump-backed ugly-mugged thief ' scream the gray ` i would like to know what _ you _ be out here for this time of night skulk and creep and nose about in the dark poach upon other people 's preserve ' ` very well i mighty well ' be the reply ` for _ you _ to talk you black-skinned ogre-eyed growling and sputter robber to come upon this roof stick up _ you _ back and take air on yourself i would like to know what business _ you have _ get to be prowl about and crowd yourself into honest people 's company ' ` i be a regular tom cat i would have you know and go where i please and i 'll stand none of you big talk and insolent look ' ` insolent hear the cowardly thief insolent very well mr tom cat very good indeed now just take you black skin off of this roof or you 'll get what will make you look cross-eyed foe a month ' ` get off this roof i think you say look at this set of ivory and these claw old greyback if you want i should leave this roof just come and put I off try it on old beeswax yes yes try it on once and we 'll see whose eye will look straightest in the morning come on old humpback try it on old sausage tail ' and then they pitch in and such scratch and growl scolding and swearing and bite and roll over and over i never happen to see or hear before about that time i drop a boulder of coal take from the scuttle weigh about half a pound right among they -lrb- accidently of course -rrb- whether it hit any one i can not positively affirm but i hear a dull heavy sound a kind of _ chug _ as if it have strike against something soft and the scream of one of the belligerent be bring to a sudden stop by a sort of hysterical jerk as though there have be a sudden lack of wind to carry it on it put a end to the disturbance and all the rioter save one scamper away that one remain all double up in a heap like as if it have the sick headache or be attack with a sudden inflammation of the bowels if any body 's cat be find the next morning with a swell head or a great bunch on its side and seem dumpish it be my private opinion that that be the one that lump of coal fall upon still it do ` nt do much good in the way of relieve I from the annoyance of these cat convention they continue to congregate nightly on that long shed in the rear of my room i waste more wood upon they than i could well afford to spare i use up all the brickbat i could lay my hand on i throw away something less than a ton of coal and on two occasion come near be take to the watch-house for smash a window in the opposite block all this prove of no avail indeed my tormentor begin at last to get use to it to regard it as part of the performance the matter be get serious it become evident that either those cat or myself must leave the premise i have pay my rent in advance and be therefore entitle to quiet use and enjoyment accord to the term of my lease i make up my mind to try one more experiment so i buy I a double-barrelled gun and a quantity of powder and shot and give fair warning that i intend to use they well the moon come up one night with she great round face and go walk up the sky with a queenly tread throw she light like a mantle of brightness over all the earth i love the calm of a moonlight night in the pleasant spring time and the cat of we part of the town seem to love it too for they come from every quarter from the shed around the national garden from the stable the street the basement and the kitchen creep stealthily along the top of the fence and along the shed and clamber up the board that lean up against the outbuilding and set themselves down score or less of they in they old trysting place right opposite my chamber window to all this i have in the abstract no objection if a cat choose to take a quiet walk by moonlight if he choose to go out for he pleasure or he profit it be no particular business of mine and i have not a word to say cat have rights and i have no disposition to interfere with they if they choose to hold a convention to discuss the affair of rat-and-mousedom they can do it for all I but they must go about it decently and in order they must talk matter over calmly there must be no rioting no fight they must refrain from the use of profane language -- they must not swear there be law against all this and i have warn they long before that i would stand no such nonsense i tell they frankly that i would let drive among they some night with a double-barrelled gun load with powder and duck-shot -- and i mean it but those cat do ` nt believe a word i say they do ` nt believe i have any powder and shot they do ` nt believe i have any gun or know how to use it if i have and one great maltese with eye like tea-plate and a tail like a bologna sausage grin and sputter and spit in derision and defiance of my threat ` very well ' say i ` very well mr tom cat very well indeed on you head be it mr tom cat try it on mr tom cat and we 'll see who 'll get the worst of it ' well as i say the moon come up one night with she great round face and all the little star hide themselves as if ashamed of they twinkle in the splendor of she superior brightness i retire when the rumble of the carriage in the street and the tramp on the stone sidewalk have cease and the scream of the eleven o'clock train have die away into silence with a quiet conscience and in the confidence that i should find that repose to which one who have wrong no man during the day be justly entitle it may have be midnight or one o'clock or two when i be awaken from a pleasant slumber by a babel of unearthly sound in the rear of my chamber i know what those sound mean for they have cost I fuel enough to have last a month i raise the window and there as of old right opposite I on the north end of that long shed be a assemblage of all the cat in that part of the town i will not be precise as to number but it be my honest belief that there be less than three hundred of they and if one among they all be silent i do not succeed in discover which it be there be that same old maltese with he saucer eye and sausage tail and over against he sit a monstrous brindle and off at the right be a old spotted ratter and on he left be one black as a wolf 's mouth all but he eye which glare with a sulphurous and lurid brightness and dot all around over a space some thirty foot square be dozen more of all size and color and _ such _ growl and spit and shriek and swearing never before break with hideous discord the silence of midnight i load my double-barrelled gun by candle-light i put plenty of powder and a handful of shot into each barrel i adjust the cap carefully and step out of the window upon the narrow roof upon which it open i be then just eighty foot from that cat convention i address myself to the chairman -lrb- the old maltese -rrb- in a distinct and audible voice and say ` scat ' he do ` nt recognize my right to the floor but go right on with the business of the meeting ` scat ' cry i more emphatically than before but be answer only by a extra shriek from the chairman and a fiercer scream from the whole assembly ` scat once ' cry i again as i bring my gun to a present ` scat twice ' and i aim straight at the chairman cover half a dozen other in the range ` scat three time ' and i let drive bang go the right-hand barrel and bang go the left-hand barrel such scamper such leap off the shed such run away over the eaves of the outbuilding over the top of the wood-shed be never see before the echo of the firing have scarcely die away when that whole assemblage be break up and disperse ` thoma ' say i the next morning to the boy who do chore for we ` there seem to be a cat asleep out on that woodsh go up and scare it away ' thoma clamber upon the shed and go up to where that cat lay and lift it up by the tail hallood back to I ` this cat can not be wake up it can not be scare away -- its dead ' after examine it for a moment -- ` somebody be be a shootin ' on it by thunder ' as he toss it down into the yard you do not say so say i that cat be the old maltese -- the chairman of that convention i do not know where he board or who claim title to he what i do know be that it cost I a quarter to have he bury or throw into the river and that i be suffer to sleep in peace from the time i make the discovery that _ powder and lead be great queller of midnight rioting _ they give _ I _ quiet at least and save I from the wickedness of the nightly use of certain expletive under the excitement of the occasion which be not to be find in any of the religious work of the day chapter xii the first chain op pond --

fall and whirling and surging among the boulder in a descent of three of four hundred foot in all around these and seven other rapid of greater or less extent we boat have to be carry we reach the lower chain of pond within a hour of sunset and find we tent pitch at a pleasant spot which look out over the easternmost one of these beautiful little lakelet there be three of they connect together by narrow passage or strait the bank of which as the boat glide along the oar will touch they be surround by low but pleasant hill so arrange as to form a varied but delightful scenery from the western one the hill rise from the water with a steep acclivity cover with a gigantic growth of timber save on the northern side where a pleasant natural meadow cover with rank grass and a few spruce and fir tree stretch away it contain about two hundred acre and its water be deep and pure the middle one though smaller be equally beautiful skirt on three side with wood-covered hill and on the other by a continuation of the same natural meadow the eastern one on the western bank of which we tent be locate on a beautiful little bay be the prettiest of they all it contain perhaps six hundred acre and the scenery around it be exceedingly cheerful and pleasant the northern shore be bind by a natural meadow of luxuriant wild grass between which and the water be a hard sandy beach at low water some thirty foot wide and extend between a quarter and half a mile in length as we approach these pond the river become broad and shallow natural meadow cover with tall grass and weed stretch away on either hand when we come to this portion of the river the oar be ship and we boat-men take they seat in the stern with they paddle smith be in the bow of one boat and spalding in that of the other each with rifle in hand preparatory to the slaughter of a deer to provide we with venison it be arrange that the marksman who fire and fail to secure he game should change place with the one behind he and that thus the rotation should go on till we should bring down a deer we know that we should see number of they feed along the margin of the stream and upon the natural meadow that skirt the shore the stream be wind and tortuous and at no time could we see more than five-and-twenty rod in advance of we so crooked be its course we be move up the stream cautiously and silently the boatman who have charge of the craft in which be smith and myself seat in the stern paddling and smith himself seat in the bow with rifle in hand ready for anything that might turn up as the boat round a point a deer start out from among the reed on the right and go dashing and snort across the river directly in front of the boat and five or six rod ahead the water be only about two foot in depth smith blaze away at he where the ball go mercy know but the deer dash forward with accelerate speed and a louder whistle and go crash up the hill-side smith acknowledge to a severe attack of the buck fever it be now my turn to take the next shot and change place with smith we go ahead in ten minute a chance to try my skill occur but it be a long shot the game be on the wing and i have no better success than do my friend the deer only increase the length of he bound and he too go plunge through the old wood snort in astonishment and huge affright at what he have see and hear we boat now fall back and spalding and the doctor take the lead in a short time a deer be discover feed just ahead of we on the lily pad along the shore the boatman paddle silently up to within eight or ten rod of he spald sight he long and as he aver carefully with he rifle the deer feed and feed on and we wait anxiously to hear the crack of the rifle and see the deer go down but still the boat glide on unnoticed by the animal that be feed in unsuspecting security at length he raise he head throw forward he long ear gaze for a second intently at he enemy and then appreciate he danger snort like a warhorse and plunge in a seeming desperation of terror towards the shore he have run a few rod when spald let drive at he as he confess at random the ball go wide of the mark and the game dash with more desperate energy and whistle and snort like a locomotive into the brush that line the bank it be spald 's third shot in all he life at a deer and he insist gravely enough that he do not fire while the game be stand broadside to he on account of he desire to give the animal a chance for he life the truth be that spalding have a bad a very bad attack of the aforesaid buck fever the doctor by rotation now become the lead marksman he be cool and calm as if go to perform some delicate surgical operation we soon come in sight of a buck feeding in a shallow pasture and the boat glide quietly within fifteen rod of it the doctor 's hand be firm and he aim steady there be about he none of that nervous agitation which be so apt to disturb the first effort at deer slaying the boat come to a pause a moment when he rule ring out quick and sharp wake the echo of the mountain around and reverberate along the shore at the crack of the rifle the buck leap high into the air and plunge madly towards the bank up which he dash with a prodigious bind make a single jump among the tall grass and disappear from the sight the doctor be greatly mortified suppose he have miss he declare solemnly that he have take steady and sure aim just back of the fore-shoulder of the deer have a perfect sight upon it and that it do not fall in its track could only be owe to its bear a charmed life the boatman however know that the animal from its action be mortally wound he say nothing but paddle quietly to the shore and there just over the bank in the tall grass and weed lay the noble buck stone dead he have go down and die without a struggle a proud man be the doctor as he pass he hunting-knife across the throat of the deer and gaze upon its broad antler now in the velvet point to the course of the ball right through its vitals in on one side and out on the other we have venison for the next four-and-twenty hour and we disturb the deer no more that afternoon the deep baying of the stag-hound as we enter the little lake apprise we of the location of we tent and we be glad to reach they and stretch we limb upon the bed of bough beneath they for the day have be warm and we journey a weary one we pioneer have make the entire journey the day before though he have to pass over all the carrying-place three time we find that he have kill two deer and have the meat from they cut into thin slip undergo the process of jerk in a bark smokehouse erect near the tent he have also a beautiful string of trout ready for we supper take in a way peculiarly he own he have use neither bait nor fly after supper as we sit look out over the lake in front of we tent the doctor inquire of we pioneer how he have take he fish as he have with he neither rod nor fly and there be no bait to be find in the wood proper for trout why say he i get lonesome yesterday all alone up here in the wood wait for you and i think i would take a look around the shore of the lake think i might find a gold mine or a pocketful of diamond or something of that sort so i take my rifle and the two dog and start on a explorin ' voyage i do not find any gold but i find just across there by those willow and alder a cold stream enter the lake and right in the mouth of it the trout be lyin ' as thick as you finger they be fine little fellow as i ever happen to see weigh about a quarter of a pound each i have a hook or two and a piece of twine in my pocket but they be of no sort of use in common fishin ' for i have no kind of bait and could not get any after think the matter over i conclude i would see if i could not bag some of they in a quiet way so i cut I a long pole tie the hook and line to the end of it and reach out over the water drop quietly down among they i let the line drift gently up against the one i want he do not seem to mind it but be rather pleased as the line tickle he side after let it lay there a moment i jerk suddenly and up come the trout clean over my head on to the flat rock behind I however this might have astonish he it do not seem to disturb the rest in that way i catch all i want and could have catch a bushel it be not a very science way of fishin ' but it answer when a man be hungry and have not get any bait or fly i scarcely know why say the doctor but cullen 's account of catch he trout remind I of a circumstance which occur when i be a boy and which for the moment make a deal of sport i have not probably think of it in twenty year but it come to I now as fresh as though it be the occurrence of yesterday it must be as hank wood say the other day that a thing which get fairly anchor in a man 's mind remain there always and cover up as it may be by other and later thing it can never be forget it will come drift back on the current of memory fresh and palpable as ever everybody understand or ought to understand how sheep be wash a small yard be build on the bank of a stream adjacent to a deep place one side of which be open to the water and into which the flock be crowd the washer take they place in the water where it be three or four foot deep and the sheep be catch by other and toss to they where they undergo ablution -lrb- a operation by the way that they do not seem altogether to enjoy -rrb- to wash the dirt and gum from they fleece on such occasion it be regard as a lawful thing a standing and ancient practical joke to pitch any outsider who may happen to indulge he curiosity by stop to look on into the stream if he be verdant he will be very likely to be inveigle into the yard and in a unguarded moment be make to take a involuntary dive head foremost into the water a few rod above the place in which my father wash he sheep be a old dam the apron of which remain and beneath which be a basin some five or six foot in depth and thirty or forty foot in diameter fill of course with water on one occasion a man who be employ to catch the sheep be one of those shiftless good-natured lazy fellow to be find in almost every neighborhood who prefer smoking and tell story in bar-room to regular work and who greatly prefer odd job to consecutive labor tom g -- be one of this genus full of fun and mischief but without a particle of real malice in he composition as he be busy throw sheep to the washer a young fellow from the neighbor village happen that way and become somewhat interested in the process be seduce by tom g -- inside of the yard to try he hand at catch and toss in sheep about the second or third one he operate upon he treacherous friend stumble against he give he a tremendous push and with a sheep in he arm he drive head foremost among the washer the water be cold and there be a good deal of puffing and blow about the time he head come above the surface he be a sensible chap and take the joke as a wise man should especially when the odds be all against he albeit it be somewhat rude he come out on the other side of the stream and after join in the laugh against himself and take off and wring he garment he wander up to the apron of the old dam and stretch himself along the plank go to look anxiously down into the deep water after a while he seem to have discover something and call out to he friend below ' i say tom have you get a fishhook in you pocket here be a trout that will weigh two pound and i want to hook he up ' now tom be a fisherman and a big trout be he weakness moreover he be never without half a dozen hook and line in he pocket he leave he business at once and go up to the apron to assist in take the two-pound trout a pole be cut and a couple of foot of line with a hook attach be fasten a little way from the top and the haft of the hook stick into the end so that by a little force it might be remove and tom and he friend get upon the apron and stoop over to see where the great trout lay ` here he be tom just under the edge of this rock ' tom stretch himself over to get a view of the fish when a vigorous shove from the rear send he like a great frog plump towards the bottom of the pool this be a consummation that tom have not bargain for but there be no alternative but to swim for the shore drip like a rat from a flood sewer that joke have two point to it and tom g -- have the worst of they you anecdote say smith remind I of one in which i be a actor and which be impress upon my mind by a process which few boy be fond of but which be very apt to make the impression durable _ i _ fish for trout once without line or hook i get a fine string of they and myself into a pretty kettle of fish in the bargain on my father 's farm as it be when i be a boy be a stream that come down through a gorge in the mountain that bound the pleasant valley in which that farm lay in the spring freshet and the summer rain that stream be a mighty and resistless torrent that come roaring and plunge down from the plain above cascade and leap down ledge and rush though a gorge on either side of which precipice of solid rock stand straight up two hundred foot in height it be a goodly sight to see that stream when its back be up come rush and foam a mighty flood from the deep and shadowy gulf rolling in its resistless course great boulder of ton upon ton in weight and eddy and twist and roar onward in its furious course towards the lake in the summer time the drouth lap up its water and it dry away to a little brook trickle over the fall and go wind a small streamlet around the base of the hill sometimes it disappear in the gravel or among the loose stone save here and there a pool of narrow limit and shallow depth it be a fine trout stream at time its water be cold and pure and the brook trout love to hide away under the great smooth stone or shelve rock and be comfortable in the shade when the summer sun be hot and fiery in the sky when the creek be low they would congregate in the pool and still place and in time of extreme drouth might be see huddle together in such place in great number my father though not a member of any church be strict in he family discipline in regard to the observance of the sabbath the breach of which on the part of he child be very apt to be follow by consequence not the most pleasant in the world for he hold that a good switch be a essential article of household furniture and its occasional use a cardinal principle in the philosophy of family rule one Sunday when i be some ten or eleven year old when the old people be go to meeting -lrb- and they have to go eight mile to find a meeting house -rrb- i with a older brother tire of lie around the house conclude to take a stroll along up the brook it be a time of severe drouth and the stream be dry up save here and there a small pool clear and cold the bottom of which consist of smooth and clean-washed stone and pebble in one of these be a number of beautiful speckled trout average maybe a quarter of a pound each in weight here be a temptation too strong to be resist we have no hook or line with we and would not have venture to use they _ on Sunday _ if we have that would have be fishing but the taking of those trout with we hand be quite another matter so roll we pants up above we knee -lrb- there be no use of talk about shoe and stocking such luxury be not within the range of indulgence to boy of we age in those day save in the frost and snow of winter and stub toe stone bruise and thorn in the foot come float along down from the long past like shadow of darkness on the current of memory by the way will some rich man who be rear in the country in the good old time when boy go barefoot in the summer month when chapped foot stone bruise stub toe and thorn that pierce and fester in they _ sole _ be the great ill that ` darkened deepest around human destiny ' solve for I a problem of the human mind will he tell I whether in he after life when he be the owner of broad acre fine house pile of stock in pay corporation and huge deposit in solvent bank he ever feel richer or prouder when count he gain and contemplate the aggregate of he wealth than he do when he pull on he first pair of boot -rrb- so as i say we roll up we pants and wade in for the trout we catch a beautiful string of twenty or more take they home dress they nicely and sit they carefully away in the cool cellar we have a notion that the greatness of the prize would wipe away the offence by which it be secure and that the delicious breakfast they would afford would be receive as a sufficient atonement for the sin of have take they on a Sunday but we be never more mistaken in we life my father go into the cellar for some purpose in the evening after he return from meeting and discover the trout a inquiry be institute we dereliction be expose and we be promise a flogging now that be a promise which while it be rarely make be never break when my father in he calm quiet way make up he mind and so express it that he owe one of he boy a flog it become as it be a debt of honor what in modern parlance would be term a confidential debt and he to whom it be acknowledge to be due become a prefered creditor and be sure to be pay well the trout be eat for breakfast and after the meal be over my brother and myself be duly pay off at a hundred cent on the dollar with full interest that flogging cure I of ` tickle ' trout especially on Sunday i be never tempt to take trout with my hand without feel a tickle sensation about the back and though old recollection of the long past of that pleasant stream and the gorge through which it flow with the side hill cover with old forest above it and the green field spread out on the other side of the home of my boyhood the old log-house the cattle the sheep the old watch-dog and the thousand other thing around which memory love to linger come clustering around my heart yet conspicuous among they all be the flogging i get for ` tickle ' trout on a Sunday chapter xiii a jolly time for the deer -- hunting on the water by daylight -- mud lake funereal scenery -- a new way of take rabbit -- the negro and the marino buck -- a collision as we come down to the lake in the morning to perform we ablation we see a fine deer on the opposite shore feed upon the pond lily that grow along in the shallow water it be nearly half a mile from we and while we be look at it four other come walk carelessly out of the tall grass upon the beach and commence playing as we have see lamb do on the sandy shore they would run here and there back and forth at full speed along the sand leap high into the air kick up they heel and perform all the various antic of which animal so supple and active may be suppose capable we see one fellow leap with a clear bind over two that be stand look out over the water and run some fifty rod up the beach as if all the hound in christendom be at he tail and then wheel gracefully and return with equal speed to he companion when they all commence jump and bound and run up and down along the shore as if they be out on a regular spree and be determine to be jolly after half a hour of exceedingly active play they hoist they white flag and go bound over the meadow into the wood the deer that be feed pay no further attention to they than to raise he head and look quietly and perhaps contemptuously at they occasionally while he chew he breakfast that he be pick up in the shape of lily pad upon the surface of the water spalding and a boatman paddle across the lake to make mm a morning call it be a curious fact that one skilled in the art will paddle or scull one of these light boat to within a few rod of a deer while feed in plain open sight provide always that the wind blow _ from _ the direction of the animal and no noise be make by the boatman the deer will feed on and the time for paddling be while he head be down when he raise it to look about he in whatever position the boatman be he must remain immovable if he paddle be up it must remain so not a motion must be make or the game will be off with a snort and a rush for the shore and the wood the deer may and probably will look with a vacant stare directly at the approach boat without its curiosity be in the least excited and then go to feed again the marksman must take he aim while the game be feed when it raise its head high in the air throw forward its ear and gaze at he for a moment with a wild and startled look then be he time to fire five seconds at the longest be all that be allow he when he see these motion for within that time with its fear thoroughly arouse the game will be plunge for the shelter of the wood the boatman paddle spalding quietly and silently to within twelve or fifteen rod of the deer that be feed when a column of white smoke shot suddenly up from the bow of the boat the sharp crack of the rifle ring out over the water and the deer go down spalding be a proud man as he return to we with a fine fat spike buck in he boat these little lake be probably sixty-five mile from the settlement allow for the wind course of the river just above where the river enter be a dam build of log some fifteen foot high erect by the lumberman the last winter to hold back the water so as to float they log down from this to tupper 's lake and so on down the rackett to the mill away below around this dam be the last carry place between this and mud lake over which we boatman trudge with they boat like great turtle with they shell upon they back this be still call bog river and though above the dam to mud lake where it take its rise it be deep and sluggish yet it be do it honor overmuch to dignify it by the name of a river it be large enough however to float we little craft we leave we baggage-master here with most of we luggage to perfect he operation in the way of jerk venison intend to return the next day we might have leave everything without a guard so far as human depredation be concern no bolt or bar would be necessary for its protection in the first place nobody would visit the spot and if they do we property would be perfectly protect by the law of the wood it would be doubtless carefully inspect by any curious banter pass that way but theft or robbery be unknown here true a bottle of good liquor if handle by a visitor might lose somewhat of its contents but it would be drink to the health of the owner and in a spirit of good fellowship and not of theft all which would be regard by woodsman as strictly within rule there be as hank wood say no law agin it we leave the first chain of pond and row some ten mile up the deep and sluggish but narrow channel of the river startling every little way a deer from its propriety by we presence as it be feed along the shore few sportsman ever visit this remote region and it be above the range of the lumberman we come to some rapid near the outlet of the second chain of pond around which we walk and up which the boatman push they little craft these rapid be a quarter of a mile in length with no great amount of fall but still enough to prevent the passage up they of a loaded boat directly at the head of these rapid be the second chain of pond three pleasant little lakelet of from two to four hundred acre each surround by dense forest and shore in the main walled in by huge boulder and broken rock we pass through these in which be several loon or great northern diver quietly float and as they watch we send forth they clear and clarion voice over the water we take each a pass shot at they but with no other effect than to make they dive quicker and deeper and stay under longer than usual at the flash of we rifle they would go down and in a few minute would be again on the surface sixty rod from we laugh aloud as it be with they clear and quavering voice at we impotent attempt to shoot they we leave the second chain of pond by the narrow and sluggish inlet still the bog river here so small that the boatman 's oar span the narrow channel and as crooked a stream as it be possible for one to be it flow for mile through a low and marshy region with dense alderbush cluster along the shore and scatter fir-trees dead at the top standing between these and the forest in the background the bottom much of the way be of clean yellow sand in which be imbed million of clam resemble in every respect those of the ocean beach some of these we open and find the living bivalve in appearance precisely like they kindred of the salt water i have see occasionally muscle shell in other stream and along the shore of the lake but i never before saw any such as these save near the ocean where the salt water ebb and flow and not even there in such quantity one might gather barrel and barrel of they large and apparently fat and yet there would be hundred or thousand of barrel leave the mink the muskrat and other animal that hunt along the water and have a taste for fish have a good time of it among they for we see bushel of shell in place where the fish have be extract and devour we arrive at mud lake towards evening and pitch we tent on a little rise of ground on the north side a few rod back from the lake among a cluster of spruce and balsam and surround by a dense growth of laurel and high whortleberry bush we see a deer occasionally on we route and the bank of the stream in many place be trodden up by they like the entrance to a sheep-fold why this sheet of water should be call mud lake be a mystery for though gloomy enough in every other respect its bed be of sand and it be surround by a sandy beach from fifteen to forty foot wide it be perhaps four mile in circumference its water generally shallow and so cover with pond lily and skirt with wild grass as to form the most luxuriant pasture for the deer and moose to be find in all this region of all the lake i have visit in these northern wild this be the most gloomy indeed it be the only one that do not wear a cheerful and pleasant aspect it seem to be the highest water in this portion of the wilderness lie as one of we boatman express it up on the top of the house in only one direction could any higher land be see and that be a low hill on the western shore not exceed fifty foot in height there be no tall mountain peak reach they head towards the cloud overlook the water no range stretch away into the distance no gorge or spread valley no sloping hillside give back the sunlight or along which gigantic shadow of the drift cloud float all around it be fir and tamarac and spruce of a stinted and slender growth dead at the top and with lichen and moss hang down in sad and draggled festoon from they desolate branch it be in truth a gloomy place typical of desolation which it be well to see once but which no one will desire to visit a second time we notice on the sandy beach track of the wolf the panther the moose and in one place the huge track of a bear he must have be of monstrous growth judge by the impression of he great foot and claw in the sand but we see none of these animal and so gloomy be the place so sepulchral such a air of desolation all around that it bring over the mind a strong feeling of sadness and gloom and we resolve not to tarry beyond the nest morning even for the chance of take a moose a panther or a bear we pitch we tent as i say a little way back from the lake near a cold spring that come boil up through the white sand in a little basin eight foot wide the bottom of which like that on the bank of tupper 's lake be all in commotion boil and bubble as the water force its way up through it i be in the forward boat as we approach the lake and be surprise to see the number of deer feed upon the lily pad in the shallow water and the wild grass that grow along the shore some stand midside in the water some with only the line of they back and head above it some be close along the shore feeding upon the grass that grow there other still be nibble at the leaf of the moosewood upon the bank and one large buck stand by the side of a fir tree rub he neck up and down against it as if scratch himself against its rough bark we have not be discover and wait for the other boat to arrive great be the astonishment of my companion when they see the number of deer that be feed in this little lake neither of they have ever see the like nor have i save on one occasion and that be in a small lake the name of which i have forget lie a few mile beyond the head of the upper saranac you see that clump of low balsam tree on that point yonder say my boatman as we lay upon we oar point in the direction indicate well from that spot three year ago i shoot a moose out upon the bar there as it be feed upon the lily pad and flag grass i have hear from a old indian hunter about this lake and the abundance of game to be find here and i make up my mind to see it so another hunter and myself agree to come up here in July and take a look at matter and find out whether the old copperhead tell the truth or not we start about the middle of July with we rifle and provision for a fortnight and come up we see any quantity of deer on the way on the second chain of pond we see as we be rowing along a large panther walk out on to the top of a great boulder and look around lash he side with he long tail and then sit down on he haunch with he tail curl around he foot just as you have see a cat do he be too far off for we to shoot he and he see we before we get within proper distance and steal away into the wood and we pass on as we round the point just below the lake there and look out upon the broad water i see the moose i speak of feed we sit perfectly still and permit the boat to drift back down the stream until we be out of sight we then land and i creep carefully and silently to that clump of fir tree i have my own and my companion 's rifle both properly load have get a right position i sight for a vital part and fire the animal rush furiously forward two or three rod with its head lower as if make a lunge at a enemy then stop and look all around stand with its back hump up and its short stump of a tail working and writhe at a furious rate i sight it again with the other rifle and pull the animal plunge furiously for again for a few rod stop a moment and then settle slowly down and fall over on its side dead it be a cow-moose and would weigh as kill five or six hundred pound i be a pretty proud man then as that be my first moose and about as big feel a chap as be squire smith the other day when he bring down that buck i have shoot two other here since one at each visit i have make the season for moose hunting along the water pasture be nearly over they go back upon the hill in August the food there be by that time abundant the track we see be old one the animal have pass there several day previously i would not have it suppose that the moose be abundant in any portion of this wilderness they have come to be few and far between and exceedingly wary at that i could hear of none have be kill the present season but that there be some leave as well as bear and wolf and panther the track we see give unmistakable evidence we see no appearance of trout in this lake or in the outlet of it above the upper chain of pond the stream swarm with chub and dace a rare circumstance with the stream of this region towards evening we see number of little gray wood rabbit hop around among the dense undergrowth on the ridge where we tent be situate squat themselves down and cock up they long ear as they pause occasionally to examine the strange visitor who have come among they they be very tame not seem to regard we presence as a thing of much danger to they see those rabbit remark smith remind I of a anecdote of my boyhood which at the time occasion I a amount of mortification equal only by the amusement it afford I when i think of it in after year on my father 's farm be a bush field a place that have be chop and burn over and then leave to grow up with bush make a excellent cover for wild wood rabbit i have see they hop about when i go to turn away the cow in the morning or after they at night i have a longing to ` make game ' of they i have a brother a good deal older than myself who be as fond of a joke as i be of the rabbit and who be quite as ready to make game of I as i be of they so he tell I one day to put a apple on a stick over they path high enough to be just above they reach and a handful of scotch snuff on a dry leaf on the ground under it and the rabbit while smell for the apple would inhale the snuff and sneeze themselves to death in no tune well i be a child then and simple enough to be gammon by this rigmarole i set the apple and the snuff but i get no rabbit while i do get laugh at hugely for my credulity this satisfied I that people should never impose upon the simplicity of childhood i remember my mortification on the occasion it be so long ago that it stand out by itself a mere fragment of memory with _ all _ beyond it a blank and a wide gap out this side it be a isolate fact fix in my recollection by the pain it occasion I you anecdote of the rabbit say the doctor remind I of a story tell of a dutchman who discover a owl on a limb above he and notice that its face and great round eye follow he always as he walk around the tree without its body move at all see this he conclude in he wisdom that he would travel round the tree till the owl twist its head off in watch he so round and round he go for a hour and stop only by have the conviction force upon he mind that the owl have a swivel in its neck strange remark spald how the hearing of one story remind we of another i always admire the ` arabian night ' because the story contain in that work hang together so like a string of onion or a braid of seed corn the first be a sort of introduction to the second and the second a usher to the third and so on through the whole but why the story of the dutchman and the owl should remind I of another in which a old negro and a bellicose ram be the actor be a matter i do not pretend to understand unless it be the extreme absurdity of both a gentleman of my acquaintance long ago -lrb- he be a middle-aged man when i be a small boy he be a upright and a good man he have go to he rest and sleep in a honor grave have upon the simple stone above he no lie epitaph -rrb- have a old negro who rejoice in the name of pompey and a merino buck the latter a valiant animal that be ready to fight with anybody or anything that cross he path between he and the ` color person ' be a ` eternal distinction ' a active and irreconcilable antagonism that develop itself on every possible occasion the old guinea man be winnowing wheat one day with a old-fashioned fan -lrb- do any of you ever see one of these primitive machine for separate wheat from the chaff use by we father before the fan mill be invent it be a ingenious contrivance by which a man with a strong back and of a strong constitution could clean some twenty bushel in a single day -rrb- while stoop over to fill he fan with unwinnowed grain the buck take advantage of he position come like a catapult against he and send he like a ball from a paixhan gun head foremost into the chaff great be the astonishment but greater the wrath of pompey and dire the vengeance that he denounce against he assailant gather himself up and rub the part batter by the attack of he enemy he retreat around the corner of the barn and procure a rock weigh some twenty pound return to the presence of he foe who be quietly eat the wheat that the negro have be clean evidently regard it as the legitimate spoil of victory get down on all fours and manage to hold the stone against he head pompey challenge he enemy to combat the buck nothing loth draw back to a proper distance and shut both eye come like a batter _ ram _ against the stone on the other side of which be the negro 's head as might have be expect the challenger go one way and the challenge the other by the recoil both knock into insensibility by the concussion pompey be take up for dead but he wool and the thickness of he scull save he he give the buck a wide berth after that he regard he always with a sort of superstitious awe never be able to comprehend how he but he through that big stone explain the matter to he ever so scientifically demonstrate it on the clearest principle of mechanical philosophy still pompey would shake he head and as he walk away would mutter to himself ` de debbil help dat ram _ sure _ dere 's no use in di nigger 's tryin ' to come round _ he _ he be a witch dat ram be and be not nuffin else ' chapter xiv a deer trap -- the result of a combat -- a question of mental philosophy discuss we return the next day to we camping ground on the lower chain of pond we find we pioneer and he goods all safe no visitor have pass that way in we absence smith knock over a deer on we passage down i have say that just above we camp be a dam it be make in this wise : first great log be lay up across the stream in the same fashion as the side of a log house to the height of about twelve foot properly secure and upon these other and smaller log be lay side by side transversely and slope up the stream at a angle of forty-five degree like one side of the roof of a house these long slender log reach out over and beyond those that be lay up across the stream the lower part cover with brush and then with earth so as to make a tight dam the upper end even when the dam be full extend several foot above the top water line these log or perhaps they have better be call large and long pole for when compare with the foundation timber they be nothing more have of course above where they be cover with brush and earth interstice or crevice between they on we return and as we come in sight of the dam i be in the forward boat see a small deer lay stretch out upon these pole dead hanging as it be by one foot my impression be that it have be shoot and drag up there and leave by we pioneer for the present we find however upon examination that the deer have walk up on the dam probably to take a look at what be below and on the other side when he foot slip down between the pole and he be catch as in a trap he leg be badly broken and nearly sever by he effort to get loose and the bark of the pole be worn away within reach of he struggle he have die where he thus get hung and there he be stone dead but not yet cold when we find he he be a fine fat young deer and die by one of the thousand accident to which the wild animal of the forest as well as man be expose upon relate this incident to a old hunter i be tell by he that he once while out in the wood come upon the skeleton of two large buck that in fighting have get they horn so interlocked and wedge together that they could not separate they and thus lock in the death grapple they have starve and die there lay they bone the flesh eat from they by the beast and carrion bird and bleached by the sun and the storm the two skull with the horn still interlock and the narrator tell I he have they yet at home fast together as he find they as one of the curiosity to be meet with in the rackett wood i have be think say spalding in he quiet way as we sit towards evening look out over the pleasant little lake watch the shadow chase the retire sunlight up the side of the opposite hill i have be think how differently we act and feel and talk -- aye and think too -- out here in these old wood from what we do when at home and surround by civilization however we four may deny be old we can not certainly claim to be young we have all reach the meridian of life and though feeling few if any of the infirmity of age still we next move will be in the downhill direction yet notwithstanding all this we talk and act and think and feel too like boy i do not speak this reproachfully but as a fact which develop a curious attribute of the human mind well reply the doctor while it may be curious it be exceedingly natural we have throw off the restraint which society impose upon we we have throw off the care which the business of life heap upon we we have go back for a season to the freedom the sport the sight the exercise which delight we boyhood and can it be call strange that the feeling the thought and emotion of we youth should come well up from the long past or that with the return of boyish emotion the language and action of boyhood should be indulge in again you will find say smith you old feeling of sobriety of thoughtfulness you cautiousness come back just in proportion as you tire of this wilderness life and that by the time you be ready to return to civilization you will have become as staid sober and reflective man of the world as when you start with as strict a guard upon you expression of sentiment or opinion as ever it be that ` guard ' of which you speak remark spalding over the emotion the sentiment of the heart stifle they expression and chain down under a placid exterior they manifestation that constitute one of the broad distinction between youth and manhood it be when that guard be set that the process of fossilization so to speak begin and if no relaxing agency intervene the heart become cold and hard even before white hair gather upon the head i often imagine that if man who really _ think _ who have the power of analyzation of weigh cause and measure result would dismiss that rigid espionage over themselves would stand in less awe of the world in less dread of its accusation of change and with the fearless frankness of youth declare the truth and stand boldly up for the right as they _ at the time _ understand it to be without reference to consistency of present view and opinion with those of the past the world would be much better off progress would have vastly fewer obstacle to contend against but it be not every man even of those who _ think _ who in politics in religion in science in anything involve a possible charge of inconsistency of the desertion of a party a sect or a principle dare avow a change of conviction or opinion however such change may exist this should not be so it belittle manhood and make slave and coward of man it be a proud prerogative this ability and power of think it be a priceless privilege this freedom of thought and opinion and he be a craven who move on with the heedless and thoughtless crowd conscious of error himself a hypocrite and a live lie through fear of the charge of ` inconsistency ' the accusation of change ` speak you opinion of to-day ' say carlyle ` in word hard as rock and you opinion of to-morrow in word just as hard even though you opinion of to-morrow may contradict you opinion of to-day ' there be a fund of true wisdom in this beautiful maxim if man would appreciate it it would correct a vast deal of error in politics in religion in philosophy in the social relation of life time change and struggle against it as they may man 's conviction will change with the time the man who say that he opinion never alter be to I either a knave or a fool for a think man to remain stationary when everything else be on the move be a simple impossibility time be when the stage coach be the model method of travel it carry we six sometimes eight mile the hour in comfort and safety but who think of the lumbering stage coach now with its snail 's pace of eight mile the hour when the locomotive with its long train of car light up like the street of a city in motion rush over the smooth rail literally with the speed of the wind the scream of the steam-whistle have succeed the old stage-horn and the iron horse take the place of those of flesh and blood change be write in great glowing letter upon everything it stand out in blaze capital everywhere all thing be on the move forward and forward be the word and who would who can stand still amidst the universal rush only a century ago from the valley through which the majestic hudson roll its everlasting flood westward to the mighty mississippus westward still to the rocky mountain and yet westward to the pacific be one vast wilderness interminable forest stand in all they primeval grandeur and gloom boundless prairie

smith and martin go out around the lake night hunting and the rest retire to we tent we hear the report of smith 's rifle from time to time and conclude that we should have to court-martial he for a wanton destruction of deer contrary to the law we have establish for we government on that subject but on he return we ascertain that though have have several shot he have succeed in kill or accord to martin 's account even wound but one and that a yearling and the poorest and leanest we have see since we enter the wood though it be thus diminutive in size smith declare that he have see and shoot at some of the largest deer that ever roam the forest he insist that he have see some by the side of which the largest we have look upon by daylight be mere fawn and thereupon he undertake to establish a theory that the large deer feed by night and the smaller one by day this would have be all well enough be it not for the fact understand by every experienced night-hunter that by the spectral and uncertain light of the lamp or torch a deer when see standing in the water or on the reedy bank be in appearance magnify to twice its actual dimension to this smith at last assent since to deny the proposition involve the conclusion that he have kill the wrong deer for the one he shoot at as it stand in the edge of the water though much smaller than some he have see appear greatly larger than the one he kill chapter xv hook up trout -- the left branch -- the rapid -- a fight with a buck we start down stream in the morning towards the fork intend to ascend the left branch to little tupper 's lake we reach the fork at three o'clock directly opposite to where the right branch enter a small cold stream come in among a cluster of alder bush on the eastern shore at the mouth of this little stream which one can step across the trout congregate we could see they lay in shoal along the bottom but the sun shine down bright and warm into the clear water and not a trout would rise to the fly or touch a bait we want some of those trout and as they refuse to be take in a scientific way and accord to art it be a necessity for which we be not responsible which impel we to a method of capture which under ordinary circumstance we should have reject i take off the fly from my line and fasten upon it half a dozen snell with bare hook attach a small sinker and drop quietly among they a large fellow work he way lazily above where the hook lay on the bottom eye I as if laugh at my folly in attempt to deceive he with fly or bait i jerk suddenly and two of the hook fasten into he near the tail that trout be astonish as be half a dozen or more of he fellow when they come out of the water tail foremost struggle with all they might against so vulgar and undignify a manner of leave they native element we get as beautiful a string in this way as one would wish to see albeit they laugh at we best skill with fly and bait and the cream of the matter be that we have we pick of the shoal we pitch we tent at the foot of the second rapid on a high moss-covered bank the roar of the water sound deep and solemn among the old wood as it go roar and tumble and struggle through the gorge the night wind moan and sigh among the tree above we while the night bird 's note come soothingly from the wilderness around as what a strange diversity of taste exist among the people of this world of ours say the doctor address himself to I as we sit in front of we tent listen to the roar of the water you and i i take it enjoy a fortnight or so among these lake and old forest with a keener relish than spalding or smith here i judge so because we indulge in these trip every year while this be they first adventure of the kind but even you and i however much we may love the wood however we may enjoy these occasional tramp among they shady solitude would not enjoy they as a residence and yet i have sometimes think i should love to spend the summer in a forest home alone with nature with my pen and book a fishing-rod and rifle to supply my want and a friend to talk with occasionally many year ago i be out on the western prairie some sixty day beyond the region of bread we have encamp on the bank of a stream along which a narrow belt of timber grow more than a quarter of a century have pass since i take that trip to look upon the rocky mountain there be no gold region lay beyond they then or rather the enterprise of the anglo-saxon have not discover its existence and the greed of the white man have not make the trail over the mountain or through they dismal pass a familiar way along in the afternoon we be visit by a trapper who have in he wanderings discover the smoke of we camp fire he be a weather-beaten iron man of the solitude of nature who have wander away from he home in new england and from civilization into that limitless wilderness he be glad to see we inquire the news from the outer world talk about york state vermont the bay state and then after a hour 's converse as if he social instinct and sympathy have be satisfy he shoulder he rifle and start off across the plain towards a belt of timber lie dim and shadowy like a low cloud upon the distant horizon i watch he for a hour or more as he trudge away over the rolling prairie grow less and less to the view until he become like a speck in the distance and then vanish from my sight there be a solemn sort of feeling steal over I as this lonely hunter wend he way into the deep solitude of the prairie to be alone with nature commune only with himself and the thing scatter around he by the great creator he seem to be contented and happy how different be he taste from yours or mine my friend and yet i feel as though it would have be easy for I to have be like he a isolate and solitary man have circumstance in early life throw I into a position to have follow the original bent of my nature and yet say spalding if you will look into the philosophy of the matter you will see that this diversity of taste as you call it be not so great after all that be that the origin of the impulse which send some man away from society among the solitude of the wilderness and of that which hold other in constant communion with the busy scene of life be very nearly the same it be the love of adventure of excitement a restlessness for something new a desire for change this impulse be control shape by circumstance of early life by education and association but the foundation of it at last be the thirst for excitement the love of adventure one man wander away into the wilderness in pursuit of it another plunge into society in pursuit of the same thing these hardy man who be here with we who be rear on the border of civilization enjoy the solitude of they wilderness quite as much and upon the same general theory as we do the society to which we have be accustom and they plunge alone into the one with quite as much zest as we do into the other in the pursuit of excitement here be cullen now who have spend more time alone in the wilderness than almost any other man outside of the trapper and hunter of the prairie of the west i appeal to he if it be not rather a love of adventure than of nature which send he on he solitary ramble in the forest may be the judge be right reply cullen as he rub the shaving of plug tobacco in the palm of he left hand with the ball of he right while he hold he short black pipe between he tooth preparatory to fill it may be the judge be right i rather think he be and let I tell you i have meet with some queer adventure as you call they in these wood too some that i would not have go out arter if i would know what they be to have be afore i start i have be movin ' back from what you call civilization for five and twenty year because i do not like to live where people be too thick and where there be nothing but tame life around I i have a kind of liking for the deer and moose and have not any ill will towards now and then a wolf or a painter i like a rifle better than i do the handle of a plow and i would rayther bring down a ten-pronger than to raise a acre of corn and i do not care who know it there be a place in the world for just such a man as i be yet and will be till these old wood be go do you see that say he roll up he pantaloons to he knee reveal a deep scar on both side of the calf of he leg as if it have be pierce by a bullet and do you see that as he exhibit another deep scar above he knee and that as he show another on he arm above the elbow wal i reckon i have a time of it with the old buck that make they thing on my under-pinin ' and on my corn-stealer as they say out west fifteen year ago i be over on tupper 's lake shantyin ' on the high bank above the rock just at the outlet fishin ' and huntin ' and layin ' around loose in a promiscuous way all alone by myself havin ' nobody along but the old black dog that you appeal to hank wood who nod assent remember that dog continue cullen be human in he day and if anybody have another like he and want a couple of month lumberin ' in the place of he i be ready for a trade he may call at my shanty wal crop and i have see about all there be to be look at about tupper 's lake and havin ' hearn some pretty tall story about the deer and moose up about the head of bog river from a ingen who have hunt that section i mention to crop one mornin ' that we would take a trip into they part ` agree ' say he or leastwise he do not say a word agin it and by the wag of he tail i understand he to be agreeable mud lake as you have discover aint very near now and it be a good deal farther off then the settlement have not be push so far into the wood then as now but we put out crop and i for mud lake we pass the eight carryin ' place afore night and reach the first chain of pond while the sun be hangin ' like a great torch in the tree-top i have see a good many deer in my day but the way they stand around in those pond and in the shallow water of the river below among the grass and pond lily be a thing to make a man open he eye _ some _ i see dozen of 'em at a time and if it do not seem like a sheep paster i would ` nt say it i have my pick out of the lot and knock over a two-year-old for provision for I and crop i aint at all poetical but if there be ever a matter to make a man feel like stringin ' rhyme that evenin ' that crop and i spend on the lower chain of pond or little lake on bog river be a thing of that sort the sun throw he bright red light on the top of the mountain away off to the east spread it all over the lofty peak like a golden shawl while the gorge and deep valley around they base rest in deep and solemn shadow the loon speak out clear like a bugle on the lake and he voice go echoin ' around among the hill the frog be out and out jolly while the old wood be full of happy voice and merry song as if all nater be runnin ' over with gladness and joy even the night breeze as it sigh and moan among the tree-top seem to be whisperin ' to itself of the joy and brightness and glory of such a evenin ' as the night gather the moon in she largest growth come up over the hill and walk like a queen up into the sky and the bright star gather around she twinklin ' and flashin ' and dancin ' as if merry-makin ' in the brightness of she presence away down below the bottom of the lake be other mountain and lake another moon with bright star shinin ' and twinklin ' around she other broad heaven just as distinct and glorious as those which arch above we do not laugh judge for I and crop saw and hear all that i have be describin ' to you and we feel it too may be quite as deeply as if we would be breed in college and stuff with the larnin ' of the book i hear the cry of the painter the howl of the wolf and the hoarse bellow of the moose that night and crop creep close alongside of I in we bush-shanty and answer these forest sound by a low growl as if sayin ' to himself that while he would rayther keep oat of a fight yet if necessary in defense of he master he be ready to go in wal we start on up stream next mornin ' pass the second chain of lake and go along up the crooked and windin ' course of the stream till towards night we come in sight of mud lake that lake be anything but handsome to my thinkin ' you see it be gloomy and solemn enough situate as it be away up on the top of the mountain higher than any other water i know of in these part all about it be fir and tamarack and spruce the lichen hang like long gray hair away down from they stint branch while all around low bush grow and moss sometimes a foot thick cover the ground that judge be the place for black fly and mosquito in June the black fly be all go before this time in the summer but if you would a take this trip the latter part of June you would have admit that i be tellin ' no lie if there be any place in the round world where mosquito have longer bill or the black fly swarm in mightier host i do not know where it be and sha not go there if i happen to find out its location i have a tolerably thick hide but if they do not bite I _ some _ i would not say so but you ought to have see the deer feedin ' on the pond-lily and grass in that lake i they be like sheep in a pasture and out some fifty rod from the shore be a great moose helpin ' himself to the eatables that grow there i lay my jacket down for crop to watch and wade quietly in towards where the moose be feedin ' i get within twelve or fifteen rod of he and speak to he with my rifle he hear it you may guess without knowin ' who or what hurt he he plunge right towards I for the shore but he never get there alive you ought to have see the scampering of the deer at the sound of my rifle maybe there be not much splashin ' of the water and whistlin ' and snortin ' and puttin ' out for the shore among 'em the next mornin ' i get up just as the sun be risin ' and a little way down on the shore of the lake i see a buck wal he be one of 'em -- that buck be the horn on he head be like a old-fashioned round-posted chair and if they have not a dozen prong on 'em you may skin I he be not as big as a ox but a two-year-old that could match he could brag of a pretty rapid growth i creep up behind a little clump of bush to about fifteen rod of where he stand on the sandy beach and sighting carefully at he head let drive my gun hang fire a little owin ' to the night-dew but that buck go down and after kickin ' a moment lay still and i take it for grant he be dead so i lay down my rifle and go up to where he be and with my huntin ' knife in my hand take hold of he horn to raise he head so as to cut he throat if that deer be dead he come to life mighty quick for i have no sooner touch he than he spring to he foot and with every hair standin ' straight towards he head come like a mad bull at I in strugglin ' up he overshoot I and as he make he drive one prong go through the calf of my leg i plunge my knife into he body and the blood spirt all over I but it be not no use he smash down upon I again and make that hole in my leg above the knee i handle my knife in a hurry and make more than one hole in he skin while he stick a prong through my arm i holler for crop who be watch the shanty as he duty be the old buck and i have it rough and tumble sometimes one a-top and sometimes the other and both growin ' weak from loss of blood may be we do not kick and tussle about and tear up the sand on the beach of the lake _ some _ the buck be game to the backbone and have no notion of givin ' in and i have to fight for it or die so up and down over and over and all around we go for a long time until crop make up he mind that my callin ' so earnestly mean something and round the point he come when he see what be goin ' on you ought to have see how _ he _ go in he do not stop to ask any question but as if possess by all the fury of creation he light upon that buck and the fight be up he with he tooth and i with my knife settle the matter in less than a minute but judge let I tell you that buck be dangerous and if crop have not be around may be ther would have be the bone of man and beast bleachin ' on the sandy beach of mud lake i bind up my wound as well as i could -- but it be tough work backin ' my bark canoe over the carryin ' place on bog river and across the ingen carryin ' place and from the upper saranac to bind lake with they hole in my leg and arm and the other bruise i receive when i get out to the settlement i be mighty glad to lay still for six week and when i get around again i be a good deal leaner than i be now my gun hangin ' fire make my bullet go wide of the spot i aim at it have graze he skull and stun he for a little time and craze he into the bargain i learn more fully a fact that i would a idea of before by my fight with that deer and it be this -- that it be best to keep out of the way of a furious buck with tall sharp horn on he head he be a dangerous animal to handle that be one of the adventure that i go out into the wilderness arter and find without lookin ' for it and i have find a good many other that put I and crop in a tight place more than once i back he over all the carryin ' place between little tupper 's and the saranac once when he be too lame and weak to walk and nuss he for a month afterwards but that be a adventer i 'll tell another time there be a deal of excitement as the judge call it outside of the fence if people will take the pain to look for it there chapter xvi round pond -- the pile driver -- a theory for spiritualist we put up we tent the next evening on a bold bluff near the outlet of round pond a picturesque and pleasant sheet of water some eight or ten mile in circumference it lay there still and waveless in that calm summer evening as glassy and smooth as if no breeze have ever stir its surface all around it be old forest old hill and rock and away off in the distance be the tall peak of the adirondack stand up grim solemn and shadowy in the distance these peak be see from almost every direction they tower so far above the surround highland that they seem always to be peer over the intervene range as if hold a everlasting watch over the broad wilderness beneath they this lake be probably more than a thousand foot above the rackett and the river fall that distance principally at the two rapid around which we boat be carry the rest of the way it be a deep sluggish stream so that the descent may be reckon within less than three mile a ledge of rock form the lower boundary of the lake through which the water at some remote period break its way and it go roar down rapid for three-quarter of a mile then move in a sluggish current across a plain of several mile in extent then plunge down a steep descent for over a mile and a half to subside again into quiet and move on with a sluggish current to plunge down the ledge again into tupper 's lake there be no perpendicular fall of more than twenty foot but the water go plunge and boil and foam down shelve rock and eddy and whirling around immense boulder rush and roar through the gorge with a voice like thunder these fall be all useless here and probably will be for century to come but be they out in the living world in the midst of civilization with a fertile and populous region about they they would soon be harness to great wheel and make utilitarian the clank of machinery would soon be hear above the roar of they water they would do a immensity of labor on they returnless journey to the ocean but here they be utterly valueless waste they mighty power upon desolate rock rush in mad and impotent fury forever through a region of barrenness and sterility so far as the use of civilization be concern a region where the manufacturer or the agriculturist will never tarry until the world shall be so full of people that necessity will drive they to the mountain to build up the waste place of the earth opposite and across the bay from where we tent be pitch i notice that a small stream enter the lake and smith and myself cross over to experiment among the trout i know would be gather there we be entirely successful for we take one at almost every throw i have more than once state that the trout of these lake and river in the warm season congregate where the cold stream enter and if the sportsman will search out the little brook no matter how small and cast he fly across where they water enter the lake or river he will be sure to find trout in any of the hot summer month we return to camp before the sun go behind the hill with we fish ready for the pan and we boatman provide we with a meal of jerk venison pork and trout which a epicure might envy and to which a hard day 's journey and a appetite sharpen by the brace influence of the pure mountain air give a peculiar relish it be a pleasant thing to see the moon come up from among the tree that form a dark outline to the lake away off to the east and travel up into the sky to see how faithfully it be give back from down in the stirless water and how the star twinkle and glow around it in the depths below as they do in the depths above there be the moon and there the star all bright and glorious in the heaven above and there another moon and other star as bright and glorious down in the vault below the lake float as it be a almost viewless mist a shadowy and transparent veil between as we sit in the greyness of twilight in front of we tent a curious sound come over the lake from the opposite shore so like civilization that it startle we for a moment here we be fifty mile from a house away in the forest beyond the sound of anything savor of human agency and yet we hear distinctly what be for all the world like the blow of a axe or hammer upon a stake drive it into the earth it have the peculiar ring which any one will recognize who have drive a stake into ground cover with water by blow give by the side instead of the head of a axe these blow be give at interval so regular that we all suspend smoking certain that there be other sportsman beside ourselves in the neighborhood of this lake who in the world be that ask smith of martin who seem to enjoy we astonishment that reply martin be a gentleman know in these part as the ` pile-driver ' he visit all these lake in the summer season and though as a general thing he travel alone yet he sometimes have half a dozen friend with he if you 'll listen a moment may be you 'll find that he have a friend in the neighborhood now who will drive a pile in another place sure enough in a moment the same ringing blow come from a reedy spot in a different part of the bay the bird that make that noise say martin be about the homeliest creature in these wood it be a small gray heron that light down among the grass and weed to hunt for small frog and such little fish as swim along the shore when he drive he pile he stand with he neck and long bill point straight up and pump the air into he throat send it oat with the strange sound you have hear it be the resemblance of the sound to that make by drive a stake into ground cover with water that give he he name he be a awkward filthy bird but he help to make up the noise one hear in these wild region my first thought be say smith that we have get among the spirit of the wood and that they be ` rap ' they indignation at we presence there be something so human about it by the way remark the doctor and you remind I of the subject what a strange delusion be this spiritualism to the ` manifestation ' of which you refer and how singular it be that man of strong natural sense and cultivate mind should be draw into it we all know such they delusion too be stronger than mere speculative belief it be a faith which to they appear to amount to absolute knowledge they have no doubt or hesitancy on the subject they conviction be perfect such that be they as strong in they faith as christian as they be in the reality of spiritualism they would be able to move mountain i have notice this intensity of they faith say smith and while i utterly reject the whole theory of spiritualism i could never join in the ridicule of its earnest devotee there be something that command my respect in this strong faith when honestly entertain however stupendous the error may be to which it cling there be something to my mind too solemn for derision in the idea of commune with the spirit of the depart or that the time be approach when live man and the soul of the physically dead be to meet as it be face to face and know each other as they be it be one which i can and do reject but can not ridicule the world however regard it differently and yet with all the contempt and derision that have be pour upon this singular delusion its devotee have multiply beyond all precedent in the history of the world they number it be say in this country alone million and have some forty or more newspaper in the exclusive advocacy of they theory the wise people of this world say spalding that be those who be wise in they day and generation laugh at the believer in this modern theory of spiritualism they pity they too as the unhappy devotee of a faith which sober reason and all the experience of the past prove to be as unsubstantial as the moonbeam that dance upon the water at midnight still these same devotee point to the demonstration of what they regard as live fact phenomenon palpable to the sens thing that appeal to the eye the ear and the touch and say that these be higher proof than all the dogma of philosophy all the observation and experience of former time all the logic of the past and here be the issue between spiritualism and the mass of mankind who deride and condemn it now be it know to you that i be no spiritualist i reject not all the evidence of the phenomenon upon which it be base but i utterly deny that such phenomenon be the work of disembodied spirit i myself have see what utterly confound I and while i reject all idea of supernatural agency all interposition of depart spirit yet i have become thoroughly satisfy that there be more thing in heaven and earth than be dream of in we philosophy these phenomenon of which the spiritualist speak i will not undertake to pronounce all lie some of they be doubtless imposture -- the work of knave who speculate upon the credulity and superstition which be attribute of the human mind but they be not all such but while i admit they reality i insist that such as be so be the result of natural law which will one day be discover and which will turn out to be as simple as the spirit which preside over the telegraph or that which constitute the life of a steam engine there may be and probably be a great undiscovered principle which underlay these spiritual manifestation as they be call and mind be after it look for it carefully and what mind have once start in pursuit of earnestly it seldom fail to overtake i have sometimes amuse myself by endeavor to furnish a theory for the spiritualist to stand upon base upon the demonstration of the past the evidence bring to light by the research of science which at all event should have about it truth enough to give color and respectability even to a error as stupendous as that of spiritualism this theory i have predicate upon the progress of the material world aside from animal life show that what may have be impossible thousand of year ago may be possible or about become possible now that we be about enter upon a new era in the advancement of all thing towards perfectability and that the advent of that era may be mark by a established communication between the living and the spirit of the depart science demonstrate that the material world present in its history a illustration of the great principle and theory of progress it be quite certain that we planet be once a very different thing from what it be now it differ in form in substance in compactness in everything from its present condition we do not _ know _ that it be once wholly aeriform mere gas in combination too crude to admit of solidarity but reasoning back from established fact the conclusion be almost irresistible that this earth now so rock-ribbed and solid so ponderous so ragged with mountain range and cloud pierce peak be once but vapor float without form through limitless space drift as mere nebulous matter among the older creation of god however this may be it be regard as quite certain that time be when ft be entirely void of solidity void of dry land with no continent island or solid ground with no living thing within its circumference it be thus pass through one of the remote era of its existence it be then young just emerge as it be from nothingness grow into form assume shape and gathering attribute of fitness for exterior vitality prepare the way for higher existence than mere inorganic matter how long this era exist science have fail to demonstrate but it pass away and solid land mark the next era of the earth 's progress it be surround by a atmosphere absolutely fatal to animal life a atmosphere which while it stimulate vegetable growth no living thing could breathe and continue to live hence it be that vegetation gigantic almost beyond conception cover its surface fern which be now a pigmy plant nowhere higher than a few foot grow tall and overshadow like great oak while oak it be fair to presume tower thousand of foot towards the sky these stupendous forest stand alone upon the surface of the earth no animal wander through they fastness no bird sport amidst they mighty branch noxious exhalation come steam up from they tangled recess and they gloomy shadow lay a mantle of darkness over dreary and lifeless solitude the storm rage and the wind howl the sun travel its daily round with its light dim and cloud by the pestilential vapor it exhale and silence so far as the sound of animal life be concerned reign supreme -- the stillness of the grave the quiet of utter desolation save the voice of the wind or the storm be unbroken all over the face of the earth onward and onward roll this mighty orb on its pathway through the heaven bear with it no animal existence freight with no human hope -- carry with it nothing of human destiny man with all he lofty aspiration he mighty scheme he glory and he pride be a thing of the future he have not yet emerge from the eternity of the past to grapple with the present or encounter the retribution of the eternity which be to come this be the era of gigantic vegetable growth and it have its use for it be prepare the way for higher and more complicated existence as the gas that surround the earth become consolidated into vegetation as this stupendous growth decompose the noxious atmosphere draw from it its grosser particle and work they up into solid matter extract from it what be fatal to animal life this earth enter upon another era of its progress animal life make its appearance it be weak and feeble at first but a step remove from vegetable matter the molusca the polypus and the rudest form of fish be beyond question the first of live thing science demonstrate that the water bring forth the first creation endowed with animal vitality how long this era continue no man can tell then come the amphibise gigantic animal of the lizard kind the saurus that could reach with they long neck and ponderous jaw across a street and pick up a man if street and man there have be then come land animal monstrous in growth by the side of which the elephant dwindle to the diminutive stature of the dormouse in all these advance be a succession of step mount higher and higher in complication of structure each more perfect in organism than its predecessor vegetation itself become more complicated and as it approach perfection lose its gigantic growth solidarity compactness in all thing become the order of nature the atmosphere surround the earth become more and more fit for the higher and more complicated animal organization at last when time be ripe for he advent when the earth be fit for he residence and the air for he breathing man the last and most perfect in he structure the most delicate and finish in he organization of all live thing make he appearance he step from the hand of god the only thinking reflect the only intellectual responsible be in all the world he stand at the head of create matter with all thing on the earth subject to he will and correspond to he condition he attribute he necessity and he instinct thus this great earth itself have be but one continue illustration of the great theory and principle of progress from a begin lose in the thick darkness of a past eternity it have be march forward in a career as pause-less as the sun in he journeying through the sky as clearly demonstrable as the growth of the germ that start from the bury acorn and move on to its full development in the great oak science record with unerring certainty the progress of the earth and of animal life from the lowest existence in the mollusca and polypi up to the superlatively complicate and delicate structure of man trace it step by step until it be finish in the noblest work of god a human body couple with a immortal soul and here arise a question which science have not solve and to which the philosophy the wisdom the logic of the past can give no answer the earth and the thing of the earth have be move forward march on towards perfectability always be this forward movement finish we have in look at the subject in the light of science a time when there be not on the earth in the air or in the water any live thing we have a era when animal life be but a span remove from vegetable vitality we have a era of gigantic vegetable growth a era of gigantic but rude animal growth and so on step by step down to the advent of man the previous combination of animal life and vegetable life pass away with the era in which they flourish one class succeed another each emerge from and step over the annihilation of its predecessor till we come down to the present -- be there no future progress for this earth as a planet be there to be no other era where man himself like the saurus like the mastodon shall have pass away to be succeed by some nobler animal structure some loftier intelligence some more cunning invention of the infinite mind man great in intellect powerful in mind gifted with reason and have within he a spirit that be immortal proud glorious aspiring as he be fall very far short of perfection in every attribute of he nature to say therefore that the prescience the creative power of the almighty reach the limit of its achievement in the creation of man be to impeach the omnipotence of god himself will any man insist that the ingenuity of the almighty be exhaust may it not be then that the time will come when some sentient being as far superior to man as man be to the animal of the era of the lizard and the amphibium shall like the geologist of the present day be delving among the rock and rubbish of vanish age for evidence of the existence of we own proud species at to they some remote period of the world 's progress if these question can not be answer by the learn and the wise if science make no response and philosophy furnish no solution of they who dare say that the world be not even now enter upon a new era of progress take another step in the forward movement may it not be that the time be come when the barrier between the living and the disembodied spirit be to be break down when that viewless essence that mystery of mystery the spirit of life the immortal soul shall be permit to come back from the unknown country to impart to the people of this world the wisdom the mystery and the glory of the next may not this be the new era that be about open in the progress of all thing it may be ask be it not possible that a new principle be about be evolve that will admit of communication between the living and the physically dead may it not be that the world and its surroundings have become so change that what be impossible thousand or even hundred of year ago may have become or be about to become possible now that the same process which carry this earth forward from the beginning that so change the atmosphere of old render it fit to sustain animal life in its rudest structure that so change it again as to make it capable of sustain a higher order of animal organism that keep on change and improve the whole face of the earth that so arrange organic matter as to make this world at last a fit residence for man may be go on still approach all thing nearer and nearer to perfection until we have arrive upon the threshold of a era when live man may commune with the spirit of the physically dead a era as yet but in its dawn when the stupendous future can be see only as through a glass darkly remember i do not assert my faith in a theory which be indicate by a affirmative answer to these inquiry for i have none i give the record of the earth 's progress in the past as it be write upon the rock stand out upon precipice bring to light by the research and translate by the energy of science from forget and bury age the deduction to be draw from it i leave to those who have a taste for the speculative neither believe in nor quarrel with the theory which they may predicate upon it chapter xvii little topper 's lake -- a spike buck -- a thunder storm in the forest -- the howl of the wolf we spend the next day in coast round pond look into its secluded bay and rest when the sun be hot beneath the shadow of the brave old tree that line the bank in float along the shore of this beautiful sheet of water one can hardly help imagine that in the broken rock and rough stone pile up along the margin of the lake he see the rain of a ancient wall the mortar of which have become disintegrate by time and the masonry fall down he will see at interval what from a little distance seem like a solid wall of stone lay with care and upon which the lapse of century have work no change so regular be the stratum of which it be compose while a occasional boulder large as a house and cover with moss remind he of the ruin tower of some stronghold he will see as he round some rocky point half a dozen of these gigantic boulder pile together lean against each other with great cavernous opening between through which he can walk erect and he involuntarily look around he for the armor of the ancient giant who pile up these stupendous rock and wall in the lake with these massive boulder as we sweep around a point near the south shore of the lake we see a deer at a quarter of a mile from we feed upon the lily pad that grow along the shore spalding and myself be in advance of we little fleet and we boatman paddle we carefully and silently towards the animal use the paddle only when its head be down he would feed for a minute or two and then look carefully all around he of we he take no particular notice although we be within a hundred and fifty yard of he and even when we be within sixty yard he seem to regard we only as a log float upon the water or something else which might be regard as perfectly harmless spalding be in the bow of the boat and when within some eight rod of the game we lay perfectly quiet for a moment when he rifle speak out and its voice ring and re-echoed among the surround hill as if a whole platoon of musketry be blaze all around we the deer make three or four desperate leap in a zigzag direction and then go down when we get to he he be dead he be a fine two year old buck with spike horn and in excellent condition we take he saddle and skin and pass on from bind pond we row up the inlet a broad and sluggish stream full of grass and lily pad to little tapper 's lake we see several deer feed along the shore that discover we as we row carelessly along go whistle and snort away into the forest as we approach the lake dark cloud gather in the west great ugly look thunderhead come roll up from behind the hill higher and higher perfect stillness be all around we the leaf be moveless on the tree and the voice of the bird be hushed squire say martin to I i be thinkin ' we would better go ashore and put up we tent there be a mighty big storm over the hill and he 'll be down this way before many minute and we row to a high point at a small distance cover with spruce and fir tree and put up we tent on the lee side of it so as to be sheltered from the wind as well as the rain this be the work of only ten minute but before we have finish the deep voice of the thunder come roll over the forest and we could see the storm rise over the hill in a long black line all across the western sky the lightning dart down towards the earth or across from cloud to cloud and the thunder boom and roll along the heaven its deep rumble shake the ground like a earthquake presently the hill be hide from we view we hear the rush of the storm in the forest on the other side of the river then the splash of the big drop on the water and then the wind and the rain be upon we for a few minute i think we tent would have be lift bodily from the ground but the skill of we pioneer have provide against the blast and they remain stand safely over we in a short time the wind pass on leave the heavy rain to pour down in torrent and the deep voice thunder to come crash down to the earth or go roll solemnly and heavily along the sky it rain for a hour as it can do only among these mountain region the cloud and the rain at length sweep on and the bow of promise span the rear of the retire storm a new joy seem to take possession of the wild thing and gladness and merriment sound from every direction in the old wood a thin and shadowy mist hang like a veil over the water and a refreshing coolness as well as brightness and glory be all around we these storm of a hot summer day in this high region if one be prepare for they be full of pleasant interest they rise so majestically sweep along with such power and pass away so triumphantly leave behind they such a calm sweetness in the air that a journey to this wilderness would be imperfect in interest without witness they we enter little tripper 's lake towards evening at the north end and look down south one of the most beautiful view imaginable open upon we vision surround by low and undulating hill dot with island with long point run far out into the lake and pleasant little bay hide around behind wooded promontory it present a wild yet please landscape on which a painter 's eye could not rest but with delight and which transfer to canvas would make a picture of which any artist might be proud by the way i wonder that we artist do not summer among these mountain and lake sketch and paint the transcendently beautiful view they everywhere present there be nothing like they on all this continent we talk about the scenery of lake george it be all tame and spiritless compare with what may be see here it possess not a tithe of the variety the bold and grand the placid and beautiful all mingled and change always as you pass from point to point along these lake why do not the artist whose business it be to make the canvas speak drift out this way and deal with nature in all she ancient loveliness clothe in she primeval robe and smile in she freshness and beauty as when throw from the hand of deity it would repay they for they labor and yield they a rich harvest of gain we have hear of the shanty in which we be to encamp and we row straight through the whole length of the lake towards it we reach it as the sun be go down and stow away we luggage before the darkness have gather over the forest we take possession by the right of squatter sovereignty the owner be unknown or at all event absent from the wood this lake be one of the few in all this region that i have never visit before and be next in beauty to its namesake two day ' journey nearer to civilization it be about twelve mile in length and from one to two mile in width with many beautiful bay steal around behind bold rocky promontory and sleep in quiet beauty under the shadow of the tall forest tree that tower above they shore it be dot too with beautiful island some rise with a gentle slope from the water cover with scatter norway pine and a dense undergrowth of low bush other be cover with tall spruce fir and hemlock stand up in stately and solemn grandeur they arm lovingly intertwine through the everlasting verdure of which the sun never shine and other still be gigantic rock rise up out of the deep water all treeless and shrubless remain always in brown and barren desolation on which the eagle and osprey devour they prey and the flock of gull that frequent the lake ` light to rest from they almost ceaseless flight civilization have not as yet mar in anything this beautiful sheet of water even the lumberman have not force he way to the majestic old pine that tower in stately grandeur above the forest tree of a lesser growth not a foot of laud have be clear within thirty mile of it the old wood stand around it just as god place they in all they pristine solemnity stately and motionless the wild thing that roam among they in the day of old be there still and the same species of bird that sport in they branch thousand of year ago be there still we hear the howl of the wolf at night we hear the scream of the panther we see the track of the moose and where he have feed on the pasture along the shore we see the footprint of a huge bear in the sand on the beach and the deer-path be like those that lead to a sheep-fold it be a pleasant thing to row along the shore into the bay around the island and into the creek that come in from other little lake deeper in the wilderness the bank be mostly bold and bluff the rock stand up four or eight foot from the water or break and fall like a ancient wall here and there be a long stretch of beautiful sandy beach on which the tiny wave break with a ripple song and from which bar go out with a gentle slope into the water we intend to remain here quietly for a few day take thing easy rowing and fishing and hunting enough for exercise only there be plenty of deer and trout and duck and partridge here to be take with small labor there be bear and wolf and panther in the wood around but these be fewer and harder to be come at than the other game there be a occasional moose too we see the track of all these animal hereabouts and we hope to get a shot at some or all of they before leave the wood reader do you ever hear the wolf howl in the old wood of a still night no then you have not hear _ all _ the music of the forest some deep-mouthed old forester will open he jaw and send forth a volume of sound so deep so loud so changeful so undulating and variable in its character that as it roll along the forest and come back in quaver echo from the mountain you will almost swear that he single voice be a agglomerate of a thousand all mixed and mingled and roll up into one may be away in the distance possibly on the other side of the lake or across a broad valley another will open he mouth and answer with a howl as deep and wild and variable as the first and possibly a third and fourth one on the right and another on the left will join in the chorus until the whole forest seem to be fall of howling and noise and yet not one of these animal may be within a mile of you to a timid man there be something terrific in the howl of the wolf but in truth they be harmless as the deer quite as wild and shy and full as cowardly in the presence of a man they will fly as frighten from he approach unless possibly in the intense cold and desolation of winter when drive together and render desperate by hunger they might be embolden by starvation to attack a man but even this be among the apocryphal legend of the wilderness hear they wolf howlin ' say hank martin as we sit in the evening around we camp fire remind I of a story mark shuff tell of he experience with the critter but mind i do not pretend to swear to its truth for i do not claim to know anything about the fact myself i 'll tell it as mark tell it to I and if it turn out to be too tough a yarn to take down whole do not lay it to I you know mark shuff say he appeal to I and you may believe such part of it as you may be able to swallow and the rest may be divide up as the doctor say the other day among the company go ahead say the doctor i 'll take a quarter as my share of the story and you may cut it off of either end or carve it out of the middle i 'll take a quarter tough or tender you may set down a quarter to my account say smith and spalding shall take another very well then say martin i 'll believe a quarter of it myself and so the case be make up as the judge would say well repeat martin you know mare shuff of course i know mark shuff and who that have visit these lake and wood do not know he he be a stalwart man six foot in he stocking strong healthy and enduring as iron i have have he as a boatman and guide about tupper 's lake and the region beyond it more than once he work at lumber in the winter and if there be one among the hundred i have almost say thousand who make war in the snowy season of the year upon the old pine of the rackett wood who can swing a axe more effectually than mark shuff he light be under a bushel -- he fame obscure mark work hard for four or five month and lay around loose the balance of the year in the summer he hold a cost as a thing of ornament rather than use and boot or shoe as luxury not to be reckon as among the necessaries of life he hat as a general thing be of straw and minus a little more than half the brim he would be out of place and out of uniform as well as out of temper with himself if he be for any considerable length of time without the stub of a marvelously black pipe in he mouth fill with plug tobacco shave and rub in he hand into a proper condition for smoking mark though by no mean a intemperate man be fond of a drop now and then and when he have just a thimbleful too much the way he will swear be emphatically a sin and yet he be anything but quarrelsome or contrary even when a shade over the line of strict sobriety he be a great strong square-shouldered big-breasted good-natured specimen of the genus homo a giant in physical strength and be i a wolf i would prefer let he alone to any man in these part when he get just the least grain shiny -lrb- and he never get beyond that -rrb- and he oar go a little wrong or a twig brush he ungently or he seat get a little hard he will express he sense of its improper deportment by incontinently damn its eye and so forth as if it be a sentient thing and understand all he profane denunciation but with all this mark never forget to be respectful and in he way courteous to he employer he have moreover a sharp clear eye in he head and can see a deer or any other game as quick and shoot it as far as the best and have as good a knowledge of where they be to be find as any man in these wood well continue martin as he light he pipe by dip it into the ember and scoop up a small coal well mark shuff and a friend of he by the name of westcott have a shanty one winter over on tupper 's lake they be trappin ' martin and mink and muskrat and wolf when they could get one they shanty on the outlet just at the foot of the lake below the high rocky bluff round which the little bay there sweep there be not any house then nearer than harriet town down by the lower saranac but there be a company of lumberman have a shanty up towards the head of the lake near where the bog river enter mark one cold winter 's morning start on a errand to the lumber shanty i speak of calculatin ' to return the same evening the lake be freeze over and he take to the ice as be the nearest and best travelin ' the winter have set in airly and the snow have lie deep for month and the game of the wood have get pretty well starve out mark do ` nt take he rifle with he thinkin ' of course that he would see no game on the ice worth shootin ' and a gun would only be a incumbrance to he well he do he errand at the shanty and start for home i do not know whether he take a drop or not but they generally keep a barrel of old rye in the lumber shanty and my opinion be that mark be invite to take a horn in which case i be bold to say the horn be take however that may be mark start for home along in the afternoon and take to the ice as he do when he go up in the morning everything go right until he get within may be a mile of home when he hear from a point of land a little to the left of he a sharp fierce bark and turn that way he see a great shaggy fierce-looking wolf trot out from behind a boulder and squat himself down on he haunch and eye he as if calculate the probability of he make a good supper while mark be look at he feelin ' a little oneasy he hear another sharp bark and from a point just ahead of he another great wolf trot out on to the ice and sit himself down eye he with suspicious intensity in a moment another come out right opposite to he and then another and another until mark swear to this day that there be more than a dozen of these fierce and hungry savage squat on they haunch within fifty yard of he mark as i say have no rifle he only weapon be a hunting knife and a heavy walking stick which he carry in he hand to say that he be not frighten would be state what i do not believe to be true and i have hear he tell how he huntin ' cap seem to be lift right up on he head as if every hair point straight towards the sky he look at the wolf a moment and then walk on but the animal trot along with he still however keepin ' at a respectful distance those in advance seem inclined to cross he path as if to turn he towards the center of the lake while those behind go further and further from the shore as if to surround he and thus they travel for near half a mile mark make for the open water which in the coldest weather be always to be find near the outlet of the lake determine if they come to close quarter to take to that and swim for it he have hear and know that almost every animal be afraid of the voice of a man so he shout at the top of he voice and as he say rip out some select and choice oath which for a moment alarm the wolf and they fall back a few rod still however keepin ' in a kind of half circle around he but it be ` nt long before they begin to gather in on he again and though he shoutin ' and swearin ' keep they at a good distance yet they seem to be gettin ' use to it and it do not alarm they as it do at first mark have now get within reach of the water and he feel comparatively safe he be not more than a quarter of a mile from home and cold as it be he feel sure that he could swim that distance before be compel to take to the water it occur to he to halloo for westcott which he do with all he might the wolf do ` nt appear to care much about he hallooing but keep trottin ' along between he and the shore and before and behind he drawin ' the circle closer and closer every ten rod and mark expect every moment when they would make a rush on he in which case he have make up he mind to make a dive into the water along which he be now travelin ' presently he see westcott with he double-barrelled rifle stealin ' along the shore hide from the kritter by a high rocky point within some twenty rod of he he feel all right then for he know that when westcott pint that rifle at anything something have to come it be a dangerous piece that rifle be ` specially when load and westcott be at one end of it mark be not more than fifteen rod from the shore but that ground be occupy by the wolf on the right be the water into which he might at any moment be compel to plunge while both before and behind he he advance and retreat be alike cut off he have notice that whenever he stop the wolf stop as if the time for the rush have not yet come and it puzzle he to understand why they delay the onset see westcott with he rifle mark determine to treat he assailant to a choice lot of profane epithet and the way he open on the cowardly rascal he say astonished even himself but while he be thus swearing at he enemy he discover as he think the reason why they have not attack he sooner a troop of a dozen or more wolf break cover some distance up the lake and come runnin ' down towards where he stand for whose presence no doubt those around he be wait just then he see westcott 's huntin ' cap above the rock on the point and see he double-barrel poke out in the direction of the leader of the pack and he know that that old grey-back 's time have come mark let off a fresh volley of profanity and as the wolf seem prepare for a rush westcott 's rifle break the frozen stillness of the wood and old grey-back turn a summerset and go down the astonished wolf cluster together for a moment in confusion and the other barrel speak out another of the pack bound into the air and as he come down kick and thrash about in a most oncommon way and then lay still -- while the way the rest put out for the point some distance up the lake be a thing to be astonish at mark throw up he hat and holler and shout and swear till the last wolf disappear into the forest and then shoulderin ' one of the dead kritter and westcott the other start on home the hide and the bounty on the scalp make a good day 's work of it but mark swear to this day that if the last dozen of wolf have be a little earlier or westcott a little later he would a-be drive like a buck to the water cold as it be and if they would be a little earlier still he would have be a goner he never go far from home since without a rifle although with that he have no fear of wolf yet he conclude that a hunting-knife and a stick be no match for a whole pack of the kritter when make savage by the starvation of winter -lrb- illustration : westcott 's rifle break the frozen stillness of the wood and old greyback turn a summerset and go down the astonished wolf cluster together for a moment in confusion and the other barrel speak out -rrb- while we be listen to the story of mark shuff and the wolf the old fellow over the water make the forest ring again with he howl he be answer from mile away down the lake by another they voice keep the forest echo busy until we lay ourselves away in we blanket where we sleep till waken by the glad voice of the bird in the early morning chapter xviii a explore voyage in a alder swamp -- a beaver dam -- a fair shot and a miss -- drown a bear -- a unpleasant passenger we start the next morning on a explore voyage round the lake to look into the bay and inlet try the fish and deer and see what we could see generally we strike across to a island opposite we landing-place contain five or six acre cover with a dense growth of spruce hemlock and fir with a occasional pine stand with its tall head proudly above the other forest tree while along the ground the low whortleberry bush load with fruit now just ripening grow this island be near the south shore and separate from it by a narrow channel some twenty rod in width we land and be regale ourselves upon the berry leave we boat and gun on the lake side of the island we have wander near the center of the island when three deer start up within two rod of we and rush whistle and snort in huge astonishment across the island in the direction of the mainland and dash wildly into the water swam to the shore and disappear into the forest we in truth be little less astonished than they for we certainly expect no such game to be hide there and when they leap up so suddenly and plunge away crash and snort through the brush it startle we somewhat but we boat and gun be on the other side of the island and we could only look on as they swim boldly to the shore without the power to harm they at the east end of the lake a large stream deep sluggish and tortuous enter which we vote come from a lake or pond back at the base of the hill see some three or four mile distant in that direction and while the other boat pass in another direction spalding and myself start upstream to explore it as we advance the alder and willow encroach more and more upon the channel until it become too narrow for rowing we boatman take he paddle and seat in the stern of we little craft propel it up stream for a hour or more the alder gradually contract the channel become narrower until we be pass under a low archway of branch cover with dense foliage through which the sunlight could not penetrate the arch grow lower and lower and the channel narrower until we at last absolutely stick fast among the branch of the alder which here grow almost horizontally over the stream we could not turn round and to go further be absolutely impossible there be but one mode of extrication and that be to back straight out the way we have enter we boatman change he position to the bow of the boat and after much labor and exertion we start down stream after two hour of hard work push with the oar and pull by the branch we emerge into daylight come out into the open stream not a little fatigued by we effort to find the imaginary pond at the base of the mountain this stream with the broad alder marsh that stretch away on either side be doubtless once a beaver dam and we think we could discover where these singular and sagacious animal have erect the structure that make for they a artificial lake we theory on this subject may have be true or false but this much be a fact that in all this region of lake and river i have see no alder or other marsh of any considerable extent save this in the time of old when the indian and he brother the beaver live quietly together before the greed of the white man have build up a war of extermination between they this must have be a glorious country for the beaver the lake be so numerous and the pond and river so fit for they that they must have have a good time of it here for century the indian never disturb they never make war upon they they flesh be not need or fit for food and the value of they fur be unknown tradition speaking from the dim and shadowy past tell we of the vast number of these sagacious and harmless animal which congregate in these region live in undisturbed quiet and happiness all the year build they dam they canal and city on all the pond river and lake hereabouts but they be all go now i inquire if any have be see of late year and could hear of but a single family which some ten year ago be say to dwell somewhere in the vicinity of mud lake the highest and wildest of all these mountain lake the last of these be take four or five year ago since which no sign of the beaver have be discover they be doubtless all go and as this be they last abiding-place they may be regard as extinct on this side of the alleghany range and probably on this side of the eastern slope of the rocky mountain like the beaver the indian who turn against he will soon be go too annihilation be write as the doom of both the wild man must pass away with the wood and the forest before the onward rush of civilization and history will soon be all that will remain of the indian and he ancient brother the beaver well be it so and who will regret it it be a sad thing to see a whole race perish wipe out from the aggregate of human existence but in this instance its place will be fill by a higher and nobler race and the hunting-ground of the savage and the pagan be convert into cultivate field where stand the wigwam will stand the farm-house where the council-fire blaze will stand the hall of enlighten and christian legislation church and school-house and all the accompaniment of christianity and civilization will take the place of ancient forest and educate intellectual cultivate mind take the place of the rude untaught and unteachable man and woman of the wood as we re-enter the lake we see a noble buck feed along the shore a short distance from we we drop behind a point of willow from the outer edge of which we would be in shooting distance we paddle silently round the point and there within fifteen rod of we he stand broad side to we present as beautiful a mark as a man could wish i count he certainly ours when i draw upon he with my rifle well i blaze away and as i do so he raise he head suddenly gaze in astonishment at we for a moment with he ear throw forward and in a attitude of wildness and then dash madly away into the forest snort like a war-horse at every bind i have not touch he and i know it the moment i fire we little boat be light and rollish and just as i press the trigger it roll slightly on the water and my ball pass over but mighty close to the back of that deer i be mortify enough at this mishap for i prided myself on my coolness and marksmanship and here be a failure apparently more inexcusable than any that have occur but there be no help for it the deer be go and spalding and the boatman indulge in a hearty laugh at my expense some half a mile up the lake we see a great turtle sun himself on a rock which be partly out of water he be twice as large as any of the fresh-water kind i have ever see he shell be all of two foot in diameter and he scaly arm as they hang loosely over the side of the rock be as large as the wrist of a man he be some six or eight rod from we and spalding give he a shot with he rifle the ball glance harmlessly from he massive shell against the ledge behind he and start from he sleep he clamber lazily and clumsily into the water we throw out a trolling line as we pass up the lake but we catch no trout along the shore however we catch small one in plenty with the fly these shore trout as i call they seem to be a distinct species differ in many respects from the other trout of the lake or stream they be uniform in size rarely exceed a quarter of a pound in weight they be of a whitish color longer in proportion than the lake river or brook trout have fewer speck upon they and those not of a golden hue but rather like freckle they be find among the broken rock where the shore be bold and bluff or near the mouth of the cold brook that come down from the hill i catch they at every trial and whenever we want they for food they flesh be white and excellent -- better to my taste than that of any other fish of these water we rejoin we companion in a little bay that lay quietly around a rocky promontory where we find they enjoy a dinner of venison and trout under the shade of some huge firtree by the side of a beautiful spring that come bubble up in its icy coldness from beneath the tangled root of a stinted and gnarled birch happily there be enough for we all and we accept at once the invitation extend to we to dine towards evening we row back to we shanty the breeze have entirely cease and the lake lay still and smooth not a wave agitate its surface not a ripple pass across its stirless bosom the wood along the shore and the mountain in the back ground the glowing sunlight upon the hill-top be mirror back from its quiet depths as if there be other forest and other mountain and hill glowing in the evening sunshine away down below twin to those above and around we we see on we return along the beach the track of a bear in the sand that have be make during the day and we have some talk of try the scent of we dog upon it but it be too near night to allow of a hope of secure he even if the dog could follow and we give up the idea promise to attend to bruin 's case another day as we sit with we meerschaum in the evening speculate upon the chance of secure a bear or a moose before leave the wood a wolf lift up he voice on the hill opposite as and make the old forest ring again with he howl he be answer as in the night previous from away down the lake and by another from the hill back of we and another still from the narrow gorge above the head of the lake however discordant the music appear to we they seem to enjoy it for they keep it up at interval during all the early part of the night see that bear 's track and hear the howl of those wolf say the doctor remind I of a story i hear tell by a old ohio pilot whom i find in drift down that noble river in a pirogue some five and twenty year ago we tie up one night by the side of another similar craft that have go down ahead of we the people on board of which have land and build a camp-fire and erect they tent they be stranger to we but in those day everybody you meet in the wilderness which skirt the upper ohio be you friend if you choose to regard he so i be a mere boy then and be in company with my father and three other gentleman who own a township of land not far from cincinnatus that be not far now consider the difference in the mode of travel between then and now and we be on we way to explore that township i do not regard it as of much value then though it have since bring a heap of money to its owner we find the company belong to the other boat busily employ in cook a supper of venison and bear-meat they have in the course of the day kill two deer and a bear that they find swim the river we be invite to help ourselves a invitation which be cordially give we as cordially accept we have be pass during most of the day through unbroken forest stand up in stately majesty on both side of the river and stretch back the lord know how far after the darkness gather the wolf make the wilderness vocal with they howl it be the first time i have ever hear they and for that matter the last until since we have be in these wood : but when that old fellow over the lake lift up he voice last night i recognize it at once i can not say i admire it as a musical performance then and i do not appreciate its harmony now if there be those who like it why _ de gustibus non _ and so forth but i set out to tell the story that the old ohio pilot tell that night while the traveller sit smoking around they camp-fire and the wolf be howl in the wilderness about we i do not of course vouch for its truth i simply tell it as he tell it to we he seem to believe it himself for he tell it with a gravity of face and a seriousness of manner which would ill comport with its falsity he hearer do not seem to regard it as pass belief but they laugh at the idea of drown a bear ` twenty odd year ago ' say the old pilot as he light he pipe and seat himself on the head of a whisky-keg ` there war not a great many people along the ohio except ingin and bear and we do not like to cultivate a very close acquaintance with either of they for the ingin be cheatin ' deceivin ' and scalpin ' critter and the bear have a onpleasant way with 'em that people of delicate narve do not like i come out for some people over on the east side of the mountain lookin ' land in company with four man who have hunt over the country ohio war not any great shake then but let I tell you stranger it have a mighty big pile of the tallest kind of land layin ' around waitin ' to be open up to the sunlight it be goin ' ahead now and people be rushin ' matter in the way of settlin ' of it but you could stick down a stake most anywhere in it then and travel in any direction a hundred mile climbin ' a fence ` wal we come down the alleghany in two canoe and shanty on the ohio just below where the alleghany empty itself into it we hide we canoe and strike across the country and travel about explorin ' for six week and when we get back to we shantyin ' ground we be tucker out you may believe we rest here a couple of day layin ' around loose and takin ' we comfort in a way of we own early one morning when my companion be asleep i get up and paddle across the river after a deer for we want venison for breakfast i get a buck and be returnin ' when what should i see but a bear swimmin ' the ohio and i put out in chase right off i soon overhaul the critter and pick up my rifle to give he a settler when i find that in paddlin ' i have spatter water into the canoe wettin ' the primin ' and makin ' the gun of no more use than a stick i do not understand much about the natur of the beast then and think i would run he down and drown he or knock he on the head so i put the canoe right end on towards he thinkin ' to run he under but when the bow touch he what do he do but reach he great paw up over the side of the canoe and begin to climb in i have not bargain for that i feel mighty onpleasant you may swear at the prospect of havin ' sich a passenger i have not time to get at he with the rifle till he come tumblin ' into the dugout and as he seat himself on he stern show as pretty a set of ivory as a body would wish to see there we sit he in one end of the dugout and i in the other eyein ' one another in a mighty suspicious sort of way he do not seem inclined to come near my end of the dugout and i be principled agin goin ' towards he i make ready to take to the water on short notice but at the same time conclude i would paddle he to the shore if he would allow I to do it quietly ` wal i paddle away the bear every now and then grinnin ' at I skinnin ' he face till every tooth in he head stand right out and grumblin ' to himself in a way that seem to say ' i wonder if that chap 's good to eat ' i do not offer any opinion on the subject i do not say a word to he treatin ' he all the time like a gentleman but keep pullin ' for the shore when the canoe touch the ground he clamber over the side and climb up the bank and givin ' I a extra grin start off into the wood i push the dugout back suddenly and give he as i feel safe again a double war-whoop that seem to astonish he for he quicken he pace mightily as if quite as glad to part company as i be i larned one thing stranger that mornin ' and it be this never to try drownin ' a bear by runnin ' he under with a dugout it will not pay ' chapter xix spalding 's bear story -- climb to avoid a collision -- a unexpected meeting -- a race that story say spalding remind _ I _ of a bear story i shall do as the doctor do tell it as it be tell to I i do not see the bear but i know the man who be the hero of it and he brother tell the story in he presence one day and he make no denial he at least be estop from dispute it and we lawyer call that _ prima facie _ evidence of its truth it occur a long time ago when there be fewer green field in oswego county and especially in the town of mexico than there be now the old wood stand there in all they primeval grandeur the wave of ontario lave a wilderness shore and they dull sound as they come roll in upon the rocky beach die away in the solitude of a gloomy and almost boundless forest here and there a ` clearing ' let in the sunlight and the woodman 's axe break the forest stillness as he battle against the brave old tree the smoke of burn fallow be occasionally see wreathing in dense column towards the sky civilization enterprise energy and new life be just start on that career of progress which have move onward till the wilderness under the influence of they mighty power have be make to blossom as the rise those be pleasant time as we look upon they now just fading into the dim and shadowy past but they be time of toil and privation the arm of the man of those time be nerve by the hope of the future and the spirit that sustain they be that of faith in the fact that the promise of reward for they labor be sure do the man of the present day ever think what a gigantic labor that be of clear away those old forest contemplate a wilderness reach from the atlantic to the mississippus from the great lake and the majestic st lawrence to the gulf of mexico every acre of which be cover with tall tree which have to be cut away one by one not with some great machine which mow they down in broad swath like the grass of a meadow but by a single arm and a single axe talk about the pyramid the chinese wall the great canal of the earth they sink into utter insignificance when compare with the prodigious labor of clear away the american forest and spread out green field where we father find only a limitless wilderness of wood the son of these man who perform that labor in my judgment have a better patent to preferment and honor than those who come from other land to claim they inheritance after it have be thus perfect by such toil and hardship and danger as the history of the world can not parallel i think if i remember rightly say the dr you set out to tell a bear story you be now indulge in a sermon on progress allow I to call you attention to the bear i appeal to the court say spalding address smith and myself against this interruption the counsel will proceed say smith with all the gravity of a judge we hope the interruption will not be repeat well say spalding resume he narrative some fifty year ago two enterprising man -lrb- brother -rrb- march into the wood in the town of mexico now in oswego county with they axis on they shoulder and stout heart beat in they bosom they locate a mile or more apart and begin a warfare such as civilization wages against the old forest tree man talk about courage on the battle-field the face of danger amid the conflict of armed host and the crash of battle all that be well but what be such courage stimulate by excitement and brace by the ignominy which follow the laggard in such a strife to that calm endure moral courage of he who encounter the toil and hardship incident to the settlement of a new country and battle with the danger the long year of privation which lie before the pioneer who go into the forest to carve out a home for himself and he child how much more noble be such courage how infinitely superior be such a warfare one which mow down forest tree instead of man which create green pasture broad meadow and field of wave grain instead of smoulder city and desolate home how much more pleasant be the sound of the woodman 's axe than that of the booming cannon how much more cheerful the smoke that go up from the burning fallow than that which hang in darkness over the desolation of the battle field beneath which lie the dead in they stillness and the wound in they agony but i be lose sight of the bear exactly so say the doctor and we have not as yet have the pleasure of make he acquaintance suppose you give we a introduction to the gentleman these interruption be entirely out of order gravely remark smith they must not be repeat the counsel will proceed well resume spalding bow deferentially to the court one of these settler start one day across the wood to visit he brother there be few road in those time and these be lay out without much reference to distance they go wind and crook every way to avoid this hill or that creek or water course or any other impediment which nature may have throw in the way and a blind footpath or a line of marked tree be more commonly travel from one forest house to another the forester be tramp cheerfully along think doubtless of the good time come when he farm would be shear of all its old wood when flock and herd would be grazing in luxurious pasture tall grain wave in field the summer grass clothing in richness meadow reclaim by he labor from the wilderness and he should be at ease among he child first settler of a new country think of these thing and it be because they think of they that they heart be strong and buoyant with hope they live in the future endure the darkness and privation of the present in they faith in the brightness of the year to come thus they wait in patience for while they command success and the end of they toil be a old age of competence and in the closing year of life quiet and repose well he be enjoy these pleasant vision when he see some thirty rod ahead of he a huge bear with she cub ` travel he way ' as the say be in other word come directly towards he he be no hunter and have with he no weapon he have hear strange story of the ferocity of the bear when she cub be by she side and to say that he be not horribly frighten would be a departure from the strict requirement of truth he have hear too that a bear could not climb a small straight tree and _ he _ could the question then be between climbing and run he be not much in a race and he decide to climb so select a smooth-barked perpendicular ash sapling he start with might and main towards the top he go up as he suppose till he be out of the reach of the bear and hold on all the time keep he eye on the animal and make as little noise as possible the bear doubtless see that he be beyond she reach pass on out of sight and after he remain till the danger be over he conclude to come down he be astonish to find that he effort to descend be powerless he seem to have freeze to the tree upon look around to he utter amazement he find himself sit on the ground _ with both leg and arm lock fast around the tree he have not climb a inch and the bear have not be aware of he presence in the wood _ that ash sapling be safe from that day it stand then in the old forest the woodman 's axe spare it it stand now in the open field a majestic tree its great trunk eight foot in circumference its long arm cover with foliage cast a broad shadow over the pasture beneath in which cattle and sheep seek for coolness and ruminate in the heat of the summer day it be point out as the tree which the man who be frighten by a bear _ do not _ climb and be refer to as evidence of the truth of my story as the dutchman prove the authenticity of he bible ` by the picture ' and that say i put _ I _ in mind of a bear story which have this merit over both of yours -- it be true i can speak of it as a thing of personal knowledge occur within my own personal experience i begin the study of law in angelica the county seat of alleghany county and as it be a good many year ago it be fair to assume that i be a good many year younger than i be now and that the country in that region be younger too everybody know that alleghany county be or use to be a great place for whirlwind and tornado if they do not they may understand and be assure of the fact now a few year -lrb- less than twelve -rrb- ago a black cloud come loom up in the northwest and start on its career towards the southeast as it sweep along it send its fierce wind crash and howl and roar through the old forest uproot hurl to the ground and scattering everything that encounter its fury house barn haystack fence tree everything be prostrate and to this day its track be visible in the swath it mow through the old wood from sixty to a hundred rod wide plain and distinct still for mile and mile it be not of that tornado however that i propose to speak other have precede it and in the country all about angelica be what be call ` windfall ' these windfall be neither more nor less than the old track of these whirlwind and tornado that have sweep down the forest tree fire have finish what the whirlwind begin in time blackberry-bush have grow up among the char trunk of the old pine and other tree bear a immensity of fruit and it be a pleasant resort for young people one of those windfall when the blackberry be ripe and luscious these windfall be great place too for rabbit partridge and ` such small deer ' and it be no great thing to boast of to kill a dozen or two of the bird of a afternoon i go out with a friend one day to one of these windfall partly after blackberry and partly for partridge we be both boy younger than fifteen then and each possess probably quite as much discretion as valor we have separate a short distance from each other he to gather berry and i with a small fowling-piece in pursuit of game presently i see my friend crash through the brush towards I and also towards the field without he basket and bare head he hair stand straight up put in he very best jump as if a thousand tiger be at he heel without heed for a moment my anxious inquiry as to what be the matter he keep right on leap the log like a deer look neither to the right hand nor the left but with he coat tail stick out on a dead level behind make a straight wake for home fear be say to be contagious and i believe in the doctrine that it be so i catch it bad and without know what i be afraid of i start and if any fourteen year old boy can make better time than i do on that occasion i should like to see he run i keep possession of my fowling-piece and come out neck and neck with my friend we scramble over the outer fence and run some dozen rod or more in the open field without either of we look back then however we make the astounding discovery that there be nothing after we and we both pause to take breath and so far as i be concern to ascertain if possible what have occasion the race i learn that my friend after i leave he have go into the windfall and be stand upon the long trunk of a fall tree pick berry when he see a few rod from he towards the other end of the log on which he be stand a great black hand reach up and bend down a tall blackberry-bush that be load with berry this alarmed he somewhat for whoever the great black hand belong to be conceal by the thick bush and they foliage from he view presently two great black hand be place upon the log and a huge black bear clamber lazily up and for a second stand in utter amazement face to face and within fifty foot of my friend both break at the same instant in affright my friend in one direction and the bear in the other -- my friend for the field and the bear for the deep wood -- and each as anxious as fear could make he to put a ` broad belt of country ' between they my friend drop he basket as he leap from the log it be no time to stop for a basket a limb catch he hat and pull it off he have not time to stop for he hat the truth be he be in a hurry and something more than a hat or a basket be require to stay he progress towards home the squire 's story say cullen as he knock the ash from he pipe and commence shave a fresh supply of tobacco with he jack-knife and deposit it in the palm of he left hand the squire 's story remind I of a adventer crop and i meet with over towards st regi lake a good many year ago and i 'll state the circumstance of the case as the judge would say it be a adventer that do not happen often -- leastwise not in the same way it make I understand some thing that i have not much idea of before let I tell you judge if you do not want a fight with a animal that be get long claw and sharp tooth do not come close upon he onaware or may be there 'll be trouble give he time to think and ten to one he 'll take to he heel most animal have more confidence in they leg than they have in they tooth and claw and they 'll be very likely to use 'em if you 'll give 'em time to consider but if you find a painter or a bear takin ' a nap in you path and do not want to have a clinch with he wake he up before you get right onto he or he 'll be very likely to think he be corner and they animal have onpleasant way with 'em when they be in that fix wal as i be sayin ' crop and i be over on st regi lake layin ' in a store of jerk venison and trappin ' martin and mink and muskrat and huntin ' wolf and sich other wild animal as come in we way the scalp of a wolf be good for fifteen dollar in they day and a backload of fur be worth a heap of money we have a line of martin trap leadin ' back to the hill and over into a valley beyond where the animal be plentier than they be on we side in passin ' along this line we have to round the end of a hill that terminate in a sharp point of rock in a deep gully at its foot a stream go surgin ' over rapid the bank on the side towards the hill be may be twenty foot high and a right up and down ledge above this ledge and between it and the rocky point be a narrow path only three or four foot wide that turn short around the end of the hill on the left hand be the ledge and at the bottom of it be break rock and on the right be a bluff point of rock that make up the end of the hill standin ' straight up may be fifty foot around this point the path turn sharp almost as you elbow i be passin ' quietly round this pint lookin ' down into the gully with crop at my heel when on turnin ' the short elbow there i stand face to face and within ten foot of a mighty big bear that be travellin ' my way as the judge say i have no idee that he be around and i be quite sartain he do not expect to meet a human in such a place of course we be naterally astonish at seein ' one another just then and the meetin ' do not seem to be altogether agreeable to either party i be not easily scare when i have time to prepare for a scrimmage yet i be free to say i would have give a couple of wolf-scalp to have be on the other side of the gully just at that time the bear seem to expect I to begin the fight for after gruntin ' out in a very oncivil way he surprise at makin ' my acquaintance he rear himself up on eend and with a fierce growl show a set of ivory that be not pleasant to look at i should have be willin ' myself to have back down and apologize for my rudeness in crossin ' he path for i be carryin ' my rifle carelessly in my left hand and we meetin ' be so sudden that i scarcely have time to bring it to bear upon the kritter i rather think i should have dodge back any how but crop seem to think he master be in danger and that he be obligate live or die to go in so quick as a flash he rush by I and throw himself into the very face of the desperate brute crop make a great mistake when he calculate he be a match for that bear for with one cuff the animal send he eend over eend down the bank upon the broken rock below but the little time that be so occupied save I a deal of trouble and danger for it last just long enough for I to bring my rifle into position which i do about the quickest you may bet you life on that i run my eye along the barrel sight he between the eye and pull the bear keel over onto he back with a jerk give a spiteful kick with both hind foot and he too go over the ledge onto the sharp rock below i look over and see crop staggerin ' to he foot and lookin ' about in a bewildered way as if not quite understandin ' how he come there i go round a little way and get down into the gully where the animal be i find the bear stone dead and crop with two rib break and he shoulder out of joint whinin ' and moanin ' piteously with pain i set he shoulder as well as i could and after takin ' the skin off the bear i back he two mile to my shanty it be a fortnight before he ` leave the house ' but he learn a little piece of wisdom by that cuff that send he down the bank and get a little insight into the nater of a angry bear -lrb- illustration : crop make a great mistake when he calculate he be a match for that bear for with one cuff the animal send he eend over eend down the bank upon the broken rock below but the little time that be so occupied save I a deal of trouble and danger for it last just long enough for I to bring my rifle into position which i do about the quickest you may bet you life on that -rrb- chapter xx the chase on the island -- the chase in the lake -- the bear -- gamble for glory -- anecdote of noah and the gentleman who offer to officiate as pilot on board the ark we have as yet have no use for we dog since we leave the saranac they have travel quietly with we as we move from place to place or stay inactive at the tent while we remain stationary the game be so abundant that the real difficulty be to restrain ourselves from destroy more than be needful for we use we have indeed fail to live strictly up to the law we have impose upon ourselves for we have at all time trout and venison beyond we present want excuse ourselves on the ground that a excess of supply be always preferable to a scant commissariat more than one deer be slaughter if the truth must be tell for no better reason than that give by a irishman for smash a bald head he chance to see at a window : it present a mark too tempting to be resist the lake from we camping ground we station two of we boat between the island and the shore nearest the main land and the other on the opposite side and send cullen upon the island to beat for game it be scarcely five minute before the voice of the dog break upon the stillness of the morning in a simultaneous and fierce cry as if they have start the game suddenly and fresh from he lair away they go in full cry across the island the deer sweep around the upper end and return on the opposite side as if loth to take to the water but true to they instinct the hound follow make the hill and the old wood ring again with the music of they voice presently a noble buck break cover directly opposite to where the doctor and smith 's boat lay as we object be rather to enjoy the music of the chase than to capture the deer they shout and halloo as he enter the water and he wheel back and go tear in huge affright through the wood up the island again still the howl be upon he trail and as he approach the upper end he again take to the water to be frighten back by martin and myself and with renew energy he bound across to a point stretch out into the lake on the opposite side here spald and wood be station and they by they shout drive he back again to the thicket by this time the poor animal begin to appreciate the full peril of he position for turn where he would he find a enemy in front while the cry of he pursuer follow he like he destiny thus far every effort to escape by take to the water have fail and he seem to think as martin express it that day be break he essay it again on the land side and be drive back by we and thus he course three time round the island until in desperation he plunge into the broad lake and strike boldly out for the opposite shore three quarter of a mile distant spalding shout to we and when we round the headland we see that he and wood have head and be drive he towards a small island of less than half a acre cover only with low bush half a mile down the lake we do not propose to harm he but we intend to drive he upon that little island and by surround it keep he there for a while by way of experiment upon he fear or rather as martin say to see what he would do as he approach the shore he bound upon the island and toss he head from side to side as if look for a place of concealment or escape finding none he dash across to the opposite side and plunge into the lake he be meet by the doctor and smith and turn back he rush in another direction across the island to be head by the boat in which i be seat and again in another direction to be head by spalding thus meet and drive back at every turn he at last station himself on a high knoll near the center of the island apparently expect that the last struggle for life be to be make there we rest upon we oar make no noise and watch he movement the bush be low come only up midside to the animal he watch we latently for half a hour toss he head up and down look first at one then at another as if calculate from which the attack upon he life be to come at last as if overcome by weariness or conclude that after all there be no real danger he lay quietly down in answer to he confidence in the harmlessness of we intention we row away back to the island where we start he we have not reach it however when we see he enter the water and swim to the main land and glad enough he seem to be when he have regain the protection of he native forest we take we dog from the island and row to the broad channel of the inlet which enter the lake on the left hand side as you look to the south there be two of these inlet which enter within a quarter of a mile of each other each of which come down from little lake or pond deeper in the wilderness the one we enter flow in a tortuous course through a natural meadow stretch away on either hand forty or fifty rod to a dense forest of spruce maple and beech above which gigantic pine stand stately and tall in they pride three mile from the lake the hill approach each other and the little river come plunge down through a gorge over shelve rock and around great boulder as if mad with the obstruction pile up in its way as we approach these fall smith who sit in the bow of the boat motion to the boatman to lay upon he oar and point to a object partly conceal by some low bush forty or fifty rod in advance of we remain perfectly still a moment we see a bear step out upon a boulder look up and down the stream and stretch he long nose out over the water as if look for a good place to cross the rapid after scratch he ear with one of he hind foot and he side with the other he turn and walk deliberately from we sight into the forest by this time the boat with the dog come in sight and we beckon its occupant to come to we one of the hound only have ever see game of this kind but cullen declare that there be no game that they would not follow when once fairly lay on we want that bear it be the only one we have see indeed it be the only one i have ever see wild in the forest we go to the spot where we last see he and there in the sand by the side of the boulder be he great track almost like a human foot cullen call the attention of the dog to it and halloo they on they take the scent cheerfully and with a unite and fierce cry they dash away in pursuit they have run but a short distance when they seem to become stationary and deep quick baying succeed the lengthen and ring sound of they voice treed by mose cry cullen as he dash forward the rest of we follow as fast as we could not too fast say martin not too fast there be no hurry he will not come down unless we noise frighten he let we go quietly there be plenty of time belcher have get he eye on he and will stay by he till we come we travel quietly and as silently as we could for near half a mile and as we round a low but steep point of a hill there sit bruin some twelve rod from we in the fork of a great birch tree forty foot from the ground look down in calm dignity upon the dog that be bay and leap up against the tree beneath he do anybody ever notice what a meek innocent look a bear have when in repose how hypocritically he leer upon everything about he as if butter would not melt in he mouth well such be the look of that bear as he peer out first on one side then on the other of the great limb between which he be sit secure as he suppose from danger but he be never more mistaken in he life in watch the dog he have fail to discover we we agree that three should fire upon he at once reserve the fourth charge for whatever contingency might happen smith the doctor and spalding sight he carefully each with he rifle rest against the side of a tree and blaze away they gun sound almost together it be pitiful the scream of agony that bear send up it be almost human in its anguish it go ring through the wood die away at last almost in a human groan after struggle and clasp he arm for a moment around the great branch of the tree he hold relax he reel from side to side and then fall heavily to the ground with three ball within a inch of each other right through he vitals he be larger than a medium size animal of he species and in excellent case the next thing in order be to transport he to we boat this be do by tie he foot together then run a long pole cut for the purpose between they and lift each end upon the shoulder of a boatman he be string up as allen express it clear from the ground they stumble along as best they could over the rough ground and through the tangle brush towards the river it be a heavy load consider the unevenness of the path and the man be compel to halt every few rod to breathe we get he safely to the landing at last and tumble he into the bottom of one of the boat start down stream towards we shanty a proud trio be spald smith and the doctor that afternoon return with they game across the lake and they certainly have some occasion to congratulate themselves for this be the first wild uncaged bear either of we have ever see and he they have succeed in capture we dine that afternoon on a roasted sirloin of bear stew jerk venison fry trout and pork i can not say that i altogether relish the roast though some of we company take to it hugely the truth be that with some of they venison and trout be begin to be somewhat stale dish they do not relish fat pork and a change therefore to roasted bear meat be peculiarly acceptable gentleman say smith to the doctor and spalding as we sit after we meal enjoy we pipe what say you to sell out you interest in that bear if you be open for a bargain i 'll make you a proposition why the doctor reply there 'll be nothing left but the skin and that will be of no special value except as a trophy not exactly resume smith i 'll deal frankly with you gentleman there 'll be a good many story to be tell about the killing of that bear and my object be to appropriate the glory of the achievement now it wont be a matter to boast of to say that we three fire into one bear and that none of the largest oh as to that say the doctor i intend to enlarge upon the subject exaggerate the size of the bear describe the terrible conflict i have with he how i happen to save myself by remember my double-barrelled pistol how i make

amount and nature of the blackmail you intend to levy upon I but have a conscience man have a conscience it will be make a great sacrifice on my part the doctor reply but out of friendship for you i 'll make you a proposition we 'll toss op a dollar and the one that win shall have the honor of have kill the bear and of tell the story in he own way and the other shall indorse it agree say smith but if you win i shall have to borrow a conscience of spalding or some other lawyer for there 'll be need of a pretty elastic one yours will answer i think drily remark spald it appear to I gentleman say i that i have something to say about the killing of that bear you exclaim the doctor what have you to do with it pray there stand you rifle with the same ball in it that you place there this morning you have not discharge you rifle to-day notwithstanding that i reply i be entitle to a portion of the glory as i be chargeable with my share of the responsibility of kill the bear i be one of the first who discover he i be among the foremost in the pursuit i be present aid and advise in the manner of the killing i have my weapon in my hand and be restrain from use it only because you might fail to accomplish what my reserved bullet would have make secure now if this bear have be human and we be accuse of kill he i would be regard in the eye of the law as equally guilty with you i appeal to spald if this be not so h -- be right reply spalding as he send a column of smoke wreathing upward from he lip such be the law we must buy this fellow off smith say the doctor we must buy he off he be a old hunter know as such and he 'll take to himself all the glory and what be worse the world will believe he he 'll spread himself beyond all bound he 'll shine beyond endurance upon the strength of this bear we must buy he off it be against all conscience but there be no help for it we must buy he off there be a impudence in this claim which remind I of a anecdote relate by noah by noah ask smith interrupt he noah who what ignorance there be in this world even in these day of educational enlightenment remark the doctor to spalding and myself now here be a decently inform gentleman claim to be a christian man to have study the bible and do not know who noah be such a instance of human ignorance in these time be shocking oh i understand now say smith he be the gentleman who build the ark well go on with you anecdote well as i be say the doctor resume this claim of h -- 's to a share of the glory of slaying the bear remind I of a anecdote relate by noah soon after the subsidence of the flood and it show that impudence be at least not post-deluvian in its origin it seem that there be in the world before as well as after the flood some very meddle impudent fellow who be always interfere with other people 's business claim a share of other people 's credit try to make the world believe that they be great thing and persuade everybody that whatever remarkable achievement be accomplish occur through they counsel and advice and as a consequence claim a large share of all the honor go well after the rain have continue fall for a number of day and the valley be all full of water and the angry surge go roar with the voice of ten thousand thunder high up along the side of the hill one of these pestilent fellow -- deride the miraculous exhibition go on all around he -- undertake in he self-conceit to lead the people to a place of safety so he select a lofty peak that shoot up from a range of mountain and commence travel up its steep acclivity but the flood follow he roar and boil and heave in its onward rush day by day night by night it creep up and up higher and higher until the self-confident leader who scoff at the supernatural warning have but a mighty small place above the surge whereon to shelter himself from the destruction that surround he about that time the ark with noah and he people all safe and snug come drift that way ` halloo ' say the occupant of the rock ` send we a boat and take we aboard the freshet be get pretty bad and it be get a little damp up here ' ' i can not do it ' say noah ` my craft be full of better people ' ` but ' say the applicant for admission into the ark ` let I in and i 'll superintend the navigation i 'll man the wheel and see that the sail be all right and we can pick up a deal of float plunder as we go along '

as we may pick up come bring we aboard ' ` can not do it ' say noah ` can not think of such a thing ` then ' say the persevere applicant for a passage in the ark ` i 'll go along for nothing -- give the benefit of my counsel and assistance free grati more than all that i 'll stand the liquor all round ' ` no use in talk ' say noah ` you can not come on board of my craft on any term you would corrupt my people and set they by the ear in a week you can not have a berth on any condition good-bye ' ` then go to thunder with you old ark ' indignantly respond the occupant of the rock ' i do not believe there be go to be much of a shower after all ' in a day or two noah drift that way again the mountain peak have disappear beneath the water and the occupant be all go i give up my claim say i doctor in consideration of you anecdote take the glory of kill the bear i see you be not dispose to give I a place in you ark so toss up the dollar the dollar be toss up and smith win the glory chapter xxi the doctor and he wife on a fishing excursion -- the law of the case -- strong-minded woman the right to the glory of have kill the bear be settle the doctor address himself to spald remark -- there be something in h -- 's appeal to you about the law of he case that remind I of a little scene between my wife and myself many year ago when we be both younger than we be now and certainly have never anticipate the dark year of trial through which we be unexpectedly call upon to pass you know that i start in life like smith here a gentleman of fortune calculate like he to live at my ease without troubling myself with the care of any particular business as i pass along still i think or rather my father think that it would be well enough even for a gentleman to have at least a nominal title to some profession so i study the law and be admit as a attorney and counsellor of the court never intend to practice i do not become very profoundly learn in the profession still i become to some extent indoctrinate with its mystery i do not like it and when the necessity for some active employment come loom up in the distance i choose a different calling and at six-and-twenty commence the study of my present profession this do not occur until after i have be marry some three year i live in the country then or rather summer there in a beautiful little village in the interior of the state in a pleasant old-fashioned house which my father build and which as i be he only heir i suppose of course i own some half a dozen mile from the village be a fine trout stream to which my wife and myself use occasionally to go on a fishing excursion on such occasion we go on horseback as the road be somewhat rough and my wife be as much at home in the saddle as i be this i repeat be a good while ago and we be both a score of year younger than we be now well i start out alone one day to visit this trout stream anticipate a good time with its speckled and usually greedy inhabitant i say i be alone and yet there be with I all the way and all the time one who can talk reason philosophise understand thing as well as you or i and one to all appearance as much and distinctly human as you or i impossible exclaimed smith we can not go that doctor i can not stand my quarter of that foolish man continue the doctor i say i be alone let I demonstrate my proposition blackstone say and what he say every lawyer will concede be the end of the law and the begin too for that matter that when a woman become a wife she lose she identity become nobody that she husband absorb she existence as it be as he do she goods and chattel in he own now sir do you comprehend my wife be with I and she be accord to law nobody of course i be alone you sir be a law abide man must admit that my proposition be qed the doctrine of absorption as i call it be convenient it promote harmony of action by subject it to the control of a single will thus avoid all embarrassment from a conflict of opinion between man and wife so on my way to the trout stream -lrb- i say _ my _ way for though my wife be on horseback by my side yet she be accord to the best legal authority nobody you see i be alone -rrb- i think i would enlighten the good lady in regard to the true position or rather the no position at all which she occupy we way lay for a couple of mile along a old road towards a clearing which have be abandon and through which the stream flow the tall old tree spread they long arm over we clothe in the rich verdure of spring and the breeze so fresh and fragrant moan and sigh and whisper among the leaf ` my dear ' say i blandly as we ride along the bird singing merrily among the branch above we ` do you know that you be nobody ' ` nobody mr w -- ' -lrb- i be simply mr w -- then i have not become nor even dream that i should become a doctor -rrb- ` nobody mr w -- do you say nobody ' ` absolutely nobody ' say i ' a perfect nonentity you be less even than a legal fiction ' ` look you ' say she as she apply the whip to she pony in a way that bring he with a bind across the road directly in front of I -lrb- she ride like a belt knight -rrb- obstruct my progress ` look you mr w -- ' and there be a red spot on she cheek and she eye sparkle like the sheen of a diamond ` let we settle this matter now i can bear be of small consideration occupy very little space in the world but to be stricken out of existence entirely to possess no legal identity to be regard as absolutely nobody be a thing i do not intend to stand -- mark that mr w -- ' ` keep cool my dear ' say i ` let we argue this matter ' i be calm for i know the law be on my side i have the book and the court and the statute all in my favor i be fortify you see ` argue the matter ' she exclaim ` not till it be admit that i be somebody if i be nobody i can not be argue with i can not reason nor talk now mr w -- i have a tongue ' ` gospel truth ' say i ` whatever the authority may say but we will admit for the sake of the argument that you be somebody blackstone say ' -- ` out on blackstone ' she exclaim ` what do i care for blackstone whose bone have be moulder in the grave for more than a hundred year for what i know do not talk to I about blackstone ' ` but my dear you be _ my _ wife and blackstone say ' -- ' i do not care a fig what blackstone say if i _ be _ you wife i be my mother 's daughter and my brother 's sister and tommy 's mother and there be four distinct individuality all center in myself ' ` but ' say i again ` blackstone say ' -- ` confound that blackstone ' she exclaim ' i do believe he have drive the wit out of the man 's head now look you mr w -- you invite I to ride with you you now say i be nobody very well if nobody leave you i suppose you will not be without company for somebody certainly leave home with you this morning and have ride with you thus far so good-bye mr w -- success to you fishing mr w -- ' and she strike into a gallop towards home ` hallo ' say i ' i give up the point i take back all i say _ culpa mea _ my good wife if blackstone do say ' -- ` not a word more about blackstone ' say she shake she whip half serious half playfully at I ` if i go with you i go as somebody -- a legal entity ' ` very well ' say i ` we 'll drop the argument ' ` not the argument but the fact mr w -- and admit that blackstone be a goose and that he law like he logic be all nonsense when measure by the standard of common sense and practical fact admit that a woman when she become a wife do not become a mere nonentity or i leave you to journey alone ' ` very well my dear let we see if we can not compromise this matter suppose we allow he philosophy to stand as a general truth make you a exception we 'll say that wife in general be nobody but that you shall be exempt from the general rule and be consider always hereafter and as between ourselves as somebody ' you see the shrewdness of my proposition firstly it save blackstone secondly it save _ I _ let I down easy and thirdly it appeal to the womanly vanity of my wife and it take ` oh well ' she say as she bring she pony alongside of I and we jog along cosily together ' i see no objection to that other wife can take care of themselves but this compromise as between _ we _ mr w -- must be a _ finality _ no nebraska trap mr w -- no kansa bill hereafter it must be a finality mind ' ` very well ' say i and a robin that be build its nest on a limb that hang over the road pause in its labor and burst into song and the burden of its lay seem to be a compromise which in truth should be a finality we be successful in we fishing and we follow the old-fashioned custom as to bait we discard the fly use only the angle-worm at the foot of the ripple under the old log where the water go whirling under the cavernous bank in the eddy among the driftwood everywhere we find trout -- not large none weigh over six ounce and few less than three we catch my basket full in less then two hour and then ride home it be a day of enjoyment to we you may be sure and now i appeal to you in all seriousness my friend the doctor continue address himself to spald if there be not something due to the wife and mother of the present generation be there not some relaxation of the law necessary in vindication of the civilization of the age against the legal barbarism still remain on the statute book and adhere to by the common law in regard to wife and mother be the current of progress to flow by they for ever bear no reform which shall affect they do not misunderstand I i be no advocate of the practice of the ` strong-minded woman ' who hold they convention and public meeting who unsex themselves by mount the forum and throw off the retire modesty of the true woman seek to secure notoriety at the price of popular contempt but there be evil which bear heavily too heavily upon the woman even of this country and which for the credit of the civilization of the age should be correct as calm-minded philanthropic man we the american people should look into this subject and regardless of jeer and scoff do what justice humanity and the right demand of we in regard to some of the social and legal inequality between the sex pertain to the married state it be one of the mystery of we system of jurisprudence reply spald that while everything else be on the move while progress be write in letter of live light upon all other thing that remain stationary -- at least in a comparative sense the world move on civilization advance science and the art stride forward but the law stand still a principle which may have be somewhat change modify bent if you please into a adaptation to the exigency of the present and a fitness for the change circumstance of the time in which we live be suddenly throw back into its old position by the exhumation of some ` decision ' from the dust of age make by some judge away back in the olden time resurrect by the research of some antiquarian lawyer who love to delve among the rubbish of past generation the learn the wisdom the philosophy of the present be discard and the spirit of a lower civilization be conjure from the darkness of vanish century to settle rule for the government of commerce personal conduct and the social relation of the time in which we live there seem to be something paradoxical in the idea that the older the decision the better the law -- the more ancient the commentator the profounder the wisdom of he axiom this might be well be it true that civilization be ` progress backwards ' the science of government retrograding in that case it would of course be true that the nearer you approach the fountain the purer the stream would be but such be not the fact in all these attribute the world be on the advance the science of government progressive and to make the wisdom of century ago override the wisdom or overshadow the light of the present be a paradox peculiar to we system of jurisprudence there be lawyer and judge who enjoy a high reputation whose fame rest upon they profound research among the worm-eaten tome of black-letter law and whose glory consist in they familiarity with the opinion and axiom of man who live and die so long ago that they very tomb be forget this class of lawyer and jurist hold in contempt all the learn the philosophy the practical wisdom of the present -- reject everything that be not beard and hoary with age seat in they library in the midst of they ponderous octavo they roman and black-letter volume they reject with disdain the commentator the opinion of the jurist of the present century and brushing away the cobweb and dust from the cover of they treasured relic of bygone age they clasp they in a loving embrace close to they heart exclaim ` these be my jewel ' whatever have not the sanction of ancient authority be folly to they -- worse than folly for it be innovation and that be rank impiety i remember a anecdote of the celebrated william wirt related to show how ready he mind be how instant in activity and how suddenly it would flash with a eloquence superior to that exhibit by the most elaborate preparation he be argue a cause before the supreme court of the united state and lay down as the basis of he argument a principle to which he desire to call the particular attention of the judge the opposing counsel interrupt he call for the authority sustain he principle -- ` the book -- the book ' demand he adversary ` sir and you honor ' say wirt straighten himself up to he full height ' i be not bind to grope my way among the ruin of antiquity to stumble over obsolete statute or delve in black letter law in search of a principle write in live letter upon the heart of every man ' if the idea contain in this answer of wirt be more fully appreciate by we modern jurist it would be all the better for the country the common law be say to be the perfection of reason this be doubtless true but it be the perfection of the reason of the present as well as of the past its principle be elastic suit themselves to the civilization of all age they be progressive keep pace with the progress of all time they be not immutable save in the element of right and they therefore shape themselves to all circumstance move along with the onward march of trade the commerce the social relation and business of the people the learning of to-day the wisdom the philosophy of to-day be profounder than that of any preceding century and it be folly to overthrow it by or compel it to give place to the learn the wisdom the philosophy of depart and ruder age in regard to you question whether there be not some relaxation of the law necessary in vindication of the civilization of the age against the legal barbarism remain upon the statute book and in the common law in regard to we wife i answer frankly that i do not know about that the law as you read it in blackstone and as you expound it to you wife on you fishing excursion have be somewhat modify wife have be give a _ status _ by modern legislation and a woman by become a wife do not now cease to be a legal entity the law permit she to retain and control she property irrespective of she husband and she have therefore thus far cease to be ` nobody ' but my private opinion be that as a general thing the woman of this country get along very well even under the pressure of the ` barbarism ' of which you speak they manage one way and another to get the upper hand of they legal lord law or no law if they existence in the light of authority be ` less than a legal fiction ' they come to be regard or make themselves feel in the world as practical fact they be quite as apt to be at the top as at the bottom of the ladder notwithstanding what ` blackstone say ' about they legal position there be doubtless a good deal of abuse of authority on the part of husband but the woman get they share of the good that be go in the world as a general thing if the law be against they they manage to usurp full a even amount of privilege and authority and keep along about in line with the other sex i never know a out and out controversy between a man and he wife in which the former do not get the worst of it in the end and as to the imposition which as a melancholy truth be too frequent they be about as much on one side as the other it be not to legal enactment that we must look for the cure of unhappiness incident to the married state but to a reform in temper and habit of life besides i do not believe the wife of this country would accept of a strict legal equality at all if it be tender they as a finality i believe they would prefer remain as they be for by be so they be leave to the resource of they own genius to win by they tact what be not guarantee by law i know that there be a good many crazy-headed people in pantaloons as well as petticoat who go about labor for the 'em ancipation of woman ' as if the heaven and earth be come together but those of they who wear skirt generally have delicate white hand flow curl flash black eye and the gift of oratory -- and a desire to exhibit they all while those in pantaloons have they hair comb smoothly back as if prepare to be swallow by a boa-constrictor wear white cravat talk softly and show a good deal of the whites of they eye from a chronic habit of look up towards the moon and star as a general thing these latter are of no practical use in the world and make as good a tail to the kite of the ` strong-minded woman ' as anything else but these people represent a very small portion of the american woman and until the mass demand 'em ancipation ' i rather think that matter have better be permit to remain as they be the woman will take care of themselves -- no fear of that chapter xxii a beautiful flower -- a new lake -- a moose -- he capture -- a sumptuous dinner we start the next morning on a explore voyage up the right-hand stream which enter this beautiful lake some half a mile west of the one we have look into the day before on either hand as we pass along the narrow channel be a natural meadow cover with a luxuriant growth of rank grass and weed conspicuous among which be a beautiful flower the like of which i have never see anywhere else i be no botanist and therefore can not describe it in the language of the florist so that the learn in that beautiful science might classify it it resemble somewhat the wild lily in shape grow upon a tall strong stem almost like the stem of the flag the flower itself be double and its deep crimson -- the deepest almost of any flower i have ever see -- shine conspicuously as it wave gracefully in the breeze above the surround vegetation it have one defect however it be without fragrance i infer from the fact that its root spread far out every way and reach down into the water beneath that it can hardly be transfer to the garden or become civilized it would be a great acquisition to the collection of the florist if it could for i know of no flower that excel it in richness of color gracefulness of appearance or in gorgeousness of beauty we see abundance of deer feed quietly upon the narrow meadow and upon the lily pad on we way we have no inclination to injure they and we let they feed on some of they be hugely astonished however at we presence and dash away whistle and snort into the forest two mile from the lake we come to a rocky barrier down which the stream come rush and roar for fifty or sixty rod in a descent of perhaps sixty foot in all around these rapid the boat be carry and we find above they the water deep and sluggish flow through a dense forest the tall tree on the bank stretch they leafy arm across the narrow channel form above it a arch delightfully cool through which the sunlight could scarcely penetrate we follow this channel a long way when we come to a little lake or pond four or five mile in circumference it be a perfect gem lay there all alone so calm so lovely in its solitude with no sign of civilization around it no sound of civilization startling its echo from they sleep of age no human voice have perhaps ever be hear upon its shore since the red man depart from the hunting-ground of he father the shore all around it be bold and rocky save on the western side where a broad sandy beach of a quarter of a mile in extent lay between the water and the shadow of the deep forest beyond a solitary island of half a dozen acre cover with majestic pine and tall straight spruce tree rise near the center of the lake add a new charm to its quiet beauty the water of this little lake be clearer and more transparent than those of any other we have see we could see the white shell on its sandy bottom fifteen foot below the surface this peculiarity induce we to believe that we be above the stratum of iron ore which seem to underlie most of this wild region color while it do not render impure the water of most of these lake and river i have frequently in my wanderings in these northern wild stumble upon outcrop orebed which be they nearer market or more accessible to the energy and enterprise of the american people would be capable of build up gigantic fortune but they be all valueless here and probably will continue so for generation to come we see the fresh track of a moose on the sandy beach track that have be make that morning and we conclude to spend the day here in the hope of secure one of these gigantic deer we row to the island intend to encamp there we enter a little bay of half a acre the point form it come within a few yard of each other and the branch of the tree intertwine they long arm lovingly above as we land we dog begin nose and dash about as if suddenly rouse into excitement by the hot scent of some animal that have be disturb by we come they break into a simultaneous cry and plunge like mad into the thicket we push we boat back towards the open water when we hear the plunge of some animal into the lake on the other side of the island martin who be in the lead boat with I by a few vigorous pull at the oar round the point between we and the spot where we have hear the plunge and there not ten rod from the shore make for the mainland be the game which of all other we most desire to see a moose by mose exclaim martin in huge excitement hurrah hurrah a moose he be ours he can not escape and away he dash in pursuit the other boat now heave in sight and a loud hurrah go up from each when they see the nature of the game that have be start there be no difficulty in overtake the animal desperate as be he effort to escape we shoot past he and turn he back in a direction towards the island again and i pick up my rifle to settle the matter do not shoot he say martin do not shoot he yet he can not get away and if you kill he he 'll sink and if he do not we can not get he into the boat let we drive he back to the island the other boat be by this time up with we every man in a wild state of excitement eager to be first in at the death we have head the animal towards the island with we three boat so arrange as that he could swim in no other direction without run one of they down the dog have start a deer that have take to the water on the other side of the island look here say i gentleman this game be mine i claim he by right of discovery and my right must not be interfere with very well the doctor answer we 'll only take a hand in he capture if he be likely to escape so go ahead as we come within a few yard of the shore and we could see that the animal 's hoof touch the bottom i aim carefully at he head and fire he make one desperate lunge forward and turn over on he side die with scarcely a straggle the ball have pass directly through he brain this be the first and only live moose i have ever see he be not a large one be probably a three-year-old but well-grown we should have call he a monster have we not before that time see in various museum the stuff skin of those a quarter or a third larger he would have weigh as shot probably between five and six hundred pound he have make this solitary island he home as we ascertain by he spoor and other sign that we find upon subsequent exploration we see he bed but a few rod from where we land and from which we dog have arouse he though they in they excitement have overrun he scent and dash off after a deer we have now accomplish one of the object of we journey in this direction and as the law we have impose upon ourselves have reach its limit prohibit we shooting another moose that day even should a opportunity occur we conclude to return to we shanty on the lake below we therefore dress we moose and take with we the skin and hind quarter start down stream to a late dinner on little tupper 's lake indeed there be a sort of necessity for we do so we have leave we provision there calculate to return in the afternoon not have take with we even pepper or salt wherewith to season the food which upon constraint we might cook during we absence a few cracker in the pocket of each be all in the provision line that we have provide ourselves with and though when we see the moose-track in the sand we have conclude to rough it for a single night for the chance of secure such rare game yet have secure it that part of we mission be accomplish and we turn towards home on we return to the lake spalding and myself row across to the mouth of a cold brook to procure a supply of fresh trout upon which with we moose and bear-meat to dine this we soon accomplish and on we arrival home we find huge piece of moose and bear roasting before a blaze fire the meat be support upon long stick one end of which be sharpen and the meat spit upon it and the other thrust into the ground in a slanting direction so as to bring the roast piece into a proper position before the fire the meat be remove occasionally and turn until the roast process be complete and then serve up on clean birch bark just peel from the tree in the place of platter we have tin plate knife and fork with we also a tea-kettle tin cup and tea of the choicest quality sugar pepper salt and pork the man who can not make a meal where the viand present be moose-meat bear jerk venison fresh trout and pork and for drink the best of tea and the purest and coldest spring water have better keep out of the rackett wood the people whoever they be who prepare the camp in which we be domicile have a eye to convenience and comfort the shanty be build of log on three side the crevice between which be fill with moss and the sloping roof neatly cover with bark in layer like a old-fashioned roof cover with split shingle the front be open and directly before it be a rough fire-place with jam make of small boulder lay up with clay regularly-fashioned as if intend for a kitchen this fire-place be three or four foot high and serve a excellent purpose with reference to we cookery and the lighting of we shanty at night it serve also to conduct the smoke upward and prevent it from be blow into we face as we sit in front at once of we sleeping-place and we camp-fire the only thing that remind we of civilization aside from what we carry with we be the innumerable cricket that through all the night keep up they chirrup in the crevice of this rude fireplace there be something old-fashioned and sociable in they song these with the shrill note of the little peeper along the shore be old sound to we familiar voice and they fall pleasantly on the ear we have finish we meal and take to we pipe in the evening as the sun go down among the old forest away off in the west the greyness of twilight come steal over the water and grow into darkness in the beautiful valley where that lake lay sleep the star steal out silently and set they watch in the sky and calmness and repose rest upon everything around we i remember say smith the first year that i be in college of hear two learn professor dispute about what sort of animal it be that make the piping noise we hear in the marshy place and stagnant pool in the spring time usually know as peeper one insist that it be a newt or small lizard and i remember that he go to he library and bring a volume which prove he theory to be correct the other deny the authority of the author and insist that the peeper be a frog the discussion excited my curiosity and i make up my mind to satisfy myself on the subject if possible by occular demonstration there be a small marshy place half a mile or so from the college grounds from which i have hear in my walk the music of the peeper come up every evening in a loud and joyous chorus i watch by it a number of evening and though there be a plenty of peeper pipe merrily enough yet i could not get sight of one to save I i begin to think it be a myth the viewless spirit of the bog that make all the noise about which the learn professor have be dispute at last however i get sight of a peeper catch he in the act and see that it be in fact a little frog nothing more nothing less he be not more than three foot from I and though when i move he hide himself in the muddy water yet i manage to capture and take he home alive he be a little animal certainly not larger than a half-dollar piece and it be marvellous how a thing so small could make such a loud and piercing noise i take he to my room and place he in a water-tight box in which i fashion a artificial bog in the hope that he would confirm my testimony by he piping the second evening as i sit in my room pore over the recitation of the morrow he lift up he voice loud shrill and clear as when singing in he native marsh i hurry in triumph to the learn disputant about he identity and in they presence he furnish unanswerable evidence that the peeper be a frog and not a newt i be compliment by both the learn pundit as though i have add a great item to the aggregate of human knowledge you _ do _ do a great thing my friend say spalding you solve a mystery about which man wise in the learning of the book have perhaps be dispute for century what be the peeper ask the naturalist who listen to they piping note from the marshy place in the spring time it be a matter of small practical importance what they be still it be a question which mind want to have solve its solution would do no great amount of good to the world but then it be a mystery which it be the business of mind to lay bare and what more have science do in trace the history and progress of this earth of ours as write upon the rock among which geology have be so long delving ` what be the peeper ' ask the naturalist ` they be newt little lizard ' answer a learn pandit ` they be spirit of the bog myth that hold they carnival in the early grass of the marshy pool ' say the theorist and poet who _ believe _ in the ideality of a poetic fancy ` they be frog ' say a third who be ready to chop any amount of logic in favor of he system of frogology and hereupon column of argument and page of learn discussion have be hold over the identity of the jolly peeper of the spring-time but you discard logic throw away argument and come down to the sure demonstration of sober fact you watch by the marshy pool and catch the ` peeper ' in the act take he ' _ in flagrante delicto _ ' as the lawyer say and thus end the theoretical discussion about the ` peeper ' you place another fix fact upon the page of natural history and how often have the wisdom of the school the philosophy of the profoundest theorist be overthrow by the simple demonstration of practical fact for a thousand year the world be in pursuit of the giant power that lay hide in heated vapor the steam that come float up from boiling water that power elude the grasp and baffle the research of human genius which be look so earnestly after it until ingenuity give it up and philosophy pronounce it a delusion not far from the beginning of the present century practical experiment begin to develop the mysterious power of steam rudely and imperfectly harness at first it still make the great wheel revolve and man talk about make it a great motor for mechanical purpose philosophy volunteer its demonstration of the absolute impossibility of such a thing still human ingenuity feel its way carefully onward until the great fact be develop that steam be in truth capable of move machinery be endowed almost with vitality and could be make to throw the shuttle and spin ingenious man hint that it might be make to propel water-craft in the place of wind and sail and thus be harness into the service of commerce as it have already be into that of manufacture here again philosophy interpose its axiom and declare the scheme among the wild vagary of a distempered fancy but year roll on and the tall ship that swing out upon the broad ocean and move forward when the air be still and calmness be on the face of the deep forward in the eye of the wind -- forward in the tooth of the storm that stop not for billow or blast give the lie to philosophy and scatter the theory of the wise like chaff the lightning that fierce spirit of the storm that dart down on its mission of destruction from the black cloud float in the sky become a thing of interest to the mechanical world and the question be ask ` why can not the lightning be harness into the service of man and be make utilitarian ' philosophy sneer at the wild delusion but see how that same subtle and mysterious agency have be conquer note how truthfully it carry every word intrust to its charge along thousand of mile of the telegraph wire with a speed in comparison with which sound be a laggard a speed that annihilate alike space and time man look into a mirror and see they own counterpart a _ fac-simile _ of themselves reflect there begin to ask ` why may not that shadow be fix fasten in some way to remain upon the polished surface that give it back even after the original may be moulder in the grave ' here again philosophy lay its finger upon its nose and wink facetiously as if it have find a new subject for ridicule in the stupendous folly of such a inquiry but from that simple question rise up the daguerreian art a art which fix upon metallic plate upon paper the shadow of a man of palace and cottage of mountain and field give thus a picture ten thousand time truer to nature than the pencil of the cunningest artist these and a thousand other mighty triumph of human ingenuity have fight they way onward to they present position against the fogyism of philosophy the inertia of the schoolman they have be the sequence of cold resistless demonstration of experiment and fact the world would stand still but for the spirit of research for the practical for experimental and not theoretical knowledge that be abroad it be this spirit that move the world in all its present matchless career of progress and distinguish we era above all other of the world 's existence you may be thankful my friend that you have be able to add another fix fact to the stock of human knowledge even though it be only that the ` peeper ' be a frog and not a ` newt ' or a ` myth ' but who would suppose that such a tiny little frogling could make such a loud shrill and ear-piercing sound who would think that a million of such puny thing could make the air of a summer evening so full of the music of they song i remember how in my boyhood i listen to they voice which come up loudest shrillest merriest when twilight be spread its gray mantle over the earth while the song of the bird be hush into silence and the come darkness be lull the thing of the day into repose oh how merrily they sing along the little brooklet that take its rise in a spring in the meadow and wend its way among the young grass just spring into verdure to the beautiful lake beyond they song be in my ear now and that meadow that beautiful lake the tall hill on the summit of which the depart sunlight linger the tall maple that cluster in they conelike beauty around that gush fountain the cluster plum tree the giant oak spare by the woodman 's axe when the old forest be sweep away the field the ` gulf ' in the hill-side and the beautiful creek that come cascade down the shelve rock and leap over precipice in which the speckled trout sport : all these be before I now -- a vision of loveliness all the more dear because stamp upon the memory when life be young oh time time the wreck that lie scatter in thy pathway that little brooklet and the peeper the fountain the maple and the meadow be all go the brave old oak be rive by the lightning the field have creep up to the very summit of the hill and even the stream that come down from the mountain have vanish away save when the rain or the melting snow send it in a freshet over the rock where when i be a boy it be cascade always that beautiful meadow too be go and the street of a modern village with block of house and store and shop occupy the place where i swing my first scythe the old log-house vanish year and year ago a steamboat plough its way through that beautiful lake and the thing of my boyhood be but vision of memory call up from the long long past not one landmark of the olden time remain oh time time chapter xxiii the cricket in the wall -- the minister 's illustration -- old memory we spend the following day in drift quietly around the lake float lazily in the little bay under the shadow of the tall tree and lounge upon small island gather the low-bush whortleberry which grow in abundance upon they we fill we tin pail with this delicious fruit for a dessert for we evening meal on one of these island we find indication of its be inhabit by wood rabbit and we send cullen to the shanty for the dog to course they not however with any intention of capture they but to enjoy the music of the chase and hear the voice of the hound echo over the water we land they upon the island and begin beat for the game the hound understand that they business be the pursuit of deer and have hunt the island over thoroughly come back to we and sit quietly down upon they haunch as much as to say there be nothing there worth look after but we have see one of the little animal that have be rouse from its bed by the dog and we call they special attention to the fact by lead they to the spot and bid they to hunt he up they understand we meaning and start on the trail with a loud and cheerful cry for half a hour they course he round and round the island make the lake vocal with they merry music we might have shoot the game they be pursue fifty time but we have no design against its life the little fellow do not seem to be greatly alarm for we note he often when by double he have temporarily throw off the dog squat himself down and throw he long ear back in the direction of the sound that have be pursue he and when the dog straighten upon he trail and approach where he sit he would bind nimbly away among the thick bush to double on they again we call off the dog and pass on to float along under the shadow of the forest tree and the hill and take a occasional trout by way of experiment among the broken rock along the shore we have dispatch cullen to the shanty to prepare dinner for we by six o'clock at which hour we be to be at home cullen have promise to use he own expression to spread himself in the preparation of this meal and he keep he promise on we return we find a sirloin of moose roasted to a turn a stake of bear-meat broil on the coal a stew of jerk venison and as pleasant a dish of fried trout and pork as a epicure could desire we appetite be keen and we do ample justice to he cookery this be one of the most delightful evening that i have ever spend in the northern wood there be such a calm rest upon all thing such a impress of repose upon forest and lake such a cheerful quiet and serenity all around we that one could scarcely refrain from rejoice aloud in the beauty and the glory of the hour as the sun sink to he rest behind the western hill and the twilight begin to gather in the forest and over the lake the moon rise over the eastern high land walk with a queenly step up into the sky cast a long line of brilliant light across the water show the shadow of the mountain in bold outline in the depths below and pale the star by she brightness above we all feel that we be recruit in strength so rapidly in these mountain region where the air be so brace and pure under the influence of exercise simple diet natural sleep and the absence of the labor and care of business that we be contented notwithstanding the monotony that begin to mark we everyday proceedings i have be listen say spalding as we sit upon the rude bench in front of we camp-fire indulge in we usual season of smoking after we meal to the song of the cricket in those rude jam and they call up sad yet pleasant memory from the long past of the old log house the quiet fire-place the crane in the jam the great log blaze upon the hearth of a cold winter evening the house dog sleep quietly in the corner and the cat nestle confidingly between he foot oh the day of old the day of old these cricket call back with these memory the circle that gather around the hearth of my home when i be young father mother brother sister playmate and friend how quietly some of they grow old and ripe and then drop into the grave how quietly other steal away in they youth to the home of the dead and how the rest have drift away on the current of life and be lose to I in the mist and shadow of time even the home and the hearth be go they ` battle with time and slow decay ' until at last they be wipe out from the thing that be the song of the peeper be a pleasant memory and come well up with a thousand cherish recollection of we vanish youth but the song of the cricket that make its home in the jam of the great stone fire-place be pleasanter and the memory that come float back with he remembered lay be pleasanter still he be always there he be not silent like the out-door insect through the spring month and the cold of winter piping only in sadness when the still autumnal evening close in they brightness and beauty over the earth but he sing always and he chirrup be hear at all season in the winter the fire on the hearth warm he in the summer he have a cool rest place and he be cheerful and merry through all the long year and this remind I of a anecdote of a venerable minister who pass year ago to he rest he be a scotchman and when preach to he own congregation at salem in washington comity he indulge in broad scotch which to those who be accustom to it be exceedingly pleasant i be a boy then and be return with my father from a visit to vermont we stop over the sabbath at salem and attend worship in the neat little church of that pleasant village there be no railroad in those day the iron horse have not yet make he advent and the scream of the steam whistle have never startle the echo that dwell among the gorge of the green mountain state oh progress progress i have travel that same route often since more than once within the year and i fly over in a hour what be the work of all that cold winter day that bring we at night to that neat little village of salem i think as i dash with a rush over the road i once travel so leisurely how change be write upon everything how time and progress have obliterate all the old landmark leave scarcely anything around which memory could cling well well it be so everywhere all over the world change improvement progress be the word the venerable minister for he lock be gray and time have plough deep furrow down he cheek and draw palpable line across he brow be as my memory paint he the personification of earnestness sincerity and truth the text and the drift of the sermon i have forget save the little fragment that fix itself in my memory by the singularity of the figure by which he illustrate he meaning he be speak of the operation of the holy spirit upon the human heart and how gently it win man from they sinful way he say ` it be not boisterous like the rush of the tempest it be not fierce like the lightning it be not loud like the thunder but it be a still sma ' voice like a wee cricket in the wa 's ' i regard the cricket that chirrup in the wall as a institution one of the past to be sure sweep away by the current of progress whose course be onward always over everything obliterate everything hurl the thing of today into history or bury they in eternal oblivion in this country there be nothing fixed nothing stationary and never have be since the first white man swing he axe against the outside forest tree since the first green field be open up to the sunlight from the deep shadow of the old forest that have stand there grand solemn and boundless since this world be first throw from the hand of god there will be nothing fix for century to come the tide of progress will sweep onward in the future as it have do in the past onward be the great watchword of america and american institution onward and onward over the ancient forest onward over the log-house that stand in the van of civilization over the great fire-place over the cricket in the wall over the old house dog that sleep in the corner over the loved face that cluster around the blaze hearth in the day of we childhood over everything primitive everything my friend that you and i love when we be little child and that come drift along down on the current of memory -- bright vision of the returnless past ah well it be best that it should be so it be best that the world should move on that there should be no pause no halt in the onward march what be we that the earth should stand still at we bidding or pause to contemplate we tear dust to dust be the great law but so long as a phoenix rise from the ash of decay what right have we to murmur time may desolate and destroy but man can build up and beautify true he work perish as he perish but new work and new man be rise forever to fill and more than fill the vacancy and desolation of the past go ahead then world sweep along progress mow away time tear down temple and stronghold sweep away the marble palace and log-house sweep away infancy and youth manhood and old age wipe out old memory and pass the sponge over cherish recollection the energy and the ingenuity of man be a over-match even for time from the ruin of the past from the desolation of decay new structure will rise and a new harvest more abundant than the old will spring up from the stubble over which time 's sickle have pass recuperation be a law stronger than decay and it be write all over the face of the earth chapter xxiv the accident of life -- some man achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon they -- a slide -- rattlesnake at the top and a icy pool at the bottom -- a fanciful theory while we sit thus converse we boatman go down along the beach and around a little point that run out into the lake to bathe they be jolly but uncultivated man give to rudeness and profanity of speech when out of we immediate presence and by themselves and we hear from they while they be splash and struggle in the water expression somewhat inelegant as well as profane i have often think say spalding as we listen to the rude and sometimes profane speech of we man how vast the influence which circumstance or accident over which man have no control have upon they conduct and destiny in this world if not in the next the poet have well say ` full many a gem of purest ray serene the dark unfathomed cave of ocean bear and many a flower be bear to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air ' these rude man be but testify to the great truth that man be the creature in a greater or less degree of circumstance that he be great or small polished or rude wise or simple accord to the accident of he birth or the surroundings in the midst of which he journey of life lay true there _ be _ intellect that will work themselves into position man who will hew they way upward in spite of the difficulty which beset they as there be other who will plunge down to degradation and dishonor in defiance of tender rearing of education of association and all the allurement to a upward career that can be present to the human understanding but these be so rare that they may be properly regard as exception to the general rule so rare indeed as to prove its truth you and i can look around we and from among we acquaintance select many man and woman whose genius and solid understanding and whose virtue too have remain undeveloped and probably will do so till they die from lack of opportunity for they exercise accident seem to have stricken they from they legitimate sphere circumstance for which they be not responsible and over which they could exercise no control have bar they out from they seeming true position in the world and the genius which be intend for the daylight and the eagle 's flight towards the sun be leave to skim in darkness along the ground like the course of the mouse owl we have all see another thing which baffle we philosophy while it prove the truth of the theory of which i be speak we have see man and see they every day who from no quality of heart or mind seem fit to rise in the world occupy commanding position to which accident have lift they whose genius command no admiration whose virtue be of a doubtful character and who possess no one quality which entitle they to we respect or the respect of the world as the former be the victim of circumstance these latter be its creature both be the sport of fortune the one class its victim and the other its favorite how be all this to be account for and where rest the responsibility of failure and where the credit of success be there accident float about among the path mark out on the chart of life by the deity which jostle he creature from the destiny intend for they or be man throw loose upon the current of life to take they chance of good and evil to be virtuous or vile accord to the influence among which they be float to be fortunate or otherwise as the means of advance themselves drift within they reach if so where rest the responsibility i ask again of failure and where the credit of success child be bear into the world under strangely different influence one first see the light in the haunt of vice and crime amidst the corruption which fester away down in the depths of a great city the influence which surround it be only and always evil they be such in infancy in childhood in youth and in manhood another be cradle under the influence of intelligence piety virtue have around it always the safeguard of refine and christian civilization what be the difference in the degree of responsibility attach to the future of these antipode beginning can you tell I where and how these wide terribly wide distinction be to be reconcile when and where the career of these germ of be start from point so wide asunder be to meet and how the balance of good and evil of suffering and enjoyment of sinning and retribution be to be adjust at last i have be ask myself too while listen to the speech of these man so thoughtlessly utter where these profane epithet these impious expression be to rest at last who can tell whether they do not go jarring through the universe mar the music of the sphere throw discord into the anthem of the morning star when they sing together a wail among the glad voice of the son of god when they shout for joy in this world and to the dulness of human perception when the sound of the impious word have die away or a smile come back to the face cloud by the angry think the effect seem to have cease but it may not be so the word or the thought may be wander for age vibrate still away off among the outer creation of god the angel that bear they at the beginning from the lip or the heart may be fly still and generation and century may have pass before he journey with they shall have cease it be a fanciful idea that whatever we say or think be immortal that every word we utter go ring through the universe forever that every thought of the heart become a creation a thing of vitality in some shape start forward among the thing of some sort of life never to die i have sometimes in my dreamy hour speculate upon the truth of such a theory and reason with myself in favor of its reality all i can say in its favor however be that i can not disprove it it may be true or it may not there be other mystery quite as incomprehensible the result of which we can see without be able to penetrate the darkness in which they dwell but assume its truth and appreciate the consequence which would follow we should rule the tongue with a sterner sway and guard the heart with a more watchful care than be we wont think of the obscene word become a living entity the profane oath a thing of life the filthy or impure thought assume form and vitality all start forward to exist forever among the creation of infinite purity who would own one of these ogre in comparison with the beautiful thing of god who would say of the obscene word the profane oath or the filthy or impious thought ` this be mine i make it i be the author of its be -- its creator ' and yet it may be so if it be there be few of we who have not throw into life much very much to mar the harmony of nature to throw discord among the sphere you statement remark smith that accident have much to do with make or mar the fortune of man be doubtless true man be destroy by accident and they life be sometimes save by it and if you 'll put away metaphysics come out of the cloud in which you have hide yourself in you dreamy speculation i will furnish you with a case in point show that a man may get into a very unpleasant predicament where he run a great risk and get some hard knock and yet be able to thank god for it in perfect earnestness of spirit a case of the kind come under my own observation and while there be not much philosophy or abstract speculation about it there be a great deal of hard practical fact it happen when i be a boy at the old homestead in the valley that stretch to the southwest from the head of crooked lake that valley be hem in by high and steep hill and at the tune of which i speak be much more beautiful in my view than it be now there be no village there then and the farm which stretch from hill to hill be greatly less valuable than they be now but the wood and pasture and meadow lay exactly in the right place and have among they partridge and squirrel and pigeon and cattle and sheep enough to make thing pleasant besides there be plenty of trout in those day in the stream that flow along through the valley midway between the hill on the north side come down through a gorge or ` the gulf ' as we use to call it be a stream which in the dry season of the year be a little brook trickle over the rock but which in the spring freshet or when the cloud empty themselves on the mountain be a wild foam roaring and resistless torrent in follow this stream into ` the gulf ' you walk on a level plain between wall of rock rise two or three hundred foot on either hand and a dozen or more rod apart until you come to ` the fall ' down which the stream rush with a plunge and a roar when its back be up or over which in the dry season it quietly ripple these ` fall ' be not perpendicular but steep as the roof of a dutch barn and it be a great feat to climb they when the stream be low ascend about fifty foot you come to a broad flat rock large and smooth as a parlor floor and which in the summer season be dry well one day in company with a boy who be visit I i go up to the ` fall ' and we conclude to climb the shelve rock to the ` table ' and take off we shoe and stocking enter upon the perilous ascent -- for such to some extent it be hand and foot finger and toe be all put in requisition my friend begin the ascent before i do and be half way up when i start i ought to have say that at the foot of the ` fall ' be a basin worn away by the torrent and in which the water clear and cold then stand to the depth of three or four foot we be toiling painfully up when i hear a rush above and in a instant my friend come like a arrow past I slide down the shelve rock on he back or rather in a half-sitting posture he rear to the rock i will not undertake to say that the fire fly as he go by I for the rock be slate and therefore such a phenomenon be not likely to occur but the entire absence of the seat of my friend 's pantaloons and the blood that trickle down to he toe show that the friction be considerable as he pass I i hear he exclaim ` thank god ' and the next instant he plunge into the cold water at the base of the fall what there be to be thankful for in such a descent over the rock i could not at the time comprehend as the chance be in favor of a break back or neck or some other consummation equally out of the range of gratitude in a ordinary way he come up out of the water blowing and snort like a porpoise with a cold in he head and wade to the shore ` come down ' he shout which i do not quite so far or fast as he do but fast enough to make a involuntary plunge head foremost into the pool at the bottom the occasion of he catastrophe be this : he have ascend so near the table rock that he hand be upon it and be lift himself up when as he eye come above the surface the edge upon which he hand with most of he weight rest give way and he start for the basin below but he have a view of what satisfy he that to this accident he owe he life and it be a sense of gratitude for he escape that prompt the exclamation i hear as he go bump past I coil on the rock above and within reach of he face be several large rattlesnake and he always insist that one make a spring at he as he hand give way and he put out for the basin into which he plunge he be a good deal bruise but he escape from the poisonous reptile reconcile he to that chapter xxv head towards home -- the martin and sable hunter -- he cabin -- autumnal scenery we conclude that we would break up we camp in the morning and drift leisurely back towards civilization we have tarry upon this beautiful lake until we have explore its romantic nook and we start on we return to we old camping ground at the foot of round pond we have refrain for two day from disturb the deer and we supply of fresh venison be entirely exhaust just at the outlet of the lake we be leave be a little bay towards the head of which be a great number of boulder lay around loose scatter about like haycock in a meadow only a great many more to the acre the water about these boulder be shallow and the lily-pad and grass make a luxuriant pasture for the deer among these boulder and conceal by one of they save when he head be up be a deer while he feed we could see nothing of he but when he raise he head to look around he that alone be visible above the rock smith and myself be in the lead boat he in the bow with he rifle as the current sweep near the rock where the deer be feed we let we little craft drift quietly in that direction as we come within shooting distance say from fifteen to twenty rod smith adjust he rifle and as the animal raise its head above the rock he sight he carefully and fire it be a beautiful shot there be nothing of the animal but the head visible and the bullet true to its aim strike it square between the eye and it fall dead this shoot together with the glory of kill the bear elate smith wonderfully and upon the strength of they he assume the championship of the expedition we draw the deer into the baggage-boat and send forward we pioneer to erect we tent and prepare a late dinner at we old camping ground while we land with the dog on the island near the head of round pond or lake to course whatever game they might find upon it they soon burst into full chorus and dash away the island be small contain only a few acre and the game could not therefore take a wide range after a single turn a deer break like a maddened war-horse from the thicket and plunge into the lake strike boldly for the mainland five hundred yard distant we be near by with we two boat when he take to the water and we think we would accompany he as a escort to the shore so we row up and with a boat on each side and within ten foot of he as he swim escort he towards the forest we treat he with great respect offer he no indignity interfere with he in nothing and yet the old fellow seem very far from appreciate we politeness or relish we company the truth be he be horribly frightened and he struggle desperately to rid himself of we association but we stick by he like he destiny talk kindly to he endeavor to impress upon he mind that we mean he no harm -- indeed that we be he friend but i repeat he do not appreciate we politeness by-and-by he foot touch the sand and he bound forward as much as to say good-bye gentleman when a simultaneous yell from all six of we and the discharge of four rifle in quick succession over he add wonderfully to the energy of he flight he will be likely to recognize we if he ever meet we again and if the past furnish any admonition to he kind he will give we a wide berth we row leisurely along the eastern shore and in a deep bay find excellent fishing at the mouth of a cold mountain brook on the bank of this bay we find the winter hut of a martin and sable trapper it have a outer and inner apartment the latter almost subterranean the hut be compose of small log which a single man could lay up the crevice between which be closely pack with moss and the roof cover with two or three layer of bark the doorway be saw through these log and a door construct of bark be make to fit it a rude hearth of sandstone be build in one corner and a hole be open above it to let out the smoke against the outside of this pen only about ten foot square log be lean up the end of which rest upon the ground the interstice between they carefully stop with moss and the whole cover with bark the end consist of stake drive into the ground and chink with moss into this sleep apartment a door be cut from the parlor large enough for a man to pass by get down on all-fours while within be a plentiful supply of bough from the spruce and fir tree in this hut now so dark and in which the air be so dead and fetid a solitary trapper have winter pursue he occupation of martin and sable hunting -- the which if tolerably successful would yield he some two or three hundred dollar the season he carry into the wood a bag of flour or meal a few pound of pork pepper salt and tea and this with the game he kill make up he supply of food with no companion but he dog he have probably spend two or three month and very possibly more in this lonely cabin we arrive at we camp towards evening and dine sumptuously on fresh venison and trout we pioneer have provide a luxurious bed of bough within and have fashion rude seat in front of we tent he have roll the butt of a huge tree which he have fell to the proper place against which to kindle we camp-fire and we have a pleasant place to sit with we pipe in the evening look out over the water listen to the pile-driver half a dozen of which be drive they stake along the reedy shore with commendable diligence the sunlight lay so beautifully on the hillside and contrast so admirably with the deep shadow of the valley beneath the lake be so calm and still the old wood stand around so moveless and solemn that one could scarcely persuade himself that he be not look upon some gigantic picture the fanciful grouping and transcendent coloring of some ingenious and winning artist the hillside about these lake remark the doctor must be superlatively beautiful in the fall when the forest put on its autumnal foliage they present such a variety of tree of so many different kind and the hill and mountain be so admirably arrange that they must be gorgeous beyond description however we may prefer the green and _ living _ beauty of spring when everything be so full of vitality so buoyant and free yet the autumn scenery be the most magnificent of any in the year every season have its charm say spalding even the winter with its cold its dead and cheerless desolation have its robe of chaste and peerless white which as well as that of the spring-time the summer and the autumn have be the theme of song i agree with you that in gorgeousness of beauty there be no season so rich as the autumn spring-time have its pleasant scenery its genial day its deep green its flower and its singing bird and these be all the more lovely because they follow so closely upon the cold storm and bleak wind the chilling and blank desolation of winter we love the spring because of its freshness its pervading vitality its recuperate influence everybody love the spring-time everybody talk about the spring-time poet sing of it orator praise it ` fair woman and brave man ' laud it so that be spring-time human and possess human instinct and subject to human frailty it would have plenty of excuse for become a very vain personage somebody have call the autumnal day the ` saddest of the year ' i have forget who he be if i ever know but in my judgment he be all wrong dark day there be -- damp chilly misty wet and unpleasant day in autumn day that make one relish a corner by a old-fashioned fire there be gusty windy capricious day in autumn which nobody care to praise when the northwest wind go sweeping over the forest roaring among the tree and whirling the sere leave along the ground and which to tell the truth about they be anything but pleasant but ` some day _ must _ be dark and dreary ' and they serve to give the sunlight of a bright to-morrow a keener relish and a lovelier comparative beauty to call the fall day the ` saddest of the year ' be a absurdity poetical i admit but still a absurdity there be nothing sad in a cold or a wet a drizzly a gusty or a stormy day much there may be that be unpleasant much that one may be dispose to quarrel with but they be anything but sad a calm autumnal day in the country be a great thing a beautiful thing a thing to thank god for a thing to make one happy buoyant of spirit full of gratitude to the great creator a thing to make one merry too not with a loud and boisterous mirth but with a heart full to overflow with cheerfulness and a calm joy to see the bright sun standing in he glory up in the sky shed he placid light over the earth when the air be clear the wind hush and the leaf be still and moveless on the tree and then to look along the hillside and mark the bright sunlight and the deep shadow the green of the fir the hemlock and the spruce the yellow of the birch the crimson of the maple the dark brown of the beech the gray of the oak the silver glow of the popple and the vary shades of all these mingle and blend in all the harmony of brilliant color why these hillside be deck like a maiden in she beauty like a bride robe for the altar talk about springtime or summer green on the hillside green in the meadow and pasture green everywhere -- all around be changeless and everlasting green as if hillside and valley forest and field have but a single dress for morning noon and night and that only and always green true there be the music of the bird joyous note and variant happy and hilarious in the spring-time but there be no cricket under the flat stone in the pasture he song be not hear in the stone wall or in the corner of the fence no music of the katydid no tap of the woodpecker on the hollow tree or the dead limb no chattering of the squirrel as he gather he winter store no pattering of the fade leave as they come so quietly down from they place no fall of the ripened nut loosen from they bur or shuck by the recent frost all these sound belong to the calm autumnal day and while they differ the whole heaven from the merry song of spring there be nothing sad about they no no nothing sad i remember -lrb- and who that be rear in the country do not -rrb- when i be a boy how i go out in the sunny day of autumn after the frost have paint the hillside to gather chestnut and when the breeze rustle among the branch how the nut come rattle down and how if the wind be still i climb into the tree and shake they top and how the chestnut patter to the ground like a shower of hail i remember the squirrel how they chatter and chase each other up and down the tree or leap from branch to branch gathering here and there a nut and scud away to they store house in the hollow tree provide in this season of plenty for the barrenness of the winter month i remember too how we gather in those same old autumnal day hickory-nut and butter-nut by the bushel and how pleasant it be in the long cold winter evening to sit around the great old kitchen fire-place crack the nut we have gather when the green the yellow the crimson the brown the gray and the pale leaf be on the tree pleasant evening those seem to I now as they come float down on the current of memory from the long past and dear be the face of those that make up the tableau as they be group around those winter fire log be blaze on the great hearth and the pineknot throw at interval on the fire give a bold and cheerful light throughout that capacious kitchen i remember how the winter wind go glance over the house-top whirling and eddy and moan around the corner hiss under the door and send its cold breath in at every crevice and how the window rattle when the blast come fiercest and how the smoke would sometimes whirl down the great chimney i remember well where my father 's chair be always place and where my mother sit of those winter evening when she household care be over for the day ply she needle or knitting or darning stocking or mend garment for such employment be no dishonor to the matron of those day with these for the lead figure i remember how seven brother and sister be group around and how the old house dog have a place in the corner and how lovingly the cat nestle between he foot cherish memory be these pleasant vision and they come to I often vivid as reality but the dream vanish the vision fade away and i think of the six pale still face as i see they last and of the name that be chisel upon the cold marble that stand through the sunny spring-time the heat of summer the autumnal day and the storm and tempest of winter over the grave of the dead chapter xxvi a surprise -- a serenade -- a visit from stranger -- a invitation to breakfast -- a fashionable hour and a bountiful bill of fare the evening be calm and the lake sleep in stirless beauty before we the shadow of the mountain reach far out from the shore lieing like a dark mantle upon the surface of the water above and beneath which the star twinkle and glow like the bright eye of seraph look down from the arch above and up from the depths below the moon in she brightness sail majestically up into the sky throw she silver light across the bosom of the lake million of firefly flash they tiny torch along the reedy shore the solemn voice of the night bird come from out the forest the call of the raccoon and the answer the hooting of the owl and the low murmur of the leaf stir by the light breeze that move lazily among the tree-top old familiar music to we be hear this latter sound be always hear even in the stillest and calmest night there may be no ripple upon the water it may be moveless and smooth as a mirror no breath of air may sweep across its surface and yet in the old forest among the tree-top there be always that low ceaseless murmur a soft whisper as if the spirit of the wood be hold in hushed voice communion together we have retire for the night under the cover of we tent my companion have sink into slumber and i be just in that dreamy state half sleeping and half awake which constitute the very paradise of repose when there come drift across the lake the faint and far off strain of music which to my seeming exceed in sweetness anything i have ever hear they come so soft and melodious float so gently over the water and die away so quietly in the old wood that i could scarce persuade myself of they reality for a while i lay luxuriate as in the delusion of a pleasant dream as though the melody that be abroad on the air be the voice of angel chant they lullaby into the charm ear of the sleeper presently smith raise he head support he cheek upon he hand he elbow rest upon the ground and after listen for a moment open he eye in bewilderment exclaim as he look in utter astonishment about he what in the name of all that be mysterious be that spalding and the doctor follow and they amazement be equal only by they admiration when oft in the stilly night come steal in matchless harmony over the water a serenade from the naiad by jupiter exclaim smith a concert by the genie of the water cry the doctor hush say spalding we be trespassing upon fairy domain the spirit of these old wood these mountain and rock-bound lake be abroad and well may they carol in they joyousness in a night like this in a little while the music change and come o'er the moonlight sea come swell over the lake and again it change and come mariner down in the deep with I go gently and swiftly abroad on the air the music cease for a moment and then two manly voice of great depth and power come float to we ear to the word : ` farewell farewell to thee araby 's daughter ' thus warble a perl beneath the deep sea ` no pearl ever lay under onan 's dark water more pure in its shell than thy spirit in thee ' that be flesh and blood at least exclaim the doctor and i propose to ascertain who be treat as to this charming serenade in the stillness of midnight we go down to the margin of the lake and a few rod from the shore lay a little craft like we own in which be seat two gentleman the one with a flute and the other with a violin they have see we campfire from they shanty on the other side of the lake and have cross over to surprise we with the melody of human music and pleasantly indeed it sound in the stillness and repose of that summer night in that wild region the echo that dwell among those old forest those hill and beautiful lake have never be startle from they slumber by such sound before and right merrily they carry they from hill to hill and through the old wood and over the calm surface of that sleep lake and with a joyousness too that tell how welcome they be among those wild and primeval thing after listen to they music for half a hour we invite we new friend ashore we find they to be two young gentleman from philadelphium who have just graduate at one of the eastern college and who have conclude to spend a month among these mountain and lake before enter upon the study of the profession to which they be to devote themselves they have be close friend from they childhood and room-mate during they collegiate course they have cultivate they taste for music until few mere amateur could equal they skill upon they respective instrument or in harmony of voice they be highly intelligent and courteous gentleman and if they future shall equal the promise of the present they will make they mark in the world we accept at parting they invitation to breakfast with they on the morrow and at one o'clock they leave we to return to they shanty over the lake we send one of we boatman to row they home and as they start across the water they treat we to a concert to which it be pleasant to listen there be something surpassingly sweet in the music of the flute and violin in the hand of skillful performer and yet to my think it fall far short of the melody of the human voice i have listen to some of the most celebrated singer and of the most distinguished performer but it appear to I now that i never on any other occasion hear the melody of the human voice or instrumental music half so enchanting as that which come float over the lake on that calm summer night there be a volume and compass about it which can never be reach in a concert room it be not loud but it seem to fill all the air with its sweetness it come over the sens like a pleasant dream as it go swell up to the hill that skirt the lake float away over the water and die away in lengthen cadence in the old forest every other sound be hush the voice of the night-bird be still even the frog along the shore suspend they bellowing and all nature seem listen to the new harmony that thus fall like enchantment upon the repose of midnight the music grow fainter and fainter as it recede until only a occasional strain wavy and dream-like come creep like the voice of a spirit over the water and then it be lose in the distance the frog resume they roar the night-bird lift up they voice the raccoon call to he fellow and be answer away off in the forest the pile-driver hammer away at he stake the old owl hoot solemnly from he perch and we retire to we tent to talk over the romance of we serenade and to dream of ole bull and the swedish nightingale the morning break bright and balmy a pleasant breeze sweep lazily over the lake lift the thin mist that hang like a veil of gauze above the water we leave we tent stand and cross over to the shanty of we friend of the previous evening to breakfast we find they live like prince they two boatman have build they a log shanty open in front and cover with bark so as to be impervious to the rain while within be a luxurious bed of bough around the campfire be bench of hew slab and a table of the same material a few rod from the door a beautiful spring come bubble up into a little basin of pure white sand the water of which be limpid and cold almost as ice-water they have be here for a week hunting and fishing they have employ they leisure in jerk the venison they have take of which they have some four or five bushel and which they intend to take home with they to serve together with the skin of the deer they have slay as trophy of they success they receive we cordially and we sit down to a breakfast which for variety at least rival the elaborate preparation of the astor or the st nichola albeit the cookery as a abstract fact might have be of the simplest we have venison-steak pork ham jerk venison stew fresh trout broil partridge cold roast duck a fricassee of wood rabbit and broil pigeon upon we table come in course or pile up helter-skelter on great platter of birch bark some on tin plate and now and then a choice bit on a chip we have coffee and tea and the purest of spring water by way of beverage and truth compel I to admit that under the advice of the doctor a drop or two of old cognac may have be add by way of relish or to temper the effect of a hearty meal upon the delicate stomach of some of the guest we be exceedingly fashionable in we time for breakfast this morning and it be eleven o'clock before we rise from table the sun be travel through a cloudless sky and he brightness lay like a mantle of glory upon the water while he heat give to the deep shadow of the old tree whose long arm with they clustering foliage be interlock above we a peculiar charm the description which we give of the beautiful lake we have leave the day before the story of the moose and the bear we have kill together with we quit-claim of the shanty we have inhabit bring we friend to the conclusion to drift that way for a week or so it be amusing to hear smith relate the manner of capture the bear the glory of which achievement he have win by the toss up of a dollar how he have start out alone in one of the boat with he rifle to look into a little bay half a mile below the shanty where be leave the rest of we sleep after dinner and how as he be float along under the shadow of the hill at the base of a wall of rock some forty foot high rise straight up from the water he hear something walk just over the precipice and how he pick up he rifle that lay in the bottom of the boat to be ready for any emergency and then how astonished he be to see a great black bear walk out into view along the edge of the rock above and how carefully he sight he and how at the crack of he rifle the animal come tumble down the cliff and how quick he reload and give trim a settler in the shape of a second bullet and how he tug and strain and lift to get he into the boat and how astonished we all be when he return with he prize to camp while relate this wonderful achievement he wink at the doctor as much as to say fair play remember we compact stand by I now and the doctor do stand by he boldly endorse with a gravity that be refreshing every invention of smith 's prolific imagination on the subject of he slaughter the bear we leave we new friend in the afternoon they to start in the morning for we old camping-ground on the lake above and we down the stream on we retreat from the wilderness we come back to we tent after secure a string of trout from the mouth of the little stream across the bay we evening meal be over and we sit around we campfire just as the sun be hide himself behind the western highland when from a little hollow in the forest behind we and but a short way off we hear the call of a raccoon martin start over the ridge with the dog and in five minute he halloo to we to come with we rifle for he have the animal treed and ready to be bring down at a moment 's warning we go over to where he be and sure enough away up in the top of a tall birch sit he coonship look quietly down upon the dog that be bay at the foot of the tree gentleman say spalding we will not all fire at this animal as we do at smith 's bear one bullet be enough for he and if he get down among we i think six man will be a match for one ` coon ' so we need not be inhuman through a sense of danger whose shot shall he be i move that spalding have the first shot say smith and the motion be carry do i understand you gentleman spald inquire adjust himself as if prepare to bring down the game that i be to have this first shot and that no one be to fire until i have take a fair shot at he we all answer yes be you perfectly agree in this and do you all pledge yourselve to abide the compact spalding inquire again bring he rifle to a present and look up at the game all agree we answer with one voice very well gentleman say spalding shoulder he rifle there be one life save anyhow that animal up there have be in great peril but he be safe now i do not intend to fire at he sooner than ten o'clock to-morrow and if i understand we arrangement we leave here in the morning at six sell by mose exclaim martin as he break out into a roar that you might have hear a mile i think the judge mean something by the time he waste in talkin ' and gettin ' ready to shoot spalding inquire smith do you expect we to keep this compact of course i do he reply do any of we peach when you open so rich in the matter of you bear do any one break he compact with you on that subject absolve we from we agreement about the bear and you may take my shot at that animal up in the tree i be not bear yesterday smith reply and i can not afford to exchange the glory of kill the bear in my own way and bare three responsible endorser for the honor of shoot a coon gentleman he continue i move that that coon be permit to take he own time to descend from he perch up in the tree-top there and the motion be carry unanimously chapter xxvii would i be a boy again we have play the boy again yesterday and to-day pretty well remark smith as we sit in front of oar tent in the evening smoking we pipe and i be half inclined to think we have start for home too soon after all spalding 's moralize for the last two or three day deceive I i think as he be become so serious he must be get tired of the wood but he proposition yesterday to escort that deer to the shore and frighten he almost to death he jolly humor with we young friend over the way and the trick he play on as in regard to the raccoon this evening satisfy I that he be get a good deal of the boy in he yet we shall have to retreat from the wood slower than i think to exhaust it if the care of business or the duty of life do not call we back to civilization say the doctor i could almost spend the summer among these lake only for the luxury of feeling like a boy again when i listen to the glad voice of the wild thing around as i can almost wish myself one of they that coon for instance interrupted smith that come so near get shoot by he chatter i call the gentleman to order say i the doctor have the floor i sometimes think that it be no great thing after all to be human the doctor continue bow he acknowledgment for my protect he right to the floor mind be a great thing but there be more of sorrow anxiety and care clustering about it than these wild thing we hear and see around we suffer through they instinct reason knowledge wisdom be great thing to stand at the head of create matter to be the noblest of all the work of god the only create thing wear the image and stamp with the patent of diety be proud thing to boast of but great and glorious and proud as they be they have they balance of evil they bring with they no contentment no repose while they heap upon we boundless necessity and limitless want we be hurry through life too rapidly for the enjoyment of the present and the good we see in prospect be never attain when we be boy we long to be man with the strength and intellect of man and now that we be man with mature power of body and mind true to we organic restlessness and discontent we look back with longing for the feeling and emotion of we boyhood what a glorious thing it would be if we could always be young -- not boy exactly but at that stage of life when the physical power be most active and the heart most buoyant that to my think would be a better arrangement than to grow old even if we live on until we stumble at last from mere infirmity into the grave look forward in discontent one half of we life and backward in equal discontent the other you remind I say spalding of a little incident simple in itself but which at the time make a deep impression upon my mind and which occur but a few week ago return from my usual walk one morning my way lay through the capitol park the tree cover with they young and fresh foliage intertwine they arm lovingly above the gravel walk form a beautiful arch above through which the sun could scarcely look even in the splendor of he noon the bird sing merrily among the branch and the odor of the leaf and grass as the dew exhale give a freshness almost of the forest to the morning air on the walk before I be two beautiful child a boy of six and a little girl of four they be merry and happy as the bird be and with a arm of each around the waist of the other they go hop and skip up and down the walk stop now and then to waltz to swing round and round and then dart away again with they hop and skip too full of hilarity too instinct with vitality to be for a moment still the flush of health be on they cheek and the warm light of affection in they eye they be confide affectionate loving little child and my heart warm towards they as i see they waltz and dance and skip about under the green foliage of the tree ` willy ' say the little girl as they sit down on the low railing of the grass plat to breathe for a moment and listen to the chirrup and song of the bird in the bough above they ` willy would not you like to be a little bird ' ' a little bird lizzie ' reply she brother ` why should i like to be a little bird ' ` oh to fly around among the branch and the leaf upon the tree ' say lizzie ` and among the blossom when the morning be warm and the sun come out bright and clear in the sky oh they be so happy ' ` but the morning aint always warm and the sun do not always come up bright and clear in the sky lizzy ' say she brother ` and the leaf and blossom aint always on the tree the cold storm and the winter come and kill the blossom and scatter the leaf and what would you do then i should not like to be a bird but i _ should _ like to be a big strong man like father ' ` please tell I what tune it be ' say the little boy address I i tell he and he turn to he little sister save ` come lizzie we must go mother say we must be home by half-after seven and it be most that now ' and he put he arm lovingly around she neck and she put hers around he waist and they walk away towards home talk about the leaf and the blossom on the tree the merry little bird the bright sunshine and the pleasant time they have have in the park that morning it be a pleasant thing to see those two little child so confide so earnest and true in they young affection cling to each other so closely as if no shadow could ever come between they or tarn they heart from each other how natural be that simple question put by that little girl to she brother ` would not you like to be a little bird ' it be the thought of a pure young mind that see only the bright sunshine of to-day whose life be in the present and to which there be no foreboding of darkness in the future there be philosophy too in the answer of she brother a simple but suggestive sermon ` but the sun ' say he ` do not always come up bright and clear the morning aint always warm the leaf and blossom aint always on the tree the cold storm and the winter come and kill the blossom and scatter the leaf and what would you do then ' to finite mind like ours it would seem to have be a more beautiful arrangement of nature could it have be that we could always have the spring time in its glory with we if the leaf and the blossom be always young and fresh and fragrant if the cold storm of winter could never come to ` kill the blossom and scatter the leaf ' if the sun would always come up bright and clear if the bird be always merry and they glad voice always on the air this world would be a paradise then and one older and wiser in the learning of the school but not wiser or better in the heart 's affection than that little girl might well wish to be a little bird to fly around among the branch the green leaf and the blossom on the tree and yet what presumption in finite man to sit in judgment upon or criticise the wisdom of the omnipotent god how know we but that a single change the slightest alteration of a simple law would go jarring through all the universe throw everything into confusion and bring utter chaos where now all be order the mother see she little child die she lay it in its coffin and surrender it to the grave and she heart rebel against the providence that snatch away she treasure in she agony she appeal reproachfully to heaven and ask ` why be i thus bereaved ' foolish mother impeach not the wisdom of you bereavement mysterious as it may be know this that in the council of eternity you sorrow be consider and the decree which take from you you darling be order in mercy pestilence sweep over the land a wail be on the air peace mourner be still the pestilence have a mission of mercy mysterious as it may be to we the storm lash the ocean into fury tall ship freight with human soul go down into its relentless depths a shriek of agony come gurgle up from the devour water a cry of woe be hear from a thousand home over the wreck and the lose peace again mourner the storm have a mission of mercy it may never be comprehend by we here but when the veil shall be lift as in god 's good time it doubtless will be we shall see how the pestilence and the storm that cost so many tear be essential to the harmony of a glorious system a perfect plan and that seem sorrow be at last the occasion of unspeakable joy let no man say that this or that law or operation of nature be better change until he can fathom the design of god till he can create a planet and send it on its everlasting round till he can place a star in the firmament till he can breathe upon a statue the workmanship of he own hand and be obey when he command it to walk forth a thing of life till he can dip he hand into chaos and throw off world the ` cold storm of winter ' be essential to the enjoyment of the brightness and glory the genial sunshine the pleasant foliage the blossom and the odor of spring they have they use and chill and dreary and desolate as they may be they be part of a arrangement order by infinite goodness and omnipotent wisdom ' i should like to be a big strong man like father be ' how like a boy be this thirst for the strength the might and power of manhood and this be the aspiration of the young heart always to be mature strong to grapple with the care and wrestle with the stern actuality of life how little of these do childhood know how little do it calculate the chance that when in the long future it shall have attain the full strength and maturity of life when manhood shall be in the glory and strength of its prime and it look forward into the dark cloud beyond and backward into the bright sunshine of the past the aspiration the hope will change into regret and the yearning of the heart speaking from its silent depths will be ` would i be a boy again ' chapter xxviii head down stream -- return to tupper 's lake -- the camp on the island we start down stream again at six o'clock in the morning intend if possible to reach tupper 's lake before encamp for the night it would make for we a busy day to accomplish so much but go down stream and down hill be very different thing from go up as any gentleman may satisfy himself by rowing against a current of two mile the hour or toiling up a ascent of three or four hundred foot to the mile and then retrace he step we accomplish more than half the distance and that over the worst of the journey by twelve o'clock and we halt for dinner and a _ siesta _ if there be one thing in life which can lay any claim to be consider a positive luxury it be a nap on a mossy bank in the deep shadow of the forest tree after a hearty meal of a warm summer day there should be in order to its full appreciation a mixture of weariness with a due proportion of laziness too much of either detract from the enjoyment of its beatitude to _ feel _ the sensation of rest that weariness be leave you and that the process of recuperation be a active living agency go on all through the system while the natural love of repose be be gratify as a independent emotion constitute the very perfection of mere animal enjoyment the musquito at midday have go to they rest or if a straggler come buzz and sing about you ear you be lull rather than disturb by he song if he take he drop of blood from you vein the tickling of he tiny lance be but a pleasant titilation and you let he feed on almost grateful for he kindness in keep you from sleep too soundly or lose in utter oblivion the full extent of the luxury of perfect repose after a hour 's rest we launch we little fleet upon the river again and while the sun be yet above the western highland we stand upon the broad flat rock at the mouth of bog river look out over tupper 's lake one of the most beautiful sheet of water that the sun or the star ever look upon we sea-biscuit be get low and we egress from the wilderness be therefore become in some sort a necessity there be no lack of venison or fish but these be rather luxury than actual necessaries and they be become somewhat stale to as the staff of life be bread and of this we have but two day ' supply it be entirely true that we jerk venison now dry and hard as chip could if necessary be make to furnish to some extent a substitute still while it be write that man shall not live by bread alone it be equally the law that he can not very well get along without it we launch we boat upon the lake and row to the head of long island where we put up we tent for the night i have speak so often of the loveliness of the evening on these beautiful lake that to attempt a description of the one we enjoy on this romantic island would be only a tiresome repetition but there be a splendor about the heaven above and they counterpart in the depths below which i have scarcely ever see equal there be no moon in the early evening and so pure and clear be the atmosphere so moveless and still the water that the star seem to come out in vaster number and with a intenser glow and to be reflect back from away down in the lake with a brighter refulgence the hill along the shore seem to stand up in bolder outline the bay to lay in deeper shadow while the tall peak stand in grim solemnity like pillar support the mighty arch of the sky i be ask myself say smith as we sit look out over the water in the evening or gaze down into the glowing depths and listen to the night voice faint and far off in the old forest as they come float over the lake i be ask myself as we journey around the fall to-day and as we stand on the rock where the river come leap down and plunge into the lake whether the march of improvement would ever spread a lowell around those fall or subject those wild water to the use of civilization whether progress would ever invade those mountain region or the ingenuity of man ever discover use for these rock and boulder or coin wealth from the sterile and sandy soil of this old wilderness hitherto a country like this have be regard of no value save for the timber which it grow and when that be exhaust as fit only to be abandon to sterility and desolation but who can tell whether there may not be in these boulder these rock this sandy and unproductive soil unknown wealth hold in reserve to reward the research of science in its utilitarian exploration i be not now speak of gold or silver or any other dross which man have hitherto waste they toil to accumulate but of new discovery and new purpose to which these now useless thing may be apply discovery which may send the tide of emigration surge up from the valley to mountain region like these may it not be that science while delving among the wreck of vanish age may stumble upon some new principle or combination of the element of which these old rock be compose that shall give they a value beyond that of the richest lowland and make they the center of a dense and cultivate population you question answer spalding be suggestive do you ever think what gigantic stride the world have make within the memory of man now live and who be yet unwilling to be count as old look back for only fifty year and note what a stupendous leap it have take where then be the iron road over which the locomotive go thunder on its mission of civilization where the telegraph that mock at time and annihilate space hark there be a new sound break the stillness of midnight and startling the mountain echo from they sleep of age it be the scream of the steam-whistle the snort of the iron horse the thunder of he hoof of steel rush forward with the speed of the wind shake the ground like a earthquake as he move a new motor have be harness into the service of man and make to fly with he message swifter than sound it be the winged lightning and as it flash along the wire stretch from city to city and across continent carry with unerring certainty every word commit to its charge ocean steamer have make but a ferriage of sea the photographic art have make even the light of the sun a substitute for the pencil of the artist everywhere in all the department of science in every branch of the art improvement progress have be go on with a sublimity of achievement unknown in any age of the past these thing be mighty motor which push along civilization throw a wonderful energy into the forward impulse of the world but remember that though these result be bring about by the advance in the mechanic art yet that advance be base upon a deeper philosophy a profounder wisdom than mere perfectability in those art take the steam-engine -- it be a great contrivance a wonderful invention but the greatest of all be the discovery of the principle and operation the practical phenomenon of steam itself the telegraphic machine be a great invention but the great thing be the development of the science of electricity the discovery of the secret agency which send forward the think entrust to it swifter than light the daguerrian instrument the metallic plate the prepared paper be great invention but vastly greater be the discovery and development of the phenomenon and affinity of light the mystery of solar influence there be hope for the world in all this mighty progress for with it will one day come the development of the true nature and theory of government the true solution of the great theory of the social compact the proper adjustment of the relation of man to man a right appreciation of the nature and value of human rights it be bring forward the mass elevate the million who work it will rouse into activity they innate energy and bring forth they inward might it create think to guide the hand that set all this vast machinery in motion it diffuse and strengthen intellectuality and the pride of intellectuality making of the man who work something more than mere machine themselves it be develop and perfect a mightier engine than any of man 's invention one that tyrant can not always control that king can not always manage that engine be the human mind like the steam-engine it be gather power and capability for the exercise of power and the time will come when it will go crash with resistless energy among throne overturn despotism upheave dynasty sweep away those false theory of governmental institution which guarantee to one class of people a life of luxurious idleness couple with a prerogative to rule and which doom another class to a hereditary servitude changeless as fate and relentless as the grave it will vindicate the rights and ennoble the destiny of the mass of the people who work but where be this career of progress to end be there a limit to this onward movement we know that the world have make greater advancement in the present century than it do in the five thousand year precede it and that new discovery in the science and the art be be make every day nature have be compel and be still be compel to yield up secret which have be for century regard as beyond the power of human capacity to penetrate how be this be the world to go on thus always be this rush of progress to remain unchecked always if so what mystery even of omnipotent wisdom will remain unsolved at last what result will not human energy be able to accomplish be the time to come when man shall be able to shape out of clay fashion from wood or stone a image of himself and breathing upon it command it to walk forth a thing of life and be obey will he be able to search out a universal antidote to disease will he discover the means of supply the human frame with such recuperative power as will nullify the law that prescribe to all flesh the dilapidation and decay of age of weakness and of death will he search out some secret agency which will hold he body in perpetual youth defy alike the attrition of age and the ravages of disease will he discover how it be that time sap the strength and steal away the vigor of the human system and a remedy for exhaust and waste energy it be not my purpose to advance a theory base upon a affirmative answer to these inquiry but when we contemplate the stupendous pace at which the world be move forward who will venture to assert where the limit to this progress be to be find you tell I that man can not _ create _ that he can only combine into new shape element which god have furnish to he hand i do not know this that he _ have _ not create i admit but that he have not capability as yet undeveloped as a creator i do not know i will not venture the assertion that the time will ever come when he will have discover wherein lie the mystery of life that he will ever find a antidote to disease that he will search out some recuperative agency stronger than the law of decay and that will hold the human system in the perpetual vigor and bloom and beauty of maturity i will not assert that science will at last be carry to such perfection that there shall be no more infirmity of age that the pestilence will be stay from walk in the darkness and destruction from waste at noonday that man will cease to grow old save in year or that death will be compel to seek its victim only through the channel of accident against which forecast will not and science have no opportunity to guard what i mean to say be that i do not know that just such result be beyond the capability of human progress measure the future by the past i can not demonstrate that such result may not one day be attain the good time of which you speak say the doctor when there shall be no more infirmity of age no grow old save in year when there shall be no wasting by disease through the perfectability of the curative science or the discovery of some recuperative agency stronger than the law of decay will never come when it be grant as a abstract proposition that the capability of science be sufficient to counteract the mere waste influence of time upon the human system you be meet by a great practical fact which will overturn you theory the excess of the world be a much more fruitful source of disease and death than the attrition of age there be a constant struggle on the part of nature to build up and beautify to strengthen and recuperate against the result of human excess not one in a million of those who pass away every year die from the effect of age as a primary cause hence you must not only perfect science but you must perfect the moral and the habit of the human family before you can exempt they from decay and death the instinct of man the appetency which they possess in common with the whole animal creation be each make the source of disease and premature decay some man eat too much some drink too much some sleep too much some waste they vital energy in sensual indulgence while all have some vicious habit -lrb- i mean with reference to the preservation of life -rrb- known or unknown to the world which sooner or later undermine the constitution and help on the work of dilapidation these excess will always exist they be inherent in the human constitution result from the very nature of man they be a inevitable sequence of he physical structure and he intellectual life to avoid they imply absolute perfectability in every attribute and that make he a god until man shall have become infinite in wisdom as well as immaculate in purity he will continue to indulge to a greater or less extent in excess of some sort and those excess will always be a overmatch when superad to the natural law of decay for the recuperative effort of science you must create a radical reform in every department of life in business in social habit in the fashion in the mode of living in everything before you can hope to reach the utopia of which you speak the outrage perpetrate upon nature by the conventionality of the world alone would be a insurmountable barrier to the realization of you idea the necessity for excessive labor to satisfy artificial want hew away at one end of society and the indulgence of idleness and ease at the other exposure to the element to heat and cold bury its million and too great seclusion in pursuit of comfort in heated room and a confine and corrupt atmosphere bury its million also lack of wholesome food fill thousand of grave and the result of abundance fill other thousand lack of appropriate clothing fit for the constitution and the season engender disease and death and a excess of the same article fashion as stupendous folly only can fashion it engender vastly more disease and death there be element of decay and death furnish to man and woman tempting they weakness and force upon they adoption by the conventionality of life every day every hour and everywhere it be a part of we civilization a offshoot of the very progress of which you speak a sort of necessity in practical result at least that man _ shall _ so live as to wage war against nature and against themselves that they shall hurry themselves or be hurry by inevitable circumstance into the grave at the earliest possible moment you may therefore dismiss from you mind my friend the fanciful idea that science will ever enable the world to dispense with the cemetery or that the city of the dead will through its agency cease to flourish you will find that as science close up one avenue to the grave man will force a way to it through another we shall have to live as we father live be subject to disease as they be grow old as they grow old and die as they die we must submit to the law which have write the doom of decay upon all thing which have make we mortal and when we time come we must be content to pass away as the countless million who precede we have do well say spalding as he knock the ash from he pipe and rise to retire under the cover of the tent for the night be it as you say what matter it ' i would not live always ' give to we the hope of a hereafter a faith that look through the valley of the shadow of death and see immortality a world of glory beyond and what matter it how soon the hour of we departure shall come chapter xxix a mysterious sound -- treed by a moose -- angle for a powder horn -- a unheeded warning and the consequence as spalding cease speak there come from away off over the forest in the direction of the tall mountain peak a faint sound like the boom of a cannon so distant that it could scarcely be hear and yet it be distinct and palpable to the sens i say that it come from the direction of the mountain see dim and shadowy in the distance and yet none of we be quite sure of this we all hear it but not one of we could assert that the direction from which it come be a fix fact in he mind there judge say cullen i have hearn that sound often among the mountain and when i have be driftin ' about on these lake it never seem much louder or nearer it always seem to come from the mountain and yet you 'll hear it while shantyin ' at they base and it sound just as faint and far off as it do just now what it be or where it come from i will not undertake to say the old ingin who five and twenty year ago fish and hunt over these region tell of it as a thing to wonder at and that it be hand along down from generation to generation as one of the mystery of this wilderness i mind once i be out among the adirondack trappin ' martin and sable i shantied for a week with crop under the shadow of mount marcy it be twenty odd year ago and that old mountain stand a good deal further from a clearin ' than it do now crop and i have a good many hard day ' work that trip but we get a full pack of martin and sable skin and two or three wolf scalp besides a bear and a painter and we do not complain wal one afternoon we put up a shanty in a open spot two mile from we regular campin ' ground and build we fire for the night there be no moon and though the star shine out bright and clear yet in the deep shadow of the forest it be dark and gloomy enough we have eat we supper and i be smokin ' my last pipe before layin ' myself away when all at once the forest be light up like the day it be all the more light from the sudden glare which break upon the darkness and there for a instant stand the old wood light up like noon every tree distinct every mountain every rock and valley as perfect and plain to be see as if the sun be standin ' right above we in the sky crop be as much astonished as i be and he creep to my foot and tremble like a coward as he crouch beside they i look up and flyin ' across the heaven be a great ball of fire lookin ' for all the world as if the sun have break loose and be runnin ' away in a fright a long trail of light flash and stream along the sky where it pass it be out of sight in a moment and the fiery tail it leave behind fade into darkness a little while after maybe ten minute after it disappear that boomin ' sound come driftin ' down the wind and i somehow tho ' t it be mix up in some way with that great ball of fire that fly across the sky maybe i be wrong but i have always tho ' t it be the bustin ' into piece of that fiery thing that light up the old wood that night that break the forest stillness like a far off cannon i never hear it so loud at any other time and when i hear it now i always say to myself there go another of nater 's fireball into shiver i have hearn it in the daytime when the air be still and the forest voice be hushed but i never at any other time day or night see what i suspicioned occasion it the ingin use to say it come from the mountain but it do not i have hearn some folk pretend that it come from the bowels of the airth but it do not its a thing of the air and i have a notion it travel a mighty long way from its startin ' place afore it reach we talkin ' about that trip among the adirondack put I in mind of a adventer i have with a bull moose on one occasion among they there be time when sich a animal be dangerous i have hearn tell of elephant gittin ' crazy and breakin ' loose from they keeper or killin ' they and makin ' a general smash of whatever come in they way i believe its so sometimes with a bull moose and when the fit be on the animal forget its timid nater and be bold and fierce as a tiger i have see two sich in my day one of 'em send I into a tree and the other put I around a great hemlock a dozen or twenty time a good deal faster than i like to travel in a general way and if i have not hamstring he with my huntin ' knife maybe he would have be chasin ' I round that tree yet wal as i be sayin ' i be out among the adirondack one fall airly in November i would wound a deer and send crop forward on he trail to overtake and secure he it be a big buck with long horn and crop have a pretty good general idea of what sich thing mean he be cautious about cultivatin ' too close a acquaintance with such a animal unless something oncommon obligate he to do so i hear he bayin ' a little way over a ridge layin ' gist beyond where i shoot the buck i war not in any great hurry for i know crop would attend to he case and i tho ' t i would wipe out my rifle afore i load it again i be standin ' by the upturned root of a tall fir tree that have be blow down and in fallin ' have lodge in a crotch of a great birch maybe twenty foot from the ground and break off i step onto the butt of the fall spruce and be takin ' my time to clean my gun when i hear a crashin ' among the brush on the other side of the ridge as if some mighty big animal be comin ' my way i walk pretty quick along up the slopin ' log till i be maybe fifteen foot from the ground and i see crop comin ' over the ridge in what the doctor would call a high state of narvous excitement with he tail between he leg lookin ' back over he shoulder and expressin ' he astonishment in a low quick bark at every jump at something he seem to regard as mighty onpleasant on he trail i do not have to wait long to find out what it be for about the biggest bull moose i ever happen to see come crashin ' like a steam-engine after he he be not more than two rod behind the dog and if i ever see a ugly look beast that moose be the one every hair seem to stand towards he head and if he be not in earnest i never see a animal that be he be puttin ' in he best jump and the way he hurry up crop 's cake be a thing to be astonish at the dog do not see I and seem to be principled agin stoppin ' to inquire my whereabouts he dash under the log where i stand and the moose after he like mad he seem to be expectin ' aid and comfort from I as the papers say and be wonderin ' no doubt where I and my rifle be all this time i call after he but he be in a hurry and could not stop for there be a thing he do not care about shakin ' hand with not three rod from he tail he hear I though and take a circle round a great boulder and the moose after he and as he get straighten my way i call he again and he see I he leap onto the log and come runnin ' up to where i stand and be mighty glad to be out of the way of they big hoof and horn that be after he he be safe now and he open he mouth and let off a good deal of tall barkin ' at he enemy the moose see we and he fury be the greater because he could not get at we he keep chargin ' back and forth under the log we be perch on and if there be not malice in he eye i would not say so when i first see he i be standin ' with the butt of my rifle on the log my hand graspin ' the barrel and as i catch it up suddenly to load the string of my powder-horn catch between the muzzle and the ramrod break and the horn fall to the ground here be a fix for a hunter to be in my rifle be empty and every grain of powder i have in the world be in the horn fifteen foot below I on the ground to go down after it be a thing i be principled agin undertaking considerin ' the circumstance of that bull moose with he great horn and the onpleasant temper he seem to be in what to do i do not know i holler and shout at the kritter thinkin ' maybe that the voice of a human might scare he but it only make he madder and every time i holler he charge under the log more furiously than before i throw my huntin ' cap at he but he pitch into it and if he do not trample it into the ground as if it be a human you may shoot I after a while he get tire of dashin ' back and forth under the log and take a stand two or three rod off and as he eye we shake he great horn and stamp with he big hoof as much as to say ` very well gentleman i can wait do not hurry yourselve take you time but i shall stay here as long as you stay up there and when you do come down we 'll take a turn that will not be pleasant to some of we ' crop and i take the hint and sit still thinkin ' maybe he would get over he pet and move off but he do ` nt lean that way at all he seem to have make up he mind to stay there as long as we stay on the log be the same more or less we would sit there maybe a hour when i happen to think of a trollin ' line and some fishhook i have in my pocket and it come across I that possibly i might fish up my powder horn so tyin ' half a dozen hook to the end of my line i lay down on the log to angle for my powder-horn when i lay down the old bull make a pass under the log as if he expect I down there and charge back again as if he be disappoint in not runnin ' agin I but he see ` twa not no use and take he old stand agin i drop down the grapnel and after a great many failure i hook into the string of the powder horn and hoist away i haul it up mighty quick for the old bull seem to be suspicion that something be goin ' on that might have something to do with he futer happiness and when he get sight of it the pass he make be a thing to stand out of the way of but he be too late the powder-horn be safe and i notify he as squire smith do the cat to leave they part in just one minute by the clock he do ` nt pay any attention to the warnin ' i load my rifle carefully and while i be puttin ' on the cap ask the gentleman if he calculate to move on and let peaceable people alone he do not condescend to answer a word look for all the world like a tiger in savageness ` very well ' say i as i sight he between the eye ` on you head be it ' and pull the ball go crashin ' through he skull into he brain and he go down crop know what that mean he do not wait to run down the log but leap to the ground and have he tooth in the animal 's throat before the echo of my rifle be do dancin ' around among the mountain i load my gun before i come down thinkin ' maybe there might be another bad temper moose about but there be not crop and i learn what we ought to have know before and that be that it be a safe thing for a hunter to have a extra horn of powder in he pocket and a loaded rifle in he hand when a mad bull moose be on he trail and that a slantin ' tree be a good thing to get onto at sich a time chapter xxx good-bye -- float down the rackett -- a black fox -- a trick upon the martin trapper and its consequence we rise with the dawn the next morning and before the sun be above the hill we be on we way down the lake to separate as we strike the rackett the doctor and smith to return by the way of keeseville and the champlain and spalding and myself to drift down that pleasant stream to pottsdam and thence to the majestic st lawrence to spend a fortnight among the thousand island of that noble river near the outlet of the lake be a bold rocky bluff rise right up out of the deep water twenty foot against which the wave dash and around which a romantic bay steal away to hide itself in the old wood this beautiful bay be always calm for even the narrow strait which connect it with the open water be divide by a rocky but wooded island shut out alike the wind and the wave from disturb its repose it be surround by gigantic forest tree whose shadow make it a cool retreat in the heat of noon and whose dense foliage fill the air with freshness and fragrance when the sun be hot in the sky towards its head a cold stream come creep around the boulder and dancing and singing down the rock from a copious spring a short way back in the forest near where this brook enter we land at seven o'clock to breakfast we supply ourselves with fish by cast across the mouth of the little stream while we boatman be prepare a fire we sail of eight mile down the lake furnish we with appetite which give to the beautiful speckled trout we catch there a peculiar relish we arrange matter so that the doctor and smith be to return in one boat to the saranac while spalding and myself be to move on down the rackett with the other two cullen and wood be to go with we to pottsdam from whence we route lay by railroad to ogdensburgh we have on enter the wood dispatch we baggage to the former place to await we arrival there at nine o'clock we launch out upon the lake again there be two outlet which enter the rackett half a mile apart down the right hand one of which the doctor and smith 's course lay and ours down the leave we shake hand with we friend and lay upon we oar while they pass on towards home wish they a pleasant voyage and a safe return i say shout smith as they be about round a point that would hide they from we view remember we compact about kill the bear the glory of that achievement belong to I you know do not say a word about it when you get home till you see I i have not fully make up my mind as to the manner of capture he and there must be no contradiction on the subject go ahead reply spalding we 'll be careful of you honor drop we a line at cape vincent when you have digest the matter and we 'll stand by you good-bye good-bye and we friend disappear from we sight on they voyage home and so say spalding we be to leave this beautiful lake and these old forest so soon i could linger here a month still enjoy these shady and primitive solitude to you and i the quiet which one find here be vastly more invite than it be to the friend who have just leave we the doctor of necessity lead a life of activity feeling physical weariness as the result of he labor but little of that strong yearning for intellectual repose which those in you profession or mine so often feel smith 's life demand excitement the absence of the care and toil of business occasion a restlessness and desire of change which make he discontent here with they the great charm of this wild region be its novelty they enjoy its beauty for a season with peculiar relish but as these become familiar the spell be break and they turn towards home without a regret to you and i there be something beyond this we too feel and appreciate the beauty of these lake and mountain the hill-side and placid water the forest song and wild scenery be pleasant to we but we enjoy they the more from the intellectual relaxation the mental quiet and repose which we find among they we feel that we be rest that the process of recuperation intellectual as well as physical be go on within we we can almost trace its progress and we feel that the time spend by we here be full of profit as well as pleasure at all event it be so with I and if duty to other whose interest it be my business to serve do not demand my return i could enjoy another month here with unabated pleasure you have leave I little i reply to add to what you have already say in express the source of my enjoyment among these beautiful lake fishing and hunting consider in the abstract be thing i care but little about they be pleasant enough in they way but what bring I here be the strong desire as well as necessity for the repose of which you speak there be a luxury in intellectual rest when the brain be wearied with protracted toil which far surpass the mere animal enjoyment which follow relaxation from physical labor that rest i can not find in society i must seek it among wild and primeval solitude where i can be alone with nature in she unadorned simplicity away from the barbarism so to speak of civilization where i can act and talk and think as a natural and not a artificial man where i can be off my guard and free from the weight of that armor which the conventionality of life the caption espionage of the world compel we to wear un-tempted by the thousand enticement which society everywhere present to lure we into unrest we drift leisurely down the left hand channel and enter the rackett bidding good-bye to the beautiful lake as a bend in the river hide it from we view a mile below the junction the river run square against a precipice some sixty foot in height wheeling off at a right angle and stretch away though a natural meadow on either hand of hundred of acre in extent at the base of this precipice form by the rocky point of a hill the water be of unknown depth above and fifty foot from the surface of the river there be ledge of a foot or two in width like shelf along which the fox the fisher and possibly the panther creep instead of travel over the high ridge extend back into the forest as we round a point which bring we in view of this precipice spalding who be in the forward boat discover a black object make its way along the face of the rock a signal for silence be give and the boat be permit to float with the current in the direction of the precipice we be forty rod distant and the animal whatever it be have no suspicion of danger it pause midway across the rock look about nose out over the water and sit down upon its haunch as if enjoy the beauty of the scenery around it in the meantime the boat have drift within twenty rod and spald take deliberate aim fire at the crack of the rifle the animal leap dear of the ledge strike once against the face of the rock some twenty foot below and then go end over end thirty foot into the river as he strike the water he commence swim round and round in a circle evidently bewilder by spalding 's bullet or the effect of he involuntary plunge down the rock we man bent to they oar and have get within five or six rod of it when it straighten up in alarm for the shore hold on cullen say i lay steady for a moment i draw upon the animal and just as it reach the shore fire and it turn over dead we find it to be a black fox that have walk out upon the ledge and thus be add another victim to the indulgence of a idle curiosity spalding 's bullet have graze its belly rake off the hair and grain the skin mine have go through its head there judge say cullen as he lift the animal into the boat be a kritter that be not often meet with in these part and the wonder be that he do not discover we as we float down the stream he be about the cunningest animal that travel the wood he be get a eye that be always open a delicate ear and a sharp nose and he keep 'em busy as a general thing he never neglect they warnin ' but put out about the quickest whenever they notify he that there be a enemy about i have have a good deal of trouble with they in my day when i have be out trappin ' martin they 'll manage to spring the trap and carry off the bait when one of they chap get on a line of trap there be no use in talkin ' the game 's up and the trapper may make up he mind to get rid of the varmint in some way or locate in another range of country he 'll find he trap spring and he bait go or if a martin have be in ahead of the fox he 'll find only the skull the end of the tail the foot and a few of the larger bone and they 'll be pick mighty clean at that you have see a martin trap or if you have not i 'll try and describe one so that you 'll understand it it be a very simple contrivance and if a martin be not a good deal more stupid than a goose he have never be catch in one of they we drive down a couple of row of little stake plantin ' the stake close together and leave between the row a space of six or eight inch the row be may be a foot and a half long we then cut and trim a long saplin ' say five or six inch across at the butt and leave one end on the ground set the other may be two foot high with a kind of figure four so that when it fall it will come down between the row of stake we fix the bait so that a martin in get at it will have to go in between the row of stake and displace the trap stick when down come the pole upon he and crush he to death we talk about a _ line _ of trap because we blaze a line of tree sometimes for mile and set a trap every twenty or thirty rod i have have a line of a dozen mile or more in my day in a circle around my campin ' ground in mind we trap we follow the line of marked tree from one to the other and so never miss a trap nor get lose in the wood i mind once a good many year ago crop and i be over towards the st regi on a cruise after martin and sable and anything else in the way of game we could pick up i would lay out my trappin ' arrangement on a pretty large scale and be doin ' a little better than midlin ' when i find that my trap be spring by some animal that help himself to the bait without leavin ' he hide as a consideration for settin ' of 'em after a few day i find that whatever it be understand the line as well as i do for he take the range regular and not only steal the bait but eat up half a dozen martin that have give I a claim on they hide by springin ' my trap this be a kind of medlin ' with my private concern that i do not like and i be bind to find out who the interloper be and if possible to make he acquaintance there be no snow on the ground and i could not get at he track so i make up my mind to watch for he well one day i speak to crop to stay by the shanty and take care of the thing while i go to find out who it be that be medlin ' with we property and start off on my line of trap i get up into the crotch of a great birch near one of 'em and sit there with my rifle waitin ' for something to turn up it be a little after noon when i get located the sun travel slowly along down towards the western hill he bright light in that calm November day makin ' the rocky range and the bare head of the tall peak shine out in a blaze of glory the livin ' thing of the old wood be busy and jolly enough a old owl come fly lazily out of the thick branch of a hemlock and lightin ' within a dozen foot of I open he great round eye in astonishment and as the bright sunlight dazzle he he squint and turn he cat-like face from side to side as if makin ' up he mind that he would know I the next time we meet by-and-by he open he hooked beak and great red mouth and roar out ` hoo hohoo hoo ' as much as to say ` who the devil be you ' i do not answer a word and after a little he fly back to he shadowy perch among the dense foliage of the hemlock a black squirrel come hop along with he mouth full of beech nut and run nimbly up the tree on which i be perch and out upon one of the great limb deposit he store in a hollow he find there he catch sight of I as he come back and seat himself upon a branch not six foot from my head begin chatterin ' and barkin ' as if givin ' I a regular lecter for invadin ' he premise and takin ' possession of he tree he do not seem to understand the matter at all and i do not undertake to explain the reason of my be there after a little he go off about he business and leave I to attend to mine a raccoon come nose along stoppin ' every little way to turn over the leaf or pull away the dirt from a root with he long hand tastin ' of one thing and smellin ' of another in a mighty dainty way when he come to my tree he seem to think that there might be something among its branch worth look at so he come clamber up its rough bark towards where i sit he come up on the other side of the tree from I till he get about even with my huntin ' - cap and then come round to my side and there we be face to face not two foot apart i reckon that coon be astonish when we eye meet for with a sort of scream he let right loose and drop twenty foot to the ground like a clod and the way he waddle away into the brash mutterin ' and talkin ' to himself be a thing to laugh at the sun be may be a hour high when lookin ' along the line of marked tree i see a black animal come trot mighty softly towards the trap i be watchin ' i know he at once he be a black fox and i know that he be the gentleman that have be makin ' free with my property for the last few day he trot up to the trap and walk carefully around it nosin ' out towards the bait but keepin ' out from under the pole he seem to understand what that pole mean and that if it fall on he he would be very likely to be hurt after a little he trot out to the other end of the pole and gettin ' on to it walk carefully along to within ten or twelve foot of the bait if he do not begin jumpin ' up and down till he spring the trap you may shoot I when he would do that job he go back and gettin ' hold of the bait with he tooth draw it out and begin very cooly to eat it by this time i would bring my rifle to bear upon the gentleman but i give he a little law to see what he next move would be after he would finish the bait and find there war not any more to be come at he stretch himself on he belly along the ground and begin lickin ' he paw and pass they over he cheek as you have see a cat do after he would wash he face awhile he sit himself down on he haunch curl he long bushy tail around he foot and look about as if considerin ' what he should do next just then i pay my respects to he and as my rifle break the stillness of the forest he turn a double summerset and after kickin ' around a little lay still i come down from my perch and take the gentleman to the shanty and add he hide to those of the martin i would take my trap war not disturb after that and i carry home a pack of fur that bro ' t I near two hundred dollar chapter xxxi out of the wood -- the thousand island -- cape vincent -- bass fishing home -- a searcher after truth -- a interruption -- finis we float quietly down the rackett carry we boat around the fall shooting like a arrow down the rapid or glide along under the shadow of the gigantic forest tree that line the long calm reach of that beautiful river we shake hand and part with we boatman at the pleasant village of pottsdam where we arrive the second evening after leave tupper 's lake we find we baggage and it be a pleasant thing to change we long beard for shave face and we forest costume for the garniture of the outer man after the fashion of civilization we take the car for ogdensburgh and the next morning find we steam up the majestic st lawrence towards that paradise of fisherman the thousand island we stop a couple of day at alexandrium bay and pass on to cape vincent a beautiful village situate a mile or two below where the river take its departure from the broad lake beyond this pleasant little town be build upon a wide sweep of tableland overlook the river in front and the open lake on the west it be accessible both by the lake and river have two or three arrival ' and departure of steamboat each way daily and be the terminus of the rome and watertown railroad the great thoroughfare between kingston and the central portion of the tipper province and the state it be a delightful place in the hot summer month with a climate unequalled for healthfulness a cool breeze always fan it from the water and in the vicinity the best bass fishing to be find on this continent opposite and just below the town be carlton island on which stand the ruin of a old french fortification the wall and trench and the solitary chimney from which the wooden barracks have rot or be burn away remain as melancholy testimonial of the bloody strife between the red man of the forest and the pioneer of civilization who be drive they from the hunting grounds of they father the black bass of the st lawrence and ontario be the gamest fish that swim and they be nowhere find in such abundance as in the neighborhood of cape vincent on the outer edge of the bar near the head of carlton island we catch between seventy and eighty in one afternoon weigh from three to five pound each every one of which fight like a hero diving with a plunge for the bottom skive with a rush down across or up the river leap clear from the water and shake he head furiously to throw the hook loose from he jaw before surrender to he fate in wilson 's bay a sweet place three mile from the village by water or one and a half by land we catch as many more on another afternoon we take a sail-boat and glide round lighthouse point -lrb- a pleasant drive of two mile from the village -rrb- out into the lake and steer for grenadier island five mile distant on which we tent for the night and the bass we bring home the next day be something worth look at near the upper end of long island be other prolific bass shoal where the fisherman may enjoy himself indeed he can scarcely go amiss in the surround water the black bass of the st lawrence be not only game fish but be in excellence of flavor scarcely excel by any fish of this country baked or boil they have few superior and as a pan fish be excel only by the brook-trout of the stream the season for take they commence in July and continue through September August be the best month in the year for the bass fisherman if during that month he will supply himself with a strong bass-pole a strong treble-action reel stout silk line and proper hook and visit gape vincent he will find boatman with a supply of minnow ready to serve he and if he fail to enjoy himself for a fortnight among the black bass of the st lawrence and ontario he may count himself as a man who be very hard to please we spend a pleasant week at cape vincent and then turn we face homeward invigorate in strength and buoyant in spirit to begin again a round of toil from which we at least could claim no further exemption h -- say a friend of mine as he stalk into my sanctum a few day after my return and seat himself at my elbow as if for a private and confidential talk do smith

be the marvellous story he tell about the manner of kill he really true that of course i can not tell i reply as i have never hear the story why say my friend he tell about a beautiful lake lie away back in the northern wilderness above which mount marcy and mount seward and other nameless peak of the adirondack rear they tall head to the cloud throw back the sunlight in a blaze of glory on which the moonbeam lie like a mantle of silver while away down in its fathomless depths the star glow and sparkle like the sheen of a million of diamond of the old forest and tree of fabulous growth stretch away and away on every hand throw they sombre shadow far out over the water in whose tangled recess countless deer and moose and panther and bear range and among whose branch bird of unknown melody
