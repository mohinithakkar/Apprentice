produce by juliet sutherland sjaanus and the online distribute proofread team adventure in friendship by david grayson i a adventure in fraternity this i be firmly convince be a strange world as strange a one as i be ever in look about I i perceive that the simplest thing be the most difficult the plainest thing the darkest the commonest thing the rarest i have have a amusing adventure -- and make a friend this morning when i go to town for my marketing i meet a man who be a mason a oddfellow and a elk and who wear the evidence of he various membership upon he coat he ask I what lodge i belong to and he slap I on the back in the heartiest manner as though he have know I intimately for a long time -lrb- i may say in pass that he be try to sell I a new kind of corn-planter -rrb- i could not help feeling compliment -- both complimented and abashed for i be not a mason or a oddfellow or a elk when i tell he so he seem much surprised and disappointed you ought to belong to one of we lodge he say you would be sure of have loyal friend wherever you go he tell I all about he grip and pass and benefit he tell I how much it would cost I to get in and how much more to stay in and how much for a uniform -lrb- which be not compulsory -rrb- he tell I about the fine funeral the mason would give I he say that the elk would care for my widow and child you be just the sort of a man he say that we would like to have in we lodge i would enjoy give you the grip of fellowship he be a rotund good-humoured man with a shine red nose and a husky voice he grow so much interested in tell I about he lodge that i think -lrb- i _ think _ -rrb- he forget momentarily that he be sell corn-planter which be certainly to he credit as i drive homeward this afternoon i could not help thinking of the mason the oddfellow and the elk -- and curiously not without a sense of depression i wonder if my friend of the corn-planter have find the pearl of great price that i have be look for so long for be not friendliness the thing of all thing that be most pleasant in this world sometimes it have seem to I that the faculty of reach out and touch one 's neighbor where he really live be the greatest of human achievement and it be with a indescribable depression that i wonder if these mason and oddfellow and elk have in reality catch the elusive secret and confine it within the insurmountable and impenetrable wall of they mystery secret grip pass benefit it must indeed i say to myself be a precious sort of fraternity that they choose to protect so sedulously i feel as though life contain something that i be not permit to live i recall how my friend of the corn-planter have wish to give I the grip of the fellowship -- only he could not i be not entitle to it i know no grip or pass i wear no uniform it be a complicated matter this fellowship i say to myself so i jog along feeling rather blue marveling that those thing which often seem so simple should be in reality so difficult but on such a afternoon as this no man could possibly remain long depress the moment i pass the straggle outskirts of the town and come to the open road the light and glow of the countryside come in upon I with a newness and sweetness impossible to describe look out across the wide field i could see the vivid green of the young wheat upon the brown soil in a distant high pasture the cow have be turn out to the freshen grass a late pool glisten in the afternoon sunshine and the crow be call and the robin have begin to come : and oh the moist cool freshness of the air in the highest heaven -lrb- never so high as at this time of the year -rrb- float a few gauzy cloud : the whole world be busy with spring i straighten up in my buggy and draw in a good breath the mare half startle prick up she ear and begin to trot she too feel the spring here i say aloud be where i belong i be native to this place of all these thing i be a part but presently -- how one 's mind course back like some keen-scented hound for lose trail -- i begin to think again of my friend 's lodge and do you know i have lose every trace of depression the whole matter lay as clear in my mind as little complicated as the countryside which meet my eye so openly why i exclaimed to myself i need not envy my friend 's lodge i myself belong to the greatest of all fraternal order i be a member of the universal brotherhood of man it come to I so humorously as i sit there in my buggy that i could not help laugh aloud and i be so deeply absorb with the idea that i do not at first see the whiskery old man who be come my way in a farm wagon he look at I curiously as he pass give I half the road i glance up at he and call out cheerfully : how be you brother you should have see he look -- and look -- and look after i have pass i glance back he have stop he team turn half way around in he high seat and be watch I -- for he do not understand yes my friend i say to myself i _ be _ intoxicate -- with the wine of spring i reflect upon he astonishment when i address he as brother a strange word he do not recognize it he actually suspect that he be not my brother so i jogged onward think about my fraternity and i do not know when i have have more joy of a idea it seem so explanatory i be glad i say to myself that i be a member i be sure the mason have no such benefit to offer in they lodge as we have in ours and we do not require money of farmer -lrb- who have little to pay -rrb- we will accept corn or hen 's egg or a sandwich at the door and as for a cheerful glance of the eye it be for we the best of mint coin -lrb- item : to remember when a man ask money for any good thing beware of it you can get a better for nothing -rrb- i can not undertake to tell where the amusing reflection which grow out of my idea would finally have lead I if i have not be interrupted just as i approach the patterson farm near the bridge which cross the creek i see a loaded wagon standing on the slope of the hill ahead the horse seem to have be unhook for the tongue be down and a man be on he knee between the front wheel involuntarily i say : another member of my society : and in distress i have a heart at that moment for anything i feel like some old neighbourly knight travel the earth in search of adventure if there have be a distressed mistress handy at that moment i feel quite certain i could have die for she -- if absolutely necessary as i drive alongside the stocky stout lad of a farmer in he brown duck coat line with sheep 's wool come up from between the wheel he cap be awry he trousers be muddy at the knee where he have kneel in the moist road and he face be red and angry a true knight i think to myself look not to the beauty of he lady but only to she distress what be the matter brother i ask in the friendliest manner bolt go he say gruffly and i get to get to town before nightfall get in i say and we 'll drive back we shall see it in the road so he get in i drive the mare slowly up the hill and we both lean out and look and presently there in the road the bolt lay my farmer get out and pick it up it be all right he say i be afraid it be clean bust i be oblige to you for the lift hold on i say get in i 'll take you back oh i can walk but i can drive you faster i say and you have get to get the load to town before nightfall i could not let he go without take tribute no matter what the story book say i be firmly of the opinion that no gentle knight -lrb- who be human -rrb- ever part with the fair lady whose misery he have relieve without exchange the time of day or offer she a bun from he dinner pail or find out -lrb- for instance -rrb- if she be maid or marry my farmer laugh and get in you see i say when a member of my society be in distress i always like to help he out he pause i watch he gradually evolve he reply : how do you know i be a mason well i be not _ sure _ i only join last winter he say i like it first-rate when you be a mason you find friend everywhere i have some excellent remark that i could have make at this point but the distance be short and bolt be irresistibly uppermost after help he to put in the bolt i say : here be the grip of fellowship he return it with a will but afterward he say doubtfully i do not feel the grip do not you i ask well brother it be all there if ever i can do anything for you he say just you let I know name 's forbe spring brook and so he drive away a real mason i say to myself could not have have any better advantage of he society at this moment than i i walk right into it without a grip or a pass and benefit have also be distribute as i drive onward i feel as though anything might happen to I before i get home i know now exactly how all old knight all voyageur all crusader all poet in new place must have feel i look out at every turn of the road and finally after i have grow almost discourage of encounter further adventure i see a man walk in the road ahead of I he be much bent over and carry on he back a bag when he hear I come he step out of the road and stand silent saving every unnecessary motion as a weary man will he neither look around nor speak but wait for I to go by he be weary past expectation i stop the mare get in brother i say i be go you way he look at I doubtfully then as i move to one side he let he bag roll off he back into he arm i could see the swollen vein of he neck he face have the draw look of the man who bear burden pretty heavy for you buggy he remark heavier for you i reply so he put the bag in the back of my buggy and step in beside I diffidently pull up the lap robe i say and be comfortable well sir i be glad of a lift he remark a bag of seed wheat be about all a man want to carry for four mile be not you the man who have take the old rucker farm i ask i be that man i have be intend to drop in and see you i say have you he ask eagerly yes i say i live just across the hill from you and i have a notion that we ought to be neighbourly -- see that we belong to the same society he face which have wear a look of set discouragement -lrb- he do not know beforehand what the rucker place be like -rrb- have brighten up but when i speak of the society it cloud again you must be mistaken he say i be not a mason no more be i i say nor a oddfellow nor i as i look at the man i seem to know all about he some people come to we like that all at once open out to some unsuspected key he face bear not a few mark of refinement though work and discouragement have do they best to obliterate they he nose be thin and high he eye be blue too blue and he chin somehow do not go with the rucker farm i know a man who in he time have see many a open door but who have find they all close when he attempt to enter if any one ever need the benefit of my fraternity he be that man what society do you think i belong to he ask well i say when i be in town a man who want to sell I a corn-planter ask I if i be a mason -- do he ask you that too interrupted my companion he do i say he do -- and i reflect not without enthusiasm that i have come away without a corn-planter and when i drive out of town i be feel rather depressed because i be not a member of the lodge be you exclaim my companion so be i i just feel as though i have about reach the last ditch i have not any money to pay into lodge and it do not seem if a man could get acquaint and friendly without farm be rather lonely work sometimes be not it i observe you bet it be he respond you have be there yourself have not you there may be such a thing as the friendship of prosperity but surely it can not be compare with the friendship of adversity man stoop come close together but when i get to think it over i say it suddenly occur to I that i belong to the greatest of all fraternity and i recognize you instantly as a charter member he look around at I expectantly half laughing i do not suppose he have so far forget he misery for many a day what be that he ask the universal brotherhood of man well we both laugh -- and understand after that what a story he tell I -- the story of a misplace man on a unproductive farm be it not marvellous how full people be -- all people -- of humor tragedy passionate human longing hope fear -- if only you can unloosen the floodgate as to my companion he have be grow bitter and sickly with the pent-up humor of discouragement all he need be a listener he be so absorb in he talk that he do not at first realize that we have turn into he own long lane when he discover it he exclaim : i do not mean to bring you out of you way i can manage the bag all right now never mind i say i want to get you home to say nothing of hear how you come out with you pig as we approach the house a mournful-looking woman come to the door my companion spring out of the buggy as much elated now as he have previously be depress -lrb- for that be the coinage of he temperament -rrb- rush up to he wife and lead she down to the gate she be evidently astonish at he enthusiasm i suppose she think he have at length discover he gold mine when i finally turn the mare around he stop I lay he hand on my arm and say in a confidential voice : i be glad we discover that we belong to the same society as i drive away i could not help chuckle when i hear he wife ask suspiciously : what society be that i hear no word of he answer : only the note in he voice of eager explanation and so i drive homeward in the late twilight and as i come up the lane the door of my home open the light within gleam kindly and warmly across the darkened yard : and harriet be there on the step wait ii a day of pleasant bread they have all go now and the house be very still for the first time this evening i can hear the familiar sound of the December wind bluster about the house complain at closed doorway ask question at the shutter but here in my room under the green reading lamp it be warm and still although harriet have close the door cover the coal in the fireplace and say good-night the atmosphere still seem to tingle with the electricity of genial humanity the parting voice of the scotch preacher still boom in my ear : this say he as he be go out of we door wrap like a arctic highlander in cloak and tippet have be a day of pleasant bread one of the very pleasantest i can remember i sometimes think we expect too much of christmas day we try to crowd into it the long arrears of kindliness and humanity of the whole year as for I i like to take my christmas a little at a time all through the year and thus i drift along into the holiday -- let they overtake I unexpectedly -- wake up some fine morning and suddenly say to myself : why this be christmas day how the discovery make one bind out of he bed what a new sense of life and adventure it impart almost anything may happen on a day like this -- one think i may meet friend i have not see before in year who know i may discover that this be a far better and kindlier world than i have ever dream it could be -lrb- illustration : merry christmas harriet -rrb- so i sing out to harriet as i go down : merry christmas harriet -- and not wait for she sleepy reply i go down and build the biggest warmest friendliest fire of the year then i get into my thick coat and mitten and open the back door all around the sill deep on the step and all about the yard lie the drift snow : it have transform my wood pile into a grotesque indian mound and it frost the roof of my barn like a wedding cake i go at it lustily with my wooden shovel clear out a pathway to the gate cold too one of the coldest morning we have have -- but clear and very still the sun be just come up over the hill near horace 's farm from horace 's chimney the white wood-smoke of a early fire rise straight upward all golden with sunshine into the measureless blue of the sky -- on its way to heaven for aught i know when i reach the gate my blood be race warmly in my vein i straighten my back thrust my shovel into the snow pile and shout at the top of my voice for i can no longer contain myself : merry christmas harriet harriet open the door -- just a crack merry christmas yourself you arctic explorer oo -- but it be cold and she close the door upon hear these riotous sound the barnyard suddenly awaken i hear my horse whinny from the barn the chicken begin to crow and cackle and such a grunt and squeal as the pig set up from behind the straw stack it would do a man 's heart good to hear it be a friendly world i say to myself and full of business i plow through the snow to the stable door i scuff and stamp the snow away and pull it open with difficulty a cloud of steam arise out of the warmth within i step inside my horse raise he head above the stanchion look around at I and strike he forefoot on the stable floor -- the best greet he have at he command for a fine christmas morning my cow until now silent begin to bawl i lay my hand on the horse 's flank and he step over in he stall to let I go by i slap he neck and he lay back he ear playfully thus i go out into the passageway and give my horse he oats throw corn and stalk to the pig and a handful of grain to harriet 's chicken -lrb- it be the only way to stop the cackling -rrb- and thus presently the barnyard be quiet again except for the sound of contented feeding take my word for it this be one of the pleasant moment of life i stand and look long at my barnyard family i observe with satisfaction how plump they be and how well they be bear the winter then i look up at my mountainous straw stack with its cap of snow and my corn crib with the yellow ear visible through the slat and my barn with its mow full of hay -- all the gathering of the year now be expend in growth i can not at all explain it but at such moment the circuit of that dim spiritual battery which each of we conceal within seem to close and the full current of contentment flow through we life all the morning as i go about my chore i have a peculiar sense of expected pleasure it seem certain to I that something unusual and adventurous be about to happen -- and if it do not happen offhand why i be there to make it happen when i go in to breakfast -lrb- do you know the fragrance of broil bacon when you have work for a hour before breakfast on a morning of zero weather if you do not consider that heaven still have gift in store for you -rrb- -- when i go in to breakfast i fancy that harriet look preoccupy but i be too busy just then -lrb- hot corn muffin -rrb- to make a inquiry and i know by experience that the best solvent of secrecy be patience david say harriet presently the cousin can not come can not come i exclaimed why you act as if you be delighted no -- well yes i say i know that some extraordinary adventure be about to happen adventure it be a cruel disappointment -- i be all ready for they harriet i say adventure be just what we make it and be not we to have the scotch preacher and he wife but i have get such a _ good _ dinner well i say there be no two way about it : it must be eat you may depend upon I to do my duty we 'll have to send out into the highway and compel they to come in say harriet ruefully i have several choice observation i should have like to make upon this problem but harriet be plainly not listen she sit with she eye fix reflectively on the coffeepot i watch she for a moment then i remark : there be not any david she exclaim how do you know what i be think about i merely want to show you i say that my genius be not properly appreciate in my own household you think of highway do not you then you think of the poor especially the poor on christmas day then of mr heney who be not poor any more have marry john daniel and then i say ` there be not any ' harriet laugh it have come to a pretty pass she say when there be no poor people to invite to dinner on christmas day it be a tragedy i 'll admit i say but let 's be logical about it i be willing say harriet to be as logical as you like then i say have no poor to invite to dinner we must necessarily try the rich that be logical be not it who ask harriet which be just like a woman whenever you get a good healthy argument start with she she will suddenly short-circuit it and want to know if you mean mr smith or joe perkin 's boy which i maintain be _ not _ logical well there be the starkweather i say david they be rich be not they yes but you know how they live -- what dinner they have -- and besides they probably have a houseful of company be not you tell I the other day how many people who be really suffer be too proud to let anyone know about it be not you advise the necessity of get acquaint with people and find out -- tactfully of course -- you make a point of tact -- what the trouble be but i be talk of _ poor _ people why should not a rule that be good for poor people be equally as good for rich people be not they proud oh you can argue observe harriet and i can act too i say i be now go over to invite the starkweather i hear a rumor that they cook have leave they and i expect to find they starve in they parlor of course they 'll be very haughty and proud but i 'll be tactful and when i go away i 'll casually leave a diamond tiara in the front hall what _ be _ the matter with you this morning christmas i say i can not tell how pleased i be with the enterprise i have in mind : it suggest all sort of amusing and surprising development moreover i leave harriet finally in the breeziest of spirit have quite forget she disappointment over the non-arrival of the cousin if you _ should _ get the starkweather -- ` in the bright lexicon of youth ' i observe ` there be no such word as fail ' so i set off up the town road a team or two have already be that way and have break a track through the snow the sun be now fully up but the air still tingle with the electricity of zero weather and the field i have see the field of June and the field of October but i think i never see we countryside hill and valley tree space and brook bottom more enchantingly beautiful than it be this morning snow everywhere -- the fence half hide the bridge clog the tree laden : where the road be hard it squeak under my foot and where it be soft i stride through the drift and the air go to one 's head like wine so i tramped past the patterson ' the old man a grumpy old fellow be go to the barn with a pail on he arm merry christmas i shout he look around at I wonderingly and do not reply at the corner i meet the newton boy so wrap in tippet that i could see only they eye and the red end of they small nose i pass the william 's house where there be a cheerful smoke in the chimney and in the window a green wreath with a lively red bow and i think how happy everyone must be on a christmas morning like this at the hill bridge who should i meet but the scotch preacher himself god bless he well well david he exclaim heartily merry christmas i draw my face down and say solemnly : dr mcalway i be on a most serious errand why now what be the matter he be all sympathy at once i be out in the highway try to compel the poor of this neighborhood to come to we feast the scotch preacher observe I with a twinkle in he eye david he say put he hand to he mouth as if to speak in my ear there be a poor man you will na ' have to compel oh you do not count i say you be come anyhow then i tell he of the errand with we millionaire friend into the spirit of which he enter with the greatest zest he be full of advice and much excited lest i fail to do a thoroughly competent job for a moment i think he want to take the whole thing out of my hand man man it be a lovely thing to do he exclaim but i ha ' I doot -- i ha ' I doot at parting he hesitate a moment and with a serious face inquire : be it by any chance a goose it be i say a goose -- a big one he heave a sigh of complete satisfaction you have comfort my mind he say with the joy of anticipation -- a goose a big goose so i leave he and go onward toward the starkweather ' presently i see the great house standing among its wintry tree there be smoke in the chimney but no other evidence of life at the gate my spirit which have be of the best all the morning begin to fail I though harriet and i be well enough acquaint with the starkweather yet at this late moment on christmas morning it do seem rather a hair-brained scheme to think of invite they to dinner never mind i say they 'll not be displeased to see I anyway i wait in the reception-room which be cold and feel damp in the parlor beyond i could see the innumerable thing of beauty -- furniture picture book so very very much of everything -- with which the room be fill i see it now as i have often see it before with a peculiar sense of weariness how all these thing though beautiful enough in themselves must clutter up a man 's life do you know the more i look into life the more thing it seem to I i can successfully lack -- and continue to grow happier how many kind of food i do not need nor cook to cook they how much curious clothing nor tailor to make it how many book that i never read and picture that be not worth while the farther i run the more i feel like cast aside all such impediment -- lest i fail to arrive at the far goal of my endeavor i like to think of a old japanese nobleman i once read about who ornament he house with a single vase at a time live with it absorb its message of beauty and when he tire of it replace it with another i wonder if he have the right way and we with so many object to hang on we wall place on we shelf drape on we chair and spread on we floor have mistake we course and place we heart upon the multiplicity rather than the quality of we possession presently mr starkweather appear in the doorway he wear a velvet smoking-jacket and slipper and somehow for a bright morning like this he seem old and worn and cold well well friend he say i be glad to see you he say it as though he mean it come into the library it be the only room in the whole house that be comfortably warm you have no idea what a task it be to heat a place like this in really cold weather no sooner do i find a man who can run my furnace than he go off and leave I i can sympathize with you i say we often have trouble at we house with the man who build the fire he look around at I quizzically he lie too long in bed in the morning i say by this time we have arrive at the library where a bright fire be burn in the grate it be a fine big room with dark oak furnishings and book in case along one wall but this morning it have a dishevelled and untidy look on a little table at one side of the fireplace be the remains of a breakfast at the other a number of wrap be throw carelessly upon a chair as i come in mr starkweather rise from she place draw a silk scarf around she shoulder she be a robust rather handsome woman with many ring on she finger and a pair of glass hang to a little gold hook on she ample bosom but this morning she too look worried and old oh yes she say with a rueful laugh we be begin a merry christmas as you see think of christmas with no cook in the house i feel as if i have discover a gold mine poor starve millionaire but mr starkweather have not tell the whole of she sorrowful story we have a company of friend invite for dinner to-day she say and we cook be ill -- or say she be -- and have to go one of the maid go with she the man who look after the furnace disappear on Friday and the stableman have be drink we can not very well leave the place without some one who be responsible in charge of it -- and so here we be merry christmas i could not help laugh poor people you might i say apply for mr heney 's place who be mrs heney ask mrs starkweather you do not mean to say that you never hear of mr heney i exclaimed mrs heney who be now mr ` penny ' daniel you have miss one of we greatest celebrity with that of course i have to tell they about mr heney who have for year perform a most important function in this community alone and unaided she have be the poor whom we be suppose to have always with we if it have not be for the devoted faithfulness of mr heney at thanksgive christmas and other time of the year i suppose we woman 's aid society and the king 's daughter would have perish miserably of undistributed turkey and tufted comforter for year mr heney fill the place most acceptably curb the natural outpouring of a rather jovial soul she could upon occasion look as deserving of charity as any person that ever i meet but i pity the little heney : it always come hard on the child for week after every thanksgiving and christmas they always wear a painfully stuff and suffocate look i only come to appreciate fully what a self-sacrificing public servant mr heney really be when i learn that she have take the desperate alternative of marry penny daniel so you think we might possibly aspire to the position laugh mr starkweather upon this i tell they of the trouble in we household and ask they to come down and help we enjoy dr mcalway and the goose when i leave after much more pleasant talk they both come with I to the door seem greatly improve in spirit you have give we something to live for mr grayson say mr starkweather so i walk homeward in the highest spirit and a hour or more later who should we see in the top of we upper field but mr starkweather and he wife flounder in the snow they reach the lane literally cover from top to toe with snow and both of they ruddy with the cold we walk over say mr starkweather breathlessly and i have not have so much fun in year mr starkweather help she over the fence the scotch preacher stand on the step to receive they and we all go in together i can not pretend to describe harriet 's dinner : the gorgeous brown goose and the apple sauce and all the other thing that best go with it and the pumpkin pie at the end -- the finest thickest most delicious pumpkin pie i ever eat in all my life it melt in one 's mouth and bring vision of celestial bliss and i wish i could have a picture of harriet preside i have never see she happier or more in she element every time she bring in a new dish or take off a cover it be a sort of miracle and she coffee -- but i must not and dare not elaborate and what great talk we have afterward i have know the scotch preacher for a long time but i never see he in quite such a mood of hilarity he and mr starkweather tell story of they boyhood -- and we laugh and laugh -- mr starkweather the most of all see she so often in she carriage or in the dignity of she home i do not think she have so much jollity in she finally she discover harriet 's cabinet organ and nothing would do but she must sing for we none of the new-fangled one clara cry she husband : some of the old one we use to know so she sit herself down at the organ and throw she head back and begin to sing : believe I if all those endearing young charm which i gaze on so fondly to-day -- mr starkweather jump up and run over to the organ and join in with he deep voice harriet and i follow the scotch preacher 's wife nod in time with the music and presently i see the tear in she eye as for dr mcalway he sit on the edge of he chair with he hand on he knee and wag he shaggy head and before we get through he too join in with he big sonorous voice : thou wouldst still be adore as this moment thou art -- oh i can not tell here -- it grow late and there be work to-morrow -- all the thing we do and say they stay until it be dark and when mr starkweather be ready to go she take both of harriet 's hand in hers and say with great earnestness : i have not have such a good time at christmas since i be a little girl i shall never forget it and the dear old scotch preacher when harriet and i have wrap he up go out say : this have be a day of pleasant bread it have it have i shall not soon forget it what a lot of kindness and common human nature -- childlike simplicity if you will -- there be in people once you get they down together and persuade they that the thing they think serious be not serious at all iii the open road to make space for wander be it that the world be make so wide -- goethe _ wilhelm meister _ i love sometimes to have a day alone -- a riotous day sometimes i do not care to see even my best friend : but i give myself up to the full enjoyment of the world around I i go out of my door in the morning -- preferably a sunny morning though any morning will do well enough -- and walk straight out into the world i take with I the burden of no duty or responsibility i draw in the fresh air odour-laden from orchard and wood i look about I as if everything be new -- and behold everything _ be _ new my barn my oak my fence -- i declare i never see they before i have no preconceived impression or belief or opinion my lane fence be the end of the known earth i be a discoverer of new field among old one i see feel hear smell taste all these wonderful thing for the first time i have no idea what discovery i shall make so i go down the lane look up and about I i cross the town road and climb the fence on the other side i brush one shoulder among the bush as i pass : i feel the solid yet easy pressure of the sod the long blade of the timothy-grass clasp at my leg and let go with reluctance i break off a twig here and there and taste the tart or bitter sap i take off my hat and let the warm sun shine on my head i be a adventurer upon a new earth be it not marvellous how far afield some of we be willing to travel in pursuit of that beauty which we leave behind we at home we mistake unfamiliarity for beauty we darken we perception with idle foreignness for want of that ardent inner curiosity which be the only true foundation for the appreciation of beauty -- for beauty be inward not outward -- we find ourselves hasten from land to land gathering mere curious resemblance which like unassimilated property possess no power of fecundation with what pathetic diligence we collect peak and pass in switzerland how we come laden from england with vain cathedral beauty what be it but a new way of approach for wilderness for foreignness i have no need to go a mile : i have only to come up through my thicket or cross my field from my own roadside -- and behold a new heaven and a new earth thing grow old and stale not because they be old but because we cease to see they whole vibrant significant world around we disappear within the sombre mist of familiarity whichever way we look the road be dull and barren there be a tree at we gate we have not see in year : a flower bloom in we door-yard more wonderful than the shine height of the alp it have seem to I sometimes as though i could see man harden before my eye draw in a feeler here wall up a opening there name thing object fall into category for they and wear little sure channel in the brain a mountain be a mountain a tree a tree to they a field forever a field life solidify itself in word and finally how everything weary they and that be old age be it not the prime struggle of life to keep the mind plastic to see and feel and hear thing newly to accept nothing as settle to defend the eternal right of the questioner to reject every conclusion of yesterday before the surer observation of to-day -- be not that the best life we know and so to the open road not many mile from my farm there be a tamarack swamp the soft dark green of it fill the round bowl of a valley around it spread rise forest and field fence divide it from the known land come across my field one day i see it there i feel the habit of avoidance it be a custom well enough in a practical land to shun such a spot of perplexity but on that day i be follow the open road and it lead I straight to the moist dark stillness of the tamarack i can not here tell all the marvel i find in that place i trod where human foot have never tread before cobweb bar my passage -lrb- the bar to most passage when we come to they be only cobweb -rrb- the earth be soft with the thick swamp moss and with many a autumn of fall dead brown leaf i cross the track of a muskrat i see the nest of a hawk -- and how how many other thing of the wilderness i must not here relate and i come out of it renew and refresh i know now the feeling of the pioneer and the discoverer peary have no more than i stanley tell I nothing i have not experience what more than that be the accomplishment of the great inventor poet painter such can not abide habit-hedged wilderness they follow the open road they see for themselves and will not accept the path or the name of the world and sight keep clear become curiously insight a thousand have see apple fall before newton but newton be dower with the spirit of the open road sometimes as i walk seek to see hear feel everything newly i devise secret word for the thing i see : word that convey to I alone the thought or impression or emotion of a peculiar spot all this i know to some will seem the acme of foolish illusion indeed i be not tell of it because it be practical there be no cash at the end of it i be report it as a experience in life those who understand will understand and thus out of my journey i have word which bring back to I with indescribable poignancy the particular impression of a time or a place i prize they more highly than almost any other of my possession for they come to I seemingly out of the air and the remembrance of they enable I to recall or live over a past experience with scarcely diminish emotion and one of these word -- how it bring to I the very mood of a gray October day a sleepy west wind blow the field be bare the corn shock brown and the long road look flat and dull away in the marsh i hear a single melancholy crow a heavy day namelessly sad old sorrow flock to one 's memory and old regret the creeper be red in the swamp and the grass be brown on the hill it come to I that i be a boy once -- so to the flat road and away and turn at the turning and rise with the hill will the mood change : will the day i see a lone man in the top of a pasture cry coo-ee coo-ee i do not see at first why he cry and then over the hill come the ewe a dense gray flock of they huddle toward I the yokel behind have a stick in each hand coo-ee coo-ee he also cry and the two man gather in threaten sidle advance slowly the sheep turn uncertainly this way and that come at last to the board pen that be the idee say the helper a poor lot remark the leader : such be the farmer 's life from the roadway they back they frame-decked wagon to the fence and unhook they team the leader throw off he coat and stand thick and muscular in he blue jeans -- a roistering fellow with a red face thick neck and chap hand i 'll pass 'em up he say that be a man 's work you stand in the wagon and put 'em in so he spring into the yard and the sheep huddle close into the corner here and there raise a timid head here and there dart aside in a panic hi there it be for you shout the leader and thrust he hand deep in the wool of one of the ewe come up here you southdown with the bare belly say the man in the wagon that be my old game -- wrastle the leader remark struggle with the next ewe stiddy stiddy now i get you up with you dang you that be the idee say the man in the wagon so i watch and they pass up the sheep one by one and as i go down the road i hear the leader 's thick voice stiddy stiddy and the response of the other that be the idee and so on into the gray day my open road lead not only to beauty not only to fresh adventure in outer observation i believe in the open road in religion in education in politics : there be nothing really settle fence in nor finally decide upon this earth nothing that be not questionable i do not mean that i would immediately tear down well-built fence or do away with established and beaten road by no mean the wisdom of past age be likely to be wiser than any hasty conclusion of mine i would not invite any other person to follow my road until i have well prove it a better way toward truth than that which time have establish and yet i would have every man tread the open road i would have he upon occasion question the smuggest institution and look askance upon the most ancient habit i would have he throw a doubt upon newton and defy darwin i would have he look straight at man and nature with he own eye he should acknowledge no common god unless he prove they god for himself the equality of man which we worship : be there not a higher inequality the material progress which we deify : be it real progress democracy -- be it after all better than monarchy i would have he question the canon of art literature music moral : so will he continue young and useful and yet sometimes i ask myself what do i travel for why all this excitement and eagerness of inquiry what be it that i go forth to find be i better for keep my road open than my neighbor be who travel with contentment the path of ancient habit i be gnaw by the tooth of unrest -- to what end often as i travel i ask myself that question and i have never have a convincing answer i be look for something i can not find my open road be open too at the end what be it that drive a man onward that scourge he with unanswered question we only know that we be drive we do not know who drive we travel we inquire we look we work -- only know that these activity satisfy a certain deep and secret demand within we we have faith that there be a reason : and be there not a present joy in follow the open road and o the joy that be never win but follow and follow the journey sun and at the end of the day the open road if we follow it with wisdom as well as fervor will bring we safely home again for after all the open road must return to the beaten path the open road be for adventure and adventure be not the food of life but the spice thus i come back this evening from rioting in my field as i walk down the lane i hear the soft tinkle of a cowbell a certain earthy exhalation as of work come out of the bare field the duty of my daily life crowd upon I bring a pleasant calmness of spirit and i say to myself : lord be praise for that which be common and after i have do my chore i come in hungry to my supper iv on be where you belong Sunday morning may 20th on Friday i begin plant my corn for many day previously i go out every morning at sun-up in the clear sharp air and thrust my hand deep down in the soil of the field i do not know that i follow any learn agricultural rule but somehow i like to do it it have seem reasonable to I instead of watch for a phase of the moon -lrb- for i do not cultivate the moon -rrb- to inquire of the earth itself for many day i have no response the soil be of a icy moist coldness as of death i be not ready yet it say i have not rest my time early in the week we have a day or two of soft sunshine of fecund warmth to which the earth lay open willing passive on Thursday morning though a white frost silver the harrow ridge when i thrust my hand into the soil i feel or seem to feel a curious response : a strange answering of life to life the stone have be roll from the sepulchre and i know then that the destine time have arrive for my plant that afternoon i mark out my corn-field drive the mare to my home-made wooden marker carefully observant of the straightness of the row for a crooked corn-row be a sort of immorality i bring down my seed corn from the attic where it have hang wait all winter each ear suspend separately by the white up-turned husk they be the select ear of last year 's crop even of size throughout smooth of kernel with tip well-covered -- the perfect one choose among many to perpetuate the highest excellency of the crop i carry they to the shed next my barn and shell they out in my hand machine : as fine a basket of yellow dent seed as a man ever see i have listen to endless discussion as to the relative merit of flint and dent corn i here cast my vote emphatically for yellow dent : it be the best nature can do i find my seed-bag hang dusty over a rafter in the shed and harriet sew a buckle on the strip that go around the waist i clean and sharpen my hoe now i say to myself give I a good day and i be ready to plant the sun be just come up on Friday look over the tree into a world of misty and odorous freshness when i climb the fence i drop down in the grass at the far corner of the field i have look forward this year with pleasure to the planting of a small field by hand -- the adventure of it -- after a number of year of horse planting -lrb- with horace 's machine -rrb- of far larger field there be a indescribable satisfaction in answer present to the roll-call of nature to plant when the earth be ready to cultivate when the soil begin to bake and harden to harvest when the grain be fully ripe it be the chief joy of he who live close to the soil that he come in time to beat in consonance with the pulse of the earth its season become he season its life he life behold I then with a full seed-bag suspend before I buckle both over the shoulder and around the waist a shiny hoe in my hand -lrb- the scepter of my dominion -rrb- a comfortable rest feeling in every muscle of my body standing at the end of the first long furrow there in my field on Friday morning -- a whole spring day open before I at that moment i would not have change my place for the place of any king prince or president at first i be awkward enough for it have be a long time since i have do much hand plant but i soon fall into the rhythmic swing of the sower the sure even accurate step the turn of the body and the flexing of the wrist as the hoe strike downward the deftly hollow hole the swing of the hand to the seed-bag the sure fall of the kernel the return of the hoe the final determine pressure of the soil upon the seed one fall into it and follow it as he would follow the rhythm of a march even the choice of seed become automatic instinctive at first there be a conscious counting by the finger -- five seed : one for the blackbird one for the crow one for the cutworm two to grow but after a time one cease to count five and _ feel _ five instinctively reject a monstrous six or return to complete a inferior four i wonder if you know the feel of the fresh soft soil as it answer to you step give a little respond a little -lrb- as life always do -rrb- -- and be there not something endlessly good and pleasant about it and the movement of the arm and shoulder fall easily into that action and reaction which yield the most service to the least energy scientist tell we that the awkward young eagle have a wider wing-stretch than the old skilled eagle so the corn planter at noon will do he work with half the expend energy of the early morning : he attain the artistry of motion and quite beyond and above this physical accomplishment be the ever-present scarcely conscious sense of reward repayment which one experience as he cover each planting of seed as the sun rise higher the mist steal secretly away first toward the lower brook-hollow finally disappear entirely the morning coolness pass the top of the furrow dry out to a lighter brown and still i follow the long planting at each return i refilled my seed-bag and sometimes i drink from the jug of water which i have hide in the grass often i stand a moment by the fence to look up and around I through the clear morning air i could hear the rooster crow vaingloriously from the barnyard and the robin be singing and occasionally from the distant road i hear the rumble of a wagon i note the slow kitchen smoke from horace 's chimney the tip of which i could just see over the hill from the margin of my field -- and my own pleasant home among its tree -- and my barn -- all most satisfying to look upon then i return to the sweat and heat of the open field and to the steady swing of the sowing -lrb- illustration : often i stand a moment by the fence -rrb- joy of life seem to I to arise from a sense of be where one belong as i feel right here of be foursquare with the life we have choose all the discontented people i know be try sedulously to be something they be not to do something they can not do in the advertisement of the country paper i find man angle for money by promise to make woman beautiful and man learn or rich -- overnight -- by inspiring good farmer and carpenter to be poor doctor and lawyer it be curious be it not with what skill we will adapt we sandy land to potato and grow we bean in clay and with how little wisdom we farm the soil of we own nature we try to grow poetry where plumbing would thrive grandly -- not know that plumbing be as important and honorable and necessary to this earth as poetry i understand it perfectly i too follow long after false god i think i must rush forth to see the world i must forthwith become great rich famous and i hurry hither and thither seek i know not what consume my day with the infinite distraction of travel i miss as one who attempt two occupation at once the sure satisfaction of either behold the exterior of city and of man i be deceive with shadow my life take no hold upon that which be deep and true color i get and form and a superficial aptitude in judge by symbol it be like the study of a science : a hasty review give one the general rule but it require a far profounder insight to know the fertile exception but as i grow older i remain here on my farm and wait quietly for the world to pass this way my oak and i we wait and we be satisfy here we stand among we clod we foot be root deep within the soil the wind blow upon we and delight we the rain fall and refresh we the sun dry and sweeten we we be become calm slow strong so we measure rectitude and regard essential my oak and i i would be a hard person to dislodge or uproot from this spot of earth i belong here i grow here i like to think of the old fable of the wrestler of irassa for i be veritably that anteus who be the wrestler of irassa and draw he strength from the ground so long as i tread the long furrow of my plant with my foot upon the earth i be invincible and unconquerable hercule himself though he come upon I in the guise of riches or fame or power can not overthrow I -- save as he take I away from this soil for at each step my strength be renew i forget weariness old age have no dread for I some there may be who think i talk dream they do not know reality my friend do it ever occur to you that you be unhappy because you have lose connection with life because you foot be not somewhere firm plant upon the soil of reality contentment and indeed usefulness come as the infallible result of great acceptance great humility -- of not try to make ourselves this or that -lrb- to conform to some dramatize version of ourselves -rrb- but of surrender ourselves to the fullness of life -- of let life flow through we to be use -- that be the sublimest thing we know it be a distinguishing mark of greatness that it have a tremendous hold upon real thing i have see man who seem to have behind they or rather within they whole society state institution : how they come at we like atla bear the world for they act not with they own feebleness but with a strength as of the whole of life they speak and the word be theirs but the voice be the voice of mankind i do not know what to call it : be right with god or right with life it be strangely the same thing and god be not particular as to the name we know he by so long as we know he muse upon these secret thing i seem to understand what the theologian in they darkness have make so obscure be it not just this at-one-moment with life which sweeten and save we all in all these writings i have glorify the life of the soil until i be ashamed i have love it because it save I the farm for I i decide long ago be the only place where i can flow strongly and surely but to you my friend life may present a wholly different aspect variant necessity know what i have experience in the city i have sometimes wonder at the happy -lrb- even serene -rrb- face i have see in crowded street there must be i admit those who can flow and be at one with that life too and let they handle they money and make shoe and sew garment and write in ledger -- if that complete and contents they i have no quarrel with any one of they it be after all a big and various world where man can be happy in many way for every man be a magnet highly and singularly sensitize some draw to they field and wood and hill and be draw in return and some draw swift street and the riches which be know to city it be not of importance what we draw but that we really draw and the greatest tragedy in life as i see it be that thousand of man and woman never have the opportunity to draw with freedom but they exist in weariness and labor and be draw upon like inanimate object by those who live in unhappy idleness they do not farm : they be farm but that be a question foreign to present consideration we may be assure if we draw freely like the magnet of steel which gather its iron filings about it in beautiful and symmetrical form that the thing which we attract will also become symmetrical and harmonious with we life thus flow with life self-surrendering to life a man become indispensable to life he be absolutely necessary to the conduct of this universe and it be the feeling of be necessary of be desire flow into a man that produce the satisfaction of contentment often and often i think to myself : these field have need of I my horse whinny when he hear my step my dog bark a welcome these my neighbor be glad of I the corn come up fresh and green to my plant my buckwheat bear richly i be indispensable in this place what be more satisfactory to the human heart than to be need and to know we be need one line in the book of chronicle when i read it fly up at I out of the print page as though it be alive convey newly the age-old agony of a misplace man after relate the short and evil history of jehoram king of judah the account end -- with the appalling terseness which often crown the dramatic climax of that matchless writing : and -lrb- he -rrb- depart without be desire without be desire i have wonder if any man be ever curse with a more terrible epitaph and so i plant my corn and in the evening i feel the dumb weariness of physical toil many time in older day i have know the wakeful nerve-weariness of city this be not it it be the weariness which after supper seize upon one 's limb with half-aching numbness i sit down on my porch with a nameless content i look off across the countryside i see the evening shadow fall and the moon come up and i want nothing i have not and finally sleep sweep in resistless wave upon I and i stumble up to bed -- and sink into dreamless slumber v the story of anna it be the prime secret of the open road -lrb- but i may here tell it aloud -rrb- that you be to pass nothing reject nothing despise nothing upon this earth as you travel many thing both great and small will come to you attention you be to regard all with open eye and a heart of simplicity believe that everything belong somewhere each thing have its fitting and luminous place within this mosaic of human life the true road be not open to those who withdraw the skirt of intolerance or lift the chin of pride reject the least of those who be call common or unclean it be -lrb- curiously -rrb- you yourself that you reject if you despise that which be ugly you do not know that which be beautiful for what be beauty but completeness the roadside beggar belong here too and the idiot boy who wander idly in the open field and the girl who withhold -lrb- secretly -rrb- the name of the father of she child \* \* \* \* \* i remember as distinctly as though it happen yesterday the particular evening three year ago when i see the scotch preacher come hurry up the road toward my house it be June i have come out after supper to sit on my porch and look out upon the quiet field i remember the grateful cool of the evening air and the scent rise all about I from garden and roadway and orchard i be tire after the work of the day and sit with a sort of complete comfort and contentment which come only to those who work long in the quiet of outdoor place i remember the thought come to I as it have come in various form so many time that in such a big and beautiful world there should be no room for the fever of unhappiness or discontent and then i see mcalway come up the road i know instantly that something be wrong he step usually so deliberate be rapid there be agitation in every line of he countenance i walk down through the garden to the gate and meet he there be somewhat out of breath he do not speak at once so i say : it be not after all as bad as you anticipate david he say and i think i never hear he speak more seriously it be bad enough he lay he hand on my arm can you hitch up you horse and come with I -- right away mcalway help with the buckle and say not a word in ten minute certainly not more we be drive together down the lane do you know a family name william live on the north road beyond the three corner ask the scotch preacher instantly a vision of a somewhat dilapidated house standing not unpicturesquely among ill-kept field leap to my mind yes i say but i can not remember any of the family except a gingham girl with yellow hair i use to see she on she way to school '' a girl he say with a curious note in he voice but a woman now he pause a moment then he continue sadly : as i grow older it seem a shorter and shorter step between child and child david she have a child of she own '' but i do not know -- she be not -- a wood child say the scotch preacher i could not find a word to say i remember the hush of the evening there in the country road the soft light fading in the field i hear a whippoorwill call from the distant wood they make it hard for she say the scotch preacher especially she older brother about four o'clock this afternoon she run away take she baby with she they find a note say they would never again see she alive she mother say she go toward the river i touch up the mare for a few minute the scotch preacher sit silent thinking then he say with a peculiar tone of kindness in he voice she be a child just a child when i talk with she yesterday she be perfectly docile and apparently contented i can not imagine she drive to such a deed of desperation i ask she : ` why do you do it anna ' she answer ' i do not know : i -- i do not know ' she reply be not defiant or remorseful : it be merely explanatory he remain silent again for a long time david he say finally i sometimes think we do not know half as much about human nature as we -- we preach if we do i think we would be more careful in we judgment he say it slowly tentatively : i know it come straight from he heart it be this spirit more than the title he bear far more than the sermon he preach that make he in reality the minister of we community he go about think that after all he do not know much and that therefore he must be kind as i drive up to the bridge the scotch preacher put one hand on the rein i stop the horse on the embankment and we both step out she would undoubtedly have come down this road to the river mcalway say in a low voice it be grow dark when i walk out on the bridge my leg be strangely unsteady a weight seem press on my breast so that my breath come hard we look down into the shallow placid water : the calm of the evening be upon it the middle of the stream be like a rumpled glassy ribbon but the edge deep-shade by overhang tree be of a mysterious darkness in all my life i think i never experience such a degree of silence -- of breathless oppressive silence it seem as if at any instant it must burst into some fearful excess of sound suddenly we hear a voice -- in half-articulate exclamation i turn every nerve strain to the uttermost a figure seemingly materialize out of darkness and silence be move on the bridge oh -- mcalway a voice say then i hear the scotch preacher in low tone have you see anna william she be at the house answer the voice get you horse say the scotch preacher i run back and lead the mare across the bridge -lrb- how i remember in that silence the thunder of she hoof on the loose board -rrb- just at the top of the little hill lead up from the bridge the two man turn in at a gate i follow quickly and the three of we enter the house together i remember the musty warm shut-in odour of the front room i hear the faint cry of a child the room be dim with a single kerosene lamp but i see three woman huddle by the stove in which a new fire be blaze two look up as we enter with feminine instinct move aside to hide the form of the third she be all right as soon as she get dry one of they say the other woman turn to we half complainingly : she be not say a single word since we get she in here and she will not let go of the baby for a minute she do not cry say the other but just sit there like a statue mcalway step forward and say : well -- anna the girl look up for the first time the light shone full in she face : a look i shall never forget yes it be the girl i have see so often and yet not the girl it be the same childish face but all mark upon with inexplicable wan line of a certain mysterious womanhood it be childish but bear upon it a inexpressible look of half-sad dignity that stir a man 's heart to its profoundest depths and there be in it too as i have think since a something i have see in the face of old wise man : a light -lrb- how shall i explain it -rrb- as of experience -- of boundless experience she hair hang in wavy dishevelment about she head and shoulder and she cling passionately to the child in she arm the scotch preacher have say well -- anna she look up and reply : they be go to take my baby away be they exclaim mcalway in he hearty voice well we 'll never permit _ that _ who be get a better right to the baby than you i would like to know without turn she head the tear come to she eye and roll unheed down she face \* \* \* \* \* yes sir dr mcalway the man say i be come across the bridge with the cow when i see she standing there in the water she skirt all float around she she be hug the baby up to she face and say over and over just like this : ' i do not dare oh i do not dare but i must i must ' she be sort of singin ' the word : ' i do not dare i do not dare but i must ' i jump the railing and run down to the bank of the river and i say ` come right out o ' there ' and she turn and come out just as gentle as a child and i bring she up here to the house \* \* \* \* \* it seem perfectly natural at this time that i should take the girl and she child home to harriet she would not go back to she own home though we try to persuade she and the scotch preacher 's wife be visit in the city so she could not go there but after i find myself drive homeward with the girl -- while mcalway go over the hill to tell she family -- the mood of action pass it strike I suddenly what will harriet say upon which my heart sink curiously and refuse to resume its natural position in the past i have bring she tramp and peddler and itinerant preacher all of whom she have take in with patience -- but this i know be different for a few minute i wish devoutly i be in timbuctu or some other far place and then the absurdity of the situation strike I all at once and i could not help laugh aloud it be a tremendous old world i say to myself why anything may happen anywhere the girl stir but do not speak i be afraid i have frighten she be you cold i ask no sir she answer faintly i could think of nothing whatever to say so i say it : be you fond of hot corn-meal mush yes sir very faintly with cream on it -- rich yellow cream -- and plenty of sugar yes sir well i 'll bet a nickel that be what we be go to get yes sir we drive up the lane and stop at the yard gate harriet open the door i lead the small dark figure into the warmth and light of the kitchen she stand helplessly hold the baby tight in she arm -- as forlorn and dishevelled a figure as one could well imagine harriet i say this be anna william harriet give I she most tremendous look it seem to I at that moment that it be not my sister harriet at all that i be face but some stranger and much greater person than i have ever know every man have upon occasion behold he wife he sister he mother even become suddenly unknown suddenly command suddenly greater than himself or any other man for a woman possess the occult power of become instantly miraculously the accumulate and personify custom moral and institution of the age at this moment then i feel myself slowly but surely shrink and shrivel up it be a most uncomfortable sensation to find one 's self face to face with society-at-large under such circumstance i always know what to do i run so i clap my hat on my head declare that the mare must be unharnessed immediately and start for the door harriet follow once outside she close the door behind she david _ david _ david she say it occur to I now for the first time -lrb- which show how stupid i be -rrb- that harriet have already hear the story of anna william and it have gain so much bulk and robustity in travel as such story do in the country that i have no doubt the poor child seem a sort of devastate monster of iniquity how the country scourge those who do not walk the beaten path in the careless city such a one may escape to unfamiliar street and consort with unfamiliar people and still find a way of life but here in the country the eye of society never sleep for a moment i be appal by what i have do then i thought of the harriet i know so well : the inexhaustible heart of she with a sudden inspiration i open the kitchen door and we both look in the girl stand motionless just where i leave she : a infinitely pathetic figure harriet i say that girl be hungry -- and cold well it work instantly harriet cease to be society-at-large and become the harriet i know the harriet of infinite compassion for all weak creature when she have go in i pull my hat down and go straight for the barn i guess i know when it be wise to be absent from place i unharness the mare and water and feed she i climb up into the loft and put down a rackful of hay i let the cow out into the pasture and set up the bar and then i stand by the gate and look up into the clear June sky no man i think can remain long silent under the star with the brooding mysterious night around about he without feel poignantly how little he understand anything how inconsequential he action be how feeble he judgment and i think as i stand there how many a man deep down in he heart know to a certainty that he have escape be a outcast not because of any real moral strength or resolution of he own but because society have bolster he up hedge he about with custom and restriction until he never have have a really good opportunity to transgress and some do not sin for very lack of courage and originality : they be helplessly good how many man in they vanity take to themselves credit for the built-up virtue of man who be dead there be no cause for surprise when we hear of a foremost citizen the leader in all good work suddenly go wrong not the least cause for surprise for it be not he that be moral but society individually he have never be test and when the test come he fall it will give we a large measure of true wisdom if we stop sometimes when we have resist a temptation and ask ourselves why at that moment we do right and not wrong be it the deep virtue the high ideal in we soul or be it the compulsion of the society around we and i think most of we will be astonish to discover what fragile person we really be -- in ourselves i stop for several minute at the kitchen door before i dare to go in then i stamped vigorously on the board as if i have come rush up to the house without a doubt in my mind -- i even whistle -- and open the door jauntily and have my pain for nothing the kitchen be empty but full of comforting and homelike odour there be undoubtedly hot mush in the kettle a few minute later harriet come down the stair she hold up one finger warningly she face be transfigure david she whisper the baby 's asleep so i tiptoe across the room she tiptoe after I then i face about and we both stand there on we tiptoe hold we breath -- at least i hold mine david harriet whisper do you see the baby no i whisper i think it be the finest baby i ever see in my life when i be a boy and my great-aunt who live for many year in a little room with dormer window at the top of my father 's house use to tell I story -lrb- the best i ever hear -rrb- i be never content with the ending of they what happen next i remember ask a hundred time and if i do not ask the question aloud it arise at least in my own mind if i be write fiction i might go on almost indefinitely with the story of anna but in real life story have a curious way of come to quick fruition and wither away after have cast the seed of they immortality do you see the baby harriet have ask she say no word about anna : a baby have come into the world already the present be begin to draw the charitable curtain of its forgetfulness across this simple drama already harriet and anna and all the rest of we be begin to look to the finest baby we ever see in all we life i might indeed go into the character of anna and the why and wherefore of she story but there be curiously little that be strange or unusual about it it be just life a few day with we work miraculous change in the girl like some stray kitten bring in cry from the cold she curl herself up comfortably there in we home purr she contentment she be not in the least a tragic figure : though down deep under the curve and dimple of youth there be something finally resistant or obstinate or defiant -- which keep its counsel regard the past it be curious how acquaintanceship mitigate we judgment we classify stranger into whose career the newspaper or we friend give we glimpse as bad or good we separate humanity into inevitable goathood and sheephood but upon closer acquaintance a man come to be not bad but ebenezer smith or j henry jone and a woman be not good but nellie morgan or mr arthur cadwalader take it in we own case some people know just a little about we might call we pretty good people but we know that down in we heart lurk the possibility -lrb- if not the actual accomplishment -rrb- of all sort of thing not at all good we be exceedingly charitable person -- toward ourselves and thus we let other people live the other day at harriet 's suggestion i drive to town by the upper road pass the william place the old lady have a passion for hollyhock a ragged row of they border the dilapidated picket fence behind which crowd up to the sociable road stand the house as i drive that way it always seem to look out at I like some half-earnest worker invite a chat about the weather or the county fair hence probably its good-natured dilapidation at the gate i hear a voice and a boy about three year old in a soil gingham apron a sturdy blue-eyed little chap whose face be still eloquent of he recent breakfast come run to meet I i stop the mare a moment later a woman be at the gate between the row of hollyhock when she see I she begin hastily to roll down she sleeve why mr grayson how 's the boy anna and it be the cheerful talk we have there by the roadside and the sight of the sturdy boy playing in the sunshine -- and the hollyhock and the dilapidated house -- that bring to memory the old story of anna which i here set down not because it carry any moral but because it be a common little piece out of real life in which harriet and i have be interested vi the drunkard it be a strange thing : adventure i look for she high and i look for she low and she pass my door in a tattered garment -- unheeded for i have neither the eye of simplicity nor the heart of humility one day i look for she anew and i see she beckoning from the open road and underneath the tag and tatters i catch the gleam of she celestial garment and i go with she into a new world i have have a singular adventure in which i have make a friend and i have see new thing which be also true my friend be a drunkard -- at least so i call he follow the custom of the country on he way from town he use often to come by my farm i could hear he singing afar off begin at the bridge where on still day one can hear the rattle of a wagon on the loose board he sing in a peculiar clear high voice i make no further comment upon the singing nor the cause of it but in the cool of the evening when the air be still -- and he usually come in the evening -- i often hear the cadence of he song with a thrill of pleasure then i see he come drive by my farm sit on the spring seat of he one-horse wagon and if he chance to see I in my field he would take off he hat and make I a grandiloquent bow but never for a moment stop he singing and so he pass by the house and i with a smile see he move up the hill in the north road until finally he voice still sing die away in the distance once i happen to reach the house just as the singer be pass and harriet say : there go that drunkard it give I a indescribable shock of course i have know as much and yet i have not directly apply the term i have not think of my singer as _ that _ for i have often be conscious in spite of myself alone in my field of something human and cheerful which have touch I in pass after harriet apply she name to my singer i be of two mind concern he i struggle with myself : i try instinctively to discipline my pulse when i hear the sound of he singing for be he not a drunkard lord how we get we morality mix up with we reality and then one evening when i see he come -- i have be a long day alone in my field -- i experience a sudden revulsion of feeling with a indescribable joyousness of adventure i step out toward the fence and pretend to be hard at work after all i say to myself this be a large world with room in it for many curious people i wait in excitement when he come near I i straighten up just as though i have see he for the first time when he lift he hat to I i lift my hat as grandiloquently as he how be you neighbor i ask he pause for a single instant and give I a smile then he replace he hat as though he have far more important business to attend to and go on up the road my next glimpse of he be a complete surprise to I i see he on the street in town harriet point he out else i should never have recognize he : a quiet shy modest man as different as one could imagine from the singer i have see so often pass my farm he wear neat worn clothes and he horse stand tie in front of the store he have bring he honey to town to sell he be a bee-man i stop and ask he about he honey and whether the fall flower have be plenty i run my eye over he horse and say that it seem to be a good animal but i could get very little from he and that little in a rather low voice i come away with my interest whet to a still keener edge how a man have come to be what he be -- be there any discovery better worth make -lrb- illustration : he usually come in the evening -rrb- after that day in town i watch for the bee-man and i see he often on he way to town silent somewhat bent forward in he seat drive he horse with circumspection a dr jekyll of propriety and a few hour later he would come homeward a wholly different person straight of back joyous of mien singing he song in he high clear voice a very hyde of recklessness even the old horse seem change : he hold he head higher and step with a quicker pace when the bee-man go toward town he never pause nor once look around to see I in my field but when he come back he watch for I and when i respond to he bow he would sometimes stop and reply to my greet one day he come from town on foot and when he see I even though i be some distance away he approach the fence and take off he hat and hold out he hand i walk over toward he i see he full face for the first time : a rather handsome face the hair be thin and curly the forehead generous and smooth but the chin be small he face be slightly flush and he eye -- he eye _ burned _ i shake he hand i have hope i say that you would stop sometime as you go by well i have want to stop -- but i be a busy man i have important matter in hand almost all the time you usually drive yes ordinarily i drive i do not use a team but i have in view a fine span of roadster one of these day you will see I go by you farm in style my wife and i both enjoy drive i wish i could here convey the tone of buoyancy with which he say these word there be a largeness and confidence in they that carry I away he tell I that he be now work with the expert -- those be he word -- and that he would soon begin build a house that would astonish the country upon this he turn abruptly away but come back and with fine courtesy shake my hand you see he say i be a busy man mr grayson -- and a happy man so he set off down the road and as he pass my house he begin sing again in he high voice i walk away with a feeling of wonder not unmixed with sorrow it be a strange case gradually i become really acquaint with the bee-man at first with the exuberant confident imaginative home-going bee-man far more slowly with the shy reserved townward-bound bee-man it be quite a adventure my first talk with the shy bee-man i be drive home i meet he near the lower bridge i cudgel my brain to think of some way to get at he as he pass i lean out and say : friend will you do I a favor i neglect to stop at the post-office would you call and see whether anything have be leave for I in the box since the carrier start ' certainly he say glance up at I but turn he head swiftly aside again on he way back he stop and leave I a paper he tell I volubly about the way he would run the post-office if he be in a place of suitable authority great thing be possible he say to the man of idea at this point begin one of the by-play of my acquaintance with the bee-man the exuberant bee-man refer disparagingly to the shy bee-man i must have look pretty seedy and stupid this morning on my way in i be up half the night but i feel all right now the next time i meet the shy bee-man he on he part apologise for the exuberant bee-man -- hesitatingly falteringly wind up with the word i think you will understand i grasp he hand and leave he with a wan smile on he face instinctively i come to treat the two man in a wholly different manner with the one i be bluster hail-fellow-well-met listen with eagerness to he expansive talk but to the other i say little feeling my way slowly to he friendship for i could not help look upon he as a pathetic figure he need a friend the exuberant bee-man be sufficient unto himself glorious in he vision and i have from he no little entertainment i tell harriet about my adventure : they do not meet with she approval she say i be encourage a vice harriet i say go over and see he wife i wonder what she think about it think exclaimed harriet what should the wife of a drunkard think but she go over as soon as she return i see that something be wrong but i ask no question during supper she be extraordinarily preoccupy and it be not until a hour or more afterward that she come into my room david she say i can not understand some thing be not human nature do what it ought to i ask but she be not to be joke with david that man 's wife do not seem to be sorry because he come home drunken every week or two i talk with she about it and what do you think she say she say she know it be wrong but she intimate that when he be in that state she love -- like -- he all the better be it believable she say : ` perhaps you will not understand -- it be wrong i know but when he come home that way he seem so full of -- life he -- he seem to understand I better then ' she be heartbroken one could see that but she would not admit it i leave it to you david what can anyone do with a woman like that how be the man ever to overcome he habit it be a strange thing when we ask question directly of life how often the answer be unexpected and confusing we logic become illogical we story will not turn out she tell much more about she interview : the neat home the bee in the orchard the well-kept garden when he be sober she say he seem to be a steady hard worker after that i desire more than ever to see deep into the life of the strange bee-man why be he what he be and at last the time come as thing come to he who desire they faithfully enough one afternoon not long ago a fine autumn afternoon when the tree be glorious on the hill the indian summer sun never softer i be tramp along a wood lane far back of my farm and at the roadside near the trunk of a oak tree sit my friend the bee-man he be a picture of despondency one long hand hang limp between he knee he head bow down when he see I he straighten up look at I and settle back again my heart go out to he and i sit down beside he have you ever see a finer afternoon i ask he glance up at the sky fine he answer vaguely as if it have never occur to he i see instantly what the matter be the exuberant bee-man be in process of transformation into the shy bee-man i do not know exactly how it come about for such thing be difficult to explain but i lead he to talk of himself after it be all over he say of course i be ashamed of myself you do not know mr grayson what it all mean i be ashamed of myself now and yet i know i shall do it again no i say you will not do it again yes i shall something inside of I argue : why should you be sorry be you not free for a whole afternoon free i ask yes -- free you will not understand but every day i work work work i have friend but somehow i can not get to they i can not even get to my wife it seem as if a wall hem I in as if i be bind to a rock which i could not get away from i be also afraid when i be sober i know how to do great thing but i can not do they after a few glass -- i never take more -- i not only know i can do great thing but i feel as though i be really do they but you never do no i never do but i _ feel _ that i can all the bond break and the wall fall down and i be free i can really touch people i feel friendly and neighbourly he be talk eagerly now try to explain for the first time in he life he say how it be that he do what he do he tell I how beautiful it make the world where before it be miserable and friendless how he think of great thing and make great plan how he home seem finer and better to he and he work more noble the man have a real gift of imagination and speak with a eagerness and eloquence that stir I deeply i be almost on the point of ask he where he magic liquor be to be find when he finally give I a opening i say : i think i understand many man i know be in some respects drunkard they all want some way to escape themselves -- to be free of they own limitation that be it that be it he exclaim eagerly we sit for a time side by side say nothing i could not help thinking of that line of virgil refer to quite another sort of intoxication : with voluntary dream they cheat they mind instead of that beautiful unity of thought and action which mark the finest character here be this poor tragedy of the divide life when fate would destroy a man it first separate he force it drive he to think one way and act another it encourage he to seek through outward stimulation -- whether drink or riches or fame -- a deceptive and unworthy satisfaction in place of that true contentment which come only from unity within no man can be two man successfully so we sit and say nothing what indeed can any man _ say _ to another under such circumstance as bobbie burn remark out of the depths of he own experience : what be do we partly may compute but know not what be resist i have always feel that the best thing one man can give another be the warm hand of understanding and yet when i thought of the pathetic shy bee-man hem in by he sunless wall i feel that i should also say something see two man struggle shall i not assist the better shall i let the sober one be despoil by he who be riotous there be reality but there be also morality -- if we can keep they properly separate most of we i say finally be in some respects drunkard we do not give it so harsh a name but we be just that drunkenness be not a mere matter of intoxicate liquor it go deeper -- far deeper drunkenness be the failure of a man to control he thought the bee-man sit silent gaze out before he i note the blue vein in the hand that lay on he knee it come over I with sudden amusement and i say : i often get drunk myself you yes -- dreadfully drunk he look at I and laugh -- for the first time and i laugh too do you know there be a lot of human nature in people and when you think you be deep in tragedy behold humor lurk just around the corner i use to laugh at it a good deal more than i do now he say i have be through it all sometimes when i go to town i say to myself ' i will not turn at that corner ' but when i come to the corner i do turn then i say ' i will not go into that bar ' but i do go in ' i will not order anything to drink ' i say to myself and then i hear myself talk aloud to the barkeeper just as though i be some other person ` give I a glass of rye ' i say and i stand off look at myself very angry and sorrowful but gradually i seem to grow weaker and weaker -- or rather stronger and stronger -- for my brain begin to become clear and i see thing and feel thing i never see or feel before i want to sing and you do sing i say i do indeed he respond laugh and it seem to I the most beautiful music in the world sometimes i say when i be on _ my _ kind of spree i try not so much to empty my mind of the thought which bother I but rather to fill my mind with other stronger thought -- before i could finish he have interrupt : have not i try that too do not i think of other thing i think of bee -- and that lead I to honey do not it and that make I think of put the honey in the wagon and take it to town then of course i think how it will sell instantly stronger than you can imagine i see a dime in my hand then it appear on the wet bar i _ smell _ the _ smell _ of the liquor and there you be we do not talk much more that day we get up and shake hand and look each other in the eye the bee-man turn away but come back hesitatingly i be glad of this talk mr grayson it make I feel like take hold again i have be in hell for year -- of course i say you need a friend you and i will come up together as i walk toward home that evening i feel a curious warmth of satisfaction in my soul -- and i marvelled at the many strange thing that be to be find upon this miraculous earth \* \* \* \* \* i suppose if i be write a story i should stop at this point but i be deal in life and life do not always respond to we impatience with satisfactory moral conclusion life be inconclusive : quite open at the end i have a vision of a new life for my neighbor the bee-man -- and have it yet for i have not do with he -- but -- last evening and that be why i have be prompt to write the whole story my bee-man come again along the road by my farm my exuberant bee-man i hear he singing afar off he do not see I as he go by but as i stand look out at he it come over I with a sudden sense of largeness and quietude that the sun shone on he as genially as it do on I and that the leaf do not turn aside from he nor the bird stop sing when he pass he also belong here i say and i watch he as he mount the distant hill until i could no longer hear the high clear cadence of he song and it seem to I that something human in pass have touch I vii a old maid one of my neighbor whom i never have chance to mention before in these writings be a certain old maid she live about two mile from my farm in a small white house set in the midst of a modest neat garden with well-kept apple tree in the orchard behind it she live all alone save for a good-humoured stupid nephew who do most of the work on the farm -- and do it a little unwillingly harriet and i have not be here above a week when we first make the acquaintance of miss aiken or rather she make we acquaintance for she fill the place most important in a country community of a sensitive social tentacle -- reach out to touch with sympathy the stranger harriet be amuse at first by what she consider a almost unwarrantable curiosity but we soon form a genuine liking for the little old lady and since then we have often see she in she home and often she have come to ours she be here only last night i consider she as she sit rock in front of we fire a picture of wholesome comfort i have have much to say of contentment she seem really to live it although i have find that contentment be easier to discover in the life of we neighbor than in we own all she life long she have live here in this community a world of small thing one be tempt to say with a sort of expect and predictable life i think last night as i observe she gently stir she rocking-chair how she life must be make up of small often-repeated event : pancake pudding patching who know what other orderly habitual minute affair who know who know when he look at you or at I that there be anything in we beyond the humdrummery of this day in front of she house be two long board bed of old-fashioned flower mignonette and petunia chiefly and over the small very white door with its shiny knob creep a white clemati vine just inside the hall-door you will discover a bright clean oval rag rug which prepare you as small thing lead to greater for the larger brighter cleaner rug of the sitting-room there on the centre-table you will discover snow bind by john greenleaf whittier tupper 's poem a large embossed bible the family plush album and a book with a gilt ladder on the cover which lead upward to gilt star call the path of life on the wall be two companion picture of a rosy fat child in fade gilt frame one call wide awake the other fast asleep not far away in a corner on the top of the walnut whatnot be a curious vase fill with pampas plume there be sea-shell and a piece of coral on the shelf below and right in the midst of the room be three very large black rocking-chair with cushion in every conceivable and available place -- include cushion on the arm two of they be for you and I if we should come in to call the other be for the cat when you sit down you can look out between the starchiest of starchy curtain into the yard where there be a innumerable busy flock of chicken she keep chicken and all the important one be name she have one call martin luther another be josiah gilbert holland once she come over to we house with a basket from one end of which be thrust the sturdy red leg of a pullet she inform we that she have bring we one of evangeline 's daughter but i be get out of the house before i be fairly well into it the sitting-room express miss aiken but not so well somehow as the immaculate bedroom beyond into which upon one occasion i be permit to steal a modest glimpse it be of a incomparable neatness and order all hang about -- or so it seem to I -- with white starchy thing and ornament with bright -lrb- but inexpensive -rrb- nothing in this wonderful bedroom there be a secret and sacred drawer into which once in she life harriet have a glimpse it contain the clothes all gently fold exhale a odour of lavender in which we friend will appear when she have close she eye to open they no more upon this earth in such calm readiness she await she time upon the bureau in this sacred apartment stand a small rosewood box which be lock into which no one in we neighborhood have have so much as a single peep i should not dare of course to speculate upon its contents perhaps a old letter or two a ring and a rise a ribbon that be more than a ribbon a picture that be more than art who can tell as i pass that way i fancied i could distinguish a faint mysterious odour which i associate with the rosewood box : a old-fashioned odour compose of many simple on the stand near the head of the bed and close to the candlestick be a bible -- a little familiar daily bible very different indeed from the portentous and impose family bible which repose on the centre-table in the front room which be never open except to record a death it have be well worn this small nightly bible by much handling be there a care or a trouble in this world here be the sure talisman she seek -lrb- and find -rrb- the inspired text wherever she open the book she seize the first word she eye fall upon as a prophetic message to she then she go forth like some david with he sling so panoplied with courage that she be daunt by no goliath of the philistine also she have a worshipfulness of all minister sometimes when the scotch preacher come to tea and remark that she pudding be good i firmly believe that she interpret the word into a spiritual message for she besides the drawer the rosewood box and the worn bible there be a certain black cape far be it from I to attempt a description but i can say with some assurance that it also occupy a shrine it may not be in the inner sanctuary but it certainly occupy a goodly part of the outer porch of the temple all this of course be figurative for the cape hang just inside the closet door on a hanger with a white cloth over the shoulder to keep off the dust for the vanity of the world enter even such a sanctuary as this i wish indeed that you could see miss aiken wear she cape on a Sunday in the late fall when she come to church she sweet old face shine under she black hat she old-fashioned silk skirt give out a audible not unimpressive sound as she move down the aisle with what dignity she step into she pew with what care she sit down so that she may not crush the cookie in she ample pocket with what meek pride -- if there be such a thing as meek pride -- she look up at the scotch preacher as he stand sturdily in he pulpit announce the first hymn and many a eye turn that way to look turn with affection several time harriet and i have be with she to tea like many another genius she have no conception of she own art in such matter as apple pudding she herself prefer graham gem in which she believe there inhere a certain mysterious efficacy she bake gem on Monday and have they steam during the remainder of the week -- with tea and as a sort of dessert she tell we about the danas the aiken and the carnahan who be in various relationship she progenitor we gravitate into the other room and presently she show we in the plush album the portrait of various cousin aunt and uncle and by-and-by harriet warm up and begin to tell about the scribner the macintosh and the strayer who be _ we _ progenitor the aiken say miss aiken be always like that -- downright and outspoken it be a aiken trait no aiken could ever help blurt out the truth if he know he be to die for it the next minute that be like the macintosh harriet put in old grandfather macintosh -- by this time i be settle comfortably in the cushion rocking-chair to watch the fray miss aiken advance a dana harriet counter with a strayer miss aiken deploy the carnahan in open order upon which harriet entrench herself with the heroic scribner and let fly a macintosh who be a general in the colonial army surprised but not defeat miss aiken withdraw in good order cover she retreat with two _ mayflower _ ancestor the existence of whom she establish with a blue cup and a ancient silver spoon no one know the joy of fight relative until he have watch such a battle follow the complete comfort of a good supper if any one be sick in the community miss aiken hear instantly of it by a sort of wireless telegraphy or telepathy which would astonish a mystery-loving east indian she appear with she little basket which have two brown flap for cover open from the middle and with a spring in they somewhere so that they fly shut with a snap out of this she take a bowl of chicken broth a jar of ambrosial jelly a cake of delectable honey and a bottle of celestial raspberry shrub if the patient will only eat he will immediately rise up and walk or if he die it be a pleasant sort of death i have myself think on several occasion of be take with a brief fit of sickness in tell all these thing about miss aiken which seem to describe she i have tell only the commonplace the expect or predictable detail often and often i pause when i see a interesting man or woman and ask myself : how after all do this person live for we all know it be not chiefly by the clothes we wear or the house we occupy or the friend we touch there be something deeper more secret which furnish the real motive and character of we life what a triumph then be every fine old man to have come out of a long life with a spirit still sunny be not that a heroic accomplishment of the real life of we friend i know only one thing but that thing be precious to I for it give I a glimpse of the far dim alp that rise out of the plain of contentment it be nothing very definite -- such thing never be and yet i like to think of it when i see she tread the useful round of she simple life as i say she have live here in this neighborhood -- oh sixty year the country know she father before she out of that past through the dim eye of some of the old inhabitant i have have glimpse of the sprightly girlhood which we friend must have enjoy there be even a confused story of a wooer -lrb- how people try to account for every old maid -rrb- -- a long time ago -- who come and go away again no one remember much about he -- such thing be not important of course after so many year -- but i must get to _ the _ thing i treasure one day harriet call at the little house it be in summer and the door stand open she presume on the privilege of friendship and walk straight in there she see sit at the table she head on she arm in a curious girlish abandon unlike the prim miss aiken we know so well we old maid when she hear harriet 's step she start up with breath quickly indrawn there be tear in she eye something in she hand she conceal in the fold of she skirt then impulsively -- unlike she too -- she throw a arm around harriet and bury she face on harriet 's shoulder in response to harriet 's question she say : oh a old old trouble no _ new _ trouble that be all there be to it all the new trouble be the trouble of other people you may say this be not much of a clue well it be not and yet i like to have it in mind it give I somehow the _ other _ woman who be not expect or predictable or commonplace i seem to understand we old maid the better and when i think of she bustling inquisitive helpful gentle way and the shine of she white soul i be sure i do not know what we should do without she in this community viii a roadside prophet from my upper field when i look across the countryside i can see in the distance a short stretch of the gray town road it wind out of a little wood cross a knoll and lose itself again beyond the tree of a old orchard i love that spot in my upper field and the view of the road beyond when i be at work there i have only to look up to see the world go by -- part of it go down to the town and part of it come up again and i never see a traveller on the hill especially if he be afoot without feeling that if i meet he i should like he and that whatever he have to say i should like to hear \* \* \* \* \* at first i could not make out what the man be do most of the traveller i see from my field be like the people i commonly meet -- so intent upon they destination that they take no joy of the road they travel they do not even see I here in the field and if they do they would probably think I a slow and unprofitable person i have nothing that they can carry away and store up in barn or reduce to percentage or calculate as profit and loss they do not perceive what a wonderful place this be they do not know that here too we gather a crop of contentment but apparently this man be the pattern of a loiterer i see he stop on the knoll and look widely about he then he stoop down as though search for something then move slowly forward for a few step just at that point in the road lie a great smooth boulder which road-maker long since dead have roll out upon the wayside here to my astonishment i see he kneel upon the ground he have something in one hand with which he seem intently occupy after a time he stand up and retreat a few step down the road he scan the boulder narrowly this i say to myself may be something for I so i cross the fence and walk down the neighbouring field it be a indian summer day with hazy hillside and still sunshine and slumber brown field -- the sort of a day i love i leap the little brook in the valley and stride hastily up the opposite slope i can not describe what a sense i have of new world to be find here in old field so i come to the fence on the other side and look over my man be kneel again at the rock i be scarcely twenty pace from he but so earnestly be he engage that he never once see I i have a good look at he he be a small thin man with straight gray hair above he collar i could see the weather-brown wrinkle of he neck he coat be of black of a noticeably neat appearance and i observe as a further evidence of fastidiousness rare upon the road that he be save he trousers by kneel on a bit of carpet what he could be do there so intently by the roadside i could not imagine so i climb the fence make some little intentional noise as i do so he arise immediately then i see at he side on the ground two small tin can and in he hand a pair of paint brush as he step aside i see the word he have be paint on the boulder : god be love a meek figure indeed he look and when he see I advance he say with a deference that be almost timidity : good morning sir good morning brother i return heartily he face brighten perceptibly do not stop on my account i say finish off you work he kneel again on he bit of carpet and proceed busily with he brush i stand and watch he the letter be somewhat crude but he have the swift deftness of long practice how long i inquire have you be at this sort of work ten year he reply look up at I with a pale smile off and on for ten year winter i work at my trade -- i be a journeyman painter -- but when spring come and again in the fall i follow the road he pause a moment and then say drop he voice in word of the utmost seriousness : i live by the word by the word i ask yes by the word and put down he brush he take from a inner pocket a small package of papers one of which he hand to I it bear at the top this sentence in large type : be not my word like fire saith the lord : and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in piece i stand and look at he a moment i suppose no one man be stranger than any other but at that moment it seem to I i have never meet a more curious person and i be consume with a desire to know why he be what he be do you always paint the same sign i ask oh no he answer i have a feeling about what i should paint when i come up the road here this morning i stop a minute and it all seem so calm and nice -- he sweep he arm in the direction of the field -- that i say to myself ' i will paint god be love ' a appropriate text i say for this very spot he seem much gratified oh you can follow you feeling he exclaim sometimes near town i can not paint anything but ` hell yawn ' and ` prepare to meet thy god ' i do not like 'em as well as ` god be love ' but it seem like i have to paint 'em now when i be in arizona -- he pause a moment wipe he brush when i be in arizona he be say mostly i paint ` repent ye ' it seem like i could not paint anything else and in some place i feel move to put ` repent ye ' twice on the same rock i begin to ask he question about arizona but i soon find how little he too have take toll of the road he travel : for he seem to have bring back memory only of the text he paint and the fact that in some place good stone be scarce and that he have to carry extra turpentine to thin he paint the weather be dry i do not know that he be a lone representative of this trait i have know farmer who in travel saw only plow and butter-tub and corn-crib and preacher who look across such autumn field as these would carry away only a musty text or two i pity some of those who expect to go to heaven : they will find so little to surprise they in the golden street but i persevere with my painter and it be not long before we be talk with the greatest friendliness have now finish he work he shake out he bit of carpet screw the top on he paint can wrap up he brush and disposed of they all with the deftness of long experience in he small black bag then he stand up and look critically at he work it be all right i say a great many people come this way in the next hundred year will see it that be what i want he say eagerly that be what i want most people never hear the word at all he pause a moment and then continue : it be a curious thing mister -- perhaps you have notice it yourself -- that the best thing of all in the world people will not have as a gift i have notice it i say it be strange be not it he again remark very strange i say i do not know 's i can blame they he continue i be that way myself for a good many year : all around I gold and diamond and precious jewel and I never once see they all i have to do be to stoop and take they -- but i do not do it i see that i have meet a philosopher and i decide that i would stop and wrestle with he and not let he go without he story -- something like jacob be not it with the angel do you do all this without payment he look at I in a injured way who have pay I he ask mostly people think I a sort of fool oh i know but i do not mind i live by the word no nobody pay I : i be pay myself by this time he be ready to start so i say friend i be go you way and i 'll walk with you so we set off together down the hill you see sir he say when a man have get the best thing in the world and find it be free he naturally want to let other people know about it he walk with the unmistakable step of those who know the long road -- a easy swinging steady step -- carry he small black bag so i gradually draw he out and when i have he whole story it be as simple and common but as wonderful as daylight : as fundamental as a tree or a rock you see mister he say i be a wild sort when i be young the drink and worse i hear folk say sometimes that if they would know what be right they would have do it but i think that conscience never stop ring little bell in the back of a man 's head and that if he do not do what be right it be because he _ want _ to do what be wrong he think it be more amusing and interesting i go through all that mister and plenty more besides i get pretty nearly as low as a man ever get oh i be down and out : no home no family not a friend that want to see I if you never get down that low mister you do not know what it be you be just as much dead as if you be in you grave i be tell you i think there be no help for I and i do not know 's i want to be help i say to myself ` you be just naturally bear weak and it be not you fault ' it make a lot of man easier in they mind to lay up they trouble to the way they be bear i make all sort of excuse for myself but all the time i know i be wrong a man can not fool himself so it go along for year i get marry and we have a little girl he pause for a long moment i think _ that _ be go to help I i think the world and all of that little girl -- he pause again well _ she _ die then i break my wife 's heart and go on down to hell when a man let go that way he kill everything he love and everything that love he he be on the road to loneliness and despair that man i be tell you one day ten year ago this fall i be go along the main street in quinceyville i be near the end of my rope not even money enough to buy drink with and yet i be then more 'n half drunk i happen to look up on the end of that stone wall near the bridge -- be you ever there mister -- and i see the word ` god be love ' paint there it somehow hit I hard i could not anyways get it out of my mind ` god be love ' well say i to myself if god be love he be the only one that _ be _ love for a chap like I and there be no one else big enough to save I -- i say so i stop right there in the street and you may believe it or explain it anyhow you like mister but it seem to I a kind of light come all around I and i say solemn-like ' i will try god ' he stop a moment we be walk down the hill : all about we on either side spread the quiet field in the high air above a few lacy cloud be drift eastward upon this story of tragic human life creep in pleasantly the calm of the countryside and i do try he my companion be say and i find that the word on the wall be true they be true back there and they have be true ever since when i begin to be decent again and get back my health and my job i figure that i owe a lot to god i wa 'n' t no orator and no writer and i have no money to give ` but ' say i to myself i be a painter i 'll help god with paint ' so here i be a-travelling up and down the road and mostly painting ` god be love ' but sometimes ` repent ye ' and ` hell yawn ' i do not know much about religion -- but i do know that he word be like a fire and that a man can live by it and if once a man have it he have everything else he want he pause : i look around at he again he face be set steadily ahead -- a plain face show the mark of he hard earlier life and yet mark with a sort of high beauty the trouble with people who be unhappy mister he say be that they will not try god i could not answer my companion there seem indeed nothing more to be say all my own speculative incoming and outgoing -- how futile they seem compare with this near the foot of the hill there be a little-bridge it be a pleasant quiet spot my companion stop and put down he bag what do you think say he i should paint here well i say you know better than i do what would _ you _ paint he look around at I and then smile as though he have a quiet little joke with himself when in doubt he say i always paint ` god be love ' i be sure of that of course ` hell yawn ' and ` repent ye ' have to be paint -- near town -- but i much rather paint ` god be love ' i leave he kneel there on the bridge the bit of carpet under he knee he two little can at he side half way up the hill i turn to look back he lift he hand with the paint brush in it and i wave mine in return i have never see he since though it will be a long long time before the sign of he disappear from we roadside at the top of the hill near the paint boulder i climb the fence pause a moment on the top rail to look off across the hazy countryside warm with the still sweetness of autumn in the distance above the crown of a little hill i could see the roof of my own home -- and the barn near it -- and the cow feed quietly in the pasture ix the gunsmith harriet and i have the first intimation of what we have since call the gunsmith problem about ten day ago it come to we as be to be expect from that accomplished spreader of burden the scotch preacher when he come in to call on we that evening after supper i could see that he have something important on he mind but i let he get to it in he own way david he say finally carlstrom the gunsmith be go home to sweden at last i exclaimed dr mcalway pause a moment and then say hesitatingly : he _ say _ he be go harriet laugh then it be all decide she say he be not go no say the scotch preacher it be not decide -- yet dr mcalway have not make up he mind i say whether carlstrom be to go or not but the scotch preacher be in no mood for joke david he say do you ever know anything about the homesickness of the foreigner he pause a moment and then continue nod he great shaggy head : man man how my old mither greet for scotland i mind how a sprig of heather would bring the tear to she eye and for twenty year i dare not whistle bonnie doon or charlie be my darling lest it break she heart ` tis a pain you have not have i be think davy we all know the longing for old place and old time i say no no david it be more than that it be the want and the longing to see the hill of you own land and the town where you be bear and the street where you play and the house -- he pause ah well it be hard for those who have it but i have not hear carlstrom refer to sweden for year i say be it homesickness or just old age there ye have it davy the nail right on the head exclaim the scotch preacher be it homesickness or be he just old and tired with that we fall to talk about carlstrom the gunsmith i have know he pretty nearly ever since i come here now more than ten year ago -- and like he well too -- but it seem as dr mcalway talk that evening as though we be make the acquaintance of quite a new and wonderful person how dull we all be how we need such a artist as the scotch preacher to mould hero out of the common human clay around we it take a sort of greatness to recognize greatness in a hour 's time the scotch preacher have both harriet and I much excited and the upshot of the whole matter be that i promise to call on carlstrom the next day when i go to town i scarcely need the prompt of the scotch preacher for carlstrom 's gunshop have for year be one of the most interesting place in town for I i go to it now with a new understanding afar off i begin to listen for carlstrom 's hammer and presently i hear the familiar sound there be two or three mellow stroke and i know that carlstrom be make the spark fly from the red iron then the hammer ring and i know he be strike down on the cold steel of the anvil it be a pleasant sound to hear carlstrom 's shop be just around the corner from the main street you may know it by a great weather-beaten wooden gun fasten over the doorway point in the daytime at the sky and in the night at the star a stranger pass that way might wonder at the great gun and possibly say to himself : a gunshop how can a man make a living mending gun in such a peaceful community such a remark merely show that he do not know carlstrom nor the shop nor _ we _ i tie my horse at the corner and go down to the shop with a peculiar new interest i see as if for the first time the old wheel which have stand weather so long at one end of the building i saw under the shed at the other end the wonderful assortment of old iron pipe kettle tire a pump or two many part of farm machinery a broken water wheel and i do not know what other flotsam of thirty year of diligent mending of the iron work of a entire community all this you may say -- the disorder of old iron the cinder which cover part of the yard but do not keep out the tangle of goldenrod and catnip and boneset which at this time of the year grow thick along the neighbouring fence -- all this you say make no invite picture you be wrong where honest work be there be always that which invite the eye i know of few thing more invite than to step up to the wide-open door and look into the shop the floor half of hard worn board half of cinder the smoky rafter of the roof the confusion of implement on the bench the gun in the corner -- how all of these thing form the subdue background for the flaming forge and the square chimney above it at one side of the forge you will see the great dusty bellows and you will hear its stertorous breathing in front stand the old brown anvil set upon a gnarly maple block a long sweep make of peel hickory wood control the bellows and as you look in upon this lively and pleasant scene you will see that the grimy hand of carlstrom himself be upon the hickory sweep as he draw it down and let it up again with the peculiar rhythmic swing of long experience -- heap up he fire with a little iron paddle hold in the other hand -- he hum to himself in a high curious old voice no word at all just a tune of contented employment in consonance with the breathing of the bellows and the mount flame of the forge as i stand for a moment in the doorway the other day before carlstrom see I i wish i could picture my friend as the typical blacksmith with the brawny arm the big chest the deep voice and all that but as i look at he newly the scotch preacher 's word still in my ear he seem with he stoop shoulder he gray beard not very well keep and he thin gray hair more than ordinarily small and old i remember as distinctly as though it be yesterday the first time carlstrom really impressed himself upon I it be in my early blind day at the farm i have go to he with a part of a horse-rake which i have break on one of my stony hill ' can you mend it i ask if i have know he better i should never have ask such a question i see indeed at the time that i have not say the right thing but how could i know then that carlstrom never let any broken thing escape he a watch or a gun or a locomotive -- they be all alike to he if they be broken i believe he would agree to patch the wreck chariot of phathon a week later i come back to the shop come in come in he say when he see I he turn from he forge set he hand on he hip and look at I a moment with feigned seriousness so he say you have come for you job he soften the j in job he whole speech indeed have the engaging inflection of the scandinavian tongue overlaid upon the english word so he say and go to he bench with a quick step and a air of almost childish eagerness he hand I the part of my hay-rake without a word i look they over carefully i can not see where you mend they i say you should have see he face brighten with pleasure he allow I to admire the work in silence for a moment and then he have it out of my hand as if i could not be trust with anything so important and he explain how he have do it a special tool for he lathe have be find necessary in order to do my work properly this he have make at he forge and i suppose it have take he twice as long to make the special tool as it have to mend the part of my rake but when i would have pay he for it he would take nothing save for the mend itself nor be this a mere rebuke to a doubter it have delight he to do a difficult thing to show the really great skill he have indeed i think we friendship begin right there and be base upon the favor i do in bring he a job that i think he could not do when he see I the other day in the door of he shop he seem greatly pleased come in come in he say what be this i hear i say about you go back to sweden for forty year he say i have be homesick for sweden now i be a old man and i be go home but carlstrom i say we can not get along without you who be go to keep we mend up you have charle baxter he say smile for year there have be a quiet sort of rivalry between carlstrom and baxter though baxter be in the country and work chiefly in wood but baxter can not mend a gun or a hay-rake or a pump to save he life i say you know that the old man seem greatly pleased : he have the simple vanity which be the right of the true workman but for answer he merely shake he head i have be here forty year he say and all the time i have be homesick for sweden i find that several man of the town have be in to see carlstrom and talk with he of he plan and even while i be there two other friend come in the old man be delighted with the interest show after i leave he i go down the street it seem as though everybody have hear of carlstrom 's plan and here and there i feel that the secret hand of the scotch preacher have be at work at the store where i usually trade the merchant talk about it and the postmaster when i go in for my mail and the clerk at the drug store and the harness-maker i have know a good deal about carlstrom in the past for one learn much of he neighbor in ten year but it seem to I that day as though he history stand out as something separate and new and impressive when he first come here forty year ago i suppose carlstrom be not unlike most of the foreigner who immigrate to we shore fire with faith in a free country he be poor -- as poor as a man could possibly be for several year he work on a farm -- hard work for which owe to he frail physique he be not well fitted but he save money constantly and after a time he be able to come to town and open a little shop he make nearly all of he tool with he own hand he build he own chimney and forge he even whittle out the wooden gun which stand for a sign over the door of he shop he have learn he trade in the careful old-country way not only could he mend a gun but he could make one outright even to the barrel and the wooden stock in all the year i have know he he have always have on hand some such work -- once i remember a pistol -- which he be turn out at odd time for the very satisfaction it give he he could not sell one of he hand-made gun for half as much as it cost he nor do he seem to want to sell they prefer rather to have they stand in the corner of he shop where he can look at they he be the incorruptible spirit of the artist what a tremendous power there be in work carlstrom work he be up early in the morning to work and he work in the evening as long as daylight last and once i find he in he shop in the evening bend low over he bench with a kerosene lamp in front of he he be hum he inevitable tune and smooth off with a fine file the nice curve of a rifle trigger when he have trouble -- and what a lot of it he have have in he time -- he work and when he be happy he work all the harder all the leisurely one of the town drift by all the child and the fool and often rest in the doorway of he shop he make they all welcome : he talk with they but he never stop work clang clang would go he anvil whish whish would respond he bellows creak creak would go the hickory sweep -- he be help the world go round all this time though he have sickness in he family though he wife die and then he child one after another until only one now remain he work and he save he buy a lot and build a house to rent then he build another house then he buy the land where he shop stand and rebuild the shop itself it be a epic of homely work he take part in the work of the church and on election day he change he coat and go to the town hall to vote -lrb- illustration : the child often rest in the doorway of he shop -rrb- in the year since i have know the old gunsmith and something of the town where he work i have see young man bear american with every opportunity and encouragement of a free country grow up there and go to waste one day i hear one of they sit in front of a store grumble about the foreigner who be come in and take up the land the young man think it should be prevent by law i say nothing but i listen and hear from the distance the steady clang clang of carlstrom 's hammer upon the anvil ketchell the store-keeper tell I how carlstrom have long and plan and save to be able to go back once more to the old home he have leave again and again he have get almost enough money ahead to start and then there would be a interest payment due or a death in the family and the money would all go to the banker the doctor or the undertaker of recent year say ketchell we think he would give up the idea he friend be all here now and if he go back he certainly would be disappoint a sort of serenity seem indeed to come upon he : he family lie on the quiet hill old thing and old time have grow distant and upon that anvil of he before the glowing forge he have beat out for himself a real place in this community he have beat out the respect of a whole town and from the crude human nature with which he start he have fashion himself wisdom and peace of mind and the ripe humor which see that god be in he world there be man i know who read many book hope to learn how to be happy let I commend they to carlstrom the gunsmith i have often reflect upon the incalculable influence of one man upon a community the town be better for have stand often look into the fire of carlstrom 's forge and see he hammer strike i do not know how many time i have hear man repeat observation gather in carlstrom 's shop only the other day i hear the village school teacher say when i ask he why he always seem so merry and have so little fault to find with the world why he reply as carlstrom the smith say ` when i feel like find fault i always begin with myself and then i never get any farther ' another of carlstrom 's saying be current in the country it be a good thing he say when a man know what he pretend to know the more i circulate among my friend the more i hear of carlstrom it be odd that i should have go all these year know carlstrom and yet never consciously until last week set he in he rightful place among the man i know it make I wonder what other great soul about I be thus conceal themselves in the guise of familiarity -lrb- this stooped gray neighbor of mine whom i have see so often work in he field that he have almost become a part of the landscape -- who can tell what heroism may be lock away from my vision under he old brown hat -rrb- on Wednesday night carlstrom be at dr mcalway 's house -- with charle baxter my neighbor horace and several other and i have still another view of he i think there be always something that surprise one in find a familiar figure in a wholly new environment i be so accustomed to the carlstrom of the gunshop that i could not at once reconcile myself to the carlstrom of dr mcalway 's sit room and indeed there be a striking change in he appearance he come dress in the quaint black coat which he wear at funeral he hair be brush straight back from he broad smooth forehead and he mild blue eye be bright behind a especially shiny pair of steel-bowed spectacles he look more like some old-fashioned college professor than he do like a smith the old gunsmith have that pride of humility which be about the best pride in this world he be perfectly at home at the scotch preacher 's hearth indeed he radiate a sort of beam good will he have a native desire to make everything pleasant i do not realize before what a fund of humor the old man have the scotch preacher rally he on the number of house he now own and suggest that he ought to get a wife to keep at least one of they for he carlstrom look around with a twinkle in he eye when i be a poor man he say and carry box from ketchell 's store to help build my first shop i use to wish i have a wheelbarrow now i have four when i have no house to keep my family in i use to wish that i have one now i have four i have think sometimes i would like a wife -- but i have not dare to wish for one the old gunsmith laugh noiselessly and then from habit i suppose begin to hum as he do in he shop -- stop instantly however when he realize what he be do during the evening the scotch preacher get I to one side and say : david we can not let the old man go no sir i say we can not all he need davy be cheer up it be a cold world sometimes to the old i suppose the scotch preacher be say the same thing to all the other man of the company when we be prepare to go dr mcalway turn to carlstrom and say : how be it carlstrom that you have come to hold such a place in this community how be it that you have get ahead so rapidly the old man lean forward beam through he spectacles and say eagerly : it ist america it ist america no carlstrom no -- it be not all america it be carlstrom too you work carlstrom and you save every day since Wednesday there have be a steady pressure on carlstrom not so much say in word but people stop in at the shop and pass a good word but up to Monday morning the gunsmith go forward steadily with he preparation to leave on Sunday i see the scotch preacher and find he perplex as to what to do i do not know yet positively that he have a hand in it though i suspect it but on Monday afternoon charle baxter go by my house on he way to town with a broken saw in he buggy such be the perversity of rival artist that i do not think charle baxter have ever be to carlstrom with any work but this morning when i go to town and stop at carlstrom 's shop i find the gunsmith hum louder than ever well carlstrom when be we to say good-by i ask i be not go he say and take I by the sleeve he lead I over to he bench and show I a saw he have mend now a broken saw be one of the high test of the genius of the mender to put the piece together so that the blade will be perfectly smooth so that the tooth match accurately be a art which few workman of to-day would even attempt charle baxter bring it in answer the old gunsmith unable to conceal he delight he think i could not mend it to the true artist there be nothing to equal the approbation of a rival it be charle baxter i be convince who be the decide factor carlstrom could not leave with one of baxter 's saw unmended but back of it all i know be the hand and the heart of the scotch preacher the more i think of it the more i think that we gunsmith possess many of the quality of true greatness he have the serenity and the humor and the humility of greatness he have a real faith in god he work he accept what come he think there be no more honorable calling than that of gunsmith and that the town he live in be the best of all town and the people he know the best people yes it _ be _ greatness x the mow now i see the secret of the making of the best person it be to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth this be a well earn Sunday morning my chore be all do long ago and i be sit down here after a late and leisurely breakfast with that luxurious feeling of irresponsible restfulness and comfort which come only upon a clean still Sunday morning like this -- after a week of hard work -- a clean Sunday morning with clean clothes and a clean chin and clean thought and the June air stir the clean white curtain at my window from across the hill i can hear very faintly the drowsy sound of early church bell never indeed to be hear here except on a morning of surpass tranquillity and in the barnyard back of the house harriet 's hen be cackle triumphantly : they be impiously unobservant of the sabbath day i turn out my mare for a run in the pasture she have roll herself again and again in the warm earth and shake herself after each roll with a equine delight most pleasant to see now from time to time i can hear she gossipy whickering as she call across the field to my neighbor horace 's young bay colt when i first wake up this morning i say to myself : well nothing happen yesterday then i lay quiet for some time -- it be Sunday morning -- and i turn over in my mind all that i have hear or see or feel or think about in that one day and presently i say aloud to myself : why nearly everything happen yesterday and the more i thought of it the more interesting the more wonderful the more explanatory of high thing appear the common doings of that June Saturday i have walk among unusual event -- and have not know the wonder of they i have eye but i do not see -- and ear but i hear not it may be it _ may _ be that the future life of which we have have such confusing but wistful prophecy be only the relive with a full understanding of this marvellous life that we now know to a full understanding this day this moment even -- here in this quiet room -- would contain enough to crowd a eternity oh we be child yet -- play with thing much too large for we -- much too full of mean \* \* \* \* \* yesterday i cut my field of early clover i should have be at it a full week earlier if it have not be for the frequent and sousing spring shower already half the blossom of the clover have turn brown and be shrivel away into inconspicuous seediness the leaf underneath on the lower part of the stem be curl up and fading many of they have already drop away there be a tide also in the affair of clover and if a farmer would profit by he crop it must be take at its flood i begin to watch the sky with some anxiety and on Thursday i be delighted to see the weather become clearer and a warm dry wind spring up from the southwest on Friday there be not so much as a cloud of the size of a man 's hand to be see anywhere in the sky not one and the sun with lively diligence have begin to make up for the listlessness of the past week it be hot and dry enough to suit the most exacting hay-maker encourage by these favourable symptom i send word to dick sheridan -lrb- by one of horace 's man -rrb- to come over bright and early on Saturday morning my field be only a small one and so rough and uneven that i have conclude with dick 's help to cut it by hand i think that on a pinch it could all be do in one day harriet i say we 'll cut the clover to-morrow that be fortunate say harriet i would already arrange to have ann spencer in to help I yesterday morning then i get out earlier than usual it be a perfect June morning one of the brightest and clearest i think i ever see the mist have not yet rise from the hollow of my lower field and all the earth be fresh with dew and sweet with the mingled odour of grow thing no hour of the whole day be more perfect than this i walk out along the edge of the orchard and climb the fence of the field beyond as i stooped over i could smell the heavy sweet odour of the clover blossom i could see the billowy green sweep of the glisten leave i lift up a mass of the tangled stem and lay the palm of my hand on the earth underneath it be neither too wet nor too dry we shall have good cut to-day i say to myself so i stand up and look with a satisfaction impossible to describe across the acre of my small domain mark where in the low spot the crop seem heaviest where it be lodge and tangle by the wind and the rain and where in the higher space it grow scarce thick enough to cover the sad baldness of the knoll how much more we get out of life than we deserve so i walk along the edge of the field to the orchard gate which i open wide here i say be where we will begin so i turn back to the barn i have not reach the other side of the orchard when who should i see but dick sheridan himself come in at the lane gate he have a old coarse-woven straw hat stick resplendently on the back of he head he be carry he scythe jauntily over he shoulder and whistle good-bye susan at the top of he capacity dick sheridan be a cheerful young fellow with a thin brown face and -lrb- milky -rrb- blue eye he have a enormous adam 's apple which have a odd way of move up and down when he talk -- and one large tooth out in front he body be like a bundle of wire as thin and muscular and enduring as that of a broncho pony he can work all day long and then go down to the lodge-hall at the cross and dance half the night you should really see he when he dance he can jump straight up and click he heel twice together before he come down again on such occasion he be marvellously clad as befit the gallant that he really be but this morning he wear a fade shirt and one of he suspender cord behind be fasten with a nail instead of a button he sock be sometimes pale blue and sometimes lavender and commonly therefore he turn up he trouser leg so that these vanity may not be wholly lose upon a dull world he full name be richard tecumseh sheridan but every one call he dick a good cheerful fellow dick and a hard worker i like he hello dick i shout hello yourself mr grayson he reply he hang he scythe in the branch of a pear tree and we both turn into the barnyard to get the chore out of the way i want to delay cut as long as i could -- until the dew on the clover should begin -- at least -- to disappear by half-past-seven we be ready for work we roll back we sleeve stand we scythe on end and give they a final lively stone you could hear the brisk sound of the ringing metal peal through the still morning air it be a great day for haying i say a dang good one respond the laconic dick wet he thumb to feel the edge of he scythe i can not convey with any mere pen upon any mere paper the feeling of jauntiness i have at that moment as of conquest and fresh adventure as of great thing to be do in a great world you may say if you like that this exhilaration be due to good health and the exuberance of youth but it be more than that -- far more i can not well express it but it seem as though at that moment dick and i be step out into some vast current of human activity : as though we have the universe itself behind we and the warm regard and approval of all man i stick my whetstone in my hip-pocket bent forward and cut the first short sharp swath in the clover i sweep the mass of tangled green stem into the open space just outside the gate three or four more stroke and dick stop whistle suddenly spat on he hand and with a lively here she go come swing in behind I the clover-cutting have begin at first i think the heat would be utterly unendurable and then with drip face and wet shoulder i forget all about it oh there be something incomparable about such work -- the long steady pull of willing and healthy muscle the mind undisturbed by any disquieting think the feeling of attainment through vigorous effort it be a steady swing and swish swish and swing when dick lead i have a picture of he in my mind 's eye -- he wiry thin leg one heel lift at each step and hold rigid for a single instant a glimpse of pale blue sock above he rusty shoe and three inch of whetstone sticking from he tight hip-pocket it be good to have he there whether he lead or follow at each return to the orchard end of the field we look for and find a gray stone jug in the grass i have bring it up with I fill with cool water from the pump dick have a way of swing it up with one hand rest it in he shoulder turn he head just so and let the water gurgle into he throat i have never be able myself to reach this refinement in the art of drinking from a jug and oh the good feel of a straighten back after two long swath in the broiling sun we would stand a moment in the shade whet we scythe not say much but glad to be there together then we would go at it again with renew energy it be a great thing to have a work companion many time that day dick and i look aside at each other with a curious sense of friendliness -- that sense of friendliness which grow out of common rivalry common difficulty and a common weariness we do not talk much : and that little of trivial matter jim brewster 's mare have a colt on Wednesday this 'll go three ton to the acre or i 'll eat my shirt dick be always about to eat he shirt if some particular prophecy of he do not materialize dang it all say dick the moon 's drawin ' water something be undoubtedly draw it say i wipe my drip face a meadow lark spring up with a song in the adjoining field a few heavy old bumblebee drone in the clover as we cut it and once a frightened rabbit run out dart swiftly under the orchard fence so the long forenoon slip away at time it seem endless and yet we be surprise when we hear the bell from the house -lrb- what a sound it be -rrb- and we leave we cutting in the middle of the field nor wait for another stroke hungry dick i ask hungry exclaimed dick with all the eloquence of a lengthy oration crowd into one word so we drift through the orchard and it be good to see the house with smoke in the kitchen chimney and the shade of the big maple where it rest upon the porch and not far from the maple we could see we friendly pump with the moist board of the well-cover in front of it i can not tell you how good it look as we come in from the hot dry field after you say dick i give my sleeve another roll upward and unbuttoned and turn in the moist collar of my shirt then i stoop over and put my head under the pump spout pump dick say i and dick pump harder dick say i in a strangle voice and dick pump still harder and presently i come up gasp with my head and hair drip with the cool water then i pump for dick gee but that be good say dick harriet come out with clean towel and we dry ourselves and talk together in low voice and feel a delicious sense of coolness we sit down for a moment in the shade of the maple and rest we arm on we knee from the kitchen as we sit there we could hear the engaging sound of preparation and busy voice and the tinkling of dish and agreeable odour ah friend and brother there may not be better moment in life than this so we sit rest thinking of nothing and presently we hear the screen door click and ann spencer 's motherly voice : come in now mr grayson and get you dinner harriet have set the table on the east porch where it be cool and shady dick and i sit down opposite each other and between we there be a great brown bowl of moist brown bean with crispy strip of pork on top and a good steam rise from its depths and a small mountain of baked potato each a little broken to show the snowy white interior and two tower of such new bread as no one on this earth -lrb- or in any other planet so far as i know -rrb- but harriet can make and before we have even begin we dinner in come the ample ann spencer quake with hospitality and bear a platter -- let I here speak of it with the bated breath of a proper respect for i can not even now think of it without a sort of inner thrill -- bear a platter of she most famous fried chicken harriet have sacrifice the promising career of two young rooster upon the altar of this important occasion i may say in pass that ann spencer be more celebrated in we neighborhood by virtue of she genius at frying chicken than aristotle or solomon or socrate or indeed all the big-wig of the past roll into one so we fall to with a silent but none the less fervid enthusiasm harriet hover about we in and out of the kitchen and pour the tea and the buttermilk and ann spencer upon every possible occasion pass the chicken more chicken mr grayson she would inquire in a tone of voice that make you mouth water more chicken dick i would ask more chicken mr grayson he would respond -- and thus we keep up a tenuous but pleasant little joke between we just outside the porch in a thicket of lilac a catbird sing to we while we eat and my dog lay in the shade with he nose on he paw and one eye open just enough to show any stray fly that he be not to be trifle with -- and far away to the north and east one could catch glimpse -- if he have eye for such thing -- of the wide-stretching pleasantness of we countryside i soon see that something mysterious be go on in the kitchen harriet would look significantly at ann spencer and ann spencer who could scarcely contain she overflow smile would look significantly at harriet as for I i sit there with perfect confidence in myself -- in my ultimate capacity as it be whatever happen i be ready for it and the great surprise come at last : a short-cake : a great big red juicy buttery sugary short-cake with raspberry heap up all over it when it come in -- and i be speaking of it in that personal way because it radiate such a effulgence that i can not now remember whether it be harriet or ann spencer who bring it in -- when it come in dick who pretend to be abashed upon such occasion give one swift glance upward and then emit a long low expressive whistle when beethoven find himself throb with undescribable emotion he compose a sonata when keat feel odd thing stir within he he write a ode to a urn but my friend dick quite as evidently on fire with he emotion merely whistle -- and then look around evidently embarrassed lest he should have infringe upon the propriety of that occasion harriet i say you and ann spencer be benefactor of the human race go ` way now say ann spencer shake all over with pleasure and eat you shortcake and after dinner how pleasant it be to stretch at full length for a few minute on the grass in the shade of the maple tree and look up through the dusky thick shadow of the leaf if ever a man feel the blissfulness of complete content it be at such a moment -- every muscle in the body deliciously rest and a peculiar exhilaration animate the mind to quiet thought i have hear talk of the hard work of the hay-field but i never yet know a healthy man who do not recall many moment of exquisite pleasure connect with the hardest and the hottest work i think sometimes that the nearer a man can place himself in the full current of natural thing the happier he be if he can become a part of the universal process and know that he be a part that be happiness all day yesterday i have that deep quiet feeling that i be somehow not work for myself not because i be covetous for money nor drive by fear not surely for fame but somehow that i be a necessary element in the process of the earth i be a primal force i be the indispensable harvester without I the earth could not revolve oh friend there be spiritual value here too for how can a man know god without yield himself fully to the process of god i _ live _ yesterday i play my part i take my place and all hard thing grow simple and all crooked thing seem straight and all road be open and clear before I many time that day i pause and look up from my work know that i have something to be happy for at one o'clock dick and i lag we way unwillingly out to work again -- rusty of muscle with a feeling that the heat would now surely be unendurable and the work impossibly hard the scythe be oddly heavy and hot to the touch and the stone seem hardly to make a sound in the heavy noon air the cow have seek the shady pasture edge the bird be still all the air shake with heat only man must toil it be danged hot say dick conclusively how reluctantly we begin the work and how difficult it seem compare with the task of the morning in half a hour however the reluctance pass away and we be swing as steadily as we do at any time in the forenoon but we say less -- if that be possible -- and make every ounce of energy count i shall not here attempt to chronicle all the event of the afternoon how we finish the mowing of the field and how we go over it swiftly and rake the long windrow into cock or how as the evening begin to fall we turn at last wearily toward the house the day 's work be do dick have stop whistle long before the middle of the afternoon but now as he shoulder he scythe he strike up my fairy fay with some mark of he earlier enthusiasm well dick say i we have have a good day 's work together you bet say dick and i watch he as he go down the lane with a pleasant friendly feeling of companionship we have do great thing together i wonder if you ever feel the joy of utter physical weariness : not exhaustion but weariness i wonder if you have ever sit down as i do last night and feel as though you would like to remain just there always -- without stir a single muscle without speak without think even such a moment be not painful but quite the reverse -- it be supremely pleasant so i sit for a time last evening on my porch the cool still night have fall sweetly after the burning heat of the day i hear all the familiar sound of the night a whippoorwill begin to whistle in the distant thicket harriet come out quietly -- i could see the white of she gown -- and sit near I i hear the occasional sleepy tinkle of a cowbell and the cricket be call a star or two come out in the perfect dark blue of the sky the deep sweet restful night be on i do not know that i say it aloud -- such thing need not be say aloud -- but as i turn almost numbly into the house stumble on my way to bed my whole be seem to cry out : thank god thank god xi a old man today i see uncle richard summer walk in the town road : and can not get he out of my mind i think i never know any one who wear so plainly the garment of detach old age as he one would not now think of call he a farmer any more than one would think of call he a doctor or a lawyer or a justice of the peace no one would think now of call he squire summer though he bear that name with no small credit many year ago he be no longer know as hardworking or able or grasp or rich or wicked : he be just old everything seem to have be strip away from uncle richard except age how well i remember the first time uncle richard summer impressed himself upon my mind it be after the funeral of he old wife now several year ago i see he stand at the open grave with he broad-brimmed feel hat hold at he breast he head be bow and he thin soft white hair stir in the warm breeze i wonder at he quietude after fifty year or more together he nearest companion and friend have go and he do not weep aloud afterward i be again impressed with the same fortitude or quietude i see he walk down the long drive to the main road with all the friend of we neighborhood about he -- and the tree rise full and calm on one side and the still greenery of the cemetery stretch away on the other half way down the drive he turn aside to the fence and all unconscious of the halted procession he pick a handful of the large leaf of the wild grape it be a hot day he take off he hat and put the cool leaf in the crown of it and rejoin the procession it do not seem to I to be the mere forgetfulness of old age nor yet callousness to he own great sorrow it be rather a instinctive return to the immeasurable continuity of the trivial thing of life -- the trivial necessary thing which so often carry we over the greatest tragedy i talk with the scotch preacher afterward about the incident he say that he too marvel at the old man 's calmness have refer to it in he presence uncle richard turn to he and say slowly : i be a old man and i have learn one thing i have learn to accept life since that day i have see uncle richard summer many time walk on the country road with he cane he always look around at I and slowly nod he head but rarely say anything at he age what be there to say that have not already be say he trousers appear a size too large for he he hat set too far down he hand be long and thin upon the head of he cane but he face be tranquil he have come a long way there have be time of tempest and keen wind there have be wild hill in he road and rocky place and threatening voice in the air all that be past now : and he face be tranquil i think we younger people do not often realize how keenly dependent we be upon we contemporary in age we get little understanding and sympathy either above or below they much of the world be a little misty to we a little out of focus uncle richard summer 's contemporary have nearly all go -- mostly long ago : one of the last he old wife at he home -- i have be there often to see he son -- he sit in a large rock chair with a cushion in it and a comfortable high back to lean upon no one else venture to sit in he chair even when he be not there it be not far from the window and when he sit down he can lean he cane against the wall where he can easily reach it again there be a turmoil of youth and life always about he of fevered incoming and excited outgoing of work and laughter and tear and joy and anger he watch it all for he mind be still clear but he do not take side he accept everything refuse nothing or if you like he refuse everything accept nothing he once own the house where he now live with the great barn behind it and the fertile acre spread far on every hand from he chair he can look out through a small window and see the sun on the quiet field he once go out swiftly and strongly he work hotly he come in wearied to sleep now he live in a small room -- and that be more than be really necessary -- and when he walk out he do not inquire who own the land where he tread he let the hot world go by and wait with patience the logic of event often as i have pass he in the road i have wonder as i have be wonder to-day how he must look out upon we all upon we excited coming and going we immense concern over the immeasurably trivial i have wonder not without a pang and a resolution whether i shall ever reach the point where i can let this eager and fascinating world go by without take toll of it xii the celebrity not for many week have i have a more interesting more illuminating and when all be tell a more amusing experience than i have this afternoon since this afternoon the world have seem a more satisfactory place to live in and my own home here the most satisfactory the most central place in all the world i have come to the conclusion that anything may happen here we have have a celebrity in we small midst and the hill as the psalmist might say have lift up they head and the tree have clap they hand together he come here last Tuesday evening and speak at the school house i be not there myself if i have be i should not perhaps have have the adventure which have make this day so livable nor meet the celebrity face to face let I here set down a close secret regard celebrity : _ they can not survive without common people like you and I _ it follow that if we do not pursue a celebrity sooner or later he will pursue we he must it be the law of he be so i wait here very comfortably on my farm and as i work in my field i glance up casually from time to time to see if any celebrity be by chance come up the town road to seek I out oh we be crusty people we farmer sooner or later they all come this way all the warrior and the poet all the philosopher and the prophet and the politician if they do not indeed get time to come before they be dead we have full assurance that they will straggle along afterward clothe neatly in sheepskin or more gorgeously in green buckram with gilt letter whatever the air of pompous importance they may assume as they come back of it all we farmer can see the look of wistful eagerness in they eye they know well enough that they must give we something which we in we commonness regard as valuable enough to exchange for a bushel of we potato or a sack of we white onion no poem that we can enjoy no speech that tickle we no prophecy that thrill we -- neither dinner nor immortality for they and we be hard-headed yankee at we bargaining many a puffed-up celebrity lose he puffiness at we door this afternoon as i come out on my porch after dinner feeling content with myself and all the world i see a man drive we way in a one-horse top-buggy in the country it be we custom first to identify the horse and that give we a sure clue to the identification of the driver this horse plainly do not belong in we neighborhood and plainly as it draw nearer it bear the unmistakable mark of the town livery therefore the driver in all probability be a stranger in these part what stranger be in town who would wish to drive this way the man who occupy the buggy be large and slow-looking he wear a black broad-brimmed feel hat and a black coat a man evidently of some presence and he drive slowly and awkwardly not a agent plainly thus the logic of the country bear fruitage harriet i say call through the open doorway i think the honorable arthur caldwell be come here mercy I exclaim harriet appear in the doorway and as quickly disappear i do not see she of course but i know instinctively that she be slip off she apron move we most celebrated rocking-chair two inch nearer the door and whisk a few invisible particle of dust from the center table every time any one of importance come we way or be distantly likely to come we way harriet resolve herself into a amiable whirlwind of good order subside into placidity at the first sound of a step on the porch as for I i remain in my shirt sleeve sit on my porch rest a moment after my dinner no sir i will positively not go in and get my coat i be a american citizen at home in my house with the sceptre of my dominion -- my favorite daily newspaper -- in my hand let all king queen and other potentate approach and besides though i be really much afraid that the honorable arthur caldwell will not stop at my gate but will pass on towards horace 's i be nurse a somewhat light opinion of mr caldwell when he speak at the school house on Tuesday i do not go to hear he nor be my opinion greatly change by what i learn afterward of the meeting i take both of we weekly county papers this be necessary i add the news of both together divide by two to strike a fair average and then ask horace or charle baxter or the scotch preacher what really happen the republican county paper say of the meeting : the honorable arthur caldwell member of congress who be seek a reelection be accord a most enthusiastic reception by a large and sympathetic audience of the citizen of blandford township on Tuesday evening strangely enough the democratic paper observe exactly the same historic event take this jaundiced view of the matter : arty caldwell republican boss of the sixth district who be out mend he political fence spellbind a handful of he henchman at the school house near blandford cross on Tuesday evening and here be mr caldwell himself member of congress leader of the sixth district favourably mention for governor draw up at my gate deliberately descend from he buggy with dignity stop to take the tie-rein from under the seat carefully tie he horse to my hitching-post i confess i could not help feel a thrill of excitement here be a veritable celebrity come to my house to explain himself i would not have it know of course outside of we select circle of friend but i confess that although i be a pretty independent person -lrb- when i talk -rrb- in reality there be few thing in this world i would rather see than a new person come up the walk to my door we can not of course let the celebrity know it lest they grow intolerable in they top-loftiness but if they must have we we can not well get along without they -- without the color and variety which they lend to a gray world i have spend many a precious moment alone in my field look up the road -lrb- with what wistful casualness -rrb- for some new socrate or mark twain and i have not be wholly disappoint when i have have to content myself with the travel evangelist or the syrian woman who come this way monthly bear she pack of cheap suspenders and blue bandana handkerchief good afternoon mr grayson say the honorable mr caldwell take off he large hat and pause with one foot on my step good afternoon sir i respond will not you come up he sit down in the chair opposite I with a certain measure and altogether impressive dignity i can not say that he be exactly condescending in he manners yet he make I feel that it be no small honor to have so considerable a person sit there on the porch with I at the same time he be outwardly not without a sort of patient deference which be evidently calculate to put I at my ease oh he have all the art of the school politician he know to the last shade just the attitude that he as a great man a leader in congress a dominant force in he party a possible candidate for governor -lrb- and yet always a seeker for the vote of the people -rrb- must observe in approach a free farmer -- like I -- sit at ease in he shirt-sleeve on he own porch take a moment 's rest after dinner it be a perfect thing to see he have evidently hear what be not altogether true that i be a questioner of authority a disturber of the political peace and that -lrb- concretely -rrb- i be oppose he for relection and it be as plain as a pikestaff that he be here to lay down the political law to I he would do it smilingly and patiently but firmly he would use all the leverage of he place he power he personal appearance to crush the presumptuous uprising against he authority i confess my spirit rise at the thought what in this world be more enthralling than the meeting of a unknown adversary upon the open field and joust he a tourney i feel like some modern robin hood face the panoplied authority of the king 's man and what a place and time it be for a combat -- in the quietude of the summer afternoon no sound anywhere break the still warmth and sweetness except the buzz of bee in the clemati at the end of the porch -- and all about the green countryside wood and field and old fence -- and the brown road lead its venturesome way across a distant hill toward the town after explain who he be -- i tell he i have recognize he on sight -- we open with a volley of small shot we pepper one another with harmless comment on the weather and the state of the crop he advance cabbage and i counter with sugar-beets i be quite aware that there be good tactician who deprecate the use of skirmish line and the desultory fire of the musketry of small talk they would advance in grim silence and open at once with the crush fire of they biggest gun but such fighting be not for I i should lose half the joy of the battle and kill off my adversary before i have begin to like he it would not do it would not do at all it be a warm day observe my opponent and i take a sure measure of he fight form i rather like the look of he eye i never see the corn ripen better i observe and let he feel a little of the cunning of the arrangement of my force there be much in the tone of the voice the cut of the word the turn of a phrase i can be you servant with a yes sir or you master with a no sir thus we warm up to one another -- a little at a time -- we mass we force each see the white of he adversary 's eye i can even see my opponent -- with some joy -- trot up he reserve have find the opposition stronger than he at first suppose i hear say mr caldwell finally with a smile intend to be disarm that you be oppose my relection boom the cannon 's opening roar well i reply also smile and not to be outdo in the directness of my thrust i have tell a few of my friend that i think mr gaylord would represent we better in congress than you have do boom the fight be on you be a republican be not you mr grayson it be the inevitable next stroke when he find that i be a doubtful follower of he personally he marshal the authority of the institution which he represent i have vote the republican ticket i say but i confess that recently i have not be able to distinguish republican from democrat -- and i have have my doubt say i whether there be any real republican party leave to vote with i can not well describe the expression on he face nor indeed now that the battle be on horseman footman and big gun shall i attempt to chronicle every stroke and counter-stroke of that great conflict this much be certain : there be something universal and primal about the battle wage this quiet afternoon on my porch between mr caldwell and I it be the primal struggle between the leader and the follower between the representative and the represent and it be a never-ending conflict when the leader gain a small advantage the pendulum of civilization swing toward aristocracy and when the follower begin to think begin to struggle gain a small advantage then the pendulum incline toward democracy and always and always the leader tend to forget that they be only servant and would be master the unending audacity of elect person and always and always there must be a follow bold enough to prick the pretension of the leader and keep they in they place thus through the long still afternoon the battle wage upon my porch harriet come out and meet the honorable mr caldwell and sit and listen and presently go in again without have get half a dozen word into the conversation and the bee buzz and in the meadow the cow begin to come out of the shade to feed in the open land gradually mr caldwell put off he air of condescension he put off he appeal to party authority he even stop argue the tariff and the railroad question gradually he cease to be the great man favourably mention for governor and come down on the ground with I he move he chair up closer to mine he put he hand on my knee for the first time i begin to see what manner of man he be : to find out how much real fight he have in he -lrb- illustration : he move he chair closer to mine -rrb- you do not understand he say what it mean to be down there at washington in a time like this thing clear to you be not clear when you have to meet man in the committee and on the floor of the house who have a contrary view from yours and hold to it just as tenaciously as you do to you view well sir he give I quite a new impression of what a congressman 's job be like of what difficulty and dissension he have to meet at home and what compromise he have to accept when he reach washington do you know i say to he with some enthusiasm i be more than ever convince that farming be good enough for I he throw back he head and laugh uproariously and then move up still closer the trouble with you mr grayson he say be that you be look for a giant intellect to represent you at washington yes i say i be afraid i be well he return they do not happen along every day i would like to see the house of representative full of washington and jefferson and webster and roosevelt but there be a lincoln only once in a century he pause and then add with a sort of wry smile : and any quantity of caldwell that take I i like he for it it be so explanatory the armor of political artifice the symbol of political power have now all drop away from he and we sit there together two plain and friendly human being arrive through stress and struggle at a common understanding he be not a great leader not a statesman at all but plainly a man of determination with a fair measure of intelligence and sincerity he have a human desire to stay in congress for the life evidently pleased he and while he would never be crucify as a prophet i feel -- what i have not feel before in regard to he -- that he be sincerely anxious to serve the best interest of he constituent add to these quality he be a man who be loyal to he friend and not ungenerous to he enemy up to this time he have do most of the talking but now have reach a common basis i lean forward with some eagerness you will not mind i say if i give you my view -- my common country view of the political situation i be sure i do not understand and i do not think my neighbor here understand much about the tariff or the trust or the railroad question -- in detail we get general impression -- and stick to they like grim death -- for we know somehow that we be right generally speak we here in the country work for what we get -- and sometimes put the big apple at the top of the barrel nod mr caldwell and sometimes put too much salt on top of the butter i add -- all that but on the whole we get only what we earn by the hard daily work of plough and plant and reap : you admit that i admit it say mr caldwell and we have get the impression that a good many of the man down in new york and boston and elsewhere through the advantage which the tariff law and other law be give they be get more than they earn -- a lot more and we feel that law must be pass which will prevent all that now i believe that too say mr caldwell very earnestly then we belong to the same party i say i do not know what the name of it be yet but we both belong to it mr caldwell laugh and i 'll appoint you i say my agent in washington to work out the change in the law well i 'll accept the appointment say mr caldwell -- continue very earnestly if you 'll trust to my honesty and not expect too much of I all at once with that we both sit back in we chair and look at each other and laugh with the greatest good humor and common understanding and now say i rise quickly let 's go and get a drink of buttermilk so we walk around the house arm in arm and stop in the shade of the oak tree which stand near the spring-house harriet come out in the whitest of white dress carry a tray with the glass and i open the door of the spring-house and feel the cool air on my face and smell the good smell of butter and milk and cottage cheese and i pass the cool pitcher to harriet and so we drink together there in the shade and talk and laugh i walk down with mr caldwell to the gate he take my arm and say to I : i be glad i come out here and have this talk i feel as though i understand my job better for it let 's organize a new party i say let 's begin with two member you and i and have only one plank in the platform he smile you would have to crowd a good deal into that one plank he say not at all i respond what would you have it i would have it in one sentence i say and something like this : we believe in the passage of legislation which shall prevent any man take from the common store any more than he actually earn mr caldwell throw up he arm mr grayson he say you be a outrageous idealist mr caldwell i say you 'll say one of these day that i be a practical politician \* \* \* \* \* well harriet i say he be get my vote well david say harriet that be what he come for it be a interesting world harriet i say it be indeed say harriet as we stand on the porch we could see at the top of the hill where the town road cross it the slow move buggy and through the open curtain at the back the heavy form of we congressman with he slouch hat set firmly on he big head we may be fool harriet i observe on dogma and doctrine and platform -- but if we can not trust human nature in the long run what hope be there it be man we must work with harriet and woman say harriet and woman of course say i xiii on friendship i come now to the last of these adventure in friendship as i go out -- i hope not for long -- i wish you might follow I to the door and then as we continue to talk quietly i may beguile you all unconsciously to the top of the step or even find you at my side when we reach the gate at the end of the lane i wish you might hate to let I go as i myself hate to go -- and when i reach the top of the hill -lrb- if you wait long enough -rrb- you will see I turn and wave my hand and you will know that i be still relish the joy of we meeting and that i part unwillingly not long ago a friend of mine write a letter ask I a absurdly difficult question -- difficult because so direct and simple what be friendship anyway query this philosophical correspondent the truth be the question come to I with a shock as something quite new for i have spend so much time thinking of my friend that i have scarcely ever stop to reflect upon the abstract quality of friendship my attention be thus call to the subject i fall to thinking of it the other night as i sit by the fire harriet not far away rock and sew and my dog sleep on the rug near I -lrb- he tail stir whenever i make a motion to leave my place -rrb- and whether i would or no my friend come troop into my mind i thought of we neighbor horace the dryly practical and sufficient farmer and of we much loved scotch preacher i thought of the shy bee-man and of he boisterous double the bold bee-man i thought of the old maid and how she talk for all the world like a rabbit run in a furrow -lrb- all on the same line until you startle she out when she slip quickly into the next furrow and go on run as ardently as before -rrb- and i think of john starkweather we rich man and of the life of the girl anna and it be good to think of they all live around I not far away connect with I through darkness and space by a certain mysterious human cord -lrb- oh there be mystery still leave upon this scientific earth -rrb- as i sit there by the fire i tell they over one by one remember with warmth or amusement or concern this or that characteristic thing about each of they it be the next best thing to hear the tramp of foot on my porch to see the door fly open -lrb- let in a gust of the fresh cool air -rrb- to cry a hearty greet to draw up a easy chair to the open fire to watch with eagerness while my friend unwrap -lrb- exclaim all the while of the state of the weather : cold grayson mighty cold -rrb- and finally sit down beside I not too far away the truth be -- my philosophical correspondent -- i can not formulate any theory of friendship which will cover all the condition i know a few thing that friendship be not and a few thing that it be but when i come to generalize upon the abstract quality i be quite at a loss for adequate language friendship it seem to I be like happiness she fly pursuit she be shy and wild and timid and will be best woo by indirection quite unexpectedly sometimes as we pass in the open road she put she hand in ours like a child friendship be neither a formality nor a mode : it be rather a life many and many a time i have see charle baxter at work in he carpentry-shop -- just work or talk in he quiet voice or look around occasionally through he steel-bowed spectacles and i have have the feeling that i should like to go over and sit on the bench near he he literally talk I over i even want to touch he it be not the substance of what we say to one another that make we friend nor yet the manner of say it nor be it what you do or i do nor be it what i give you or you give I nor be it because we chance to belong to the same church or society or party that make we friendly nor be it because we entertain the same view or respond to the same emotion all these thing may serve to bring we nearer together but no one of they can of itself kindle the divine fire of friendship a friend be one with whom we be fond of be when no business be afoot nor any entertainment contemplate a man may well be silent with a friend i do not need to ask the wound person how he feel say the poet i myself become the wound person not all people come to friendship in the same way some possess a veritable genius for intimacy and will be make a dozen friend where i make one we scotch preacher be such a person i never know any man with a gift of intimacy so persuasive as he he be so simple and direct that he cut through the stoniest reserve and strike at once upon those personal thing which with all of we be so far more real than any outward interest good-morning friend i have hear he say to a total stranger and within half a hour they have they head together and be talk of thing which make man cry it be a extraordinary gift as for I i confess it to be a selfish interest or curiosity which cause I to stop almost any man by the way and to take something of what he have -- because it please I to do so i try to pay in coin as good as i get but i recognize it as a lawless procedure for the coin i give -lrb- be such as i myself secretly make -rrb- be for they sometimes only spurious metal while what i get be for I the very treasure of the indy for a lift in my wagon a drink at the door a fly word across my fence i have take argosy of mint wealth especially do i enjoy all travel people i wait for they -lrb- how eagerly -rrb- here on my farm i watch the world drift by in daily tide upon the road flow outward in the morning toward the town and as surely at evening drift back again i look out with a pleasure impossible to convey upon those who come this way from the town : the syrian woman go by in the gray town road with she bright-coloured head-dress and she oil-cloth pack and the old-ironman with he dusty wagon jangle he little bell and the cheerful weazened herb-doctor in he fade hat and the signman with he mouth full of nail -- how they be all marked upon by the town all dust with the rosy bloom of human experience how often in fancy i have pursue they down the valley and watch they until they drift out of sight beyond the hill or how often i have stop they or they -lrb- too willingly -rrb- have stop I -- and we have fence and parry with fine bold word if you should ever come by my farm -- you whoever you be -- take care lest i board you hoist my pirate flag and sail you away to the enchanted isle where i make my rendezvous it be not short of miraculous how with cultivation one 's capacity for friendship increase once i myself have scarcely room in my heart for a single friend who be now so wealthy in friendship it be a phenomenon worthy of consideration by all hardened disbeliever in that which be miraculous upon this earth that when a man 's heart really open to a friend he find there room for two and when he take in the second behold the sky lift and the earth grow wider and he find there room for two more in a curious passage -lrb- which i understand no longer darkly -rrb- old mystical swedenborg tell of he wonderment that the world of spirit -lrb- which he say he visit so familiarly -rrb- should not soon become too small for all the swell host of its ethereal inhabitant and be confront with the discovery that the more angel there be the more heaven to hold they so let it be with we friendship the end end of project gutenberg 's adventure in friendship by david grayson
