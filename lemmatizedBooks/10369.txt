near highflatt four mile from penistone joseph wood have be a yorkshire clothier but relinquish business in the prime of life and spend the rest of he day in assiduous pastoral labor of a kind of which we have few example to attend a monthly meeting he would leave home on foot the seventh-day before with john bottomley also a friend and preacher and at one time he servant for some neighboring meeting he would occupy the evening with social call drop at every house the word of exhortation or comfort the meeting next day would witness he fervent ministry in the afternoon they would proceed

particularly barnsley and dewsbury where at that time many be add to the society on he return home from these service he would spend the day in a upper room without a fire even in the severest weather write a minute account of all that have happen it be in 1803 that joseph wood first have intercourse with joel yeardley 's family under date of the 19th of the fourth month he say speaking of himself and some other concerned friend : -- we feel a inclination to visit joel yeardley 's family who be under convincement and who have lately remove from near handsworth woodhouse we go to breakfast he

sincerity in the man and he wife and the two son appear to be tender and hopeful the next month joseph wood repeat he visit and give a account of the interview in the follow word : -- 5 _ mo _ 1803 -- have ever since i be at joel yeardley 's the last month feel my mind draw to sit with the family and this appear to I to be the right time i set out from home the 14th of the fifth month in company with john bottomley get to joel yeardley 's betwixt four and five o'clock after tea thomas dixon walton and samuel coward of barnsley come to meet we there in the evening we have a precious opportunity together in which caution counsel advice and encouragement flow plentifully suit to the varied state of the family i have a long time therein first from 1 cor xv 58 john bottomley next afterwards i have a pretty long time after which jb be concern in prayer at the break up of the opportunity i have something very encourage to communicate to they son thoma who i believe be a exercise youth to whom my spirit feel very nearly unite joel yeardley unhappily do not long remain faithful to he conviction he not only himself draw back from intercourse with friend but be unwilling he son should leave they work to attend week-day meeting and do all in he power to prevent they this be show by the follow narrative from joseph wood 's memorandum : -- as william wass and i be go to attend a committee at highflatt on we monthly meeting day in the morning we meet with thoma yeardley of blacker near worsbro ' a young man who be under convincement i be a little surprised to see he have on a green singlet and smock frock he burst out into tear i inquire the matter and if something be amiss at home he only reply not much and we not have time to atop proceed and he go forward to my house this be on the 19th of the ninth month 1803 after the monthly meeting be over i have a opportunity to inquire into the cause of he appearance and trouble and find that he be religiously concern to attend weekday meeting which he father be much averse to and in order to procure he liberty he have work almost beyond he ability but all would not do he father plainly tell he that he should quit the house the evening before he apply to he for leave to come to the meeting at highflatt to-day but he refuse and treat he with very rough language however as the concern remain with he he rise early in the morning and get himself ready but he father come and violently pull the clothes off he back and he shirt also and take all he other clothes from he but those we meet he in tell he to get a place immediately for he should not stop in he house be thus strip he go to he work in the stable but not feeling easy without come to meeting he set out as he be not mind he dress so that he might but be favor to get to the meeting this evening we have a opportunity with he in my parlor much to we satisfaction the language of encouragement and consolation flow freely and plentifully towards he through william wass john bottomley and myself and afterwards in conference with he we find liberty to advise he to return home -lrb- he have before thought of procure a place -rrb- believe if he be preserve faithful way would in time be make for he and that it might perhaps be a means of he father 's restoration as at time he say he appear a little different not have wholly lose he love to friend and always behave kindly to they he take we advice kindly and comply therewith after stop two night at my house he return home joseph wood do not suffer much time to elapse before he pay another visit to blacker to comfort the afflict family it be from this visit as we apprehend that john yeardley date he change of heart i be convince he say on one occasion at a meeting which joseph wood have with we family 7 _ mo _ 17 1803 -- thoma walker haigh and william gant accompany we to joel yeardley 's where we tarry all night but the two young man from barnsley return home after supper joel be from home but after tea we have a religious opportunity with the rest of the family in which i have a very long consolatory and encouraging testimony to bear to the deeply-suffering exercise mind from john xvi 33 afterwards i have a pretty long time principally to they son john who i believe be under a precious visitation from on high he be much broken and tendered and i hope this season of remarkable favor will not soon be forget by he on he return home joseph wood write he the follow letter : -- newhouse 10 mo 24 1803 beloved friend john yeardley thou hast often be in my remembrance since i last see thee accompany with a earnest desire that the seed sown may prosper and bring forth fruit in its season to the praise and glory of the great husbandman who i believe be call thee to glory honor immortality and eternal life and o mayest thou be willing in this the day of he power to leave all and follow he who have declare every one who have forsake house or brethren or sister or father or mother or wife or child or land for my name 's sake shall receive a hundred-fold and shall inherit everlasting life not that we should be find want in we duty to we near connexion for true religion do not destroy natural affection but bring and preserve it in its proper place when we earthly parent command one thing and the almighty another it be better for we to obey god than man and herein be we love manifest unto he by we obedience to he command though it may sometimes clash against we parent ' mind at the same time it be we duty to endeavor to convince they that we be willing to obey all they lawful command where they do not interfere with we duty to he who have give we life breath and be and mercifully visit we by he grace i think a remark of this kind appear to be require of I apprehend if thou art faithful unto the lord thou wilt find it to be thy duty at time to leave thy worldly concern to attend religious meeting which may cause thee deep and heavy trial but remember for thy encouragement the promise of the hundred-fold in this world and in that which be to come eternal life thou art favor with a pious though afflict mother and a religiously-exercised elder brother who i doubt not will rejoice to see thee grow in the truth may you all be bless with the blessing of preservation and strengthen to keep you rank in righteousness and may you be a strength and comfort to each other and hold up a standard of truth and righteousness in the neighborhood where you lot be cast do not flinch my beloved friend be not ashamed to become a true follower of christ when little thing be require of thee be faithful thus shalt thou be make ruler over more when greater thing be manifest to be thy duty remember the lord be able to support who declare by the mouth of he prophet formerly mine heritage be unto I as a speckled bird the bird round about be against she but if the lord be on we side it matter little who may be permit to arise against we for he power be above all the combine power of the wicked one and he will bless and preserve those who above all thing be concern to serve he faithfully which that thou mayest be be the sincere desire of thy truly loving and affectionate friend joseph wood the word which have be so fitly speak take deep root in john yeardley 's heart and on the follow new-year 's day he go up to newhouse to converse with he experienced and sympathizing friend on the 1st of the first month 1804 -lrb- write joseph wood -rrb- john yeardley come to my house on purpose to see I he get here betwixt ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon attend we meeting and tarry with we until after tea and then return home he be a hopeful youth tender in spirit and of a sweet natural disposition be convince of the truth in a opportunity i have at he father 's house and i hope be likely to do well i love he much and much desire he preservation growth and establishment upon the everlasting foundation against which the gate of hell be not able to prevail shortly after this we obtain from john yeardley 's own hand a insight into the depth of those religious conviction which have so mercifully be vouchsafe to he the manner in which this interesting memorandum conclude be quaint but it express a resolution to which he be enable to adhere in a remarkable degree throughout the course of he long life for of he it may be say that beyond many he pursuit he aim and he conversation be not of the world but be bound by the line of the gospel and animated by its self-denying spirit _ blacker _ 2 _ mo _ 9 1804 -- as i pursue these earthly enjoyment it please the lord in the riches of he mercy to turn I back in the bloom of my youth and favor I with the overshadow of he love to see the splendid pleasure that so easily detain my precious time he be graciously pleased to call I to the exercise of that important work which must be do in all we heart which appear to I no small cross to my own will and attend with many discouragement yet i be make to believe it be the way wherein i ought to go and i trust thou o lord who hast call will enable I to give up and come forward in perfect obedience to the manifestation of thy divine light so as a thorough change may be work that i may be fit and prepare for a place in thy everlasting kingdom though at time i be lead into great discouragement and almost ready to faint by the way fear i shall never be make conqueror over those potent enemy who so much oppose my happiness o be thou near in these needful time and underneath to bear I up in all the difficulty which it be necessary i should pass through for my further refinement whilst i have a be in this earthly pilgrimage strong be the tie that seem to attach I to the earth but o i have cause to believe from a known sense stronger be the tie of thy overshadow spirit than all the tie of natural affection great and frequent be the trial and temptation and narrow be the way wherein we ought to walk alas too narrow for many o may i ever be preserve faithfully forward to the eternal land of rest dear lord who knowest the secret of all heart thou knowest i be at time under a sense of great weakness but thou who art always wait to gather the tender youth into thy flock and family hast mercifully reach over I with thy gathering arm mayst thou ever be near to strengthen I in every weakness and make I willing to leave all take up my daily cross and follow thee in the denial of self not fear to confess thee before man always give I strength to perform whatsoever thou mayest require at my hand wean my affection more and more attract I nearer to thyself and lead I through this world as a stranger never to be know to it more but by the name of john yeardley in the third month joseph wood again address he young friend by letter encourage he to be steadfast in trial and to beware of the gilded bait of the enemy and promising he that if he follow the lord faithfully he work should appear marvellous in he eye he wonder be disclose to he in the deep and he on he part would be make willing to serve he with a perfect heart in the sixth month again visit blacker he have a precious heart-tendering religious opportunity with all the family about this time joel yeardley be so much reduce in he circumstance as to be oblige to give up farming which compel he son to seek they own means of livelihood thoma and john go into barnsley where they apply themselves to the linen manufacture and be take into the warehouse of thoma dixon walton a friend who afterwards marry a daughter of thoma shillitoe in the first month 1806 joseph wood record another interesting interview with he young friend : -- 1 _ mo _ 7 -- i call on thoma dixon walton and john yeardley with whom i have a religious opportunity in which the language of encouragement flow freely i be open unto they from luke xii 32 fear not little flock for it be you father 's good pleasure to give you the kingdom in the third month of this year john yeardley make application for membership in the society of friend and be admit in the fifth month follow be then twenty year of age he brother thoma have join the society some time before the brother be thus describe by one who know they intimately : -- thoma as a man of homely manners of hearty and genial character and greatly beloved john as possess a native refinement which make it easy for he in after-life to rise in social position but whose reserved habit cause he to be less generally appreciate the call which john yeardley receive and which he so happily obey to leave the world and enter by the strait gate into the kingdom of heaven be accompany as we shall afterwards see more fully by a secret conviction that he would one day have publicly to preach to other the gospel of salvation a sense that such be the case seem to have take hold of joseph wood 's mind in a visit which he make he some time after he admission into the society 1 _ mo _ 29 1808 -- sit with td walton and he wife and he man john yeardley i have two pretty long testimony to bear from colossian iv 17 i have to show the necessity there be for those who have receive a gift in the ministry to be faithful and as satan be as busy about these as any other to be careful to withstand he temptation that nothing might hinder we fulfilment of this gift nor anything be suffer to prevail over we that might hinder its proper effect upon other after thoma be go to breakfast my mind be unexpectedly open in a pretty long encouraging testimony to john from john xxi 22 -- what be that to thee follow thou I have gently to caution he not to look at other to he hurt but faithfully follow he master jesus christ in the way of he leading in 1809 john yeardley married elizabeth dunn she be much older than himself plain in person but full of simplicity and goodness and of a most lovable character like she husband she have come into the society by convincement and like he she have partake in a large degree of the paternal sympathy and oversight of joseph wood she have be a methodist and be one of the first who join with friend at barnsley in the awakening which take place there in the beginning of the century john yeardley and he wife inhabit on they marriage a small house at the southern extremity of the town whither very soon afterwards be transfer the afternoon meeting which it be customary to hold at some friend 's house in barnsley the morning meeting continue to be hold at burton until 1816 when a new meeting-house be build in the town they have only one child a son who die in infancy john yeardley commence he diary in 1811 and this valuable record of he religious experience and of he travels in the service of the gospel be maintain with more or less regularity to the end of he life the motive which induce he to adopt this practice be give in the follow line with which the manuscript commence : -- it may seem a little strange that i should in my present situation attempt to keep any memorandum of the follow kind but feeling desirous simply to pen down a few broken remark as they may at time occur to my mind i apprehend no great harm can arise and if by cause a closer scrutiny into my future step along they should in any degree exercise my mind to spiritual improvement the intended purpose will be fully answer the first entry be date the 6th of the tenth month 1811 : -- _ first-day _ -- have be sweetly refresh at we little meeting this morning i have long feel assure that time call for greater diligence in I than have hitherto be render and when i consider the innumerable favor and privilege which i enjoy at the hand of divine providence beyond many of my fellow-creature and the few return of gratitude i be make it raise in I a inexpressible desire that my few remain day may be dedicate in humble obedience to he whose great and noble cause i be profess to promote how unstable be human nature on sit down in meeting this evening i get into a state of unwatchfulness which continue so long as to deprive I of the refreshment my poor mind so often stand in need of in the entry which follow the progress of the inward work and the preparation for future service be very evident : -- 13_th _ -- go to we morning gathering in a low frame of mind and be make afresh to believe that be we more concerned to dwell nearer the pure principle of truth when out of meeting we should not find such difficult access when thus collect but each one would be encourage to come under the precious influence of that baptize power which would cement and refresh we spirit together o then i firmly believe we heavenly father would in a eminent manner condescend to crown we assembly with the overshadow of he love and enable we not only to roll away the stone but to draw living water as out of the well of salvation 17_th _ -- create in I a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within I be a language which secretly pass my mind in meeting this morning and though inwardly poor as i be yet i dare not but acknowledge it a privilege to be favor even with a good desire 24_th _ -- be a little refreshed at we morning gather my spirit be exercise under a concern that i might not rest satisfied with anything short of live experience and i feel comfort with a lively hope that he whom my soul loveth will not fail to manifest he divine regard to one who be sincerely desirous to become acquaint with he way o how shall i render sufficient thankfulness for such a favor thus to be make once more sweetly to partake of the brook by the way think the evening sit rather dull though the ministry of t s be lively which be a confirm proof that however favor we may be at certain season yet if at any time we suffer we attention to be divert from the real object it frustrate the design of he who i believe intend that we should wait together to renew we strength in the eleventh month henry hull from the unite slate accompany by john hull of uxbridge visit burton and have good service they both amongst friend and with the public they lodge at john yeardley 's and in describe they labor and the pleasure he derive from they society he record he thankfulness at be place in a situation in life such as afford he the opportunity of entertain the lord 's servant he disposition be lively and strongly incline to humor and he early feel the necessity of have this natural trait of character subject to the rule of heavenly wisdom under date 27th of the eleventh month he say : -- i feel a little compunction for have these few day past give way too much to the lightness of my disposition and not be sufficiently concern to seek after that stability and serious reflection which never fail to improve the mind on the 26th of the twelfth month he record a state of spiritual poverty such he say have be the instability of my mind that my beloved be unto I as a fountain seal but he add i feel a little tendered this evening on reading over a few comfortable expression in a letter from my friend joseph wood this condition of mind continue for some month when he thus break forth : -- 3 _ mo _ 8 1812 -- how pleasant it be once more to be favor with a few drop of live water from the spring of that well which my soul have have for many week past to languish after and which i trust have be wisely withhold in order to show I that although it be we indispensable duty to persevere in digging for it yet it be only in he own time that we be permit to drink thereof he just appreciation of the nature of meeting hold for the discipline of the church and of the spirit in which they be to be conduct be show in a early part of the diary 3 _ mo _ 15 -- be at we preparative meeting the query have to be answer i be lead into deep thoughtfulness respect the same and inwardly solicit that the father of mercy would lend he divine aid in the performance of such important duty which i have reason to believe be in some measure answer for they be go through with a degree of ease and comfort to my own mind may i ever keep in remembrance the testimony of he love which be so often manifest 8 _ mo _ 17 -- meeting for discipline at burton the forepart be conduct i think to edification but in the latter one subject occupied much time unnecessarily and do not conclude to general satisfaction when some whose spirit be not well seasoned speak to circumstance which they may not have sufficiently consider it sometimes do more harm than they may at first apprehend the entry in the diary at this time shew many alternation of discouragement and comfort and of that deep search of he own heart from which he seldom shrink and which be the only way to the liberty and peace of the soul 4 _ mo _ 12 -- in contemplate the gracious dealings of the almighty with I from time to time i have be lead to query be it not that i might by patiently submit to the turning and overturning of he most holy hand become fashion to show forth he praise but alas where be the fruit be not the work rather mar as on the wheel can i in sincerity say i be the clay thou art the potter i feel weary of my own negligence for it seem as if the day with I be advance faster than the work i fear lest i should be cast off for want of give greater diligence to make my call sure o may he who be perfect in wisdom strengthen the feeble desire which remain and melt my stubborn will into perfect obedience by the operation of he pure spirit in the next memorandum which we shall transcribe we see when and how he mind be imbue with the love of scriptural inquiry and illustration two or three good book well read and digest in younger life often form the thinking habit of the man and supply no small part of the substance or at any rate the nucleus of he knowledge this show the vast importance of a wise choice of author at the time when the mind be the most susceptible of impression and the most capable of appropriate the food which be present to it those who know john yeardley will recognize the intimate connexion between these early study and the character of he future life and ministry if any should think he language on this or kindred subject mark by excessive caution they must bear in mind the comparative by unintellectual circle in which he move i trust he write under date of 4 mo 28 a few of my leisure hour for two or three week past have be spend profitably in peruse some of a clarke 's note on the book of genesis and although i be fully aware that the greatest caution be necessary when these learn man undertake to exercise they skill on the sacred text yet i be of opinion if use with prudence and a right spirit attend to it may tend considerably to illustrate particular passage i think this pious man have not only show he profound knowledge of the learn language but some of he observation be so pertinent and so judiciously make as may have a tendency to produce spiritual reflection in the mind of the reader 5 _ mo _ 24 -- have read with some attention fleury 's manners of the israelite by a clarke i be convince that even a slight knowledge of those ancient custom tend to facilitate the proper study of the sacred writings for many of the metaphor so beautifully make use of by the prophet and apostle and even we dear redeemer himself to convey a spiritual meaning seem to have have a evident allusion to the antique manners and custom which i find explain in this little volume the commotion refer to in the reflection which follow be no doubt the great european war which be then rage buonaparte it may be remember be at that time make preparation for he russian campaign and a universal alarm prevail as to the final result of he insatiable lust of conquest 5 _ mo _ 7 -- in view the commotion of the time it have induce I seriously to consider the great importance of procure as far as ability may be afford a free access to the never-failing source of we help and in a little contemplate this subject i have be comfort in a hope that if we only abide stedfast and immovable he whom the wave of the sea obey will in he own time speak peace to the mind of he toss one and a calm will ensue the perusal of elizabeth smith 's fragment occasion he to remark how profitable it be to read the writings of other but he wisely add : -- i be often desirous not to rest satisfied with a bare perusal of these believe they be only advantageous to we so far as they stimulate to a closer attention to that inward gift which alone can enable we to witness the same experience it be often a query with I how be i spending this precious time which pass so swiftly away never to return and in order to answer this query aright how desirable it be to dwell with thee sweet solitude to turn inward to examine and correct the defect of we own disorder mind how delightful it be to walk alone and contemplate the beautiful scene of nature yet in these retire moment when view the work of a divine hand spring up to answer the great end for which they be create i be often deeply perplexed with a distressing fear lest i should not be find come forward faithfully to answer the end of he who have create man for the

measure of the spirit of truth 11 _ mo _ 11 -- in take a view of some of the temporal object to which my attention have of late be more particularly turn with a desire to enlarge my idea and improve my understanding in some of the more useful and extended branch of literature it have excite in I a considerable degree of caution lest thereby i should in this my infant state of mind too much exclude the operation of that pure in-speaking word which have undoubtedly a prior right to govern all my action but i have long be convince that the active mind of man must have some object in pursuit to engage its attention when unemployed in the lawful concern of life otherwise it be apt to range at large in a boundless field of unprofitable thought and imagination i be aware that we may be seasonably employ in suitable conversation to mutual advantage and i trust i be not altogether a stranger to the value of _ sweet retirement _ but there be a certain something in every mind which render a change in the exercise of we natural faculty indispensable in order to make we happy in ourselves and useful member of society and it be under these consideration that i be induce to apply a few of my leisure hour towards some degree of intellectual attainment in the humble hope that i may be preserve in that path which will procure at the hand of a wise director that approbation which i greatly desire should mark all my step the next extract from the diary will find a response in the heart of many who read these page 1813 2 _ mo _ 17 -- never surely be any poor creature so weary of

date seem to have be occasion by enter into business on he own account be now about to enter the busy scene of life which sink I into the very depth of humility and fear lest the concern of a earthly nature should deprive I of my heavenly crown which i have so often desire to prefer even to life itself but o should there remain any regard in the breast of the father of mercy for one who feel so unable to cope with the world may he still be please to preserve I in he fear and not only to take I under the shadow of he heavenly wing but make I willing to abide under the guidance of he divine direction 7 _ mo _ 15 -- cause I not to return to the house of jonathan the scribe lest i die there these word of we weep prophet have sensibly affect my heart this morning under a prevail desire that my gracious rather may not permit I to remain as in the prison-house of worldly affair lest i die my spiritual death there we shall see that he be not successful in business and it may be that the disappointment he experience in this way be in some sort a answer to these ardent prayer to be keep from the spirit of the world under date 21_st _ of the first month 1814 he write : i trust the few temporal disappointment i have meet with of late have be conducive to my best interest have have a tendency to turn my view from a too anxious pursuit after the thing of time to a serious consideration of the very great importance of a more strict reliance on the never-failing arm of divine support for the want of which i believe i have suffer unspeakable loss about this time he have frequently to mourn over the difficulty of fix he mind in meeting for worship he often complain of wander in the unprofitable field of vain imagination but sometimes also he bear a joyful testimony to the lord 's power in enable he to unite in spirit with the living worshipper the fear of man be one of the most universal of the besetment which try the faith of the christian and it may be encourage to some to see on this point the confession of one whose natural character be that of a strong and independent mind 2 _ mo _ 6 -- i be too apt to let in that slavish fear about man and thing which render I unable to cope with the world and even unfits I for properly seek after the assistance of my maker o may he who see my weakness enable I to overcome it during the summer of this year several party of friend travel in the work of the ministry come to burton sarah lamley of tredington with ann fairbank of sheffield ann burgess -lrb- afterwards ann jone -rrb- elizabeth coggeshall from new york with mary jeffery of melksham and john kirkham of earl 's colne the labor of these friend be record by john yeardley with delight and thankfulness he accompany john kirkham to sheffield where they find stephen grellett how sweet it be he remark to enjoy the company of these dedicate servant whom they great master seem to be send to and fro to spread righteousness in the earth i often think it have a tendency to help one a little on the way towards the land of promise when i consider these favor i be lead to covet that a double portion of the spirit of the elijah may so rest on the elisha that other may also be raise to fill up the honorable situation of those worthy when they shall be remove from work to reward but of all the above-named the visit of sarah lamley and ann fairbank be for he by far the most memorable and be the means of develop that precious gift of ministry to which he have be call from he youth the extract from he diary which be give below speak of this visit and most instructively describe the time and manner in which he first receive he gift as well as the weight which the approach exercise of it bring upon he mind 5 _ mo _ 27 -- sarah lamley and ann fairbank lodge six night with we and i accompany they to dirtcar and wakefield i can acknowledge they innocent and agreeable company have be truly profitable to I and have unite I very closely to they spirit in tender sympathy 7 _ mo _ 30 -- such a load of exercise prevail over my spirit that it require some extra exertion to support it with my usual cheerfulness of countenance if i go into company i find no satisfaction for i can not appear pleasant in the society of my friend feel it irksome to discourse even on matter of common conversation from the feeling which have attend my mind it be evident that the cloud be at present rest on the tabernacle and i never see more need for I to abide in my tent and o that patience may have its perfect work for there be much to be do in the vineyard of my own heart before i can come to that state of usefulness which i believe the great -lrb- husbandman -rrb- design for I the secret language of my heart be may he hand not spare nor he eye pity until he have subdue all in I which obstruct the progress of he divine work 31_st _ -- i trust i be once more favor in meeting this morning to put up my secret petition in humble sincerity to the shepherd of israel that he would be graciously pleased to help my infirmity in the afternoon meeting i think the petition be measurably answer for towards the conclusion the ray of divine light so overshadow my mind as to induce a belief that i should be assist to overcome that spirit of opposition which have too long exist to the detriment of my best interest if there be only a willingness to abide under the form hand 8 _ mo _ 1 -- i now feel freedom to give a short account how it be with I under this concern from its commencement down to the present time i remember well about the year 1804 when in my father 's house at blacker once be in my chamber in a very serious thoughtful frame of mind receive a impression that if ever i come to receive the truth which i be then convince of to my everlasting benefit i should have publicly to declare of the gracious dealings of divine goodness to my soul the impression pass away with this remark deeply imprinted in my mind that if ever a like concern should come to be mature i should date the first intimation of it from this time i be apt to view it for a long time as the mere workings of the enemy on my mind and when it have come before my view i have often secretly say get thee behind I i will not be tempt with such a thing by these means i put it from I as it be by force not think it worthy of notice and often pray to be deliver from such a gross delusion at other time it would come with such weight on my spirit that i could not avoid shed tear and acknowledge the power which accompany the revival of so important a matter and be lead to query if there be no real intention of a heavenly nature why be i thus harass and o the fervent sincerity in which i desire that the right thing might have place and if it be wrong that i might be enable to find a release in he time who have appoint the conflict and i do believe could i then have come at a perfect resignation to the divine will i might have be bring forward in a way which would have afford permanent relief to my own mind but such be my dislike to the work that i suffer myself to be lull into a state of unbelief as to the rectitude of the concern thus many outward circumstance transpire and some year pass over with my only view the matter at a distance until he who first lay the concern upon I be please to bring it more clearly home to I and seem at time to engage he servant both in public and private to speak very clearly to my condition and although i have a concur testimony in my own mind to they declaration yet i have always a excuse to flee unto by secretly say it may be intend for some one else until the most high be graciously please by the service of he sincere handmaid sarah lamley and ann fairbank in they family visit to friend of barnsley as mention last fifth month to speak so clearly to my situation in they private opportunity with we as to leave no room for excuse but i be force to acknowledge thou art the man indeed sarah lamley be lead in such a extraordinary manner that i have no doubt at all but that she be favor with a clear and fall sense of my state she begin by enumerate the many fear which attend the apostle in they various situation how that satan have desire to have some of they that he might sift they as wheat in a sieve but add she i have pray for thee peter that thy faith fail not and when thou art convert strengthen thy brethren and how it be with mose when the almighty appear to he in a flame of fire in the bush and that it be not until the most high have condescend to answer all mose ' excuse that he be angry with he and even then he condescend to let he have aaron he brother to go with he for a spokesman also how it be with peter when the threefold charge be give he to feed the lamb and the sheep it be not enough say she to acknowledge that we love the lord but there must be a manifesting of we love by do whatsoever he may command methink i still hear she voice say and o that there may not be a plead of excuse moses-like thus be this valuable servant enable to speak to my comfort and encouragement which i trust i shall ever remember to advantage but o that i may be resign to wait the appoint time in watchful humility patience and fear for i find there be a danger of seek too much after outward confirmation and not have the attention sufficiently fix on the great minister of minister who alone be both able and willing to direct the poor mind in this most important concern and in he own time to say arise shine for thy light be come 12 _ mo _ 22 -- my poor mind have be so much envelop in cloud of thick darkness for month past that i have sometimes be ready to conclude i shall never live to see brighter day should even this be the case i humbly hope ever to be preserve from accuse the just judge of the earth of have deal hardly with I but acknowledge to the last that he have in mercy favor I abundantly with a portion of that light which be say to shine brighter and brighter unto the perfect day we shall leave for the next chapter the relation of he first offering in the ministry and conclude this with a striking passage which we find in the diary for this year john yeardley be all he life very fond of the occupation of the garden a small piece of ground be attach to he house at barnsley which he cultivate and from which he be sometimes able to gather spiritual as well as natural fruit under date of the 22nd of the seventh month he write : -- a very sublime idea come suddenly over my mind when in the garden this evening it be introduce as i plucked a strawberry from a border on which i have bestow much cultivation before it would produce anything but now think i this be a little like reap the fruit of my labor as i thus ruminate on the produce of the strawberry-bank i be strike with the thought of endless _ felicity _ and the sweet reward it would produce for all we toil here below my mind be instantly open to such a glorious scene of divine good that i feel a resignation of heart to give up all for the enjoyment of -lrb- such a foretaste -rrb- of _ endless felicity _ chapter ii from he entrance on the ministry in 1815 to he commission to reside in germany in 1820 1815 -- after the long season of depression through which john yeardley pass as describe in the last chapter the new year of 1815 dawn with brightness upon he mind he now at length see he spiritual bond loose and the extract which follow describe he first offering in the ministry in a simple and affect manner 1 _ mo _ 5 -- the subject of the prophet 's go down to the potter 's house open so clearly on my mind in meeting this morning that i think i could almost have publicly declare it but not feeling that weight and certainty which i have apprehend should accompany the performance of such a important act i be afraid of impart that to other which might be intend only for my own instruction and so it have end for the present but i be thankful in hope that i be come a little nearer to that state of resignation which be so beautifully exemplify by we great pattern of all good who when he desire the bitter cup might pass from he nevertheless add not my will but thine be do and if i be at all acquaint with my inward feeling i trust i can in some degree of sincerity say that my heart desire to rejoice more in the progress of this state of happy resignation than at the increase of corn wine or oil he first open he mouth in religious testimony in the first month of this year the occurrence seem to have take place in he own family it yield he a precious sense of the divine presence he begin to preach in public a few month later but not without another struggle against the heavenly impulse the friendship which joseph wood entertain for john yeardley strengthen with revolving year when he visit barnsley he be accustom to lodge at he house and write to he in the year 1811 about a public meeting which he feel concerned to hold he say i can with freedom write to thee feeling that unity with thy spirit which preserve we near and dear to each other and in which freedom run in the fourth month of this year when joseph wood receive a certificate to visit some of the midland county jy feel desirous of set he a little on he way on the 14th he say we go to woodhouse where we have a meeting and my friend be enable to speak very closely to the state of many present when in the meeting i feel a very weighty exercise to attend my mind with a intimation publicly to express it but this exposure i dare not yield to under a apprehension that it might be wrong in I consider the occasion on which i have come out but truly i leave the place under a burden which i be scarcely able to bear it be on the 20th of the fourth month that he begin to speak in public as a minister of the gospel he thus record the event : -- i feel myself in such a resigned frame of mind in we little week-day meeting that i could not doubt the time be fully come for I to be relieve from that state of unspeakable oppression which my poor mind have be hold in for so many year past soon after i take my seat my mind become unusually calm and the presence of the most high seem so to abound in my heart and spread over the meeting that after some inward conflict i be unavoidably constrain publicly to express it in nearly the follow word : i think i have so sensibly feel the precious influence of divine love to overshadow we little gathering that i have be ready to say it be good for we to be here or i might rather say it be good for we to feel ourselves under the precious influence of that protect power which can alone preserve we from the snare of death this first -lrb- public -rrb- act of submission to the divine will be do with as much stability of mind and body as i be capable of and i think the friend present seem sensible of my situation and sympathize with I under the exercise i trust the sweet peace which i afterwards feel be a seal to my belief that i have be favor with divine compassion and approbation in the needful time in the fifth month john yeardley attend for the first time the yearly meeting in london he describe the business as very various and instructive but bewail he own condition as that of one starve in the midst of every good thing it seem at time he say as though satan himself be let loose upon I and permit to try my faith and patience to the utmost but i hope the conflict have its use in teaching I to know that it be not by might nor by power but by the lord 's spirit that we be enable to prevail this be the commencement of another season of spiritual poverty in read a few of he memorandum during this time many a christian traveller may see he own mourning countenance reflect as in a glass 11 _ mo _ 8 -- i have for a long time feel so depressed in spirit and so inwardly strip of every appearance of good that i have often secretly have to say with try job o that i be as in month past as in the day when god preserve I 16_th _ -- death and darkness be still the cover of my poor mind and i be ashamed to acknowledge that i have for month past sit meeting after meet a victim to the baneful consequence of wander thought scarcely be able to recollect myself so much as to ask excuse of he who see in secret in these time of deepest desertion i be selfish enough to feel a longing desire for a ray of light or a smile from the countenance of he under whose banner i have many time sit with the greatest delight in day that be past o how hard it be to regain divine favor when once sacrifice through the sorrowful act of disobedience o may i sit as in dust and ash and with the noble resignation and spirit of a true dedicated follower say i will patiently hear the indignation of the lord because i have sin against he nevertheless even in he time of deepest humiliation moment of heavenly comfort be intersperse 11 _ mo _ 23 -- a more improved meeting than i have reason to hope from cross occurrence which be too apt to ruffle the unstable mind daring we silent sit together i be comfort in contemplate the many encouraging passage we have leave on sacred record two of which speak by one of large experience be particularly solace to my exercise feeling : many be the affliction of the righteous but the lord delivereth he out of they all and the young lion do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the lord shall not want any good thing o think i if we could only procure he on we side who have the thought of all man in he keep what should we have to fear we should then be bring to acknowledge that it behoove a christian traveller to crave the assistance of he who can enable we to suffer with become fortitude and resignation all the afflict dispensation of life rather than desire to be preserve from meet they the hard mutter which be the subject of the next extract embody a difficulty that have perplex many it be always encourage to find companionship in doubt and trial and perhaps the consideration which pacify the mind of john yeardley may be helpful to some who be try in the same way the passage no doubt have reference to he own want of better success in business 11 _ mo _ 30 -- when any circumstance in the common course of life which have appear to turn up in the direction of divine providence have not answer my expectation or on deliberate consideration it have not seem prudent for I to step into it i have sometimes feel greatly discourage and be ready to conclude how could this thing be order under the direction of best wisdom but let I ever remember he who have he way in the whirlwind know what be best for we and be it not for these incitement to a exercise of feel the mind would be apt to lie dormant and not be preserve alive in a proper state to prove all thing and hold fast that which be best about the end of the year he be oblige to spend several day in london on business the course of he affair seem to have be uneven and the great city be probably uncongenial to he retired habit he say : -- 12 _ mo _ 15 -- i do not remember that my feeling be ever more discourage both inwardly and outwardly when the mind be ruffle about the thing of time it be hard work to make any progress towards the land of peace i try to get to the well of water but truly it may be say i have nothing to draw with yet even under these circumstance he daily religious practice -- those which no competitor for the meed of peace and the crown of glory can dispense with -- be not without avail 16_th _ -- in reading and retirement before i leave my room i receive a little hope that i should be preserve in a good degree of patience through the cross occurrence of the day which be measurably the case the life of a christian be very much the history of outward and inward trial how happy it be when these serve only to deepen he experience the nature of john yeardley 's spiritual trial have be fully show : he temporal cross have also be glance at they consist mainly of want of success in business in which indeed he be little fitted to excel under the keen competition of modern time 1816 1 _ mo _ 4 -- a new year have commence but the old affliction be still continue both inwardly and outwardly for even in temporal affair disappointment rage high but o what a privilege to sink down to the anchor-hope of divine support this be what i can feelingly acknowledge this evening to be as a brook by the way to refresh my poor and long-distressed mind o how ardently do i desire that this season of adversity may be sanctify to I for everlasting good and prove the means of slaying that will in I which have too long be oppose to the will of he who pay the ransom for my soul with nothing less than the price of he own precious blood the difficulty of make he way in the commercial world increase until the risk of failure begin to stare he in the face the fear of such a result sink he exceedingly low but through all he be permit to keep he footing upon the rock and to behold a spiritual blessing under the guise of temporal adversity 7_th _ -- surely it be a mark of divine favor to feel the support hand of my heavenly father underneath to bear up my droop spirit in this time of adversity i think i be never more sensible of he powerful arm be make bare for my deliverance and yet unaccountable to tell i be almost afraid to trust in he o my soul wherefore dost thou doubt when thou feelest the glorious presence of thy redeemer 's countenance to shine upon thee in the meeting this morning he continue my mind be profitably exercise in contemplate the follow subject when we dear lord be about to perform the miracle of feed the multitude he command they to sit down upon the grass they be undoubtedly hungry and this might create in they too great a anxiety to be satisfy in they own time but that all thing might be do in order and without interruption they be command to sit down and wait the disposal of they food from the bountiful hand of they great master in look at the subject i think it a lively representation of the state of mind we ought to labor after when favor to feel hunger and thirst after righteousness not frustrate the design of the most high by be too anxious to be fill in we own will and way but patiently wait the time of he who giveth to all they meat in due season and that which be most convenient for they and what greater privilege could we desire than to be feed at the lord 's table 9_th _ -- as my precious wife and i be console each other this evening she remark that the dispensation we be now suffer under be probably in answer to we prayer this bring strikingly to my remembrance a secret petition which i have frequently put up in the most fervent manner i have be capable of when deeply lament my unsubjected will i have even cry out aloud o make I willing do lord make I willing make I willing o then may i submit to the means if for this end they be appoint and resign my all body soul and spirit into the hand of he who give they and may i patiently endure the swell of jordan in a manner that will enable I to bring from the bottom stone of everlasting memorial after this he be lead for a while by the good shepherd into the green pasture and beside the still water 1_st mo _ 15 -- we monthly meeting at wakefield and a heavenly meeting it be 29_th _ -- i leave home for a journey into the north on business i have many precious season of retirement as i ride along and i humbly trust my soul have be enable to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance with she beloved in such a way as will not easily be erase from my remembrance notwithstanding the deep and vary experience he have pass through he unwillingness to expose himself as a preacher of the gospel be still strong and sometimes obstruct the performance of he duty 8 _ mo _ 20 -- joseph wood have a public meeting at pilley i feel something on my spirit to communicate to the people in the early part but think the meeting be not sufficiently settle to receive it i reason away the right time another do not offer during the whole meeting for I to relieve my poor mind so i bring my burden home with I which indeed prove such as i really think i should have sink under the severe stripe as he term it which he receive on this occasion at length produce a willing mind 9 _ mo _ 10 -- i go with my dear wife to attend the burial of my cousin joseph watt at woodhouse and be at the meeting there on fourth-day the 11th it be largely attend by relation and friend i feel so sensibly the danger that some present be in of trifling away the reproof of conviction that i could not forbear revive the language which be proclaim to the prophet jonah when he have flee from the presence of the lord and be fall asleep in the ship what meanest thou o sleeper arise call upon thy god after comment a little on the subject i sit down under great solemnity which seem to cover the meeting and i can thankfully say the fruit of obedience be sweet to my taste 12 _ mo _ 1 -- go to meet this morning with a fearful apprehension lest i should have to expose myself in that which be so contrary to my natural inclination and so it prove for i have not sit long before i be make willing to express what rest weightily on my mind and that be the case of gideon when the angel appear to he under the oak as he thresh wheat i comment a little on the subject which afford I great satisfaction and joy in the follow entry notwithstanding the tardy obedience which it record we find he commission as one of the lord 's watchman seal upon he mind 1817 4 _ mo _ 7 in meeting yesterday morning i be enable publicly to relieve myself of a little matter which have be a burden on my mind for two or three meeting past in which i have feel pretty smartly the rod which be hold over the head of the disobedient in this instance human nature seem stubborn in a double degree but after it be over i feel my peace flow as a river methink i now hear this language proclaim in the secret of my heart : i have make thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore hear the word at my mouth and give they warn from I o what a important charge may i duly consider the weight of it and so watch over my own conduct in think word and action that i may not be pull down with one hand that which i may be endeavor to build up with the other if i be to be a instrument in the hand of the almighty may he graciously condescend to prepare and sharpen the arrow he may see meet to shoot through the medium of he poor servant so that they may sink deep wound the hypocrite and comfort the pure divine life in the heart of he child a few week after this john yeardley attend a remarkable meeting hold by joseph wood in which they be make to sit in heavenly place in christ jesus 4 _ mo _ 29 -- i attend another public meeting appoint by jw at middletown about ten mile from here when i enter the town i feel very flat and be ready to say the fear of the lord be not in this place but after the meeting be gather i soon find what poor creature we be to judge of these thing without wait for best direction for i think it be the most extraordinary time i ever know my friend bear a long and powerful testimony to the tender of many present if i ever forget it while in my natural sens i fear i shall be near lose my habitation the truth for it be as if heaven open and the most high pour down he bless spirit in a unbounded degree all this time he business affair go on more and more adversely and although he never fail punctually to meet all he money engagement he want of success lead in this year to a change of residence to bentham three month before he leave barnsley he write : -- surely there be a vein for the silver and a place for gold where they fine it pecuniary difficulty seem as if they would eat up every green thing but i hope and trust that he who have often say peace be still will so regulate the heat of the furnace that i may be able to bear it with become patience until there be nothing leave in I but what resemble the pure gold fit for the master 's use when i reflect on what my poor mind have pass through for more than two year past i be convinced nothing short of that arm which bring the israelite through the red sea could have support I and o should he ever loose my hand that i may serve he freely may i never forget the many covenant make with he who have so often hear and answer my prayer when in deep distress through the assistance of some of he barnsley friend a offer be make to he of a situation in a flax-spinning mill at bentham which be then or have lately be the property of charle parker a minister in the society of friend he accept the offer and a extract from a letter to he wife when on a journey will show the motive under which he act in this important step hawkshead 6 mo 28 1817 my very precious dear when i write thee last my time and feeling would not permit I to say much on we impending prospect of leave barnsley but since then this very important subject have obtain my most serious and weighty consideration and i be now free to communicate to thee my feeling in order that thou mayest weigh they duly and compare they with thy own while we be separate in the first place in take such a step we must be reconcile to sacrifice we present comfortable home we relation and friend -- in short all that may seem near and dear to we as to the outward with respect to we spiritual prospect i must confess if any service be design for I in the church militant i have sometimes apprehend it might be within the compass of we present particular and monthly meeting but should this be order otherwise in best wisdom i trust i shall be relieve from the oppressive feeling and in a short time see my way clear on the other hand if this change take place we have a probability of a comfortable living and of be relieve from the extreme anxiety attendant on trade when the whole responsibility rest on we own shoulder hr -lrb- one of the firm who have offer to employ he -rrb- seem rather desirous for I to come if we should agree he want I to go over directly to lay down plan for a few weaver ' house and to make other arrangement to save time until we could remove i do not much like the situation of the house in the town but i think another might be have if require they have a nice one in low bentham with a good garden attach which would be at liberty in next fifth month this would be a pleasant walk from the mill by the water-side all the way which might be useful to my health after be confine in the warehouse and much nearer to the meeting it be a very small meeting indeed there be only about two female friend but should we be in the right place the smallness of the number would not preclude we access to the divine spring i do not know how we shall come on with the thread trade but it seem as if we be to be do out with both thread and linen for there be scarcely any thing sell with I on this journey john yeardley and he wife remove to bentham in the eighth month 1817 bentham be a considerable village on the north-west border of yorkshire a few mile from the foot of ingleborough and it be at that time accord to the division of the county adopt by the society of friend comprise in the monthly meeting of settle after a season of deep spiritual poverty during which he find no place for the exercise of he gift john yeardley begin to speak in ministry in the little meeting to which he now belong on record the circumstance he remark : -- thus do a gracious father lead on he child step by step baptize they first into one state and then into another in order to qualify they to drop a word in season for the comfort of other little do i think under the recent buffeting of the enemy that i should ever have have to open my mouth again in the way of declare the everlasting goodness of a gracious redeemer this memorandum be make a few day after the occurrence to which it refer on he return from settle monthly meeting and be accompany the record of a fresh unfold to he mental eye of the need of gospel laborer and of he own vocation to the work in my return i have rather a unusual opening into the state of society and the great want of laborer therein and query with myself by whom shall the lord send i think i feel the weight and power of the everlasting gospel upon I to preach so that i be willing to say here be i send I o the importance of this language may the same spirit which i trust raise it in my heart preserve I in every state to the end of time amen the extract which follow treat of the same subject -- the call and exercise of the ministry from this and from the whole tenor of what have be extract from the diary will be see in what he ministry consist and what be the call and the power which be require in every successive exercise of it may it serve as a word of caution and instruction to such as be dispose to reduce this heavenly gift to a mere effort of christian good-will or to consider the exercise of it as place whether in regard to time or subject at the disposal of the minister it will be observe how john yeardley in after life so abundant in word and doctrine and so catholic in he idea and sympathy receive he vocation as a divine gift immediately from above and serve in it a apprenticeship altogether spiritual and apart from human learning or instruction 10 _ mo _ 26 -- i have be very much instruct to-day in reading and reflect on the 37th chapter of ezekiel when the prophet be ask if the dry bone could live he be wise enough cautiously to answer o lord god thou knowest but when he be command to prophesy unto they and say o ye dry bone hear the word of the lord this be hard work yet there be no confer with flesh and blood no reasoning from probability nothing but a implicit faith and dependence on the divine power which be then upon he could have enable he to do it o what a instructive lesson when the poor instrument may feel so weak and the state of thing so low that there may not be the least probability of good arise it be enough if they can only do the will of they great master and be enable to say with the holy prophet i prophesy as the lord command john yeardley do not take he actual farewell of barnsley until the end of the year the reflection which he have record on leave he home of so many year be very characteristic of the man : -- 1818 1 _ mo _ -- the twelfth month be spend at barnsley in settle my affair just before i leave bentham for that purpose i be exceedingly unhappy at the idea of leave my home friend & c at barnsley and think the parting feeling would be almost more than i could support i be enable to pray fervently to the father of spirit that he would be please to afford I strength to bear the change with christian fortitude and resign all to the disposal of he divine will and thankful i be to relate he so answer my request that i could leave the place to which i have be so long attach without a sigh i have no doubt my removal without consult more of my friend will appear strange to many this i could never feel liberty to do nor could i make any person live acquaint with my entire motive but my precious wife whatever may be the opinion of other this be a matter which rest between I and my god and i often think it a favor that we be not accountable to man who view too much the outside appearance while he with whom we have to do look at the heart after i have leave barnsley i go to pontefract to spend a few day with my friend there where my poor lass have be for a week i do not know that this time be unprofitably spend but this i know -- it never require more care and watchfulness to be preserve in a seasonable frame of spirit than when the mind be set at ease to enjoy the company of a few intimate friend we be too apt to get we thought dissipate and thus we conversation become less seasoned with grace than it would be if the girdle of truth be keep tightly bind the next entry notice a remarkable interview which he have with a woman friend from america : -- 15_th _ -- this day a meeting have be hold at the desire of hannah field from north america i step down to see she at j stordy 's and in the few minute we be together before she take leave she address herself to I in a very feel manner although she be a entire stranger she speak so pointedly to my state of mind and express the reward of faithfulness in such encouraging term that my feeling

service before the joint meeting john yeardley remark on this act of he late monthly meeting : -- the concurrence of my friend with my small offering can not but feel comfortable and encouraging to a poor timorous creature like I but the awful consideration of ranking among the servant who speak in the lord 's name humble I to the dust surely those who be design to minister before the lord in he

be a time when we heavenly father in he tender compassion for we infant state permit we to come to jesus by night or in secret yet when he be pleased to say arise shine for thy light be come and the glory of the lord be rise upon thee danger will betide we if we then flinch from a open confession some time after he have finish a woman friend rise and utter a few word she have never before be able to overcome the force of she natural fear in notice this circumstance jy say he do so because before he go to barnsley he ask that if he small service be acceptable the most high would give he a sign

to a airy disposition 12 _ mo _ 12 -- when i consider the many year which have elapse since i first enlist under the lord 's banner i find cause deeply to reproach myself for want of a more early and implicit obedience to the _ divine will _ the want of which i fully believe have be the means of plunge I into sea of trouble and year of perplexity i fear the time lose will never be redeem o should i ever have to warn other to beware of the rock on which i have split surely it may be do through heartfelt experience indeed and as the glorious light of the sun begin mercifully to verge from under the cloud o may i never never forget the sacred covenant make in the day of my deep distress that if the lord would loosen my bond then would i serve he freely 25_th _ -- i go to thornton to rw 's and next day to lothersdale meeting accompany by dw and some other part of rw 's family the forepart of that meeting be very try at which i do not wonder if we might judge from a previous feeling for ever since the prospect of this little visit present to my view i feel a load on my spirit which i could not by any means cast off on enter the place i think when we dear lord send forth he disciple he command they to take neither purse nor scrip and that if this state of poverty of spirit be any badge of discipleship some of we might claim to wear it the language of the weep prophet come also before I -- o that my head be water and mine eye a fountain of tear that i might weep day and night for the slay of the daughter of my people it be hard work for I a poor stripling to have to intimate such close thing but the conclusion be easier to the natural part i have to address a few to whom the language seem to go forth of mary the master be come and calleth for thee i go from thence to the quarterly meeting at york which be thinly attend the meeting for worship seem a cloudy season however a little matter impressed my mind which i be thankful in be enable to get rid of though hard to flesh and blood it be the first time my voice have be hear in this quarterly meeting in ministry the meeting for business be long and tedious be protracted four and a half day by a appeal it be disagreeable in its nature but be conduct in a way to afford information and instruction to the minute observer of man manners and thing 1820 -- we first extract from this year 's diary contain a short but beautiful reflection : -- 2 _ mo _ 18 -- i be convinced it would be better for we to live more in the inward spirit of prayer we should live in nearer union with the father of love receive more of he heavenly embrace the heart would be prepare to know more of he holy will and receive power to perform it when john yeardley left barnsley he commence a correspondence with he brother thoma which last until the death of the latter jy 's letter have be preserve and supply we with much that be valuable in he character and christian experience the follow extract show the power of sympathy which he possess towards those with whom he be entirely intimate : -- 4 mo 24 1820 thy affectionate letter i receive with pleasure though some part of its contents penetrate the deepest recess of my heart and excite in I every tender sympathetic feeling of a brother and a friend i rejoice that thou hast find freedom to speak so candidly the undisguised language of thy heart to I it seem like a voice from the dead because i conceive it to be the voice of that awaken principle in thee which as in many other may have be hold too long in captivity through the predominance of the surfeiting care of the world whenever thou inclinest to unbosom to I thou mayest do it with freedom and in confidence for be assure if thy complaint can not meet with relief they will at least meet with a welcome reception and a heartfelt condolence for i could have no claim to the least of the christian virtue if i be destitute of a feeling regard for the suffering of a friend and especially a brother a few month afterwards he be again call upon deeply to sympathise with he brother the occasion this time be the perplexity in matter of business in which thoma yeardley be involve he express he feeling in a letter in which he not only give the soundest christian counsel but also show how he be himself indebted to the same maxim for the preservation of he honor and of he spiritual life and usefulness the firm and practical manner in which the subject be treat render he remark of permanent value bentham 8 mo 7 1820 my dear brother thy affectionate letter of the 24th i have receive and need not tell thee how sensibly i be concern for thy present situation i do hope thou wilt not lose sight of the object thou hast now in view to get relieve in some way from the excessive load of business which press upon thee for we can none of we carry fire in we bosom too long without be burn we shall not be justify in the sight of he with whom we have to do if we do not endeavor to place ourselves in such a situation as will best answer the end for which he have design we it would convict we of a very weak and erroneous idea of a supreme be to suppose that he could not or would not prosper we endeavor with equal success in a more restricted way of trade when we motive be purely to serve he faithfully surely he who care for the sparrow will not suffer _ we _ to fall to the ground without he notice thou wilt be ready to say it be a easy matter to speak of these thing on paper but believe I my dear brother i know a little of what i say there be a time when i be as extensively engage in business _ accord to my means _ as you be now i have have large sum of acceptance to provide for with nothing towards they but what be in the uncertainty of the draper ' hand when i have set out on a journey i have have to take the distressing fear along with I that if i fail of get in almost every shilling that be due to I i fail in pay my acceptance add to this the painful prospect of lose my property until i could not pay my just debt and then mention a situation which would place a honest mind in a greater degree of perplexity o have it not be for the preserve hand of my gracious redeemer i have never lift up my head above the water which be ready to overwhelm I in the midst of all this i receive a firm conviction that if i wind up as speedily as circumstance would admit i should measurably be safe but if i suffer the impression to pass away disregard i might be hurl along with the stream and never more be able to recover myself it seem as if my eye be fix on a star which shine quite on the other side of the -lrb- water -rrb- and i be thus enable to wade through without know what course to take when i get to the other side i do not mention this as be in the whole applicable to thy case but as a fellow christian traveller towards the celestial city i earnestly intreat thee in the love of the gospel never to consider thyself on a level or at liberty to act in full scope with the man of business who think himself create to pursue the thing of time without be responsible to he creator for endeavor to reach a situation in life which would enable he to prepare for eternity thou wilt not be long at a loss what to do if thou dost not overlook the secret motive in thy own breast do not grieve at lose a little of what thou hast it will come again if for the best and may bring the double reward of peace if thou attendest to that direct hand which have hitherto preserved thee as a monument of thy heavenly father 's mercy thy victory be already sure though thou mayst not know it it be not for the test consequently not permit that we should always see we way be this the case there would be no exercise of faith the servant of the prophet be blind as to the power which preserve they when he see a host of the enemy encamp against they : he cry out alas my master how shall we do but he master answer fear not for they that be with we be more than they that be with they and the prophet pray that the young man might be make to see and when he eye be open what do he see why he see the mountain full of horse and chariot of fire round about they the lord 's choose people be continually encircle with these chariot of fire otherwise it would not be possible to be so mercifully preserve from harm should it be insinuate to thee that thou art not of this choose race let I tell thee we become child of the most high as soon as he have raise in we a desire to serve he and we become willing to abide under he protect wing whatever change may take place in we own feeling during the operation of he holy hand upon we nothing be more important in the life of a christian than the manner in which he turn to account the opportunity for serve he lord which continually spring up before he 6 _ mo _ 23 -- go last evening to wenington to repeat my french lesson my friend there ask I to call with they on a sick person feeling quite free to do so i go with they on sit quietly by the bedside a little matter come before I which be communicate from these word : affliction cometh not forth of the dust on my return home i could not but reflect on the necessity of have we bow strung and be always alive to the interest of soul and endeavor to imitate the example of we great master whose whole life be employ in continually go up and down do good chapter iii from he commission to reside abroad in 1820 to he removal to germany in 1822 in 1822 john yeardley go to reside in germany as he residence abroad constitute one of the most remarkable turn in he life and exercise a powerful influence on the rest of he career we shall develop as fully as we be able the motive by which he be induce to leave he native country by means of he diary we can trace the early appearance and growth if not the origin of the strong christian sympathy he ever afterwards manifest with seek soul in the nation on the continent of europe and especially amongst the german people the first hint concern he desire to go abroad be contain in the account of a dream under date of the 2nd of the ninth month 1818 regard which he feel much disappointed because he could not recollect the name of the place in germany about which he have in he dream be interested the next year -lrb- the 19th of the fifth month -rrb- he have a second dream on the same subject in which he suppose he friend joseph wood be about to go on a religious mission to the continent and he bring out he atla to find the place for he on be ask if he mean to accompany he he say he be not prepare to answer at present in the relation of a third dream which he have the next year -lrb- the 25th of the eighth month 1820 -rrb- the locality to which he mind be attract be first indicate pyrmont and minden he say rest very closely with I and to they i feel bind it might not have be worth while to have make allusion to these dream which ought perhaps to be rather as the continuation or echo of he thought than as they original source but for the deep importance which john yeardley himself attach to they he consider that by they be first make know to he the divine will respect he future course and that he longing desire to recover the name of the forget locality of the first dream be answer in the last it can admit of little doubt that the same conviction of they more than common significance which lead he to cherish as sacred the remembrance of these night-vision help to form and sustain he resolution in carry out the project with which he connect they just before the occurrence of the last dream he faith in the heavenly source of the invitation which whether waking or sleep he have receive to go over and help he christian brethren on the continent be confirm by a prophetic message from john kirkham who in the course of he religious travels again visit yorkshire 8 _ mo _ -- we dear friend john kirkham from earl 's colne essex sleep at we house on second-day the 7th and have a meeting with we few on third-day how wonderfully be he enlarged and i could not but admire how he be favor to speak to the state of some present i could set my seal to every word he utter and say this be the very truth before he leave we he have a select opportunity in we family and say a great deal stout be faithful to we own vision he seem to answer a question in my mind as fully as i have any right to expect for i have almost ask it as a sign that if i be not deceive in my vision he should be lead to speak on the subject he say emphatically we can not be faithful to the vision of another man we do not know it except it be reveal to we but we must be faithful to we own vision on the 9th i accompany he to the monthly meeting at settle and i once more desire that if my feeling in former time have not deceive I this servant of the lord might be lead to speak on the same subject and indeed he scarcely say anything else but what have the strongest bearing on my request what encouraging favor do i receive at the hand of so good a master a few month later we find the charge to foreign labor renew with intimation of the wide field in which he would have to work a intimation which be amply verify in he future travels 11 _ mo _ 26 -- at meeting something involuntarily enter my mind like this i will make thee a preacher of righteousness to many nation i feel not

portion of he thought 12 _ mo _ 3 _ first-day _ -- as i walk alone to the meeting this morning i think within myself what can be the cause that i so often feel draw in spirit towards the land of -- my thought have now for a long time past so frequently and so involuntarily revolve on the subject that i begin to be very jealous over they and to query whether it be the workings of self-imagination if this be the case o that i may be relieve from they but however unaccountable my feeling may be a secret love towards some unknown soul in -- be so strong at time that if i have wing i should for my own inward peace visit they in body as i now do in spirit it seem as if my spiritual eye saw in those part what we may call a seed -lrb- the seed of the kingdom sown in the heart -rrb- that want to take root downward and spring upward but which be almost choke with the tare of superstition be there not scatter up and down in -- many whose soul be verge from under the cloud of thick darkness and from under the bond of idolatrous superstition towards that glorious liberty which be bring to light by the gospel something in I secretly crave a opportunity to tell those precious creature that the time appear near at hand when this glorious gospel light will shine so clearly that they will discover a savior in the secret of they own heart and it be to he -lrb- i could tell they -rrb- that they must look for the perfection of they salvation should there be anything of the right savor in my heart concern this matter i humbly hope that in due time it will be bring to maturity and my way make plain and easy -- _ plain _ so that i can not possibly mistake the point hand of divine wisdom and _ easy _ so that when i hear the command i may be enable to obey a very instructive time at meet the subject abovementioned glance in my view and with it the dover-failing objection if i be at all apt to teach can it or will it be require of I to leave those here and other in this land who have need of instruction this objection be immediately answer in a way which i never before experienced they have besides many teacher the unerring light of jesus in they own heart unto which they know they ought alone to look for direction and if they neglect or overlook the means in themselves it be not in my power a poor instrument to do they any good so it may be say of other to whom i may apprehend myself call it all revolve on this single and important point -- what be the _ divine will _ concern I if i can only know this and be enable to do it all will be well in the autumn he attend liverpool

poor low season if there be any good i be too much like the heath in the desert -- i know not when it come in addition to this it feel as if i have to mourn over the barren state of some other o how i dread the state of a lukewarm quaker may i ever be preserve from this sorrowful state of a lukewarm quaker i believe it be often the means of bring a damp over we solemn assembly 12 _ mo _ 7 -- _ query _ what be the most likely means for I to adopt to approach nearer to holiness _ answer _ to spend more time in retirement silently to wait upon god the more conversant i be with he the more i shall know of he will and receive power to do the same to do the will of the almighty be the way to perfect holiness the nearer acquaintance we cultivate with he the stronger will become the tie of he affection the more devoted we be to he the more confidence will he repose in we catch then a glimpse of the glorious calling of the gospel minister he break forth in the follow strain : -- if i be ambitious in anything on earth it be to be eminently useful in he cause i can say with the wise man i ask neither riches nor honor except the honor which cometh from do the will of god but i do ask for a understanding heart i trust i can say in the deepest sincerity that i could renounce if they be in my power the riches and honor of ten thousand earthly world in purchase of a double portion of that holy unction which rest on elisha 's spirit these be bold saying but my savior tell I that as there be no limitation to he goodness to grant so there be no limitation in ask of he for the gift of he holy spirit but then what manner of man ought this to be on whom shall be confer such great honor surely it must be leave to himself to prepare the vessel before he pour in the oil we have already make a extract from the diary of the 3rd of the twelfth month in connection with john yeardley 's call to visit germany the same diary supplies we with the description of a spiritual opening for the benefit of other with which he be favor in the same meeting in my minute for first-day last i mention its be a instructive meeting to I towards the conclusion a simile of this kind arise and spread before my view : as wax when melt by the fire or the candle be then only capable of receive the impression of the stamp put upon it so also be we mind only capable of receive impression of divine good when we spirit be melt and contrit before the lord as these season be not at we command it appear to I to be of the highest importance for we to endeavor to preserve and improve they as the best means of testify we gratitude to the great donor the impression which the above contemplation make on my spirit prove like a morsel of bread to my soul which i find i could not conceal though i struggle hard to eat it alone it seem so insignificant to hand to other but at length i give up and feel it to be a time wherein some among the few present be melt as wax before the fire and have a portion of divine goodness afresh imprint on they mind and my spirit crave that they might not prove as the morning cloud and as the early dew that goeth away on the 7th of the twelfth month elizabeth yeardley

retirement she have long desire and which she take the most scrupulous care to improve when in health she would tell I of late that perhaps she might be take away in order to set I more fully at liberty to do the lord 's work 11 _ mo _ 18 -- this day two week be the solemn ceremony of commit to the silent dust the remains of my very precious and dearly beloved elizabeth i have dread the day very much but through prayer mix with a degree of faith which be mercifully grant i be wonderfully support in the meeting i feel the divine influence so near and so to prevail over my spirit that i be constrain publicly to thank the father of mercy for he goodness this day i visit perhaps for the last time the place which enclose the cold relic of one so dearly beloved and as i stand weep over the

friend and a minister well approve by the church before we pursue further the sequence of event two passage from the diary may be here transcribe which could not have be insert in the order of time without interrupt the narrative the first of these convey a lesson of practical wisdom and exhibit the method by which the writer be able to succeed and to excel in what he undertake it be the true comprehension and resolute act upon maxim such as these which make so much of the difference between one man and another 1821 7 _ mo _ 2 -- no man can excel in everything therefore it be highly important for each mind to consider attentively for what it be calculate and what end it be design to answer by he who create it as secular affair be often more expedite by a judicious arrangement than by hard do indiscriminately at the mass so will undertaking of superior importance be more advantageously attain by keep a single eye and look for best direction to make a proper selection of what ought to be do and what ought not to be do i be long too much wavering on this head to my great loss but i now hope it be become a settled point find i have clearly see for what service i be design in the church militant here on earth therefore through the assistance of divine grace i hope to pursue nothing but in subordination to this main design for a little mind to aim at great thing would be to thwart the whole but to endeavor to be faithful in small thing seem to be the way to attain the end from the other entry we shall extract only a few word but they be word fraught with deep instruction : -- 9 _ mo _ 7 -- without holiness no man shall see the lord without purity of heart we can not see the point of the divine finger on the 18th of the second month john yeardley attend

follow he and not look on other he be lead we into the pure green ever green pasture of humiliation where the sheep of he pasture love to lie i own the road be not very pleasant the descent be rugged and many time the poor traveller be ashamed of be see hobble down by he former acquaintance but when once within the sacred enclosure the sweet air that breathe humility hush all stormy passion to rest i read and read again of all those holy folk be divest of self and anxiously do i desire to be so too but by the mark they lay down i be very far from that attainment however he who say let there

we dear savior more necessary for myself than at the present time be ye wise as serpent and harmless as dove soon after this he have a return of he complaint in the stomach which cause he to exclaim -- we be indeed but dust and ash how quickly the slender thread may be cut and reduce this frail tabernacle to that state of earthly composition from which it be form but the spiritual part in we must have a abide somewhere _ for ever _ this be the awful consideration which ought continually to affect we heart be it not a strange infatuation to rank the moment of affliction among the evil event of we life when these may prove the very mean of bring back we wander foot to the path which lead to everlasting life he then review he own situation he call and he work it be often the consideration of my heart what have bring I into this country what have i do what be i do and what have i to do the enemy be not want to distress my poor mind on the point of these four important query but to the first i can answer a humble submission to what i believe to be the leading of divine wisdom to the second through the assistance of never-failing love i have do what i could and have find peace to the third i be desirous through divine aid to do what i can and to the fourth which refer to the future i must commit it into the hand of the judge of the whole earth who alone be able to guide my foot in the sure path i feel in the present moment desirous to keep eternity continually before my view and to let outward thing hang more fully on the dependence of he who suffer not a sparrow to fall to the ground without he notice -lrb- 11 _ mo _ 30 -rrb- 12 _ mo _ 1 -- the reading meeting this evening have be a precious time we spirit have be much tender in read some account of the life and death of we worthy friend record in sewel 's history tear so overpower the reader and the hearer that the reading be at time oblige to be suspend until we have give relief to we feeling in addition to this meeting john yeardley established another for the young to be hold on fourth-day evening in which they might improve themselves in reading and acquire a knowledge of the principle of the society with other branch of useful information the young woman be to bring they work and it be he delight to interrupt the reading with religious instruction and such remark as a father make for the improvement and gratification of he child we see he here for the first time in a character in which he be well know to the present generation in various part of england viz as a instructor and guide of the youth in notice in he diary the formation of the youth ' meeting at pyrmont he comment with pleasure on the innocent cheerful manners of he audience and on the advantage which might be look for from this kind of social intercourse the last entry in this year record a occasion of near approach to the throne of grace in prayer in the little congregation at pyrmont 12 _ mo _ 29 _ first-day _ -- a most remarkable season of divine favor in we evening assembly the awe which i have feel over my spirit the whole of the day and not feeling freedom to break my mind in the meeting in the morning induce I to look to the evening opportunity with fear and tremble which indeed be always the case when i feel the master 's hand upon I the most solemn act of worship that of public supplication so powerfully impressed my mind that i believe it right to yield to the motion which i humbly trust be do in due reverence and humility of soul we spirit be so humble under feeling of good that it seem as if the secret of all heart be present before the throne of grace to ask forgiveness for former transgression strength to serve the most high with more acceptance and to be finally prepare to reign with he in glory o how these season of refresh will rise up against we in the great day of account if we be not concern to improve by they grant dearest father that i may experience a nearer and stronger tie to do thy will more perfectly and let it please thee to remember those in this place and this land for whom my spirit so often secretly mourn and pray the diary of 1823 open with a profound and solemn reflection 1823 1 _ mo _ 4 -- for want of faith we be too much inclined to serve ourselves before we be willing to serve the great master think we may be able to do much for he afterwards when it will more accord with we situation in life but alas this time may never come if we thus put by the _ acceptable season _ we life may close with we only have perform very imperfectly the part which have be design for we in the church militant painful would be the sting when appeal to the judge of the earth in a moment when we no longer possess the capability of serve he should the declaration be thou hadst a desire to serve I when in health and strength but thou wish _ first _ to _ serve thyself _ my time be not then thy time therefore _ thy time _ be not now _ my time _ a letter to he brother write in the summer of this year -lrb- 6 mo 9 -rrb- give a description of the mode of bleaching in use in germany which will we believe be interesting to the english reader john yeardley say : wilt thou not be surprise when i tell thee that i be about to commence yarn-bleaching thou mayst be sure there be a pretty certain prospect of considerable advantage with not much risk to induce I to make the attempt the advantage be threefold -- safety expedition and cheapness the first consist in the simplicity of treatment and safety of the ingredient no chemical process be make use of the second arise from the heat of the climate the last be easily account for from the low price of labor and the cheapness of the raw material which be produce in abundance in the neighborhood in the country around for a very considerable distance almost every family make they own linen they grow or buy the flax spin the yarn and get it weave and either bleach it themselves or send it to other who have better convenience in water & c as the spring commence i notice these little bleaching-plots wherever i go and often wonder that the color be so good know that such people could not possibly be at any great expense or risk in the operation i conclude it must be do by dint of time and labor supposing that the yarn and cloth must lie at least a few month on the grass but on inquiry i be surprise to find it be make quite white in three week or a month to make a further proof i send two bundle of yarn to two different place to bleach it be now return of a very good color and perfectly strong though it have be in blench only a month and two or three day and although the greater part of the fifth month have be unfavorable for bleaching as to any risk of the yarn be tender it be quite out of the question it seem to be do by the operation that nature point out i have find a very convenient place for the purpose of make trial there be plenty of good clear water there be a prospect of have honest workpeople and at very reasonable wages -- not more than 6_d _ or 8_d _ a day there be many honest creature to be have at these wages who have nothing in the world to do from the first of my leave england i have no expectation of be liberate from this country before the expiration of about four year and i have always be desirous that something should turn up that would afford I support by suitable employment so that what i have now in view do not seem to clash with my former prospects it be -lrb- he add with affectionate feeling -rrb- a source of great consolation that i can always unbosom my mind so freely to thee and i consider it among the greatest blessing i enjoy that thou hast never yet fail of be make a instrument of support to I and my prayer be that thou mayst never lose thy reward pyrmont be one of the oldest watering-place north of the alp the inhabitant be very much dependent on the visitor who resort thither during the three summer month and amongst whom may frequently be reckon some of the first family in europe this year 1823 the prince and princess of prussium -lrb- the present regent of prussium and he consort -rrb- be there and one fourth-day morning attend the friend ' meeting the meeting-house stand in one of the _ allées _ and although its position be not central it be sufficiently public to be a object of attraction to the curiosity of stranger a memorandum under date of the 18th of the sixth month record the royal visit and john yeardley 's spiritual exercise on the occasion 6 _ mo _ 18 -- to-day the young prince and princess of prussium with the princess they mother and the hofmeister have be at we fourth-day meeting they enter with such seriousness on they countenance that i feel my spirit suddenly draw towards they in love and a secret prayer be raise in my heart for they everlasting good feeling the influence of divine love to increase i believe it right to kneel down and in brokenness of spirit i express what have open on my mind which afford I peace and i hope good to other be impart although i may say through the unworthiest of instrument for truly i have for some time be as in a state of death and darkness owing to my unwatchfulness o what would i give for more circumspection that i might be more prepared to receive the _ word _ and when command be give publish the same but unworthy creature i often deprive myself and other of season of good through my negligence and barrenness when will the time come when i can say all earthly thing be under my foot and the cause of religion and virtue rule predominant in my heart lord hasten the day and preserve my foot in thy path in the midst of many snare and rather let I die than be suffer to do anything which would dishonor thy gracious and holy name and the profession i be make of thee before the world loose my band and enable I to say in sincerity of heart i be willing to serve thee freely with the cause for self-condemnation which be allude to in this entry be no doubt connect the neglect to keep up he diary no entry occur for more than five month previous it be probably much more difficult in the position which he occupy in germany to maintain a spirit of watchfulness and self-recollection than among he more experienced friend in yorkshire there be a allusion to this in a entry of a little later date 7 _ mo _ 8 -- my mind feel a little more gather than it have be for some time past but the little outward difficulty which be continually arise have a great tendency to disperse the best feeling i think it be almost the greatest lesson that we have to learn to stand so fast in time of trouble as not to suffer loss if we would so conduct ourselves that the change of time and season should not have such a unfavorable influence on we mind this would be one great point gain it would enable we to meet the difficulty of the day in a better state to combat with they but if daily trial abound of a nature the most likely to retard he spiritual progress we shall see that he who have appoint he lot provide in he faithfulness the needful corrective and by the discipline of filial fear in the ministry of the word keep he safe in he sanctuary the attendance of visitor at the meeting-house be often numerous although it be seldom that they remain during the whole time of worship meeting of this kind be very try to john yeardley 's faith and feeling but sometimes they be season of heavenly blessing such abundantly to make amends for past humiliation 7 _ mo _ 6 -- to-day the small meeting-house and passage be quite fill with stranger and i be tell many go away who could not get in and some remain under the window no creature on earth know what my poor mind suffer when i go to meeting under such circumstance many whom curiosity bring in the expectation to hear word may some time be disappoint but i hope there be some whose intention be sincere and who be desirous to be inform the way to zion i hope strength be afford I to preach christ crucify o that the lord may support I in these very try season and take from I the fear of man and fill my heart with a holy fear of offend he whom i humbly trust i be desirous of choose to be my lord and master 7 _ mo _ 27 -- bless the lord o my soul and all that be within I bless he holy name notwithstanding my many season of poverty and inward distress the foregoing language be sometimes put into my heart on my return from we meeting which be in the bathing season almost always crowd with stranger they manner of come in and go out during the time of worship be exceedingly disturbing and yet i can not but admire the stillness which prevail when anything be deliver the help which i at time experience in these try season be wonderful in my eye when i be concern to stand up in he dread and fear what have i else to fear this fear would always cast out the fear of man which ever bring death and yet so weak be i that after all these precious help and comforting time i tremble when the meeting-day come again lest i should fail in do the lord 's will such be my fear before i can rise to my foot in meeting that i say with samson be with I this once more that i may bear testimony to thy name then if it be thy will let I die for thee and i will not think it too much to suffer o that he would be please to enlarge he gift in my heart and he unto I mouth and wisdom and give I tongue and utterance to declare he name unto the nation 7 _ mo _ 30 -- we fourth-day meeting to-day have be a precious heavenly season much more weightiness of spirit appear to exist in the stranger who attend and consequently more stillness i have not long take my seat before i believe it right to stand up with the word of the apostle awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god : i speak this to you shame the woman 's side be nearly full of richly-clad female they bear the mark of worldly distinction and be indeed as fine as hand and pin could make they but the tendering of divine love reach the heart of some among they in a particular degree i feel such a nearness of spirit towards they that i have great openness in speaking of the thing which come before I after meet they very willingly accept of some book one of they be much reach and go into the little plantation to weep another go to she to comfort she but she reply go from I and leave I alone we may truly say with the apostle that god be no respecter of person but those who fear he and work righteousness will be accept of he to whatever nation kindred tongue or people they may belong all distinction of religious sect and party spirit be lay aside when we heart become prepare to embrace each other in true christian love i do believe the lord 's work be begin in the heart of many in this land and the fervent prayer of my spirit be that he may be please to carry it on to perfection and that we may live to see the glorious day when righteousness shall cover the earth as the water cover the channel of the sea o germany germany what do my heart feel on account of thy inhabitant it seem as if i could tread thy soil for the remainder of my day if i could only be make the instrument of help on they way those scatter one who be athirst for the sincere milk of the word of life one of the female who visit we meeting come to the school room on seventh-day and request the favor of have a few book to peruse and circulate she say she be from osnabrück and that there be a number of people in that place who have a great love to the friend of we society such opportunity afford the means of circulate a knowledge of the truth to those whose heart may be prepare to receive it and if such be only awaken to seek after the way of holiness although they may never come to be of we number on earth they will he find among the number of the saint in heaven the bathing-list this season already amount to 2500 person in which number there be many who be desirous to inquire the way to zion it be much to be desire that the peculiar advantage which pyrmont afford for spread in the different part of the continent book illustrative of we religious principle should be judiciously embrace particularly as there appear such a openness to receive they i can truly say i have be thankful that my lot have be here this summer and i trust i have not flinch from do what i believe to be require of I in he letter to he brother john yeardley make frequent mention of he mother in the ninth month he hear of she be seriously ill and he thus write in reference to she state in a letter elate the 29th of the ninth month : -- the state of my dear mother 's health be truly alarming but as i have receive no further account from thee i be flattering my poor panting heart with a comfortable hope that she may have take a turn for the better and will yet live to see the hour when we shall once more embrace each other in my native land if she should be take away without my be permit to see she again it would be a cup which i could not tell how to drink this bring poignantly to my remembrance one of the most try hour of my life and yet the support then receive be wonderful as i ride along the road in the course of this summer on a journey of business my dear mother be bring to my remembrance in such a very remarkable manner that i seem to have a spiritual interview with she and she be bring so near to my feeling that i think it probable i should never see she again until we meet in eternity i scarcely know how i feel but it be as if my spirit accompany hers into the region above i note down the circumstance when i get home for it have make such a impression on my mind that i should not then have be surprise to have hear of she departure -lrb- 1 -rrb- the follow instructive remark occur in the diary about this time : -- 10 _ mo _ 27 -- my retirement and reading this morning have be more tender to my spirit than for a long time past i read and consider the institution of the passover when the israelite be lead out of egypt and it appear clear to I that the sprinkle the door-post with the blood of the lamb as command be a type of we savior 's blood which be shed for we transgression and that we must be save by he become we paschal lamb as the destroy angel only pass over the door and preserve those who have receive the mark so can we only be save by be willing to apply the blood of we dear savior to wash and cleanse we from we sin what a beauty there be in the connection of scripture truth when we read they with a simple heart prepare to receive the right impression which may be open the friend of minden and the little company of awaken people at eidinghausen who on

and not to jump -lrb- we he express it -rrb- out of one thing into another this would be the means of establish they credit as man of business 11 _ mo _ 7 -- sarah grubb mention -lrb- 2 -rrb- that when she visit minden she meet with great kindness and attention from a councillor of the place who on they leave accompany they a little way out of the town to a inn where he have provide coffee and have invite a few of he friend to take leave of they this be at the house of my worthy host -lrb- frederick schmidt -rrb- who then keep the inn at kuckuk and have for some time be under deep -lrb- religious -rrb- impression he relate to I that she discourse in the meeting she have lad in the town have affect he and yet he could not give she he hand but go into the garden to weep but after she have get into the carriage and drive from the door she suddenly make a stop come again into the house and ask for he he be call she have a remarkable opportunity with he she tell he she believe the lord have a work for he to do in this place and that he would have to stand foremost in the rank and when the time come he must not flinch from do what he master would require this have in a remarkable manner be fulfil to the present day and afford a encouraging example to the poor try servant of the lord to be faithful to apprehend duty although they may not live to see the effect of they labor yet they lord and master will not leave himself without a witness in the heart of he people praise be he name 14_th _ since thoma shillitoe and i visit eidinghausen there have be a remarkable revival to a sense of religion a number come together in a sort of society every first-day afternoon to read sing and pray for the edification one of another as all thing have a begin this may perhaps prove a step to a more perfect way of worship i have long feel inclined to visit the meeting in eidinghausen and have look towards accomplish it from minden i go there on the 9th inst and my intention to be there be know a few day before cause many of these awaken people to attend the meeting so that the little school-room be quite full and many stand in the passage i be truly thankful to be amongst they for it prove a most satisfactory season they be a rustic set of folk but have each a soul to save or to lose and all soul be of equal value in the sight of the judge of the whole earth lewi seebohm kindly give up he time to attend I as interpreter for i still prefer help of this sort when it can be do through one who be so feelingly capable i often feel as a poor wander stranger in a strange land and yet i dare not complain the goodness of the lord be great towards I he open the heart of those whom i be concern to visit to receive I into they heart and house so that it afford I great freedom in speak to they on serious subject relate to they best interest both spiritual and temporal i be convince if we mean to be useful to a people of a strange land all must be do in a spirit of love and humility with the weak we must be willing to become weak only we must be on we guard and not flinch from we well-known testimony the reflection contain in the passage which follow be of deep significance and the lesson it convey be one which the church have as much need to learn now as at any former period 15_th _ -- we find record in the writings of we ancient friend that occasionally a few word speak in the course of common conversation make a deep impression on the mind of those to whom they be address the cause must have be that they live in a more retired state of mind and be consequently better prepared to feel the smallest of good impression in themselves and be also more attentive to embrace every opportunity of improve the mind of other i fail in this respect i do not live enough in what may be truly call a spirit of prayer i must be more watchful over my thought word and action and improve my season of retirement for there be no other way of preservation than by wait and pray for a renewal of spiritual strength john yeardley then revert as he so often do to the love of soul in germany which be the means of cause he to leave he native land and which he say have not diminish during he eighteen month ' residence among they to these thought he add some consideration regard the temporal condition of the society of friend there on account of which he be often very solicitous the situation and welfare of the society here have long occupy the warmest feeling of my heart i be of the mind with other friend who have visit these part that there be a precious hidden work begin in the heart of many in germany who suffer under oppression on account of the many discourage circumstance which have exist among they and which yet prevail to the great hindrance of the lord 's work there be cause for which no human remedy can be prescribe i have often say in my heart if the lord help they not vain be the help of man much have be do for they by we dear friend in england and much still remain to be do in order that they may be preserve together and not become dispersed as though they have never be a people the effectual means of help seem yet to fail -- that of put the family in the way of help themselves by suitable employment the family who live in the neighborhood of minden mostly on small parcel of land have until now get on with a tolerable degree of comfort by cultivate they land in summer and spin yarn in winter but now the depression be so great that if they could be put into the way of earn threepence a day they would embrace it with thankfulness i have be very diffident in propon any plan for they assistance know that some former proposal have fail of accomplish the end but i have consult with those who be best acquaint with they situation and we think it safest for they to continue they own employment of spin yarn and endeavor to mend they trade by place it on this footing they must spin such a article as i can make use of in send it with what i buy from other people to my friend in the linen business in england i be to give they a little higher price than they can elsewhere obtain and those who have no flax of they own must have a little money advance to purchase some which they must repay in yarn when the yarn be dispose of in england and a profit on the same can be obtain it must be distribute among they as a premium to encourage industry and good management in produce a good article if this do not answer i can not see any thing at present that will how far this scheme be put in practice we be unable to say but we believe it be not accompany by any successful result in the next entry he speak of the advantage which he derive from keep a diary 11 _ mo _ 17 -- i be this evening accidentally induce to read over a few of my former memorandum and it humble my spirit to retrace the dealings of my merciful father with I i be glad that i have from time to time pen down a few remark by way of diary although it have be do interruptedly and very imperfectly it prove a means of enable I to see a wonderful concurrence in the way of divine wisdom which have lead I in a way that i know not and hitherto preserve I through the mercy of he love : praise be to he name now and for ever amen after he return from minden he accompany john and william seebohm who be go on a journey of business to leipzig they go by way of brunswick and halberstadt and return by nordhausen and eimbeck in this tour through the heart of germany john yeardley make many observation on the state of agriculture the city and the character of the people of the last they meet with several curious trait some of they sufficiently annoy on many great road say jy there be a summer and a winter way run parallel to each other with a rail across on which be a notice that the way be forbid by a fine of 6_d _ or 8_d _ for each horse that the traveller may know when to take the summer or the winter road we stop on the way -lrb- they be not far from wolfenbüttel -rrb- to give we horse a little bread and we coachman drive to the side of the road to make way for carriage to pass but he have inadvertently go over the setting on of the road and the roadmaster come to we and tell we we must not feed we horse there as it be not allow to drive over the stone on the side under a penalty of three shilling per horse the evening of the same day we feed we horse at a inn and walk before leave the man to follow we i and my young friend w seek the cleanest part of the way by walk in the course make for the water which be green and clean but so soon as we come by the inspector who be mostly employ on the road one of they tell we we must mind for the future and keep the right footpath or pay 6_d _ each this i consider as a infringement of english liberty and be ready to reason with he on the subject but i reflect that i be a stranger and that it be always better and more polite to submit quietly to the regulation of the country in which we live than bring ourselves into difficulty through incivility or contention in return from leipzig jy and he friend commit a more serious offence against the pragmatical regulation of the german state on we journey homewards we have much perplexity with some cloth & c which j have buy in leipzig to bring to pyrmont this arise from want of better information respect the law of the prussian territory they be exceedingly strict as to duty all kind of wares be allow to pass through the country at what may be call a reasonable excise but those traveller who have excise goods with they must preserve a certain road call the zoll-strasse it be we lot to miss this road for apprehend ourselves at liberty to pursue what road we please we take another way but we find we mistake when we come to the place where the duty be pay for we be inform we have take the wrong road and that transit duty could not be receive we must either pay the full excise as when goods remain in the prussian territory or return back until we come again into the zoll-strasse it take some time to consider which be best to be do to be send about we know not whither and on road scarcely passable would prove a serious inconvenience and on the other hand it be exceedingly mortifying to pay for such a trifle so enormous a excise the officer be very civil but tell we it be not in he power to do otherwise we conclude it would be best and cheapest to pay dearly for we error rather than be retard on we journey we have a regular receipt for what we pay but inadvertently depart again from the appoint way we be in danger of pay the full duty a second time or have the goods take from we so much for travel with excise goods early in 1824 john yeardley return for a few month to england he have ingratiate himself so thoroughly into the esteem and love of he pyrmont friend that he departure even for a short time be the signal of lamentation through the whole meeting on the 11th of the first month he have a farewell meeting at friedensthal which be attend by almost all he friend with he parting blessing he have some counsel to impart i have so much place he say in they mind that whatever i say either in counsel or reproof be always receive in love such a scene i never witness the dear lamb all weep aloud we be indeed all melt together may the shepherd of israel never leave they nor forsake they and may they become willing to follow he lead i can truly say that on they behalf my pillow have be often wet with my tear on the 3rd of the second month he leave friedensthal accompany by a young friend whom he be to conduct to a temporary residence in england and in whose religious welfare he be deeply interested while wait in hamburg for a vessel he feel keenly he solitary situation in the world 2 _ mo _ 9 -- i think i never feel poorer in spirit and more discourage than at present it seem as if visit my native land have no cheer prospect for I if it be right in the divine sight i could almost wish to spend the whole of my life in solitude but i must be willing patiently to suffer and endeavor to fill the place appoint for I on this stage of action a vessel sail for england the day before they arrival at hamburg a circumstance which at first make he regret he have not use more expedition on the way but he immediately recollect it might he for the best that he be leave behind this prove to be the case for the vessel with which he would have sail meeting with contrary wind and dark weather run aground and be oblige to put back and when jy leave the elbe she be lie in cuxhaven harbor they land at hull on the 19th chapter v from he return to england in 1824 to the commencement of he first continental journey in 1825 on set foot again in england the dejected state of mind which have accompany he on the journey return with renew force 2 _ mo _ 19 -- i do not know how to describe my feeling in landing on my native shore : i feel a poor discourage creature may he who know the sincerity of my heart be please to strengthen my poor mind for i feel almost overwhelm with fear and difficulty still deeper be he emotion on visit again the home of former day 2 _ mo _ 20 -- leave hull and come by way of selby and wakefield to barnsley i feel my heart exceedingly burden before i reach the place : it seem as if all the bitter cup i have drunk in former time be go to be hand to I afresh this may not be perhaps altogether on my own account there be at time a fellow-feeling with other and on my reach this place i soon feel my spirit dip into sympathy with some of my dear connexion who be not without they trial a few day afterwards in allusion to the religious service of elizabeth h walker of west chester we in a public meeting for worship at barnsley he say : -- i do not really know what be the matter but i fear i be go backwards from all that be good when i look at the usefulness of other o what a insignificant useless be i appear this lowly opinion of himself however be not to serve as a excuse for idleness and it be propose to he to bear elizabeth walker company in a religious circuit in some of the midland county previous to the occurrence of the yearly meeting he accept the proposal and they travel together through part of staffordshire warwick worcester and oxfordshire visit the meeting of friend and sometimes invite the attendance of the public the dispirited state of mind which john yeardley have bring with he from germany accompany he on this journey and on the 30th of the fourth month he write : -- i walk last evening in the field in a solitary frame of mind be very low in spirit on many account my own unfaithfulness deprive I of strength to cast off my burden as i go along consequently i grow weaker and weaker which be indeed diametrically opposite to grow stronger and stronger in the lord lamentable case o for a alteration for the better _ fifth-day the 6th of fifth month at sibford _ -- this be a pretty large meeting and there be a good many sweet-looking young folk the lovely countenance of such be always refresh to I and it be not much wonder if i have a little more openness for labor winch be the case in this place but in general i sit and bemoan my own uselessness i have be a burden to myself in this little journey in fear i might be so to my friend but i ought to be very thankful that they do not seem to think I so but be desirous to encourage I i think if it be otherwise it would be more than i could bear in the fifth month he attend the yearly meeting in london at the meeting of minister and elder a unusual number of certificate be grant for religious service abroad these various concern draw from he the follow reflection : -- as i sit under the weighty consideration and disposal of these subject i feel a degree of rejoice to spring in my heart that there be still member who hold the promotion of the cause of righteousness in the earth dear to the best feeling of they heart it be indeed cause of heartfelt gratitude that the divine master be direct the foot of he messenger not only to the border of this isle but also into distant part of the earth during the yearly meeting john yeardley lodge at william allen 's at plough-court and stoke newington and be introduce to several friend with whom he have not before be acquaint the acquaintance which i have make with many dear and value friend in the neighborhood of london have i hope be a little strength to I in the best thing it be truly pleasant to be treat with such genuine kindness but it be nothing for the soul to build upon -- we must look for a more sure foundation than the favor of the great and good elizabeth h walker have a meeting with the younger part of the society in london and the neighborhood in notice this meeting jy have some discriminate remark on the exercise of the ministry during this as well as many other meeting for worship i sit under religious exercise but could seldom believe it require of I to take part in the public ministry i often think when many exercise brethren and sister be present there would be a danger of interrupt the true gospel order if all be not careful to wait on the great minister of the sanctuary if we patiently abide under the rightly baptize power what we may apprehend prepare in we heart for utterance may often be deliver by other and we only have to say as it be amen we may also be bring into a right willingness to speak in the lord 's name and still be excuse this may be perhaps a preparation of a offering which may be call for at another place o the importance of know the word rightly to be divide and when and where the offering be require a part of elizabeth walker 's errand in come to europe be to visit the friend in germany mid it be propose that john yeardley should take charge of she and she companion christiana a price of neath on he return to pyrmont they go together through essex and suffolk have meeting on they way but at ipswich it appear that can price 's health be unequal to the journey and elizabeth walker proceed to hull to cross the water from thence with another company of friend who be bind for the continent jy be thus leave to proceed alone to pyrmont and he sail from harwich on the 19th of the sixth month when in suffolk he go to needham to see dear ancient samuel alexander i have he say long know this fatherly man by name and person but have have no acquaintance with he until now : he company and conversation be exceedingly pleasant and instructive to I in the evening i take a walk in a large plantation which he have himself plant when young and have now live to see afford he a comfortable retreat john yeardley be take ill when in suffolk and on settle down again in he quiet home at friedensthal he write : 7 _ mo _ 15 -- i be drinking salt-spring-water and my health be mercifully restore the air of this country seem to suit my constitution better than that of england time be very precious i think to keep a more correct journal of what i do each day might be very useful by induce a more narrow scrutiny how each hour be spend for i know not how many more may be allow I to prepare for eternity to this resolution he do not adhere with the exception of two short entry in the same month he write nothing in he diary for the remainder of the year the difficulty of he position perhaps a lack of sufficient employment and the want of that instant watchfulness without which the disciple be ever prone to stray from he master 's side seem to have again produce as they do twelve month before a season of spiritual famine he own gloomy condition do not however altogether disable he from sympathize with other in a letter to he brother of the 4th of the eleventh month he say -- i have of late be in such a low try state of mind that i have be discourage from write thee under a apprehension i should say nothing that would afford thee any satisfaction in reading but though i may not have it in my power to relieve thee i hope it will not be unpleasant to thee to know that thou art still more dear and near to I than ever thou wast in the time of more apparent outward prosperity it be a high attainment to know how to set a right value on perishable thing and it require no small degree of fortitude to bear the depression of apparent temporary adversity in that disposition of mind which become the character of a true christian although accord to we apprehension the storm may last long yet it most assuredly will blow over and then greater will be we peace than if we have never know a tempest on resume he diary which he do in the first month of 1825 john yeardley give a account of the event which happen to he during the previous few month in the seventh month 1824 thoma shillitoe and elizabeth h walker come to pyrmont and to the latter jy give he assistance in various religious engagement after she departure he again visit minden with the neighbor village of eidinghausen and hille he visit to the last-named place -lrb- 1 mo 13 1825 -rrb- be mark by a singular circumstance find a sudden draft -lrb- in my mind -rrb- to be at the reading meeting in hille to begin at two o'clock there seem but little time however propose it to my dear friend john rasche he be quite willing to accompany I and drive quickly we come in due time when the -lrb- meeting -rrb- be over the friend tell I they think it very remarkable that we should come unexpectedly on that day and that what be communicate after the reading be particularly suit to the state of a woman friend present who be labor under the temptation that she have commit the unpardonable sin and could find no rest day or night i could not prevent they from express they thankfulness for such a mark of providential interference in this way to afford the poor woman a little relief and encouragement four day afterwards have then return to friedensthal jy add : -- since we visit to hille the person above-mentioned be dead the depression under which john yeardley labor from the loss of that comfortable presence of he lord which have be almost from he youth as a lamp shine continually upon he head seem to have reach its lowest point in the early part of this year under date of the 24th of the second month he say : -- i have this morning once more be enable to pour out my sorrowful spirit before the father of mercy in a way that have afford I some relief and encouragement in bitterness and i may almost say in agony of soul have i spread before he some of those circumstance which have be a cause of unspeakable distress to I for many month past and render I unfit for almost every service temporal or spiritual thou knowest o gracious father i long to have my way and step regulate by thy holy will therefore i beseech thee have mercy on my fault and blot out from thy remembrance all my sin and everything wherein i have in weakness offend thee and be please to give I strength to become more perfectly and lastingly thine o how sensibly do i feel my own weakness and that without thee i can do nothing not for a moment preserve my own step in the midst of he discouragement he mind be direct towards the accomplishment of another part of the commission which have be entrust to he before he leave england -- viz to sojourn for a time amongst the friend in the south of france accordingly early in the third month he go to minden and lay before the two-month ' meeting he intention of go to congeny for this purpose and also of seek a religious interview with some serious people in the neighborhood of cologne this information he say be receive by my friend with much sympathy and i trust weightiness of spirit and i feel a little strengthened by the expression of they feeling and unity with I in this concern a certificate of they approbation be order to be draw up no creature on earth know how this prospect humble I i always think i be deal with in a remarkable manner -- somewhat different perhaps from other notwithstanding all the seemingly insurmountable difficulty which stand in the way and which be far too numerous to particularize my peace be connect with my obedience what will be the result i know not the way appear not yet quite clear we to the time of departure o lord favor I to wait on thee for the spirit of discernment not to step forth in the wrong time the obedience which he practice in commit himself in simple faith to this religious prospect prepare the way for a temporal blessing as well as for the return of inward joy he little know when persecute by the accuser of the brethren and mourning over the weakness of he own corrupt nature that he lord be about to provide for he a congenial and helpful companion in the room of she whose loss have leave he solitary in the world without this timely sacrifice of he own will it could not have be so easy for he to make the journey to france in the way in which it be do and which be the means of bring about the union which shed so much comfort on the remainder of he life between two and three month after the meeting at minden he receive the information that martha savory accompany by martha towell be about to pay a religious visit to the friend at pyrmont and minden he have be introduce in london to martha savory as a minister of the gospel and one who have be abroad in its service but he acquaintance with she seem to have be slight -lrb- 3 -rrb- on receive this intelligence he write : -- the prospect of see a few dear friend from my native land would be cheer but i be really so cast down that i seem as if i could not and almost dare not rejoice in anything may this low proving season answer the end for which it be permit as he apprehend the friend who be come from england might require a guide john yeardley go to meet they at rotterdam he journey and the singular coincidence of martha savory 's concern with he own be describe in a letter to he brother write after he return from holland friedensthal pyrmont 7 mo 141825 my dear brother on my return from holland i receive thy long and very interesting letter martha savory and she companion martha towell be now acceptably with we they expect to spend two or three month with we and then we have some prospect of go in company to the south of france as this have fall out in a rather remarkable manner it may not be amiss just to explain it to thee we be entire stranger to each other 's concern but as soon as my friend in london hear of my prospect from the copy of the minute of we two-month ' meeting and of my certificate dear william allen write to I desire a more particular description of my view time of departure & c and mention at the same time m 's concern which have already pass the quarterly meeting and it be fully expect she would be liberate -lrb- by the meeting of minister and elder -rrb- to visit pyrmont and minden and afterwards

become awaken to he own religious want and who believe himself call to return to greece and instruct he countryman these two interview be memorable as be probably the commencement of the strong interest which j and my evince in the greek people and which issue year afterwards in a religious tour in that country at zeist where there be a settlement of moravian the minister find the friend desire to convene they member in a meeting for worship readily consent the meeting write jy be more fully attend than we have expect there be much sweetness of spirit to be feel about these people but a want of stillness i think some of the hearer be prepare to see further than they teacher and the time may yet come when some may be draw into a more spiritual worship we leave they a few tract and they kindly give we a few little boot of theirs it be remarkable in what a spirit of love they receive we the friend reach pyrmont on the 1st of the seventh month and shortly afterwards make a visit amongst the member from house to house in that place and at minden on the 28th they visit a number of seriously awaken person at lenzinghausen who feel the necessity of spiritual worship and to whom they heart be much enlarged in gospel love walk in the garden write john yeardley in a very solemn and solitary frame of mind before the meeting i have such a feeling as i scarcely ever remember to have have before i think i see as in the vision of light as if a people would be gather in that neighborhood to the knowledge of the truth it appear to I to be in the divine appointment that we dear m be come to visit germany and a large field of labor seem to be appoint for she in this land if she be faithful the next two month be occupy with various religious service public and private not omit

greatly deject and fearful we might find none of the people whom we be seek as i be walk pensively outside the town i recollect what i once read in cecil 's remains -- that a way may suddenly open before we when we the least expect it this be now to be verify for after we have enter the carriage with the intention of go to elberfeld and while we be wait for a road-ticket i accidentally fall into conversation with we hostess and make inquiry for people of religion character learn that there be a number of such in the neighborhood the friend alight and send for a member of this little

count von-der-recke conduct they himself through every department he countenance say john yeardley evince the magnanimity and kindness of he heart it be remarkable and precious that so young a man should dedicate he whole time and fortune for the benefit of the orphan and the destitute at creveldt the next town where they stop pastor molinaar and he wife who be mennonist receive they in a very cordial manner : the latter have see thoma shillitoe at amsterdam jy relate several visit which these worthy person and some of they christian friend pay to they at the inn 22_nd _ -- in the evening pastor molinaar come with he wife and some friend to tea they inquire very narrowly respect we principle pastor m turn the conversation on woman 's preach and after some explanation appear to be pretty well satisfy with we view on this subject the mennonist hold strongly to the use of water baptism and the pastor and he wife defend this practice the latter with much earnestness but when we have unfold we sentiment and william seebohm have read a passage from tuke 's principle the pastor see that we aim only at the spiritual sense acknowledge that he have often query with himself whether the usage could not properly be dispense with and say that he intend still further to examine the question we certificate be then read and after we have converse on we church discipline the company separate in mutual love the friend inquire of the mennonist whether any of they society would incline to sit with they on the first-day evening we friend martha savory tell they we could not promise that anything should be utter see this could only take place through the immediate operation of the holy spirit at the appoint time there assemble about fifty person after a short conversation they seat themselves and when we have sit awhile in silence m find herself move to address they in a feeling manner w interpret and i relieve my mind in german as well as i be able before we separate

propose to lodge but the water be abroad from the overflow of the river and the road be extremely narrow and the rut deep they make very slow progress sometimes the way be so impracticable that they

to offer she spiritual good in return for she temporal kindness john yeardley minister to she condition under religious exercise and they trust he word find entrance into she soul on the 4th they pursue they way up hill and down the carriage sometimes become so firmly fix in the narrow deep rut that it be necessary to take out the horse and for the man of the party with the assistance of

william seebohm go to the custom-office to show the ticket of clearance they have receive on enter the prussian territory at burbach this ticket should have obviate all delay attendant on the examination of the luggage but it happen most unfortunately that the custom officer be the landlord of the inn they first come to they leave he house without take refreshment be in he eye a unpardonable offence and on william seebohm present to he the ticket he countenance and language betray the passion which rage in he breast he declare they trunk should be examine in the strictest manner and when they represent the necessity they be under of speedily pursue they journey and desire he to despatch the business as quickly as possible he reply by detain they until they be oblige to

they the next morning they be favor with a short season of solemn communion in which they be give to believe that the name of the lord would be they strong tower they liberation in fact be near for they envious jailor finding probably no excuse for longer detain they suffer they to depart but send the gendarme to guard they as far as berlenburg the man prove to be a excellent guide and be eager to bring they to the magistrate of that town where they could be more effectually check in they schismatical object he be very useful in shoulder the carriage when they come to a stand in the miserable road the town of berlenburg present a dismal spectacle the greater part have recently be burn down so that they have some difficulty in make they way through the ruin they be subject to no delay at the custom-house but before be allow to go to a inn be conduct by the gendarme to the castle to be examine by the _ landrath _ or magistrate while john yeardley and william seebohm be take into the justice-chamber martha savory and martha towell remain in the carriage where they be presently surround by a crowd who gaze with astonishment at they equipage no such vehicle have be see in the town for many year and probably never any person in such attire be weary of wait and anxious to know the result of the examination they leave the carriage and ascend to the magistrate 's room they be politely receive and arrive just as he have conclude the examination and be declare the friend entirely free from the requisition of the law the letter of recommendation which they present be very helpful in procure this result at the landrath 's request they state the object of they journey and the reason which have induce they to deviate from the route describe in the passport of all which he cause a note to be take at the conclusion he politely dismiss they with the salutation go where you will in god 's name and the abashed and disappointed gendarme be oblige to imitate he superior and make they a parting bow the magistrate refer they to two of the citizen for information regard the separatist but remark that he consider a visit to schwartzenau at that critical moment would not be without danger one of the person on whom the landrath recommend the friend to call be the inspector of the lutheran or state church of the country and on the 6th which be first-day after a time of

the name of several with whom they might freely have intercourse as the interview proceed mutual confidence increase particularly after read they certificate and the inspector express himself gratify with the liberality entertain by friend towards people of other religious persuasion it snow all the next day and the road be deep in water so that m and mt remain in-doors but jy and w walk to homburgshausen a village about a mile and a-half from berlenburg to call upon a aged man a separatist of the old connection he have hear of they arrival and be overjoy to see they he look upon it as a providential occurrence that they should have be send there at that juncture he forefather he say have be settle there many year and have hitherto enjoy liberty of conscience but now he fear they be about to be deprive of that privilege before the friend leave berlenburg he call at they inn with several more of he society he appear to be a truly pious man and look they say exactly like a _ good old friend _ he declare himself to be fully convince of the value of silent worship but say that they people in general be not prepare to adopt it however they reject outward baptism and the use of the bread and wine and refuse to bear arm he have be many time summon before the magistrate to be examine upon he religious belief on one of these occasion the landrath ask why he do not take the bread and wine and why he do not have he child baptise he answer that if he be to conform to these ceremony it would be as though he have receive a sealed letter in which nothing be write he and he people be solicitous with the friend to have a meeting with they but the mind of john yeardley and he companion be pre-occupied with a desire first to see the new separatist who be then under persecution and they do not think it proper to accede to the request in reply to a message which they send to some of the new society they receive through a young woman -lrb- for the man be afraid to come to the inn -rrb- a press invitation to visit some of they who live in a retired spot call schellershammer not far distant they immediately accept the invitation the road which be impassable for a

be prepare by one of they minister but which from its lofty assumption of prophetic authority they could not approve these people call they minister _ instrument _ and they have fall into the specious error of attribute to they effusion whether speak or write equal authority with the holy-scripture on other point they principle resemble those of friend as the disuse of outward ceremony and of oath and they testimony against war it be on these account that they be persecute they appear to dwell under the cross of christ and to live in much quietness of spirit under the exist circumstance the friend do not feel bind to appoint a general religious meeting with these people they contented themselves therefore with unfold they sentiment in conversation give they book and before they leave berlenburg address they by letter in which they enlarged particularly on the subject of the ministry they also leave some copy of they friend ' book with the old society and both party declare they belief that the visit they have receive be in the order of divine providence and take leave of they in love and confidence the friend quit berlenburg on the 9th of the eleventh month and proceed

style of he letter be at once dispel by he appearance he look be so humble so devoted and with such extreme sweetness of countenance john yeardley and martha savory converse with he a long time he do not rightly comprehend the nature of the christian ministry but he listen calmly and patiently to all they have to say they leave some book with he and receive some in return descriptive of the

although they be anxious to reach geneva as quickly as possible the attraction of gospel love towards zurich be so strong that they could not continue they journey until they have visit that city they arrive there on the 2nd of the twelfth month the state of they own feeling and the refreshing christian intercourse which await they be thus describe in the diary : -- first-day we sit down to hold we little meeting it be to I a low time but i still think the hand of divine help be near to comfort we and before the close dear m s be draw into supplication in a way which express the feeling of all we heart after this season of spiritual refreshment we call on professor gessner who with he wife and family be truly glad to see we be near dinner-time we could not stay long but they daughter offer to accompany we to she aunt 's this afternoon and accordingly come to we inn and go with we to miss lavater who with gessner 's wife be a daughter of the pious author lavater she receive we with open arm but speak only german or at least but very little french so that m s converse with she in german she speak of stephen grellet with much interest and affection : he live in the remembrance of all in this country who have see and know he as well as william allen how pleasant it be to find that such devoted instrument have leave such a good savor behind they wherever we follow dear stephen he presence have make a sufficient introduction to we but i regret exceedingly my own incapability of be sufficiently useful in these precious opportunity which we meet with : but as we often say in we little company this be like a voyage of discovery and we humble endeavor however weak may have a tendency to open the way for other who may be make more extensively useful should such ever be lead to visit the solitary part where we have be we be invite to drink tea this afternoon by we friend gessner and on a nearer acquaintance find this a precious family he wife be a sweet-spirited person and they daughter pious young woman one of they in particular i think not only bear the mark of have be with she savior but a desire be also express in she countenance to abide with he : may he who have visit she mind draw she more and more by the cord of he love and preserve she from the evil which be in the world when tea be end we drop into silence and pastor gessner offer up a prayer from the sincerity of he heart and it be evidently attend by the spirit of divine grace and life afterwards dear m and i express what be on we mind i interpret for she as well as i could and i hope they understand it we be all much tender in sympathy together and i think the visit to this family will not soon be forget : we take leave of they in the most affectionate manner they express sincere desire for we preservation on they return to berne they meet with some pious lady : one of whom say john yeardley speak german with I and enter pretty suddenly on the subject of the bread and wine supper or sacrament she seem to have lose sight that there be a spiritual communion which the soul can hold with its savior and which need not the help of outward shadow but it be remarkable when we reason for the disuse of such thing be give in simplicity and love how the feeling of other become change towards we they then see we do not refuse the administration of they out of obstinacy but from a tender conscience on the 8th they drive to lausanne and the next day to geneva john yeardley have preserve in he diary of this part of the journey a little anecdote of french character which naturally strike he the more forcibly from he have hitherto be conversant only with the phlegmatic temperament of the german the coachman it should be say be of that nation on the road between nyon and geneva a little incident occur which show we the liveliness of the french temperament a man get up behind we carriage and we coachman very naturally whip he down the man follow we quietly for a while but at length he wounded dignity overcome he patience and he come up to we coachman and begin to speak furiously on the impropriety of he have whip he find he could make nothing of one who understand not what he say he address himself to we friend martha towell and say he know he have do wrong but the coachman should have tell he to get down which be customary in they country and not to have whip he mt be prepare to appease he wrath by a mild reply which ease the poor man very much otherwise i think we should have have more trouble with he but he seem to be quiet and say teach you coachman to say in french descendez they reach geneva just in time to prevent the departure of loui majolier : who say martha savory be indeed rejoice to see we after all he anxiety but she continue great as be we mutual satisfaction at meeting i be incline to think it would have be better if this plan have never be propose as it be a means of prevent some movement which might have tend much to we relief and he mind be in such a anxious state about home that he could not give himself to anything that might have open at geneva or lausanne -lrb- to which i expect to return -rrb- but beg we very earnestly to return with he to congeny as soon as possible -- -lrb- _ letter to e dudley _ -rrb- they find the religious world at geneva in a state of convulsion the secret poison of infidelity say jy have a good deal sap the principle of real religion and the clergy of the established church have preach a doctrine tend to socinianism a few young minister have boldly come forth and separate themselves and be determine in the midst of persecution to preach christ and he crucify some of these seem to have go to the opposite extreme for they hold too strongly the principle of predestination it be a remarkable time in this neighborhood as well as at lausanne where many be awaken to seek more after the substance of religion at geneva they form a friendship with several person among whom be pastor moulinier and l'huillier and captain owen a englishman with the last-named they be unite in close bond of religious affection they be enable to administer to he spiritual want and he be forward

from the top of which say jy we have a view of the city and the surround neighborhood which be indeed beautiful the great number of olive vine fig-tree & c excite a train of idea please and indescribable in travel through switzerland john yeardley have be often bring into a low state of mind and on approach congeny the final object of the journey he heart be stir to its depths it be very instructive to observe what be he feeling in reach a place to which he mind have be so long direct the road he say be better and the outward prospect a little enliven but it be not easy to describe the feeling my mind be under in approach a place which have so long occupy my thoughtfulness to visit the prospect be discourage but i must be content and sink down to the spring of life which can alone make know the object of duty and qualify for they fulfilment in the midst of all my spiritual poverty a stream of gratitude flow in my heart to the father of mercy that he have be please to preserve we in many danger and bring we safe to this part of he heritage and if it should be he will that i should have nothing to do but to suffer for he name 's sake may he grant I patience to bear it martha savory 's feeling on the same occasion be also those of deep gratitude for the preservation experience during they journey unite she say with a humbling sense of many omission and great unworthiness yet of help have be mercifully administer in the time of need -- -lrb- _ letter of 2 mo 10 1826 _ -rrb- edward brady be spend the winter at congeny for the sake of he health and he

ought to be i often feel as one already lay by useless and the language of my heart be o that i be as in day past soon after they arrival at congeny martha savory meet with a serious accident think a ride would be beneficial to she health when the rest of the party drive one afternoon to sommières she accompany they on horseback she have not a proper saddle and she horse be eager to keep up with

catholic they be forbid by heavy fine to meet together except in very small company we meet they several time in they small meeting to much comfort there be a few among they who have stand firm through the heat of trial and these be precious individual the priest be exceedingly jealous on we arrival in the town we hold we little meeting with these pious people on first-day morning the priest come to the house of the woman friend where we have be to demand who we be and where we lodge and say it be we who have cause they to err and he would convince we in they presence that we be not only in error ourselves but have lead they into error also but we see nothing of he and leave the place in safety which we consider a great favor for such have be they rage that they have dare to shoot at some missionary who have be in the neighborhood -lrb- _ letter to thoma yeardley 4 mo 19 _ -rrb- the rest of the journey through france be in general dreary the external accommodation be bad and the

little hermitage at calai but there be little doubt that they have a wider significance and contain also a allusion to he anticipated union with martha savory the prospect of this union seem to have spring up during the journey and to have become mature before they separate at calai and the effect of it be amongst other thing to set he free from the necessity of pursue business any longer as a means of livelihood and to ensure to he a provision sufficient for he moderate want on the 12th of the fifth month john yeardley left calai for london at the inn in calais a little incident occur the

and arrive at we humble cottage the 15th of the twelfth month i trust with thankful heart \* \* \* \* \* it be appropriate to give in this place some account of martha savory 's character and christian experience that we notice be brief and incomplete be owe to the loss of most of she own memorandum and of the letter she address to those with whom she be on intimate term she possess it will be see a intellectual character and disposition as well as a experience very different from those of she husband it do not follow however that this dissimilarity be a hindrance to they joint service in the gospel any more than to they social harmony and love it may be on the contrary that martha savory 's quickness of understanding and of feel the readiness with which she apprehend the sentiment and condition of other she conversancy with the allurement of city life and the peril of unbelief from which she have be rescue fit she in a peculiar degree to be she husband 's helper in the ministry especially in they travels on the continent she be bear in london in 1781 and be the daughter of joseph and anna savory to a active and vigorous understanding she unite a strength of will which would brook little control together with much energy and fearlessness and the propensity to follow the vain inclination of the unregenerate heart display itself in a indulgence in much that be inimical to the restraint of christian principle she disposition be generous all she emotion be ardent and be seldom subject to the discipline of a correct judgment there be however various occasion even in she very early year when through the visitation of heavenly love she mind be forcibly arouse to a conviction of the need of redeeming grace she be particularly impress by the preaching and influence of william savery whose home in london be at she father 's house in some memorandum of this period she remark frequently in the meeting appoint by he i be greatly work upon by he live ministry and notwithstanding that she subsequently wander far from the way of peace there be good ground to believe that the remembrance of those truth which have penetrate she heart through the instrumentality of this gospel messenger be never altogether efface be naturally endow with a lively imagination and a taste for literature she seek to suppress the upbraiding of conscience in intellectual pursuit and employ much time in the composition of verse that be merely a transcript of visionary and romantic idea afterwards publish under the title of poetical tale this volume obtain but a limited circulation for soon after it have issue from the press the conviction that it have be a unhallowed and unprofitable exercise of she understanding be so impressed upon she spirit that although the sacrifice be considerable she cause all the unsold copy to be destroy it be interesting to observe how in later year this talent for metrical rhythm which have be so misapply become consecrate as be all she faculty to the promotion of piety and virtue during the long period in which she mental energy be thus misdirect a cloud of darkness envelop she spirit she have when about nineteen year of age imbibe sceptical view in reference to the truth of reveal religion and as she seldom read the holy scripture and be almost a stranger to they sacred contents she imagination picture a easier way to escape from the power and the consequence of sin than in that self-renunciation which the gospel enjoin in some memorandum of she experience she say in reference to the snare by which she mind be entangled : -- i be lead to a love of metaphysical study and fancy i discover with clearness that human vice and consequently human misery spring from ignorance of the nature of virtue and that if mankind would become instruct they would become good and that it be only necessary to behold virtue in its native beauty to love it and to practice it o how fallacious be this reasoning ` the world by wisdom know not god the natural man receive not the thing of the spirit of god for they be foolishness to he neither can he know they because they be spiritually discern ' at length however when in 1811 martha savory have complete the thirtieth year of she life she become deeply impress by the conviction that she be wander on the barren mountain of doubt and error and through the renew visitation of divine love the light of the sun of righteousness again shine into she heart and its humbling influence brake the rock in piece some circumstance occur that be instrumental in promote this great change she be introduce into frequent communication with some honor servant of the lord particularly with the late mary dudley and she daughter elizabeth a attack of indisposition prostrate she bodily strength and afford opportunity for serious reflection whilst from this cause confine to she chamber a young person -lrb- susanna corder -rrb- with whom she be only very slightly acquaint but to whom she be ever afterwards unite in a intimate and confidential friendship be attract to visit she the interview be a memorable one the overshadow wing of goodness and mercy be permit to gather they spirit under its bless influence on she recovery from this illness martha savory pay a short visit to she new friend which afford a opportunity for the manifestation of continued deep christian interest and on she quit the house susanna corder put into she hand a copy of the olney hymn when she have proceed a few step towards home she open the book and without notice even the title instantly cast she eye on the line the rebel 's surrender to grace commence -- lord thou hast win at length i yield my heart by mighty grace compel surrender all to thee against thy terror long i strove but who can stand against thy love love conquer even I she be deeply affect by the remarkable application of the whole of the hymn to the experience which she be then pass through she could not refrain from weep and to avoid the observation of passersby she walk through secluded street give vent to she emotion and she afterwards repeatedly express she belief that there be in this apparently casual incident a divine interposition and guidance for say she _ every word _ of that hymn appear as if purposely write to describe _ my _ case so that i could scarcely read it from the many tear i shed over it it be no exaggerated picture she now spend much time alone almost constantly read the bible and so precious be the influence that operate on she spirit whilst thus employ and so wonderfully be the bless truth of the gospel unfold to she understanding that as she express it every page of it seem as it be illuminate sustain by the joy and peace of believe she be enable to follow in faith the leading of the holy spirit and through divine strength to become as a whole burnt sacrifice on the altar of that gracious redeemer who have in he rich mercy pluck she from the pit of destruction have have much forgive she love much and shrink not from the many and deep humiliation which be involve in such a course of dedication to she lord even she external appearance strikingly bespeak she altered character there have always be in she countenance a expression of benevolence but it have not indicate a gentle or diffident mind in she demeanor and personal attire she have conspicuously follow the vain fashion of the time but now humility with a modest and retire manner mark she conduct everything merely ornamental be discard and the softening effect of a sanctify principle impart to the feature of she face a sweetness which impress the beholder with a consciousness of the regenerate power that work within be to more than a few of she acquaintance both arouse and instructive she change she residence from finsbury to the borough of southwark and settle near she friend susanna corder with whom she unite in the formation of a philanthropic association the southwark female society for the relief of sickness and extreme want the late mary sterry and several other estimable member of southwark meeting together with benevolent individual among the different religious denomination of the district soon join they and the society become a highly influential channel through which assistance have be variously render to many thousand of the indigent poor and it still continue though with a reduce scale of operation to be a important source of help to the sick and destitute martha savory devoted to this work of mercy much time and personal exertion but a more important service be also design for she she feel constrain to give evidence of she love to christ by a public testimony to the grace which have be vouchsafe to she through he who be the way the truth and the life deep be the conflict of spirit which she endure ere she could yield to this solemn requirement but sweet peace be she say as she record the sacrifice the result of thus acknowledge she gracious lord this step she continue appear to I to involve the greatest of all possible mental reduction but i reverently believe it be necessary for I and mote perhaps on my own account than on account of other for without this bond and the necessary baptism attend this vocation i should have be in danger of turn back and perhaps altogether lose the little spiritual life which have be mercifully raise she add a fervent petition for preservation and guidance and that by whatever mean however suffer to nature the vessel might be purify and fit for the master 's use she first speak as a minister in the year 1814 the humiliation and brokenness of spirit which mark these weighty engagement be feel by many especially among she youthful friend to be peculiarly impressive as token of the soul-cleansing operation of omnipotent love and as a awakening call to yield to the same regenerate influence she be acknowledge as a minister by southwark monthly meeting in the year 1818 when she have reach the age of 36 and in 1821 with the cordial approval of the meeting of which she be a member she commence that course of missionary labor in the gospel to which she be subsequently so much devoted she mission on this occasion be to congenic where and in the surround village she remain twelve month a letter to one of she sister write a few year after she marriage so fully represent she religious sentiment and the doctrine she be concern to preach and maintain that it may not improperly conclude this outline of she mental and religious character burton 13th of twelfth month 1830 i read thy remark my endear sister on the present state of thing amongst we with much interest from have have corresponding feeling frequently raise in my own mind in this day of general excitement on religious subject it remain to be a solemn truth that nothing can draw to god but what proceeds from he and whatever may be the eloquence or oratory of man if it be not the gift of god and under he holy anointing which always have a tendency to humble the creature and exalt the creator it will in the end only scatter and deceive it have long appear to I that true vital religion be a very simple thing although from we fall state require continual warfare with evil to keep it alive it surely consist in communion and at time a degree of union with we omnipotent creator through the mediation of we holy redeemer and see these feeling can not be produce by eloquent discourse or beautiful illustration of scripture but by deep humiliation and frequent baptism of spirit whereby the heart be purify and fit to receive a greater degree of divine influence see it be produce by daily prayer by give up we own will and seek above all thing to do the will of we heavenly father surely there be cause to hope that those who be convince of this and who have taste of spiritual communion through this appoint means will never be satisfy with anything however entice which if not under the influence of the holy spirit may well be compare to sound brass or a tinkle cymbal i be far from confine this influence to the minister of we little society but assuredly believe that those who be bring under the immediate teaching of the spirit under every profession will be more and more convinced that they can not preach to profit the people in they own will and at they own command and that as true and spiritual religion prevail they must in this respect come to we and not we go to they yet still it be certainly a day of much excitement and of danger especially to the young and unawakened and there never be a time when the member of we society be more loudly call upon to watch unto prayer both on they own account and on account of other humbly to implore not only that the holy spirit may not be take from we but that a greater effusion of it may be pour upon we as a body that so we may all be make and keep alive in he in whom be life and the life be the light of man i believe this would be much more we experience if the thing of this world be keep in subjection by fervent daily prayer and the obedience of faith which remain to be the means point out by we gracious redeemer of communion with the father through he what can be more pure than the profession we make to be guide by the holy spirit and if we really be so we shall be concern to maintain this daily exercise of heart before the lord and yet become what i reverently believe be he gracious will respect we and _ all _ under every name who be thus guide and have become live member of the church of christ even that we should be as light in the world or a city set upon a hill which can not be hide \* \* \* \* \* the dwelling which john and martha yeardley occupy be on the highest ground in the village command a wide and cheerful prospect and overlook on the western side the valley of the dearn and the conspicuous town of barnsley which notwithstanding the smoke that envelope it stand out in fine relief on the opposite hill they cottage adjoin the friend ' burial-ground and just on the other side of the wall repose the remains of france yeardley on the site formerly occupy by the meeting-house -lrb- 5 -rrb- the house say martha yeardley in a letter to she sister r s be warm and comfortable though at best what londoner would esteem a poor place we feel quite satisfied with it and when we get we garden in order and a cow and a few chicken it will be equal to anything that i desire in this world to-day the snow have disappear and john be very busy with he garden -- -lrb- 1 _

fatherly care among john yeardley 's note make during the more general visit we meet with a memorandum which may be take to mark a stage or era in he christian experience the daily record of religious exercise and feeling which be so useful to many in the hidden season of tender growth and preparation for future service be less likely to be maintain -- and it may be less necessary -- in the meridian of life when the time and strength be take up with active labor 3 _ mo _ -- i could write much as to the state of my mind but have of late thought it safer not to record all the inward dispensation which i have to pass through i feel strong desire to be wholly give up to serve my great lord and master and that i may above all thing become qualify for he service but the baptism through which i have to pass be many and exceedingly try to the natural part nothing will do but to rely wholly on the divine arm of power for support in pure naked faith chapter viii the second

entire unity with we in we intended religious service it be a strength and encouragement not only to have the concurrence of we friend but also to know that we have a place in they prayer for we preservation and support in every try dispensation on the eve of they departure from london a circumstance occur of a very disagreeable character the shop of they brother ab savory in cornhill be break open many valuable article be take and they travel trunk which have be leave there be ransack although they loss be trifle the annoyance of such a contretemps may easily be conceive jy say : --

nevertheless the lord have guide my step and i have cause to give he thanks they visit minden and the little meeting around bestow much labor on they but at pyrmont to suffer rather than to do be they allotted portion it sometimes seem to I write jy that we have in this place little to do and much to suffer i be often cast down and have to sit in silence and darkness this state of mind be a exercise of faith and patience through which much may be gain if it be turn to right account of the two month ' meeting he say : on the whole a favorable time but i be not without my fear that the little society in this place will lose ground in a religious sense if more faithfulness be not manifest in little thing soon after they arrival in germany they turn they step towards the north-west corner of that country and the border of holland the object of this journey be to visit some place on the shore of the north sea near friesland where the inundation of 1825 have cause great desolation and where a new colony have be form by the government from among the ruin family this little journey be so emphatically a act of faith and the course of it lay so much through a part of europe seldom visit by traveller that we shall transcribe the diary of it without much curtailment 9 _ mo _ 4 -- have for sometime feel a impression to visit friedrichgroden and other place on the store of the north sea near the confines of east friesland we set out from pyrmout in company with we dear friend loui seebohm travel with extra-post in we own carriage we find this a pretty expedition way of travel for this country be able to make about fifty-five english mile a day between oldendorf and bückeburg we experience a remarkable preservation from danger we postillion be a little sleepy have not sufficient care of the rein and the horse suddenly turn off towards a inn but miss the turn instantly fall into a deep ditch one horse quite down and the other nearly so the carriage want only a few inch further to go and then it would have come upon the horse so that a few plunge must have upset the whole concern we spring instantly out and set the quiet animal free the man be so frightened he could scarcely step from the box the whole affair do not last more than a few minute when we be on we way again with great cause for thankfulness to the preserver of we life the driver be so honest in acknowledge he fault that i give he he _ trinkgeld _ and we friend l s give he some advice we get well on through minden to diepnau and lodge there next morning set out about seven o'clock and that day travel late to reach oldenburg which we accomplish at about one in the morning next morning we be in a dilemma which way to take to find we place of destination the landlord be kind in send out several time to gain information but in vain : at length there come into the room a deaf and dumb man who frequent the house and who when he know we inquiry immediately write down the particulars of the place and explain it by sign on the table we leave two book for this intelligent man for he kindness and set forward dine at varel and have two poor tired horse and a awkward driver to jever we give he several severe lecture without much effect at length we come to a small inn on the road where he make a stand and say he could go no further without two more horse which we really believe be true for if he have not get they we must have stick in the sand the horse be procure we get to jever about eleven o'clock here be a good inn and we rest pretty well but in the morning discouragement take hold of my spirit in a way that i have seldom experienced i be ready to conclude we be altogether wrong and out of the way of we duty but forward we must now go to see the end of this exercise journey the country about varel and jever be remarkably fertile in pasture the cow handsome roll in abundance of grass and pretty much the whole country have the appearance of ease and plenty in varel we see the poor-house a building capable of contain 400 person and only four individual be there the inhabitant live in simplicity but also in the general ignorance and indifference as to religion i be exceedingly low in mind on the way but feel once more that we be in we right place and my precious m y encourage I by say we should not go there in vain on open the bible i be comfort in turn to psalm lxxviii 12-14 after have thus travel some day as it be in the dark we arrive at friedrichen siel near carolinen siel in which neighborhood on the border of the north sea lie friedrichgroden new

which form almost a new world this land be the property of the government a small sum be pay on enter and a yearly ground-rent and then it be the property of the purchaser for ever as soon as we step on the bank of one of these _ groden _ and i set my eye on one of these retire abode i feel no longer at a loss where we should go or what we should do it open suddenly on my mind as clear as the sun at noon-day that we must remain here a day or two and visit these new settler in they dwelling accordingly we drive to the inn at carolinen siel on ask for a map of the surrounding country one be put into oar hand contain a plan of the place which have suffer so severely by the flood in the spring of 1825 which render those people much more interesting to we after dinner we commence we visit and

first on new augustengroden build in 1816 -lrb- sweep -rrb- down by the water in 1825 and rebuild the same year he be a intelligent young man and answer many inquiry which we make find the distance might be too great to walk next morning we procure horse and start about seven o'clock take from we small stock of book one for each family we commence intercourse with they by first interesting ourselves about they family and domestic concern not unmindful of every suitable opportunity to turn the conversation on the subject of religion which be too much neglect by most of they they be of the lutheran profession but the church be at some distance they do not regularly attend most of they have as many as six child and some eight with fine countenance we feel deeply interested particularly for the mother some of whom be tender-spirited amiable woman and weep much in the opportunity we have with they they late affliction have make on some a deep impression and it be a time when i trust such a visit might be of advantage in the flood several have they house sweep away and one lose thirty-six head of cattle and have to drag he child out of the water naked and take refuge on the top of the house but the most touching case be that of a man who lose he wife and five child he father mother and servant they be send away in a waggon as a means of escape but the waggon be sweep away by the torrent and all perish the husband who be leave alone in the house get to land on some board part of the wreck of the house and expect to find he family safe what must have be he

he readily undertake to consult with a few other and he come to we inn next morning with another when he say the good work must have a small beginning and although he himself be quite willing the other do not see the necessity of it or be too cautious this person tell we that with respect to temporal they could never have get forward again in the way they have do have it not be for the kind and effectual assistance receive from england after a interesting conversation with these two we part in much affection my my draw up a short epistle which be sign by we all and forward to they : this

ecclesiastic be fond of keep in they own hand all thing relate to religion and will not suffer the light to shine that the people may see for themselves the edict of stade have lately be renew

inquiry about fredericks-oort but could obtain no intelligence nor could we find it on the map which we borrow for examination this be very discourage for i have hope if it be right for we to go we

for he come and immediately give we direction where to find the place we want i ought not to omit remark the comfortable feeling that i be favor with ride from wittmund to aurich -lrb- on the way to

pastor have die the night before but instead of sorrow there seem to be joy this society hold it for a religious duty to rejoice when any of they member be favor to enter a state of endless bliss this be religious fortitude which but few possess but i believe it be with they sincere for in go over the institution with the director i observe they speak of it as a matter of holy triumph no meeting be hold with the member of the establishment during this visit it be leave for j and my to attend the usual evening assembly on first-day the 21st and they be inform that it would be a occasion on which

they would make we no charge say love must pay all we be most easy to make a present to the box for the institution but they would have refuse it say feelingly traveller like you have many expense the cause for jy 's peculiar discouragement in the prospect of this meeting be the want of a interpreter any one who know the difficulty of public speaking or continuous discourse in a foreign language will comprehend the anxiety which he feel when he see no alternative but that of commit himself to preach in german though very familiar with the language he never completely overcome the want of early and of thoroughly grammatical instruction in that difficult and intricate tongue it be with feeling of this kind that he pen the follow memorandum before go to kornthal : -- 18_th _ -- extremely

without reference to any particular creed in the greek school write john yeardley we observe a serious man about thirty year of age who have the appearance of a laborer learn greek this be a little surprising and lead we to inquire the cause the inspector readily gratify we : and gratify indeed it be to hear that this poor man have give up he work of ship-carpenter from pure conviction that he

the bible society to corfu but before they reach the place of they destination they be deter by the missionary on account of the unsettled state of the country and dare not proceed further for fear of

interview with he and he be instantly send for to the inspector 's room after a few remark which open for we to make to he he confess he have no peace but when he think of give up to this feeling of

in silence nearly all remain and under a solemn cover he address the company while i translate in much fear yet venture at the end to say a few word for myself several of the company attend we home and express much satisfaction : and from this time a door be open to we at neufchâtel in a very remarkable manner they flock to we inn at all time in the day and in considerable number many acknowledge in the course of very interesting conversation that they thirst for something more satisfying than mere doctrine continually repeat -- something that would preserve from evil that would

of the peace society much to my own satisfaction it be truly gratifying to hear from those not in profession with we such strong and decide sentiment against all war as be not only inconsistent with the spirit of christianity but also contrary to sound policy i be convinced _ public _ meeting be necessary to keep alive _ public _ feeling as well as to excite individual interest as it regard myself i can say before attend the meeting i feel but little concern with respect to this great question soon after they return home they be comfort by the intelligence that a few of those person at neufchatel who have so joyfully receive they gospel message have find strength to establish a meeting for worship this information be contain in a letter from auguste borel from which the follow be a extract : -- he who try the heart and who know the sincerity of my desire deign to hear my prayer on the 24th of February when without any previous understanding we meet four in number at my house at ten o'clock in the morning this day be call with we _ torch Sunday _ and be a day of rejoice in the world and if i ought to say so during my carnal life it be to I a day of true pleasure which i always look for with impatience because of the great bonfire which be then light and which be see from we city illuminating every point of the wide horizon it be my hope that the god of love in the analogy of the spiritual order of thing may have kindle in we heart he sacred fire and will condescend to maintain and increase it in time and in eternity since that time we have continue we meeting without interruption : we number have not yet exceed six or seven we do not force the work but recognize that it be the lord alone who have begin it i feel daily more and more that he alone ought to direct it a portion of this summer and autumn be occupy by john and martha yeardley with hold public meeting for worship within the compass of pontefract and knaresborough monthly meeting amongst the

large a meeting in that place many of those present express they satisfaction by say they could have sit till morning to hear what be deliver it be a easy matter to become hearer of the word but it be the doer of the word that be pronounced happy 23_rd _ -- meeting at otley in the methodist chapel it be not very full but very solid and satisfactory the last public meeting in this place be hold in silence which might probably be the cause of a small attendance on this occasion it be bard work to bring the people to see and feel the advantage of silent worship : the time be not yet come and perhaps never may we must be willing to help they in the way point out and try to strengthen the good in all for if they be only bring to the father 's house it matter not in what way or through what medium in the eleventh month they return to the monthly meeting the minute which have be grant they and receive at the same time a certificate to visit some meeting of friend in the midland and south-western county before they leave home for this journey they receive intelligence that john yeardley 's early and intimate friend jame a wilson be no more 11 _ mo _ 24 -- my heart say jy be pained within I while i record the loss of one with whom i have be for many year on the most intimate term he have long have a afflict tabernacle and a suffering mind which i believe contribute to he refinement and prepare he for the awful change he have be recommend to go to a warmer climate and have take up he residence at glouchester where he die which prevent we from attend he in he last moment he possess much originality of character join to sincerity and genuine piety and i doubt not he experience the fulfilment of this promise : behold i have cause thy iniquity to pass from thee and i will clothe thee with change of raiment -lrb- zech iii 4 -rrb- on the 11th of the twelfth month they leave home and during the next two month be closely occupy in visit various meeting from yorkshire to devonshire they service commence with a encouraging meeting at monyash in derbyshire 13_th _ -- the first meeting we attend be at monyash it be larger than we have expect in consequence of stranger come in and prove rather a lively commencement to we spiritual course of labor on the 14th they hold a meeting in the pottery in a cottage belong to one of the few friend in the place word have get abroad that stranger be expect many of the neighbor come in so that the room below-stair be fill : it be a refreshing time they find in the woman to whom the cottage belong a bright example of piety and charity she have be say jy a cripple from she childhood but be able to maintain herself by keep a school for little child she be not unmindful also to help she poorer neighbor out of she small earnings at bristol where they arrive on the 1st of the first month 1830 they rest a few day at h and m hunt 's we have say jy much pleasure in be in this family bristol be the largest meeting we have in we society in england and to I it be a very try one on the first-day morning i be much cast down after meeting but we staid over the monthly meeting on third-day which afford I relief of mind and i leave with as much comfort as i could well desire at plymouth john yeardley find a object of lively interest in lady roger ' charity school establish to fit girl for become household servant he be gratify with the good order simplicity and economy which pervade the institution martha yeardley suffer much during they journey in devonshire from the inclemency of the weather and a heavy fall of snow on the night of the 17th prevent they leave plymouth at the time intend in consequence of this they hire a lodging and employ themselves in visit the friend from house to house and in organise a infant school which the friend have long desire to see establish on they return from plymouth they stop at sidcot where they spend some time at the friend ' school here the subject of offer prize to child come under the notice of jy and like all other subject connect with education engage he serious reflection it would certainly be better he say if the basis of good action could be lay in the child 's mind on a principle of rectitude and justice so that they might be teach to do well from a love of truth and not from a fear of punishment or a hope of reward but so long as human nature remain unchanged a check against the one and a incitement to the other seem to be necessary as a help to overcome the evil in the mind until that which be good shall become predominant they return to yorkshire through warwick and leicester and on review the journey john yeardley have the follow reflection : -- 2 _ mo _ 22 -- almost all the meeting we attend on this journey of 800 mile be very small except birmingham and bristol and the life of religion be low among the member in general which be not much to be wonder at when we consider that many of those meeting be constitute -lrb- chiefly -rrb- of a few individual who have have a birthright in the society -- bear member but not new-born christian without the power or form of religion no outward means to excite they to faith and good work if they neglect the spirit of prayer in themselves it be not surprising they should grow cold in love and zeal for the noble cause of truth on the earth but in the lowest of these -lrb- meeting -rrb- there be something alive to visit and in go along we feel the renew evidence that we be in we right allotment in thus go about endeavor to strengthen the thing that remain and though we have have to pass through much suffering both outward and inward yet we have also experienced time of rejoice in do the will of we lord and savior jesus christ after the quarterly meeting in the third month they visit each of the meeting within they own monthly meeting thinking say jy a little pastoral care be due to we friend at home see we be often concern to go abroad in the fifth month they go up to the yearly meeting via lincolnshire take several meeting in the way among the subject which occupy friend in they annual conference this year be that of mission to the heathen which it be propose by some should he take up by the society the subject write john yeardley be fully enter into and the interest be very great many friend speak they sentiment freely and feelingly and the subject be take on minute to be revive nest year if this important matter be bring home to each individual of we there would be more missionary prepare and send forth to labor but we love ease and we home content ourselves with reading and talk about what be go forward in the great cause of religion and righteousness in the earth they return home through the midland county visit most of the meeting in oxfordshire and in the part adjacent which they have be unable to do the previous year in return from the west it be comforting to we john yeardley say to be with friend in oxfordshire whom we have so long thought of many of they meeting be small but there be a few individual among they precious and improve character who i believe be under the prepare hand for greater usefulness in the lord 's church with these we be often dip into near union of spirit which sometimes cause the divine life to rise among we to the refreshing of we spirit in the sixth month they again leave home be mind to see how the church fare in the eastern part of yorkshire the point which most interested they in this tour be scarborough where they be attract both by the town itself and by the little society of friend it feel to we say jy very much like a home we lodge at elizabeth rowntree 's a sweet resting-place -lrb- 7 _ mo _ 4 -rrb- at the same time that they report to they monthly meeting the attention they have pay to this service they receive its sanction to undertake a journey in wale it be truly humbling to we write john yeardley in describe this occasion thus to have to expose ourselves poor and weak as we be but the cause be not we own but be in the hand of we great lord and master may he help we -lrb- 7 _ mo _ 19 -rrb- they leave home on the 7th of the eighth month and spend the 11th at coalbrookdale in the company of barnard dickinson and he wife from thence samuel hughes accompany they as guide into wale and continue with they a week he prove say jy a most efficient helper in this wild country know the road well and he be kind and attentive to we and we horse the stage be long and hilly and we be often oblige to go many mile round the mountain to make we way from one place to another the road to pale be over the moor we scarcely see a house for mile except here and there a little cot on a plot of ground obtain as a grant to encourage industry these little dwelling be generally surround by a few acre of well-cultivated land enclose from the moor it be much to be regret that the plan of cottage culture be not more generally promote wherever i see it practice i view it with pleasure as tend to increase the comfort of the poor on the 19th they attend the half-year 's meeting at swansea a committee of the yearly meeting be present elizabeth dudley be also there with a certificate for religious service and she and john and martha yeardley finding that the errand on which they be come be the same resolve to join company and travel together through south and north wale they be accompany throughout the journey by robert and jane eaton of bryn-y-mor as there be very few meeting of friend in wale the chief part of they service be beyond the limit of the society they meet with great openness in many place from the methodist and other preacher and they congregation from the note which john yeardley make of they religious labor in this journey we select several passage 9 _ mo _ 13 aberystwith -- we first object be to inquire for a place of meeting we find they be all engage for that evening which detain we here a day longer than we have expect but this little detention enable we to make acquaintance with two of the independent preacher to whom we become much attach in gospel fellowship a shadrach and he son the father preach in welsh and the son in english it be comforting to we to meet with two such pious humble-minded christian labor diligently to forward the cause of religion they kindly offer we they chapel for the evening and after the meeting they both express much satisfaction in have be favor with such a opportunity 9 _ mo _ 15 -- we arrive pretty early at machynlleth which be a clean little town we do not know but that we might have proceed on we journey after have refresh ourselves and we horse but ed feeling much interested for the people of the town it seem best to have a meeting with they i walk out and see a good meeting-house inquire to what persuasion of people it belong and find it be a independent chapel and that the minister live about a mile and a half in the country the prospect of be unable to make the people understand we be discourage for in the street there be nothing to be hear but welsh however there be no time for reasoning it be near twelve o'clock and all must be arrange by seven in the evening after some difficulty we find the preacher a kind-hearted pious man who readily grant he chapel and undertake to act as interpreter should occasion require this be the only place where we adopt the vulgar mode of give notice by the town-crier so common on all occasion in this country but the time be short and many of the people be not able to read we english notice which we generally fill up for the purpose the meeting be pretty fully attend and the people be mostly quiet consider there be many who could not understand when ed sit down the minister repeat in substance what she have say for not be use to speak through a interpreter she decline he give sentence by sentence when he have do i feel something press on my mind towards the poorer class present who i be sure could not understand english : so i step down from the pulpit and place myself by the minister request he would render for I a few sentence as literally as he could this he do kindly and i believe faithfully to the relief of my mind he then address a few word on he own account to the assembly and dismiss they we regret the want of the native language as we could not have the same command over the meeting as would otherwise have be the case at barmouth instead of convene the people to hear the word they have to exercise a christian gift of a different kind -- the gift of spiritual judgment 9 _ mo _ 19 -- on enter barmouth we think of a meeting with the inhabitant but on feel more closely at the subject the way do not appear clear there be something which we could neither see nor feel through this power of spiritual discrimination be very precious how instructive it be to mark we impression under various circumstance and at different time 9 _ mo _ 25 -- at ruthin we obtain information respect the few individual at llangollen who profess with friend and set off to pay they a visit we arrive at the beautiful vale of llangollen to dinner and alight at the king 's head inn at the foot of the bridge which afford we a fine view of the dee there be at present only four or five person who meet regularly as friend they live scatter in the country and be in the humbler walk of life but we think they upright-hearted christian who have receive they religious principle from conviction we see they on first-day morning in the room where they usually meet and again in the evening at we inn and be much comfort in be with they the room where they meet be in such -lrb- a obscure situation -rrb- that we should never have find it without a guide we think it right to procure they a more convenient room which we do 27_th _ -- in the evening we have a public meeting in the independent chapel which be crowd there be much openness in the mind of the people to receive the truth of the gospel before the assembly separate we propose to they to establish a school for poor child several present they conviction of the want of such a institution and the minister be so warm in the cause that he propose they commence without delay 28_th _ -- we go to wrexham and have a meeting in the evening the notice be short but the people come punctually and a precious time it be after it be over several bear testimony to the good which have be extend to they that evening and be ready to cling to the instrument invite we to have a meeting with they when we come again that way this favored time at the close of we labor among a people whom i much love seem like a crown on we exit from long-to-be-remembered wale my heart be humble in reverent thankfulness to the father of all we mercy who have graciously preserved we in outward danger and sustain we in many a inward conflict at coalbrookdale they bid a affectionate and gospel farewell to the friend with whom they have be so closely unite in this long journey and return to burton on the 20th of the tenth month in the eleventh month they make a circuit through lancashire take all the meeting of friend in course they find several meeting chiefly compose of such as have join the society on the ground of convincement mostly in place where no minister friend reside in visit one of these small meeting john yeardley relate a circumstance in the gospel labor of he friend joseph wood : -- we visit a little newly-settled meeting at thornton marsh near poulton in the fylde we worthy friend joseph wood have the first meeting of we society that be ever hold in this part it be so thinly inhabit that the friend wonder at he concern to request a meeting but one be appoint for he at a inn i think a solitary house a good many poor people come and it be a most remarkable time jw say afterwards he believe there would be a meeting of friend in that neighborhood but perhaps not in he time it have now be settle about eighteen month this journey occupy they about two week and on return home john yeardley make the follow animate remark : -- the retrospect of this journey in connexion with that of wale afford a sweet feeling of peace we be often low and discourage but help be mercifully extend in the time of need i often wish i have more faith to go forth in entire reliance on the divine arm of power for truly in the lord jehovah be everlasting strength on the conclusion of this engagement follow a month of quiet but industrious occupation at home 12 _ mo _ 25 -- a month have be spend in the quiet in read writing and many other thing in course leisure be afford i have spend a good deal of time in read diligently and attentively the holy scripture i trust to some profit after this seasonable pause john and martha yeardley be much occupy with a project change in they place of residence which issue in they removal in the spring of 1831 to scarborough the motive which induce they to make choice of this place and the feeling under which the change be accomplish be fully unfold in the diary we have for some time be on the look-out for a change in we residence inclination would have lead we to remain in we own monthly meeting but a strong impression that it might be right for we to remove for some time to scarborough have remain with we ever since we visit that place in the seventh month and have always stand in the way of we fix elsewhere although very often have we try to put it from we we be so desirous to settle at c -lrb- near pontefract -rrb- that only five pound a year in the rent save we from take the step it be my prayer at the time and always have be that we might be rightly direct and i have a hope that if it be not right for we to go to c something might turn up to prevent it and since we could not agree for the house which be offer we in that place we conclude to go for a short time to scarborough and try the fleece there under the belief that we should then be enable rightly to determine this i hope have be the case for we have not be many day i may say hour in the town before we be fully convince it be the place for we to settle in have make trial of scarborough they return to burton to arrange for they removal which take place on the 7th of the fifth month we have now see john yeardley for many year in the devoted exercise of he calling of a gospel minister it be instructive to follow he as we be able to do soon after he removal to scarborough into he chamber and see how when alone with the gracious giver he be wont to regard the precious gift how he lament that he have not use the talent more diligently and how he mind be enlarged to see the grace and power which the lord be ready to bestow on those who seek and trust he with they whole heart 6 _ mo _ 8 -- the important duty of a gospel minister have this day be bring closely under my consideration it be most assuredly the imperious duty of those who be call to feed the flock to labor diligently for the good of other with respect to myself i feel greatly ashamed and it have occur to I that should i he cast on a bed of sickness or otherwise be deprive of a opportunity of exercise this gift it would be a awful consideration and cause of deep regret that i have not better improve the time the hardness of heart in other as well as in one 's self be difficult to penetrate nothing but the power of divine grace can reach it and this require not only wait for but also labor to overcome the wander and unsettled thought to which the poor mind be subject merciful father give I more confidence in the gift which thou hast bestow on I and favor I with a greater portion of strength to minister thy word faithfully who then be that faithful and wise steward whom he lord shall make ruler over he household to give they they portion of meat in due season bless be that servant whom he lord when he cometh shall find so do -- -lrb- luke xii 42 43 -rrb- tenderly mindful of the religious want of those whom they have lately leave so early as the seventh month john and martha yeardley revisit the several congregation in pontefract monthly meeting they be both

religious awakening proceeds from the immediate influence of the spirit on the heart of man and this be the doctrine preach and maintain by the writings of the truly devoted christian in this place who be bring to profess live faith in we lord jesus christ as the alpha and omega the beginning and the end they find the country on the road to nancy very agreeable 29_th evening _ -- the white house among the tree and the vine on the hill-sides form a picturesque landscape the reaper be busy in the harvest field and the ground that be clear of its burden give proof of the diligence of the french farmer the plougher if not the sower literally overtake the reaper in the forepart of the route we see much wood and water hill and dale with cattle feed in the peaceful pasture which be a lovely sight as we advance towards chalon it become less interesting more flat with fewer tree and meadow everywhere the harvest more forward than in england but the crop much more light and thin they enter nancy under a feeling of gloom and it be some time before they could find relief to they mind but by patiently pursue the path of intercourse which open before they they be enable to deposit with some serious individual they accustomed testimony to the simple spiritual nature of the gospel in allusion to this trial of they patience john yeardley remark : -- i can not i dare not complain when i

society in reading of day spend like that which have just be describe we see in a striking manner what be the nature of that work of the ministry for which john yeardley be prepare at barnsley and bentham by so many deep baptism and sharp trial of he faith and obedience the stage on which he be call to act be not the most public the part which he have to perform be unobtrusive but when the value of strengthen the weak comforting the afflict and above all skilfully divide the word of truth in the anointed ministry of the gospel come rightly to be estimate it can not be say but that the fruit be in some sort commensurate with the power of the call and the extent of the preparation the next day and the succeed be occupy by john and martha yeardley in a excursion to the ban de la roche of which the former give the follow account in he diary 12_th _ -- in company with major we set off at 6 o'clock to the ban de la roche we have a most delightful drive by the side of the river flow

thought arise probably from the great weight and importance of the journey before we and the anxiety of provide a conveyance through a strange and dark country after much difficulty we have conclude a write contract with a italian _ voiturier _ to take we to ancona may we divine keeper in he infinite mercy grant we protection and safety even in the hand of ungodly man the journey to ancona take

he coach and provide we with food and lodging by the way the other passenger inside be a englishman who speak very little french and no italian and another englishman outside be in the same situation we could not but feel ourselves a very helpless company when arrive at the inn which be quite of a inferior class and little or no french speak we do pretty well however till we get to milan where we rest some day and we englishman be exchange for a italian priest who speak no french and a swiss who be a little useful to we as far as bologna after this place we travel five day alone the inn on this side of milan be much worse and from the detention of we passport in the town we pass through we be often prevent from reach the place of destination and oblige to lodge at village where we suffer much in the way of food and lodging yet through all we be favor to bear the journey much better than i expect my jy be rather poorly for two day and i be extremely anxious about he but the

one of whom argyri recognize as we inquire at he shop the way to the post-office on return she make herself know to he and he show we every attention he be a fine look man with a countenance as strong as brass we be comfortably lodge with a delightful view of the harbor but we heart be in corfu we young companion add my be amiable and very quick but not of much use to we respect she native tongue which she retain but very imperfectly and be not at all fond of speak it the house be high and many of the street narrow and offensive for want of cleanliness and from a immense population such number be continually in the street that there be no quiet or good air in the town the darkness be extreme and the dissipation apparently very great the oppression of we spirit at some period be almost insupportable and yet i be at time very sensible of the calming influence of divine love with a sense that have act to the best of we judgment we must resign ourselves to wait for the return of the steam-packet from england when on arrive here we find there be no letter and that probably they be send to corfu my heart sink within I we have however be since cheer by receive a very kind letter from dear robert forster nothing could have be more in season than this token of remembrance finding no suitable vessel for corfu with the assistance of they greek friend they hire a lodging and give they time to the study of italian and the modern greek religion labor be hardly to be think of the government of the town and every public office be under the direction of the roman catholic priest of

rejoice to we that you have be so favor in meeting with so many pious person with whom you could hold christian fellowship and among whom there be strong reason for believe you labor have not be in vain it be to I very gratify that you feel and exercise so much christian freedom in mingling among person of various denomination whom though owe to education and to various circumstance they may differ considerably in opinion on subject of minor importance yet conscious of one common disease -- that of sin and look for or experience the only remedy -- reconciliation with god through one savior -- you can salute as brethren and sister in the truth and feel you spirit refresh whilst you enjoy the privilege of refreshing theirs and like aquilum and priscillum with apollo be make the instrument i trust of expound unto they the way of god more perfectly my dear mother think that the person you meet with must be more spiritually-minded than christian in this country they have perhaps from external circumstance experience deeper baptism and have make greater sacrifice than many amongst we have be call upon to make and we know that ease and outward prosperity have not be favorable to the interest of the true church : but without doubt they be expose to similar danger to those in this land whose mind have be awaken to the importance of religious truth after speaking of a journey which he have make with samuel tuke and joseph priestman for re-arrange some of the monthly meeting in the west ride the writer continue : -- on the journey i receive intelligence of the decease of hannah whitaker the account produce a strong sensation in the mind of friend generally who feel much for we dear afflict friend robert whitaker and for the loss which the institution at

the society have be physically disable by a stroke of paralysis r c himself write at the same time to john and martha yeardley describe he affliction which he receive with childlike resignation as a message of love from a father 's hand i have he say no expectation of get again to meeting and it do not appear probable i shall be able again to get down stair with respect to the state of my mind it be a occasion of grateful admiration to I that such & poor unworthy creature as i feel myself to be should be so favor as to have my will entirely subject as to become resignedly willing either to live or die and for a time the prospect of not continue long appear to be most probable i however feel no reliance upon anything that i have do or could do my dependence be entirely upon the unmerited

admit that they practice the adoration of saint they only mean to hold they up as example of piety and virtue and to induce other to follow they we point out to he the importance of take he for we example who speak as never man spake and have leave we a example that we should follow he step this young man be very inquisitive and inclined to be sceptical but under all have serious impression

and vanity of the world 27_th _ -- this evening we have have a long conversation with pathane we teacher in the language and a deacon in the greek church he be much attach to the rite of he own church but acknowledge the necessity of regeneration they have a fatal error in the ceremony of baptism positively assert that when the child -lrb- or individual -rrb- have receive this he be really bear again and a fit heir of salvation such be the efficacy which they attach to this ceremony that they creed set forth in the most unqualified manner that whoever receive not the form can not enter the kingdom we could not forbear lift up we testimony against the injurious effect of such a creed 28_th _ -- we have have a ride to-day with i lowndes and family across the island sixteen mile to the sea on the other side we road lead we through a perfect wood of olive-tree thickly plant and load with fruit the hill be often variegate with the cypress & c and near to the sea be beautifully romantic we

peace even in such a remote place 2 _ mo _ 1 -- another long and pleasant visit from count sardina he be mild and condescending but close in argument he mind appear gradually to become impressed with the truth of the gospel and i trust the notion he have receive from sceptical writer be give way to a hope of salvation through christ jesus we lord fearful of do anything to make the member of he own church he enemy he come to we by night -- not for fear of the jew but for fear of the greek 9_th _ -- how often we heart be ready to sink within we in the midst of this dark and superstitious people we have now be here nearly three month and have not have one opportunity of publicly preach the gospel the power of prejudice in favor of they own superstitious rite and the overwhelming influence of moral evil seem entirely to close we way in this line we have have much conversation with we friend isaac lownde who have reside on this island thirteen year on the subject of publicly preach the gospel to the people and he say that such be they attachment to the ceremony of they own church that they can not be prevail upon to attend the ministry of any other denomination i lowndes be a character with whom we feel much christian unity and he family be like a little lamp shine in the midst of gross darkness this darkness add martha yeardley be increase by the dissipation of the greater part of the english the military have great influence here and they practice tend greatly to demoralize the unhappy people we have just hear that they have obtain leave of the senate to hold a ball in the new school-room and to break down the partition-wall between they for this purpose which will prevent the school from be open for another month on the 23rd john yeardley continue : -- to-day my drooping spirit have be refresh by six precious letter from england express the interest of we dear friend in we mission but oh how my heart be humble in the sense of how little we do during we stay here i have be closely engage in translate judson 's question on scripture the correction be nearly finish and we propose have a number print for the school ignorance of the language be a perpetual hindrance in they way although they devote a very large portion of time to acquire it the difficulty be almost insurmountable they learn to read and translate but to converse in greek be for a long time almost entirely beyond they power although to preach and teach the gospel be the primary object of john and martha yeardley 's errand the temporal improvement of they fellow-man be by no means foreign to they mission and we have often see that plan for the promotion of industry and self-support be to the former object of peculiar interest during they residence at corfu no small portion of he time be occupy with the establishment of a model farm which seem to have be a joint scheme on he part and that of the administration a grant of land be obtain from the senate and the prisoner with some of the poor be set to work to cultivate it some of the landowner watch the progress of the experiment with the intention if it should be successful of introduce the plan upon they estate we may conclude this account of they residence in corfu with some general remark on the religious character and condition of the inhabitant we trust say they we sojourn in corfu may not have be in vain : if we may only be permit to prepare the way for the further enlargement of the savior 's kingdom on the earth we may well be content prepare the way it may truly be call for there be a great deal to be do among a people just emerge from barbarism and bring with they all the fixed habit of ignorance and superstition before a door can be open for the direct preaching of the gospel they mode of reasoning be strong and wily and they ask question which can only be answer in private conversation and by scripture proof a great means of afford help must be by educate the rise generation and by the diffusion of scriptural knowledge many of the priest be extremely ignorant and some of they have only learn by _ rote _ the service of they own church in the ancient greek they knowledge therefore can not be found on they own search for scriptural truth see they have not have the opportunity of examine for themselves in some instance when we have present to they the new testament in the modern language they have say with a look of anxious gratitude this be what we want we priest teach in the church what we do not ourselves understand on the 26th of the second month they cross the sea to santa maura have a delightful passage of eight hour captain mcphail the governor a friend of william allen 's meet they himself with a boat and conduct they to he house he show they every attention during they short sojourn and introduce they to those person whom they desire to see they make a interesting call on the bishop -- a nice old man who be many year priest in a village in the mountain and what be a wonder he have be promote on account of he virtuous life he be a good example in he own village and a great promoter of school the old man be candid enough to confess that he be happier among he rustic peasant than he be now in more refined society we give he the book of genesis in modern greek and it be highly gratifying to we to see the surprise and pleasure of he countenance on be present with a account of the creation and work of the almighty in he native tongue we think the opportunity favorable for propose the scripture to be read by the clergy in the modern instead of the ancient language he make no objection and appear to see the great utility which might arise from it something have be say about the semi-barbarism of the greek what we friend learn respect crime and violence whilst in this island place the manners of the people in a very strong light nothing can show more strongly the demoralized state of these island than the frightful act of cruelty do to the cattle out of pure revenge one shudder to think of the skinning of beast alive cut off the ear of ass break the leg of horse yet of these sort of cruelty not less than 500 act have be commit in the last four year and the offender have escape be bring to conviction this dark picture be happily relieve by some trait of moral beauty the narrative of a ride into the mountain of santa maura which jy make under the escort of the governor prove to how great a degree virtuous and gentle manners grow and flourish in the remoter part of this island 3 _ mo _ 1 -- this morning we set out for a ride about nine mile up the mountain to a village call carià which contain about 1200 inhabitant and in the surround hamlet there be about the same number about half-past 9 o'clock we start captain mcphail and myself on he two sure-footed horse and another english gentleman on a fine mule after we have leave the newly-made road we pursue a track perfectly unequalled in any part where i have travel rugged precipice shelve rock and large loose stone which assail the foot of the poor beast every step they take however for my part i be well reward it give I a opportunity not only of see the interior of the island but also a specimen of the disposition of the native before we reach the village i observe with some surprise a tribe of people assemble on the top of the cliff to see we come in and on ascend a few more pace of rock we find the child of the boy ' school arrange like a little army with myrtle branch in they hand to welcome we to they sequestered hamlet after greet we with great respect they follow we to the country-house of we english friend the mountain multitude wait with patience until we have make we repast when a few of the lead villager be introduce to we room and what be they request a school for they daughter they be ask what they would give towards its support they answer whatever we can afford we that be able will pay for the poor and they shall go free it be then intimate to they that they friend would assist they in establish a school but that they themselves must join in the effort and that it would be well to consult together and put down they name and the number of child they would send here the town-crier come forward and say he have for the last twenty year cry everything the government wish to be make know in the town free of cost and he would now go round and cry for the benefit of the school next come forward the father of the young woman propose for the mistress who it be propose should be further instruct in the village and then send to the town to learn the system we ask they if they be sensible of the advantage of a school for girl of have they bring up to be good wife capable of manage they household and able to read the precious thing in the new testament one of they reply without instruction what be we -- we be like the beast one peasant have be so anxious for he daughter to learn to read that he have make interest to send she to the boy ' school when we ask why he do so he say because i have no other means and i wish to have she read the new testament to we now i have the advantage of hearing that precious book read to I by my own daughter it be delightful to witness a feeling like this in a people so uncultivated surely the friend of education in greece have encouragement to go on and prosper after this please interview we proceed to the boy ' school follow by as many as could get into the room when the boy have read i desire that question might be put to they on what they have be read but soon find that this important mode of instruction be neglect the master promise to introduce the question which we be have print if we would send he the book on return to we quarter we find among the crowd who be still present the three priest come i suppose to pay they respects to the governor we be glad of a opportunity of converse with they on ask they opinion as to a school one of they say in greek it be good bless and honorable i could not let this favorable opportunity pass without impress on they through mcphail the advantage of read the scripture to the people in the modern tongue which they could understand tell they that the book of genesis be already print in modern greek they could hardly believe I and on my show they a new copy of this and of the psalm they eye sparkle with pleasure we friend the governor read aloud a portion of genesis and one of the priest a little out of the psalm the long-robed patriarchal look man say ah this be what we want we priest read in the church what we do not understand ourselves and how can we explain it to other they modestly ask if they might have the book for a while and when we say they be give to they there be a little jealousy who should have they this we remove by say that more should be send many of the kind-hearted people accompany we to the precipice and run before to clear the way and through divine mercy we reach the dwelling of we kind host in safety not without a steeping of mountain rain when the good bishop of santa maura hear the result of we interview with the peasant he send one of he most influential priest with a subscription book for he people to put down they name towards a fund for the school thus promptly give he sanction to general education 3 _ mo _ 2 -- first-day after

assistant to govern they to whose judgment they submit and the greatest punishment be to be shut up for two or three day in a solitary room in the convent the wigwam where we alight be soon fill with visitor we be serve with coffee by we hostess -- a interesting woman with much expression of mildness in she countenance after converse awhile with the villager and satisfy they curiosity as well as we could i think it a suitable time to bring about the primary object of we visit and inquire who among they could read a young man come forward who have be educate in the school at santa maura we give he a new testament and he read the greater part of a chapter in the gospel those who be in the room listen with surprise and attention and many without look eagerly in at the doorway to hear what

with a bed in the corner screen by a slight partition a lattice-window admit a peep into the rich and lovely vale below and the pure air of the mountain be not obstruct by glass i have often hear of the eastern custom of sit cross-legged but never till now experience it in reality we be desire to sit on cushion spread on the floor for we reception and be serve with the finest walnut and honey i ever taste and while we partake of this hermit-like repast there be a precious feeling of good and i believe we have the secret prayer of the good abbot as he have ours when we present he with the new testament genesis and the psalm he kiss the book and press they to he bosom express he gratitude for the treasure we next visit be to the habitation of the judge which be of the same description as the rest where we be serve again with coffee what pleased we be the sweet feeling of quiet which prevail of which i think some of they be sensible one woman we first hostess put she hand to she heart and say very sweetly i love you they would not let we depart without show we they ancient custom of take hold of hand and dancing round singing meanwhile a sort of chant many of they come with we to the water 's edge and prayer be raise in we heart for they good and thanksgiving to we divine master for the comfort and satisfaction of the day 3 _ mo _ 8 -- under the hospitable roof of captain mcphail we have feel much at home he wife say we come have be a blessing to she she be near to we in gospel love the captain accompany we in he boat to the steamer from santa maura they proceed to argostoli the chief town of cephalonium we arrive about five o'clock in the morning the entrance to the town for a considerable distance be like a perfect lake : the white house along the side of the harbor and the craggy hill with the olive grow out of the rock have a pretty appearance at the break of day we young greek interpreter giovannus basilik be with we we have to call up the inhabitant of the only inn in the place before we could get shelter at first the host refuse to receive we little company but after some explanation he consent to arrange the desolate-looking room into habitable order they visit the school and the prison and they receive from the resident hg tennyson and the schoolmaster and mistress a friendly reception but the islander be generally careless of instruction and progress of all kind be slow from cephalonium they traverse the sea to the beautiful island of zante though they have ten man to row the passage occupy thirteen hour contrary wind write john yeardley compel we to approach the island slowly which give we a opportunity of view the village and scatter house at the foot of the mountain the town of zante be very long the main street have piazza on each side for a considerable distance in many of the window -lrb- i suppose a turkish custom -rrb- there be something like cage through which the woman peep without be see under the pretence of modesty but it be horrid to hear of the wickedness commit in-doors however i be glad to find the custom be die away and that the young woman be now permit to walk in public more than they be a few year ago this island be by far the finest we have visit it be very fertile and well cultivate and supply england with currant but like they neighbor the people have the character of be immoral treacherous and revengeful it be sorrowful to think that under the system of picture-worship there be scarcely a sin of which the poor greek be not guilty to a enormous extent with god all thing be possible -- he can change the hard heart of man by the power of he divine spirit but morally speak it must be some great convulsion that can work a real change in the nation will croggon have labor here more than seven year and know not of one conversion among the rich greek -- not one attend the service for worship he be the methodist missionary here and be call the friend of every man : he have be a real friend to we the governor and he wife have pay we marked attention the former take we to see the prison which be well conduct and the prisoner be class we suggest the benefit likely to result from the prisoner be employ and major longley -lrb- the governor -rrb- intend to introduce basket-making we have in addition to the public school visit several private one and be pleased to find so many child receive education : this be really the chief source of hope for improve the moral of the greek and disperse the gross darkness which surround this people whose long servitude and suffering under very hard master have almost drive they back to barbarism 17_th _ -- there be a shock of earthquake more violent than have be feel for some year in this place we room shake almost like a ship at sea the wall bed table and glass be all in motion and the sensation while it last be that of sea-sickness the noise may be compare to the rolling of a carriage with many horse come at full speed and suddenly stop at the dwelling -lrb- see _ eastern custom _ p 78 -rrb- have thus explore the four principal island of the ionian archipeligo john and martha yeardley turn they course towards the morea 30_th _ -- at 6 o'clock in the morning we put ourselves once more at the mercy of the wave of the mediterranean and have a quick passage of fourteen hour the landing at patra be frightful a sudden squall throw we off the shore and cause we to lose part of the rudder so that we be oblige to get into a very small boat which threaten to upset every moment we be however favor to land in safety on a project rock : it be nearly dark and the whole have a terrific appearance the plain near patra once beautifully plant with currant olive and vine be now perfectly desolate the castle be in possession of the turk eight year who make continual sally from it for provision and firewood while in order to disappoint they the greek themselves assist in the destruction of all vegetation so that there be scarcely any green thing to be see the old town be a scene of ruin the site of the new town be near the sea where temporary shop and house have be erect it be difficult to find a shelter for the night but a kind fellow-traveller assist we and at length we be press into a miserable dirty room with only a board for a bedstead at patras we have abundance of consultation whether to undertake the journey to corinth and athen by land or to encounter the gulf we conclude to venture on the latter and contract with the captain of a little boat to depart at five the next morning he deceive we by not sail at the time propose but we make a agreement with other sailor to go off in the evening hope to get to corinth the next morning : but after toss all night we find in the morning the ship have only make twenty mile and about mid-day the captain declare he could not get to corinth and must put into a small port on the opposite side of the gulf call galaxidus and wait for better weather we be so exhaust as to feel thankful in the prospect of be once more on land nothing can be more comfortless than these small greek vessel in the cabin you can neither stand nor lie at full length after some difficulty in get on shore we be lead to the khan a very large room with a fire in one corner for boiling water and a wine store and round the side be bench which serve for sit by day and on which the traveller spread he mattress for the night if he have one if not he must go without we be desire to mount a ladder to a loft like a corn-floor badly tile in and divide into four part by board about five foot high the one division of this place assign to we have no door and when the window be shut which be of wood there be no light what shone through the tiling or be admit between the board the place be soon furnished for the boy bring we a mat and spread it on the floor which be all we have a right to expect but as we seem to be visitor who could pay pretty well they bring also a rough wooden table and three wooden stool 2_nd _ -- galaxidus be in ruin present only mud cottage and temporary wooden house ship also be in build 4_th _ -- this morning we walk among the hut of the town and find a old man keep school near the ruin of he own school-room which have be destroy by the turk it happen to be he dinner-time and he be seat cross-legged on a stone with a footstool before he enjoy a few olive and a morsel of bread around he stand he ragged pupil read from leave tear out of old book some of which be so worn and dirty that the poor boy could scarcely discover what they have once contain the weather be by no means warm yet we could not wonder at he choose the open air for the place of instruction when we see he dwelling which be a mud hut not quite nine foot square with no opening for light but through the doorway in this hovel he teach he forty scholar when the inclemency of the weather do not permit they be out of door the grey-headed father be surprise that he humble company have attract the notice of stranger but see the interest we manifest in he call he inquire for a new testament which we gladly furnish with the addition of some tract to such of the child as could read they this sight be gratify to we as show a disposition to teach and to learn even under the most disadvantageous circumstance we quarter at the khan become more uncomfortable the people be so uncivil they would hardly give we cold water without grumble the second night we witness one of the most dreadful storm we ever remember to have see violent gust of wind shake we desolate abode while the rain pour down in torrent and find entrance in various part of we apartment they intend as we have see to go to athen by way of corinth and when they be disappoint of sailing to that city and throw upon the opposite shore of the gulf they still seem to have suppose it impossible to reach the capital by any other route 5_th _ -- be say john yeardley on the contrary side of the gulf and thus deprive of help ourselves by means of horse we give up all hope of reach athen and think we must of necessity return to patras we therefore inquire for a vessel to take we thither but never shall i forget my feeling of horror while try to contract with a man for a boat i say in my heart o that i might be permit to try the fleece once more in turn we face towards athen the man be exorbitant in he demand and it be too late to reach patra without risk the night on the sea to stay where we be be next to impossible without serious injury especially to my dear martha strong indeed be we unite prayer for direction and help in this time of distress and ever-blessed be the name of we adorable lord who hear and answer we prayer out of the depths of distress a little light spring up and we think if we could take a boat and cross over to scala a little port on the opposite side of the creek we might then take mule to -lrb- castri the ancient -rrb- delphus and if not able to proceed further on we way the change we hope would be use to my we do make the effort and be favor to get to scala where we find only a few scattered mud house but on landing there be a change of feeling immediately experience we be rescue from ship-builder and sailor the vilest of the vile and place among a simple country people the master of the custom-house to whom we have a few line of recommendation invite we to he house and give we coffee he provide we with four mule three for the interpreter and ourselves and the fourth for the baggage it be about eight mile or two and a half hour ' ride to delphi and no sooner have we begin to feel the mountain air than my dear m begin to revive we have to climb precipice where nothing but mule could have carry we at the foot of the mountain we come in company with two camel which be a new sight to we the situation of delphus be the most beautiful that eye can behold : mountain of rock such as we never before saw and in the back ground the far-famed parnassus cover with snow the village consist of about one hundred cottage some of they build in the rock we be conduct to one of the best of these rustic dwelling and meet with a very friendly reception from the inmate the house consist of two room and we be offer the use of one of they they furnish we with mattress lay upon a sort of dresser where we sleep much better than for many previous night even the hen and she thirteen chicken under we bed do not disturb we the novelty of the visiter soon bring in several of the neighbor who do not leave we even while we take we tea as there be a good feeling we think it well to improve the opportunity and inquire who could read the master of the house a sensible man say there be only about twenty in the village who know anything of letter but that he could both read and write for he father be a priest after tea we produce a new testament and the book of genesis and we interpreter read aloud the first two chapter of genesis we host have never see the scripture in he own language and we think we never behold a countenance more full of delight and intelligence than he be during the reading after a short explanation of what have be read and a word of exhortation we think to close but the company be so pleased with hear the account of the creation and fall of man -lrb- from the sacred record itself -rrb- that they request we to read more i desire they to ask any question on the subject they might wish and the first which we host put be what kind of tree it be the fruit of which adam be forbid to eat we answer that it be translate in we language _ apple _ he say they think it be a _ fig _ we tell they it might be a fig or it might be a apple but that the object of the almighty be to try adam 's obedience they at once agree to this and the master of the house wisely observe jesus christ come to restore to we what be lose by adam 's transgression he then say it would have be better if adam after he transgression instead of hide himself have confess he sin to god and beg he forgiveness we all agree that it be a natural act for man in he fallen state to wish to seek excuse rather than to confess he sin and repent we then make some remark on the prophecy of the savior in the third chapter of genesis and ability be give we to preach the gospel of life and salvation all heart seem touch and we own overflow with gratitude we may in truth say we heavenly father have pluck we foot out of a horrible pit and out of the miry clay and set they upon a rock and put a new song into we mouth even praise to he glorious name on consider afterwards we situation we could not but behold the hand of a gracious providence which have lead we to this spot have we attempt to go by corinth to athen we should -lrb- as they afterwards learn -rrb- have be stop by the water and have miss see this interesting people but from hence the way be passable and only four day ' journey by land after dinner we walk through the village up to the rock we come to a fountain where several woman be wash one of they a young-looking person suddenly leave she companion and with hasty step and entreat air advance towards we as we suppose to ask something but she bow she head almost to the ground and then kiss we hand after which she withdraw in a cheerful and diffident manner the reason of this salutation be that the young woman have lately be marry and it be customary for the last bride of the village to kiss the hand of stranger the temple of apollo once occupy nearly half a acre of ground : a great many of its marble pillar be still to be see half bury by the plough and corn grow over they about a hundred yard from this temple be the cave in the rock from whence the priestess pronounce the oracle among the curiosity of this wonderful place the tomb in the rock be not the least remarkable they be build of the most beautiful white marble the entrance be by a large archway and round the circle be several recess in the stone one above another where the dead have evidently be deposit they illustrate the history of the maniac dwelling among the tomb -lrb- mark v 3 -rrb- for these cave form a perfect sort of house in which person might dwell 8_th _ -- we be not able to leave delphus on account of the high wind with some rain in the evening we again enjoy we scripture reading on the hearth we continue the book of genesis and we host inquire whether those who die before the birth of the savior be lose he be inform they be save through faith in the promise he have suppose they go into hell and that when christ come he release they we ask he if enoch who walk with god and be translate could have be send to hell of this he know nothing never have read the scripture 9_th _ --

he hand to he heart and feelingly accept the trust we be most of the day wind round parnassus whose height above we be tremendous the road be frightful over rock water and swampy ground we could hardly have believe it possible to pass through the place where we mule penetrate the muleteer perform he trust faithfully render we all the assistance in he power on parting we present he with some tract he could read and be much gratify with the gift at livadium we be badly lodge in a smoky room and suffer much from extreme fatigue but we find ourselves with a interesting family to whom we read the scripture seat with they on the floor and we could not but feel grateful to we divine master for lead we among those who be thirst to receive the holy scripture in a language they could understand 10_th _ -- we travel on horse through a comparatively flat country despoil of all its verdure by the ruthless hand of war the evening be wet we reach the once celebrated thebe in the dark and be glad to take shelter in a smoky room in the first house that could receive we the situation be fine but the present town occupy only the part which be the fortress of ancient thebe 11_th _ -- this day we have much mountain country to pass through every tree we could see be either partly burnt or partly cut away towards the end of we day 's travel we go through a immense wood difficult of passage on leave which the gulf of aegina appear in view we rest for the night at a little settlement of albanian near the coast we obtain shelter in the cottage of a old woman who seem a little startled at the appearance of stranger whose language she could not understand conclude however that we have the common want of nature and have no bread to offer we she quickly prepare a little meal make a cake and baked it on the hearth under the ash we make sign to be furnish with a vessel in which we might prepare a little chocolate we frequent repast under such circumstance and at length a very rough homely-looking pitcher be produce but the greater difficulty be to find something in which to boil the milk and water after wait till they own soup have be prepare we obtain the use of the saucepan these difficulty overcome we enjoy we meal and offer some to a greek woman who have walk beside we mule for the sake of company on she dreary journey to athen but she refuse with thanks say i be not sick for the greek seldom take beverage of this sort except when they be indispose as the inmate of this homely cottage as well as the neighbor who usually come in to see traveller of we uncommon appearance do not understand greek we be deprive of the opportunity of read the holy scripture to they or of converse with they on the subject of religion all that we could do be to prepare for rest of which we stand in great need have have a very fatiguing ride through the wood to this place the room in which we have take shelter be also to be we sleeping-place in common with the old woman and she family and the greek traveller in another part of the room be also a sheep and several other animal we sweep as clean as we could a space in the neighborhood of the quiet sheep and spread what bedding we have upon the mud floor surround it with we baggage except we carpet-bag which serve we for pillow and after commend ourselves and the household to the protect care of the great shepherd of

city be beautifully situate in a plain bound by mountain and near to a rich grove of olive-tree which have be spare amid the ravages of war i feel say john yeardley low and contemplative many and various thought crowd into my heart every foot we set in greece we bee desolation i can scarcely believe that i be in the place where the great apostle of the gentile desire to know nothing but christ crucify and in sight of mar hill from which the same apostle preach to the athenian the true god we reach the only inn in the town much worn by fatigue and bad accommodation yet very grateful for have be preserve from any serious accident during we perilous journey and under a precious sense that it be in right order we persevere in come to this place we introduce ourselves to the american missionary hill and king and meet with a hearty reception the school under they care be the most gratifying sight we have see j hill and he wife have nearly 500 child on they list we be much pleased with the arrangement of the school : the classification be the best i have ever see and the child exhibit intelligence and thirst for instruction the effect of scriptural instruction on the mind of the greek child be very gratify a young girl whom the director have take into the school as a assistant teacher enter the family with a mind fortify in the superstition teach in she own church observe scrupulously the feast and fast-day the make the sign of the cross before eat and the kissing of picture the mistress wisely avoid interfere with what the girl consider to be she religious duty but after she have attend the scriptural reading and the family worship for a short time the light of divine truth break in upon she heart and as she embrace the substance of the religion of jesus christ she attachment to the superstitious form become gradually weaken until at length she leave they altogether the mistress one day say to she i observe you do not keep the fast-day nor cross yourself before eat nor kiss the picture no reply the child i be convince that make the outward sign of the cross can not purify the heart from sin and as to meat and drink i read in the scripture that it be not that which goeth into the mouth that defile the man 15_th _ -- visit the school under the direction of jona king of the boston mission he have a academy for young man and a school for mutual instruction contain together 150 i think the mode of scripture lesson particularly efficient the instruction give in the school at athen seem more complete than in any we have visit during the journey jk have service in modern greek three time on first-day at which some of the young man attend along with other greek but not many during we stay in this city we visit many greek family and distribute among they religious tract and portion of the holy scripture and exhort they to the observance of they religious duty often call they attention to those point in which they own practice be at variance with the doctrine of holy scripture the ancient ruin be exceedingly grand and raise mingle feeling in the heart not easily describe but tend to humble the pride of human greatness we see the temple of theseus the prison of socrate the famous temple of minerva but the spot that most nearly interested we be mar hill whose rocky mount be in view from lodgings where we sit and converse together of the apostle paul preach the true god and in the sweet stillness which cover we spirit earnestly desire that the pure gospel might again be freely preach and receive throughout this interesting but desolated country there be not more than sixty really good house build in the town but include great and small there may be 1500 dwelling it be settle that athen shall be the seat of the greek government and the young king otho lay the foundation-stone of the new palace in he last visit to this place 18_th _ -- be anxious to get to patra in time to sail by a english packet to corfu we set

great apostle 's be for we spirit be clothe with mourning in contemplate the darkness of the place many person to whom we speak could not read and on offer a testament to the man of the inn he refuse to receive it we pursue we travels and at mid-day meet with a try detention from the muleteer have neglect to obtain a permission we be at length suffer to proceed but arrive late at a miserable khan where we pass the night in a loft this poor place could only furnish two mule and a donkey with a man to attend they but we be encourage to hope we should find four horse about two hour further on but here we be disappointed and could get no horse to proceed we feel truly destitute and take refuge in a loft from the scorching ray of the sun we have very little food with we and see no probability of quit we desolate abode till the next day at any rate thus situate we be endeavor to be reconcile to we allotment when most unexpectedly about two o'clock we espy a small fishing-boat sailing towards patra and immediately run down to the shore a considerable distance to make signal to the boat-man and inquire whether he would convey we to vostizza a place within a day 's journey of patras we directly procure a mule to convey we baggage to the shore and descend by a very rough path to a creek where the boat lay to here we be again detain by the guard make great difficulty in allow the boatman to take passenger without a permit which could only be obtain in the town so strict and perplexing be the regulation for traveller under the new government however after detain we a hour and cause we to lose most of the fair wind he suffer the man to take we we sail along pretty well for a time when the wind suddenly change and the boatman tell we we could not get to vostizza that night but add they would put we on shore where we should be within a hour 's walk of it and that we could readily find a mule to carry we baggage this we gladly accept and be soon land and on we way

could have dispose of they what a difference between this place and poor corinth we try journey through greece have give we a opportunity of judge of the state of thing and i hope will enable we to relieve some of they want it be cause of humble thankfulness to the father of mercy that he have preserve we in the midst of many danger and bring we in safety so far back on we way with heart fill

entrance a few day before we leave the island il take we to visit the jewish rabbi who though full of argument appear extremely dark and bewildered dwelling on mysterious word whose interpretation be confine to the rabbinical office he say they look for a temporal king who should give a temporal kingdom to israel it be a truly painful visit and we leave he with the desire that he might be instruct

school and the improvement of the temporal condition of the poorer class among whom they labor in a letter from william allen write the 31st of the third month occur the follow word of encouragement : -- i have hear through letter to you relation and other that you have be much discourage at not find a more ready entrance for you gospel message but really consider the darkness the sensuality and the superstition of the people in those part we must not calculate upon much in the begin if here and there one or two be awaken and enlighten they may be like seed sown and in the divine hand become instrument for the gathering of other should you be make the means of accomplish this in only a very few instance it will be worth all you trial and suffering and again you must consider that in the performance of you duty seed may be sow even _ unknown by you _ which may take root and grow and bring forth fruit to the praise of the great husbandman though you may never hear of it be encourage therefore dear friend to go on from day to day in simple reliance on you divine master without undue anxiety for consequence for depend upon it when he have no more work for you to do he will make you sensible of a release the passage to ancona be tedious we embark at noon and have a long passage to ancona of twelve day we land on the 29th and soon find ourselves occupy a empty room in the

preserve in a tolerable degree of health and in take a review of we visit to greece and the ionian island we be still sensible of a very peaceful feeling under a belief that we have follow the pointing of the great master and a hope that the day be not far distant when the way will be more fully open in those country to receive the gospel the preaching of john in the wilderness have often appear to we to be applicable to this people -- repent for the kingdom of heaven be at hand 7 _ mo _ 6 -- we leave ancona and take the route through foligno and arezzo to florence that part of the pope 's dominion through which we have pass be highly picturesque hill and dale continually and the whole country cultivate absolutely like a garden most of the town be on the hill and nothing can exceed the beauty of they situation but as to vital religion the spirit of those who desire the promotion of the redeemer 's kingdom on the broad and sound basis of common christianity must be clothe with mourning in pass through this superstitious and illiberal country what we have see of tuscany be not so fine but the appearance of the peasant be much superior the inn be much more agreeable than we find they on the road from geneva to ancona we arrive at florence on the 10th the person to whom we have recommendation be absent on account of the heat of the season except the abbot valianus a spiritually-minded man who show we great kindness he have refuse many advantageous offer of promotion choose to be content with a little rather than to be hamper with fetter which i believe he think unscriptural and not for the good of the church he be of the opinion that it would be better for the common people to have the bible and to be more acquaint with its contents he conduct we to see the school for mutual instruction found under the patronage of the grand duke about twelve year ago the school-room be very large airy and well light it be formerly a convent the system of education differ a little from that practice in england but the child about 240 in number be apparently under a efficient course of instruction and discipline the younger boy have a string put round the neck which confines they to the place during the lesson but i observe it do not confine they attention we be much pleased with the countenance and manners of the director the abbot luigus brocciolinus he

missionary meeting in which the minister olivier unfold he experience of a divine call to leave he country and go abroad on the service of the gospel the voice which he describe as have be sound in he spiritual ear and the manner in which he receive it must have strike john yeardley as singularly in accordance with the call to a similar service which he himself have hear so distinctly in he younger day and which like olivier he have for a long time hide in he heart 8 _ mo _ 4 -- in the evening i attend the missionary meeting in the chapel de l'oratoire pastor merle -lrb- d'aubigné -rrb- open the meeting by a short prayer and singing and then give a narrative of the liberation of the slave in the english colony accord to the account receive from england pastor olivier from lausanne be present he be about to depart for lower canada and he speak in a very touching manner of the way in which the mission have first open on he own mind when the concern be make know in he heart he keep it there

find they he say more liberal in they view than have be represent and they extent of usefulness be already considerable in they academy they instruct young man with a view to they become minister missionary school-master & c as the prospect for they future usefulness may open under the direction of divine providence in a place like geneva such a institution may be well : while we regard it with some caution lest it should run too high on point of doctrine we can not but hail with peculiar satisfaction such a favorable opportunity of educate young man in the sound principle of christianity that they may happily prove instrument in the divine hand to check the spread of infidelity from geneva they go to lausanne they old friend professor gaudin take they to see several pastor and other pious person and on first-day the 17th he and he family with some other serious-minded individual join they in they hour of worship at the inn it be say jy a time of a little

select a hymn most suit by its general character to the company at other time he would leave out a few verse and select other which he think might be sing with truth by the whole congregation but the thing become so burdensome that he be oblige for conscience ' sake to leave it altogether and sit down with a few other in silence at first they meet with opposition and even persecution from person who come to they meeting to disperse they on one of these occasion a few rude young man have band together to beset they the next meeting-day and disperse they ww be strongly impressed that it be

do not recollect that in my little experience i ever have more preparatory exercise of mind to pass through and i believe it have be the same with my dear jy we have however in many of we visit be much comfort under the belief that those who remain firm in the testimony give we to bear be in a more lively state and more band together than have be the case heretofore and that through the mercy of we holy head and high priest there be a renew visitation to many in the public meeting of which we have have many there have be a rather remarkable openness to receive the truth of the gospel unite with we view of the spirituality of this bless dispensation we approach this place in deep prostration of spirit and truly we feel that all the previous baptism have be needful in order to enable we in any degree to perform we duty here there have be a sore rending of the tenderest tie and the wound be not yet heal there be a few who entertain ultra view and they over-activity tend to keep up excitement in those who be waver and have not yet leave the society : this make it very difficult for moderate people to stand between they and call for very deep indwell with the bless source of love on the other hand there be i fear very many who rejoice in the delusive suggestion of we unwearied enemy -- that the cross of christ be not necessary -- that they may speak they own word and wear they own apparel and still be call by the name of he who die for they i think we never have have more to suffer than in some of the meeting we have attend from a disposition perhaps in some degree on both side to criticise ministry : still there be i believe many precious individual among the young and middle-aged who be under the form hand for usefulness there be indeed a loud call for laborer in this large and mixed meeting and we be ready to weep over the vacant seat of those who have desert they post and i greatly fear be seek to warm themselves and other with spark of they own kindling another

avail themselves of introduction by pious prostestant from place to place whilst they be careful as have always be they practice to wait in every successive step for the direction of the divine finger

refresh with the joyful language of david -- how excellent be thy loving-kindness o god therefore the child of man put they trust under the shadow of thy wing they shall be abundantly satisfy with the fatness of thy house and thou shalt make they drink of the river of thy pleasure for with thee be the fountain of life : in thy light shall we see light -- psa xxxvi 7-9 some letter which john and martha yeardley receive from england during they sojourn in pari show the strong sympathy which accompany they in they journey and contain at the same time reference to event which will be interesting to the reader south grove peckham 8 mo 12 1842 number vi 24-27 : -- the lord bless thee and keep thee the lord make he face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee the lord lift up he countenance upon thee and give thee peace and they shall put my name upon the child of israel and i will bless they to be pronounce by aaron the high priest and he successor as the type of he by whom all blessing and favor be bestow on the church and she child the above portion of holy scripture with the 121st psalm have be so sweetly in my remembrance since parting with my beloved friend john and martha yeardley that before retire for the night i transcribe the word which convey so much better than any language of my own the renew and abide desire under which they be commit to the care and guidance of the good shepherd in humble but confide belief that he will equally watch over guard and keep those who go and those who stay cause each amidst all variety of circumstance to realize the soul-cheering truth that at the throne of grace mercy be obtain and grace to help in time of need may the peace which passeth all understand keep we heart and mind through jesus christ pray you nearly-attached friend and sister e dudley the same to martha yeardley peckham 8 mo 21 1842 while in the sick-chamber of my sister instead of at meet it feel pleasant to devote part of the evening to thee my beloved friend i have enjoy the thought of you have a good sabbath at paris where no doubt a sphere of duty will be find and perhaps many exercise of faith and patience attend the labor of love which may await you there while in the spirit of true dedication and acquiescence so mercifully bestow upon you no commandment will be count grievous nor any service for you lord too hard or painful he word come sweetly to my mind as really the portion of a brother and sister dear in the bond and power of a endless life -- bless be you eye for they see and you ear for they hear account from various part of this land continue to indicate much unsettlement and there have be large company of chartist in the immediate vicinity of london but happily the civil power prove equal to they dispersion one would hope the abundant harvest now ready to be gather may turn the current of feeling and induce the desire rather to praise the lord for he goodness than to spend time and strength in murmuring and disputing with they fellow-mortal the destruction not only of property but of life in some recent contest be quite appalling and we certainly live in very eventful time the tendency however both of the good and evil be so obviously towards a increase of light and knowledge that it seem warrantable to expect _ all _ will be overrule to better view and practice become more general and the kingdom of this world be thankfully surrender to the righteous government of the prince of peace but alas deep and complicate may be the suffering yet behind for the church and she child to endure whether in be sharer in or but the witness of what be pronounced upon the world of the ungodly from john rowntree scarborough 8 mo 29 1842 the account of you proceedings at amien have be particularly interesting to I whether manufacture employment be unfavorable or otherwise to moral and religion character or whether it be merely the larger earnings which artizan receive enable they more glaringly to gratify they natural and corrupt inclination than agricultural laborer can do whether the passive ignorance of the country laborer or the more active and intelligent habit yet combine with moral darkness of the manufacturing operative most retard the diffusion of religious truth be serious question for we in this country we manufacturer have be alarming the whole nation and threaten we with something like political revolution but they have receive a severe lesson and many of we jail be fill with the victim of unprincipled agitator consider how little of the christian spirit be generally find in the operation of government the treatment of these poor creature have on the whole be lenient and no very severe punishment be anticipate whether the people of this nation have learn more of righteousness from the judgment of the lord which have i think evidently be make know in this part of he earth be perhaps know only to he who knoweth all thing i often fear -- for surely there be very much of darkness and wickedness among we -- yet i can not unfrequently hope that light be spread and that although the power of evil be active and strongly develop yet the active diffusion of the means of good more than keep pace with they greater be he that be in you than he that be in the world be still a console assurance to many dejected yet hope believer we dear friend hannah c backhouse be strong in the faith that light increase that the field be white already for harvest and that the lord of the harvest be prepare and send forth laborer into he harvest the protestant whom you find at amien and in some other place would probably remain totally unknown to ordinary traveller and perhaps we do not enough consider how little known in a great nation the salt that preserve it may be the report from the agent of the bible society in france seem to I more than usually encouraging i hope you may be enable to impart some spiritual gift or knowledge to many hidden one who appear to be hunger and thirst after righteousness in that vain-glorious nation and that you faith may be strengthen by meeting with such john and martha yeardley arrive at lyon on the 13th and after make some call intend to proceed to nisme the next day but not feel satisfied to leave the city so soon they conclude to remain there one day more and they have cause to be thankful in have take this course for say jy we have make the acquaintance of several religious person a evangelist and colporteur name hermann lange a german swiss take we to see some protestant convert amongst whom we have find much of the interior life the lord give I a word of exhortation for they and help I to utter it in french we have a conversation with we friend lange respect the ministry in we society like many other person he suppose we have no recognize minister we explain the usage of friend and show he we certificate with which he be pleased he admire the good order in use amongst we and say that he have for a long time desire to be inform respect the principle of friend that he think as we do that a express call of the holy spirit be necessary to the ministry and that woman as well as man ought to be allow to preach i feel intimately unite to he in spirit : on parting we give he some tract explanatory of we principle lyon be the head-quarter of popery the jesuit here exert a strong influence with the government against the protestant we visit a good man name elfenbein who with he wife be very useful to the awaken protestant he be a colporteur and introduce the holy scripture into family to whom he speak concern the thing of god he and he wife call upon we in we hotel on parting he propose we should pray together this give we the opportunity of explain we sentiment regard prayer and we propose remain a while in silence and if it should please the lord to put word of prayer into we heart we would express they with the help of the holy spirit after a time of silence elfenbein pray for we with unction in a few word : it be a favored time thanks be to god on the 15th they resume they journey and pass through nisme proceed to congeny they find there edward and john pea who be travel on a religious errand and be about conclude they labor in those part the meeting be a source of comfort on both side the next day which be first-day be a solemn season : the gospel message be largely deliver in the little meeting-house and christine majolier interpret for those who speak in english the two-month ' meeting be hold and here as well indeed as on

attend the usual meeting for worship distribute religious tract in the city and its environs and institute a scripture reading meeting for the young but the object which most strongly engage they

accessible to the child of those friend who live at a distance and soon after lm die even this be give up and the means of education in the society fail altogether in they project for supply this deficiency john and martha yeardley find the parent and other friend ready to second they effort and at the two-month ' meeting in the eleventh month it be resolve to establish in the first place a school for girl only at nisme and a committee be appoint to carry this resolution into effect a mistress be find without much difficulty in justine bénézet a valuable friend who have have for sixteen

the mind of you hearer the inestimable value of the holy scripture when properly receive and make available by the enlighten influence of the holy spirit and the worthlessness -- nay the danger -- of rest satisfied with a mere knowledge of they word the word of we lord be spirit and life to those who would receive they as such yet how many who hear they be to be judge by they at the that day

be express for the destitute artizan and a liberal subscription be commence and be to be carry forward in all we meeting for they relief : a few day ago it amount to # 800 -- i hope it will exceed # 1000 : but what be that it may be say among so many yet i hope much good may be do by it and friend in other part of the nation seem to be consider whether they ought not to make some effort for similar purpose at liverpool we hear that upward of # 200 have be raise you will probably have hear of the very sudden death of jonathan backhouse whilst he wife be labor under a religious engagement in the north of we county he change seem a translation from that state of strong but imperfect love which a member of the militant church might feel here below to that fullness of love which he savior

house fc read the parable of the great supper -lrb- luke xiv -rrb- and make some remark in explication of it after which pastor chabrand speak with much feeling on the influence of the holy spirit the gradual operation of the spirit in the secret of the soul and the preciousness of dwelling in christ as the branch in the vine in order to bear fruit pastor chabrand tell we in conversation that the first time he really see the state of he soul and he need of a savior be in the meeting-house at westminster during half a hour 's silence after this time of precious silence a minister arise -lrb- 8 -rrb- and speak in so remarkable a manner to he state unfold the history of he life that he be melt to tear ever since that time he have appreciate the principle of we religious society and particularly we practice of wait upon god in silence these remark open we way to speak on a subject which have often give we pain in we intercourse with pious people viz the practice of go suddenly from one religious exercise to another we express we opinion that christian in general in they worship would derive more edification from what be speak if they be to dwell under the good feeling which be sometimes raise before pass so precipitately to singing or even to prayer with this he entirely agree and think it a point of the utmost importance he wish it could be put in practice for they church in general suffer loss for want of more quiet gathering of spirit before god john and martha yeardley do not go further towards the west than toulouse on quit that city they turn northwards to montauban for several day so they write before reach the extent of we journey westward we travel through a fertile country have the pyrenean mountain on the south cover with snow a magnificent sight

and some remark make by the professor he then kindly say if we have any word of exhortation in we heart he hope we should feel quite at liberty to express it we feel it right to make some observation with reference to the fore-part of the chapter which set forth that state of christian experience in which the mind be prepare to participate in the many precious promise contain in the middle and latter portion ability be also give we to express we faith in the one savior and mediator and in the influence and guidance of the holy spirit and he office in the sanctification of the soul this favored opportunity close with supplication we be well satisfy with we visit to this place it have remove some prejudice from we mind and perhaps may have show to those with whom we have have intercourse that friend be sound in the faith the short time we spend with professor de félice have leave a sweet impression on we mind he mourn over the want of spiritual life among the protestant of montauban amid as he say much preaching and many appeal to conscience at castre where they stop on the 26th they visit the orphan house and hold intercourse with the pastor and with a pious lawyer on we journey say john yeardley we have hear of a man near this town who bear the name of quaker and we inquire of the lawyer if he know whether he be sound in the christian faith the lawyer speak with respect of the so-called quaker but think that in he opinion he favor arianism if so say i rather hastily we will not seek he or recognize why say the advocate it be the very reason you should go to see he and try to do he good at this reply my conscience be sting on account of my hasty conclusion and after reflect on the matter we walk next morning five or six mile into the country in search of the new friend he receive we with joy and we soon satisfied ourselves as to he soundness in the christian faith but he be rather ardent in he expectation of the reign of christ on the earth twenty year ago he refuse to take a oath on a jury the judge tell he he must go to prison to which the friend reply i be willing to go to prison but i can not swear to condemn any person to death if you place I as juryman i shall acquit all the criminal the judge believe he scruple to be sincere dismiss he without further trouble this dear man attach himself to we in such a manner that it be difficult to part from he he press we to remain some day in he house but this we duty do not permit from castre they return through béziers to nisme visit various little company of protestant by the

flock to we they black eye sparkling with joy while they cling round we with they little arm to be embrace the harmony and peaceful feeling which pervade the family be truly comforting to we heart in take a retrospect of what they have do up to this time they write thus to they friend in england : -- the manner in which we gracious lord have condescend to open the way for a portion of labor in this part of he vineyard add a grain to we faith : the service which have hitherto fall to we lot on this journey be of that nature towards which we have a view before we leave we native land and we be bind gratefully to acknowledge amid many conflict and discouragement that sweet peace be sometimes we portion but we dear friend in england will readily conceive that we baptism be various and deep during we separation from the bosom of we own little visible church and we hope to retain a place in they sympathy and prayer when they be favor with access to the throne of mercy we love flow freely and unceasingly to all we dear friend from whom it be always comforting to hear brethren pray for we that the word of the lord may have free course and be glorify on the 18th of the fourth month they

receive another invitation from the pastor to a meeting where only the scripture would be read we think it best to accept it and by go a little before the time propose we have a very interesting conversation with the pastor he wife and a young englishwoman on we peculiar view the meeting be a assembly of various class with a preponderance of young person and be a very interesting occasion : many of the young people be deeply affect in the morning of this day we have be to see a aged catholic woman of the jansenist persuasion : she appear to have no dependence but on she savior and full of faith and love to have she conversation in heaven she give we a sweet benediction at parting they leave grenoble on the 25th and pursue they way by chambéry to geneva take care to dispose of most of they french tract by the way lest they should be stop at the savoy custom-house they arrive in the city of calvin on the 27th here as on former occasion they find much to interest they several of the minister and professor whom they have know before seem to have become more spiritually-minded and with the flock of the deceased pastor monnié in particular of precious memory they be unite in near christian fellowship it seem to we they write that the feeling be spread of the necessity of the immediate guidance of the holy spirit and we believe that this view of the gospel with that of the universality of divine love be much more calculate to win upon unbeliever and to enlighten romanist than the high calvinistic doctrine which have so generally prevail and which impede the growth of christian humility and daily dependence on divine help at we little meeting on first-day morning we have the company of a widow and she daughter the former be like a mother to those around she who be seek spiritual thing and we be much comfort together she invite we to tea and to have a meeting in she house the next evening : a considerable number be collect among whom be a pastor several professor and many female the pastor read a chapter and when after a time of silence the way open for communication it be like cast seed into prepared ground and the retirement of spirit before the lord which we recommend seem really to be experience before we separate it be a silence to be feel better than express amongst other pious person in this city they have a introduction to the countess de sellon she receive we say jy with open heart say i be fond of the principle of you society believe they have the real substance of religion strip of its form she ask we many question and we feel

interested by a pious magistrate frossard de saugy near relative to a dear friend of ours at geneva he inquire respect the education of child of whom he have many -- by what mean he could make they sensible of vital religion we reply that all we could do be to represent to they the love and mercy of we bless redeemer and recommend they to cherish the conviction of he holy spirit which be very early bestow upon we all : he entirely unite in we view from lausanne they go to yverdun and the day after to neufchâtel since they last visit in 1834 some who be very dear to they have be summon to

deep conflict to pass through which he confide to he mother and which he seem to think be the presage to suffer in perform some gymnastic exercise he receive a fall on the head which after some time be follow by a paralytic affection of the whole body so that he become entirely helpless and he speech be take away it be only he tender mother who could ascertain he want and administer to they which she do with unceasing assiduity after about six month he speech be almost miraculously restore and he use it in praise the lord for the remarkable support and consolation of he spirit he say he have be sensible of all that have pass and that he have be abundantly confirm in the belief that true religion consist in hear the voice of we bless redeemer and seek to do he will after some time the capability of speak much again forsake he yet he linger some month longer and when my beheld he soon after we arrival he appear like a precious lamb purify and wait to be gather to the everlasting fold the resignation of he parent be truly edifying : they propose that we should both come the next day and sit quietly beside he for a while this prove a deeply impressive time the presence of the great shepherd be evidently with we and call forth thanksgive for the mercy receive and the deliverance anticipate while listen to a few word address to he at parting he fix he die eye upon we with a expression not to be forget and before midnight the precious spirit be receive into the arm of its savior as we leave for locle early in the morning we do not hear of this until we return the day follow they visit to they favorite orphan-institution be as ever very interesting they thus describe the state in which they find it : -- we dear german friend m zimmerlin the associate of dear m a calame still live : she receive we with overflow affection after tea which we take there she hasten to show we the improvement in the premise which she say we kind friend in england have contribute to

present day the lord be lead many of he devoted child to listen to he voice that they might be bring more under the teaching of he spirit and from this would flow they consolation this -lrb- they observe -rrb- be the more remarkable as when we be here before she hold view on election and the _ finish _ work of grace almost to the exclusion of the work of ` regeneration and the renew of the holy ghost ' we find in some here write john yeardley in he diary a desire for food of a more spiritual nature : they really enjoy wait on the lord in silence but the customary activity be strong and not easily break through i trust the day will come when silence will more prevail in the assembly of the people we leave berne with feeling of peace and of much affection for many in that place and thankful to we heavenly father in that he have prepare the heart of he people to receive the invitation to feed on that spiritual food which alone can nourish the soul to eternal life they arrive at

missionary speak on the importance of unite in desire for a more general outpouring of the spirit : jy also speak much to the same effect it be we trust a profitable season but the reflection arise on this occasion as it have do on some other when among serious person not of we profession that if they would but suffer the degree of divine influence mercifully afford thoroughly to baptize the heart with the true baptism much creaturely activity would be do away and the light of the gospel would shine in they and through they in much greater purity we pay and receive visit they continue from some of the _ intérieurs _ whom we have know before and have to lament something of a visionary spirit in the midst of right feeling we recommend simplicity and close attention to the scripture and to the

at barman mention to they that four of he fellow-countryman have be for a time at kreuznach on hearing this place name it occur to jy that it would be well for they to take it in they way they have

that within a few month several hundred bible and testament have be send into bohemia and have be eagerly buy there by awaken person he think that if a translation could be make into the bohemian

way we meet at the pastor 's louse superintendent huber a worthy and experienced christian kind and fatherly to we the next day william rasche go with pastor landesen to hire a carriage no such thing however be to be have and they would have be happy if they could have engage as good a vehicle as they old crazy _ taranta _ for the only alternative be a _ bauer-wagen _ -lrb- peasant 's cart -rrb- if we except the very expensive extra-post carriage with which they would have be oblige to take a conductor it happen that a young man a apothecary 's assistant want to go to iekaterinoslav he ancestor be german and he could speak both that language and russ by landesen 's recommendation they take he as they companion and he be very useful to they on the road the _ bauer-wagen _ be much more uncomfortable than the _ taranta _ have be travel in it be like gallopping over a bad road in a english farmer 's waggon and as the vehicle have no cover the traveller be expose without protection to the full power of the sun the floor of the waggon be spread with mattress and thus furnish it serve they for parlor kitchen and lodging-room they travel in this way through the night but the next day be oblige to wait at a small dirty station for horse till the afternoon and in the evening john yeardley become so ill from hard travel and exposure to the heat that they be compel to alight at another little station near novomoskovsk and make the best of the poor accommodation they could procure the next morning somewhat refresh by rest they go forwards to iekaterinoslav where they happily meet with a clean inn the hotel suisse keep by a german the same day they go in a boat up the river samava to rybalsk seven mile to see a german schoolmaster name schreitel to whom they have a letter of introduction this be a colony of twenty-five family found in 1788 : the schoolmaster who be also the minister receive they in a brotherly manner it be here that they mission properly commence from this place a succession of german colony extend in a south-easterly direction to the sea of azov the village be all build on the same pattern be form of one straight street of neat house on both side adorn with tree in front and garden behind the german colonist consist principally of mennonite and lutheran the former be the most numerous and thrive they be invite to settle there by catherine the great in order to improve the state of agriculture but they example have not have the desire influence on the surround district although he german neighbor be in a infinitely better condition than himself the russian peasant will not imitate the husbandry which be practice so successfully before he eye at rybalsk john yeardley have a scripture reading and a religious opportunity with a few serious person who come to the house and the next evening he hold a meeting for worship with the colonist on the 3rd they leave for neuhoffnung they travel in a covered carriage which though without spring be a great improvement on they last vehicle they come the first day as for as konskus where they pass the night sleep in the carriage the air be very mild the night through in the afternoon they arrive at another mennonite colony schönweise where they have a short interview with pastor obermanz and a few of he flock these people produce a small quantity of silk the

priship and petershagen the settler here be from all part of germany mostly from prussium and würtemberg next come halbstadt the seat of the bishop and alexanderwohl where the friend pass the night they be surround by a large number of settlement on all side these be the place where accord to he previous impression and apprehension of duty john yeardley be to have enter on that work of gospel-labor to which he have so long look forward but instead of finding as on former occasion of a similar kind he heart enlarged and he mouth open to preach the word he seem now to have feel himself straiten in spirit and to have be oblige to pass in silence from colony to colony a wonder perhaps to other a cause of humiliation to himself never before in all he many journeying have such a trial befall he and it may be suppose that come so soon after the copious and unrestrained exercise of he gift which he have experience in norway it would press upon he with peculiar force the people to whom he be now come seem it be true to have be in a different state from the simple-hearted norwegian who thirst for the pure milk of the word and they comparative indifference to spiritual thing may have be a main cause of the silence which he feel to be impose upon he with the reserve natural to he he have leave but little clue to the motive and feeling under which he act great must have be the relief when as happen on several occasion he bond be loosen and the command be renew to speak in the name of he only-loved and gracious lord on the 5th they pass through several colony to gnadenfeld where say jy : -- we halt to breakfast with one of the colonist and find he a sweet-spirited man and he family pious he name be david voote he appreciate the object of we mission and speak

come out into the tumbler a white liquid and after the tea be put in the innkeeper hold up the pot against the moon and look curiously into it instead of retire early as the tartar always do the man in the hut keep a watch upon the traveller and the suspicion even of the driver be awaken when one of they come to he as he be lie by he horse to borrow he knife he horse however be so weary and he himself so unwilling to move that the traveler contented themselves with harness the horse and make ready to depart in case of necessity soon after midnight finding they be still watch by the tartar

and full of tenderness and on he young friend inquire what have make he cry out in the night he tell she that he must return home for there be more work for he to do he say that a prospect of service in the gospel have latterly open before he and that as he have greatly desire to remain in switzerland he have strive against the sense of duty and refuse to yield but that during the night he have have a vision in which he hear the command repeat to return home and enter again upon he labor and that he feel as he think the touch of the heavenly messenger 's hand this cause he to call out and when he awake he find that willingness of spirit have take the place of he former obstinacy thus turn from he own purpose he set about to accomplish the will of he gracious master with he usual resolution and they make the best of they way back to england the nature of the service which he see before he be touch upon in the following passage from a letter date neuveville the 14th of the tenth month my home duty press heavily upon I very long have i think about the young man and the younger part of we society and i have a hope the way will be make for my finding access to they in a religious and social point of view should it be permit the lord grant that it may tend to mutual comfort john yeardley return through pari he spend a day or two in that great city which he never see so quiet and free from soldier we extract from he diary a short note of a conversation which take place at the _ table d'hôte _ of the hotel where he lodge and which appear to we to be of a instructive character two man contend respect the motive by which mankind be influence to good action one attribute it to _ reason _ the other hold that it be _ virtue _ which restrain from evil and impel to good and maintain that we must do good action from the love of justice and virtue and not from the fear of punishment or the hope of reward the latter have the advantage over he antagonist in the argument : -- i have not say jy take part in the conversation but at the close i feel constrain to tell the _ christian _ that i confess myself on he side because he have defend the truth only that what he call _ virtue _ i call _ the action of the spirit of god in the heart of man _ with much animation he clasp my hand in he and cry that be the very thing -- that be just what i mean in the year 1856 he engage in two religious visit at home both of they in accordance with the kind of service which have be unfold to he in the retirement of neuveville viz mingled religious and social intercourse with he younger fellow-member in read the expression of he feeling in the prospect of the former of these engagement it be instructive to remark that the same sense of entire dependence which have bow he spirit when require in early life to make the first offering of this kind be present with he when now call upon to go forth in he master 's name for the twentieth time and when age and experience have give he reverence among man 1 _ mo _ 8 -- to-morrow be we monthly meeting when i expect to propose to my friend a visit to the meeting compose the quarterly meeting of bristol and somerset and gloucester and wilt every time any fresh exercise turn up for I it always feel as if it be the _ first _ time of enter into the holy harness if my friend permit I to proceed i hope i shall be help through it but it look formidable 21_st _ -- bristol be like a great mountain look I in the face and weigh heavily upon my heart the follow short memorandum of the way in which he be engage at bristol be take from he letter the diary during he later year supplies few note either of he labor or he experience : -- 3 _ mo _ -- i meet at richard fry 's house a large number of young man and woman teacher of the first-day school forty-eight be present a opportunity be offer for my receive and also communicate information respect school and education what make the subject more interesting in bristol be the attendance of more than one hundred of the school child at meeting on first-day morning which i think have be the practice for about ten year and they behavior be orderly and good 31_st _ -- i be somewhat busily employ in this busy city in visit the young man i find very ready access to they and my engagement have the hearty concurrence of all my friend i be abundantly convince that it would have be a great mistake to have run away from the place without make the attempt at the performance of the present service the usual meeting for worship have be season of divine favor some of they i think extraordinarily so which i consider a great mercy in my heavenly father when i consider the weakness of the poor instrument it have be announce for I to give a lecture this evening in the large meeting-house on my travels in europe a _ sound _ which almost frighten I friend really do not know what a poor thing i be by the kindness of a friend we have be supply with a please personal reminiscence of john yeardley 's visit to bristol which will help to represent he as he be in later year bristol 6 mo 8 1859 since thou inform I of thy intention to compile a memoir of we late dear friend john yeardley i have endeavor to recall the circumstance of he visit to this city in the spring of the year 1856 my impression be that the most striking feature in he character be he childlike simplicity both in word and conduct this very characteristic whilst it really increase he influence for good especially with the young render it perhaps more difficult to trace and now to describe the precise manner in which it be exercise i believe that he christian labor here be very seasonable and very important and that he be enable to perform a service which scarcely any one else would have be equally qualify to render there be in he so far as my observation go no approach towards a assumption of spiritual dignity nor be there on the other hand that which be perhaps a more frequent defect anything of _ feign _ humility he whole character seem to I perfectly unaffected to whatever extent therefore he natural disposition may have fit he for profitable intercourse with the young i think that the quality which i have attempt to describe render he peculiarly acceptable to they many time whilst he be amongst we he allude -- i believe even in he public ministry -- to he delight in they society somewhat in this manner : i love the company of those who tread the earth with a elastic step this prominent trait in he character be a striking illustration of what may be term _ the corrective tendency _ of true religion by which in advanced life he be enable to place himself under the precious influence of the love of christ in thorough sympathy with those whose circumstance in many respects be so different from he own but my object be to describe john yeardley 's meeting in bristol the truth be however that in describe the man one seem most truly to describe he service in addition to he family visit he meet a large company of we member in we meeting-house and give a interesting narrative of he journey in southern russium and greece he afterwards invite many of we young friend especially those who be engage as teacher in we first-day school to spend a evening with he meet at the house of a kind friend we have a opportunity of hearing from he own lip some interesting detail of he labor chiefly i think in reference to the school in greece with characteristic simplicity he make various inquiry respect we own first-day school in which he feel a deep interest the occasion be of a very sociable and easy character and well calculate to promote in he young friend the _ healthy tone _ of religious feeling which seem so peculiarly to belong to himself after martha yeardley 's decease and as year roll on he mind dwelt still more habitually and more confidingly than ever on the approach end of the race 4 _ mo _ 24 -- i can not say my spirit be always

month \* \* \* \* \* of the fruit which john yeardley have bequeath to we in the history of he life and christian experience none perhaps be of higher value than he diligent improvement of the talent he possess and he steady and persevere pursuit of what he have in view it be not so much what ability a man have that determine he place in society and the amount of he influence as the use which he make of they of this truth john yeardley be a striking example we have hear he say in one of he early diary : i have clearly see for what service i be design in the church militant here on earth therefore through the assistance of divine grace i hope to pursue nothing but in subordination to this main design the service to which he be call be the christian ministry and lay aside every meaner ambition and indeed every other object he address himself to preparation for this service as the labor of he life he cultivate those habit of mind and body and confine himself to the acquisition of those branch of knowledge which while they leave he heavenly gift free and unsullied would best subserve the exercise of it he industry and perseverance be remarkable in none of he pursuit be these quality more conspicuous than in he study of language it cost he especially a almost incredible amount of labor to master french the slight elementary knowledge of this language which he acquire at bentham can not have give he so much as a insight into it he acquaintance with it may be say to date from he visit to congeny when he have reach he fortieth year yet by indefatigable exertion maintain during many year he become able to write and speak it fluently though not correctly and even to preach without a interpreter the difficulty which he encounter in the acquisition of language from the late period of life at which he commence be enhance by he ignorance of latin that best trainer of the youthful faculty and by a natural inaptitude for the memory of word a proof of the latter occur when with he quick-witted wife he be occupy in conning over the italian and modern greek grammar in preparation for they journey to the ionian island the difference in they natural capacity in this respect be show in she playful expression i get my lesson in half a hour while john have be three or four hour over he and do not know it yet but although slow in study he be quick and shrewd in the observation of actual life this be apparent in he daily converse and it may also be continually trace in he diary where describe those with whom he become acquaint in he numerous travels he seize on the prominent feature of they mind or manners and with a word affix to each he own particular mark of the hundred of individual who rise into view one after another in the course of these journey scarcely two be alike a result which be perhaps due as much to the pen of the writer as to the inherent diversity of the human character to this shrewdness of observation he add a racy humor which those who know he in he hour of relaxation and familiarity will not easily forget he mind be store with quaint and pithy phrase and apt illustration which he not unfrequently seasoned with he native idiom the broad barnsley dialect he north-country pronunciation indeed never entirely forsake he and the singular graft of german which he make upon it during he residence abroad cause it to be commonly suppose by those who be stranger to he history that he be a native of germany the same moral constitution that enable john yeardley to pursue he object with indomitable perseverance sometimes betray he as may easily be imagine into a tenacity of purpose border upon obstinacy to the same strength of will also act on the defect incident to a neglect education in early life must be attribute those strong prejudice which be at time to be remark in he and of which he find it extremely difficult to divest himself but it be the triumph of grace that whilst these fault of character and disposition remain for the most part only as a hidden thorn the messenger of satan to buffet he the virtue to which they be ally and all the faculty of he mind be consecrate to the service of god and of he fellow-man and he whole nature be enlarged refine and elevate by the all-powerful energy of the gospel very sweet and instructive be we recollection of the humility of he walk amongst we and of the liveliness of he ministry mark as it be by much simplicity love and earnestness to this testimony of he monthly meeting all who be accustom to hear he will readily subscribe we be able to append some note of a few of he public testimony which we give as likely to be at once gratify and instructive to the reader the friend to whom we be indebted for they inform we that the note be write immediately after meeting and be as nearly the word use as he memory would furnish he add they bring before the mind 's eye and ear the face and voice of a dear depart friend and i believe a true and
