enough greasy odor except upon the weekly occasion of Monday 's boil dinner and whatever the status of liver and dry peach can corn and round steak she menu remain static -- so static that in the gas-lighted basement dining-room and at a remote end of the long well-surrounded table mr katz with she napkin tuck well under she third chin turn _ sotto _ from the protrude husband at she right to she left neighbor shield she remark with she hand be i right mr finshriber i just say to my husband in the five year we be here she should just give we once a change from friday-night lamb and noodle say you should complain yet with I it be six and a half year day after to-morrow easter day since i ask myself that question first even my irving say to I to-night up in the room jump up and down on

spritz say at she boarding-house they get for breakfast : fry -- you can imagine mr katz since my poor husband 's death how much appetite i get leave but i say mr katz just for the principle of the thing it would not hurt once if mr kaufman could give somebody else besides she own daughter and vetsburg the white meat from everything would not it it be a shame before the boarder she know mr pinshriber how my husband like breast from the chicken you think once he get it no i always tell he not 'til chicken come doublebreasted like overcoat can he get it in this house with vetsburg such a star boarder last night 's chicken let I tell you i do not wish it to a dog such a piece of dark meat with gizzard i have to swallow mrs katz adjust with greater security the expanse of white napkin across she ample bosom gold ring and a quarter-inch marriage band flash in and out among the litter of small tub-shaped dish surround she and a pounce fork of short sure stab right away my husband get mad when i say the same thing ` when we do not like it we should move ' he say like move be so easy if you get two chair and a hair mattress to take with you but i always say mr katz i do not blame mr kaufman herself for what go on there be _ one _ good woman if there ever be one they do not come any better or any better look my husband always say 's - ay ' i tell he ` she can stand she good look ' it be that big-ideaed daughter who be to blame do you see she new white spat to-night right away the minute they come out she have to have 'em i be only surprised she ` be not get one of they red hat from gimp 's what be all the fad believe I if not for such idea she mother could afford something better as succotash for we for supper it be a shame let I tell you that a woman like mr kaufman can not see for herself such thing god forbid i should ever be so blind to my irving i tell you that ruby have get it more like a queen than a boarding-housekeeper 's daughter spat yet rich girl could be glad to have it always so good i do not say nothing how she mother treat vetsburg she oldest boarder and for what he pay for that second floor front and no lunch she can afford to cater a little but that such a girl should not be make to take up a little stenography or help with the housework s-ay when that girl even turn a hand pale like a ghost she mother get how girl be raise nowadays even the poor one i be not the one to complain mr katz but just look down there that red stuff where be not it cranberry between ruby and vetsburg yes yes and look such a dish of it be it right extra should be allow to be bring on a table like this where fourteen other boarder get to let they mouth water and look at it you think it do not hurt like a knife for myself i do not mind but my irving how that child love 'em and he should get to sit at the same table without cranberry from the head of the table the flash implement of carve hold in askance for stroke she lip lift to a smile and a simulation of interest for display of further carnivorous appetite mr kaufman pass she nod from one to the other miss arndt little more no mr krakower gravy mr suss mr suss so simon mr schloss miss horowitz mr

impressed into it the coat hike center back the pocket-flaps half in half out and the knee sag out of press that be right mr vetsburg you should scold she when she do not eat above the black-bombazine basque so pleasantly relieve at the throat by a v of fresh white net a wave of color move up mr kaufman 's face into she architectural coiffure the very black and very coarse skein of she hair wound into a large loose mound directly atop she head and pierce there with a ball-topped comb of another decade i always say mr vetsburg she mind you before she mind anybody else in the world ma say miss kaufman close upon that remark some succotash please from she vantage down-table mr katz lean a bit forward from the line look mr finshriber how for a woman she age she snap she black eye at he it be
