: through you i beg leave to inform the senate that on Wednesday the 4th instant at 12 o'clock i shall be ready to take the oath prescribe by the constitution previously to enter on a discharge of my official duty and at such place as the senate may think proper to designate i be very respectfully sir you obedient servant andrew jackson first inaugural address fellow-citizen : about to undertake the arduous duty that i have be appoint to perform by the choice of a free people i avail myself of this customary and solemn occasion to express the gratitude which they confidence inspire and to acknowledge the accountability which my situation enjoin while the magnitude of they interest convince I that no thanks can be adequate to the honor they have confer it admonish I that the best return i can make be the zealous dedication of my humble ability to they service and they good as the instrument of the federal constitution it will devolve on I for a stated period to execute the law of the united state to superintend they foreign and they confederate relation to manage they revenue to command they force and by communication to the legislature to watch over and to promote they interest generally and the principle of action by which i shall endeavor to accomplish this circle of duty it be now proper for I briefly to explain in administer the law of congress i shall keep steadily in view the limitation as well as the extent of the executive power trust thereby to discharge the function of my office without transcend its authority with foreign nation it will be my study to preserve peace and to cultivate friendship on fair and honorable term and in the adjustment of any difference that may exist or arise to exhibit the forbearance become a powerful nation rather than the sensibility belong to a gallant people in such measure as i may be call on to pursue in regard to the rights of the separate state i hope to be animated by a proper respect for those sovereign member of we union take care not to confound the power they have reserve to themselves with those they have grant to the confederacy the management of the public revenue -- that search operation in all government -- be among the most delicate and important trust in ours and it will of course demand no inconsiderable share of my official solicitude under every aspect in which it can be consider it would appear that advantage must result from the observance of a strict and faithful economy this i shall aim at the more anxiously both because it will facilitate the extinguishment of the national debt the unnecessary duration of which be incompatible with real independence and because it will counteract that tendency to public and private profligacy which a profuse expenditure of money by the government be but too apt to engender powerful auxiliary to the attainment of this desirable end be to be find in the regulation provide by the wisdom of congress for the specific appropriation of public money and the prompt accountability of public officer with regard to a proper selection of the subject of impost with a view to revenue it would seem to I that the spirit of equity caution and compromise in which the constitution be form require that the great interest of agriculture commerce and manufacture should be equally favor and that perhaps the only exception to this rule should consist in the peculiar encouragement of any product of either of they that may be find essential to we national independence internal improvement and the diffusion of knowledge so far as they can be promote by the constitutional act of the federal government be of high importance consider stand army as dangerous to free government in time of peace i shall not seek to enlarge we present establishment nor disregard that salutary lesson of political experience which teach that the military should be hold subordinate to the civil power the gradual increase of we navy whose flag have display in distant clime we skill in navigation and we fame in arm the preservation of we fort arsenal and dockyard and the introduction of progressive improvement in the discipline and science of both branch of we military service be so plainly prescribe by prudence that i should be excuse for omit they mention sooner than for enlarge on they importance but the bulwark of we defense be the national militia which in the present state of we intelligence and population must render we invincible as long as we government be administer for the good of the people and be regulate by they will as long as it secure to we the rights of person and of property liberty of conscience and of the press it will be worth defend and so long as it be worth defend a patriotic militia will cover it with a impenetrable aegis partial injury and occasional mortification we may be subject to but a million of armed freeman possess of the means of war can never be conquer by a foreign foe to any just system therefore calculate to strengthen this natural safeguard of the country i shall cheerfully lend all the aid in my power it will be my sincere and constant desire to observe toward the indian tribe within we limit a just and liberal policy and to give that humane and considerate attention to they rights and they want which be consistent with the habit of we government and the feeling of we people the recent demonstration of public sentiment inscribe on the list of executive duty in character too legible to be overlook the task of _ reform _ which will require particularly the correction of those abuse that have bring the patronage of the federal government into conflict with the freedom of election and the counteraction of those cause which have disturb the rightful course of appointment and have place or continue power in unfaithful or incompetent hand in the performance of a task thus generally delineate i shall endeavor to select man whose diligence and talent will insure in they respective station able and faithful cooperation depend for the advancement of the public service more on the integrity and zeal of the public officer than on they number a diffidence perhaps too just in my own qualification will teach I to look with reverence to the example of public virtue leave by my illustrious predecessor and with veneration to the light that flow from the mind that found and the mind that reform we system the same diffidence induce I to hope for instruction and aid from the coordinate branch of the government and for the indulgence and support of my fellow-citizen generally and a firm reliance on the goodness of that power whose providence mercifully protect we national infancy and have since uphold we liberty in various vicissitude encourage I to offer up my ardent supplication that he will continue to make we beloved country the object of he divine care and gracious benediction march 4 1829 special message _ march 6 1829 _ _ the senate of

task devolve on I under a provision of the constitution to present to you as the federal legislature of twenty-four sovereign state and 12000000 happy people a view of we affair and to propose such measure as in the discharge of my official function have suggest themselves as necessary to promote the object of we union in communicate with you for the first time it be to I a source of unfeigned satisfaction call for mutual gratulation and devout thanks to a benign providence that we be at peace with all mankind and that we country exhibit the most cheer evidence of general welfare and progressive improvement turn we eye to other nation we great desire be to see we brethren of the human race secure in the blessing enjoy by ourselves and advance in knowledge in freedom and in social happiness we foreign relation although in they general character pacific and friendly present subject of difference between we and other power of deep interest as well to the country at large as to many of we citizen to effect a adjustment of these shall continue to be the object of my earnest endeavor and notwithstanding the difficulty of the task i do not allow myself to apprehend unfavorable result bless as we country be with everything which constitute national strength she be fully adequate to the maintenance of all she interest in discharge the responsible trust confide to the executive in this respect it be my settled purpose to ask nothing that be not clearly right and to submit to nothing that be wrong and i flatter myself that support by the other branch of the government and by the intelligence and patriotism of the people we shall be able under the protection of providence to cause all we just rights to be respect of the unsettled matter between the united state and other power the most prominent be those which have for year be the subject of negotiation with england france and spain the late period at which we minister to those government leave the united state render it impossible at this early day to inform you of what have be do on the subject with which they have be respectively charge rely upon the justice of we view in relation to the point commit to negotiation and the reciprocal good feeling which characterize we intercourse with those nation we have the best reason to hope for a satisfactory adjustment of exist difference with great britain alike distinguish in peace and war we may look forward to year of peaceful honorable and elevated competition everything in the condition and history of the two nation be calculate to inspire sentiment of mutual respect and to carry conviction to the mind of both that it be they policy to preserve the most cordial relation such be my own view and it be not to be doubt that such be also the prevail sentiment of we constituent although neither time nor opportunity have be afford for a full development of the policy which the present cabinet of great britain design to pursue toward this country i indulge the hope that it will be of a just and pacific character and if this anticipation be realize we may look with confidence to a speedy and acceptable adjustment of we affair under the convention for regulate the reference to arbitration of the dispute point of boundary under the fifth article of the treaty of ghent the proceedings have hitherto be conduct in that spirit of candor and liberality which ought ever to characterize the act of sovereign state seek to adjust by the most unexceptionable mean important and delicate subject of contention the first statement of the party have be exchange and the final replication on we part be in a course of preparation this subject have receive the attention demand by its great and peculiar importance to a patriotic member of this confederacy the exposition of we rights already make be such as from the high reputation of the commissioner by whom it have be prepare we have a right to expect we interest at the court of the sovereign who have evince he friendly disposition by assume the delicate task of arbitration have be commit to a citizen of the state of maine whose character talent and intimate acquaintance with the subject eminently qualify he for so responsible a trust with full confidence in the justice of we cause and in the probity intelligence and uncompromising independence of the illustrious arbitrator we can have nothing to apprehend from the result from france we ancient ally we have a right to expect that justice which become the sovereign of a powerful intelligent and magnanimous people the beneficial effect produce by the commercial convention of 1822 limit as be its provision be too obvious not to make a salutary impression upon the mind of those who be charge with the administration of she government should this result induce a disposition to embrace to they full extent the wholesome principle which constitute we commercial policy we minister to that court will be find instruct to cherish such a disposition and to aid in conduct it to useful practical conclusion the claim of we citizen for depredation upon they property long since commit under the authority and in many instance by the express direction of the then exist government of france remain unsatisfied and must therefore continue to furnish a subject of unpleasant discussion and possible collision between the two government i cherish however a lively hope found as well on the validity of those claim and the established policy of all enlighten government as on the known integrity of the french monarch that the injurious delay of the past will find redress in the equity of the future we minister have be instruct to press these demand on the french government with all the earnestness which be call for by they importance and irrefutable justice and in a spirit that will evince the respect which be due to the feeling of those from whom the satisfaction be require we minister recently appoint to spain have be authorize to assist in remove evil alike injurious to both country either by conclude a commercial convention upon liberal and reciprocal term or by urge the acceptance in they full extent of the mutually beneficial provision of we navigation act he have also be instruct to make a further appeal to the justice of spain in behalf of we citizen for indemnity for spoliation upon we commerce commit under she authority -- a appeal which the pacific and liberal course observe on we part and a due confidence in the honor of that government authorize we to expect will not be make in vain with other european power we intercourse be on the most friendly footing in russium place by she territorial limit extensive population and great power high in the rank of nation the united state have always find a steadfast friend although she recent invasion of turkey awaken a lively sympathy for those who be expose to the desolation of war we can not but anticipate that the result will prove favorable to the cause of civilization and to the progress of human happiness the treaty of peace between these power have be ratify we can not be insensible to the great benefit to be derive by the commerce of the united state from unlock the navigation of the black sea a free passage into which be secure to all merchant vessel bind to port of russium under a flag at peace with the porte this advantage enjoy upon condition by most of the power of europe have hitherto be withhold from we during the past summer a antecedent but unsuccessful attempt to obtain it be renew under circumstance which promise the most favorable result although these result have fortunately be thus in part attain further facility to the enjoyment of this new field for the enterprise of we citizen be in my opinion sufficiently desirable to insure to they we most zealous attention we trade with austrium although of secondary importance have be gradually increase and be now so extend as to deserve the foster care of the government a negotiation commence and nearly complete with that power by the late administration have be consummate by a treaty of amity navigation and commerce which will be lay before the senate during the recess of congress we diplomatic relation with portugal have be resume the peculiar state of thing in that country cause a suspension of the recognition of the representative who present himself until a opportunity be have to obtain from we official organ there information regard the actual and as far as practicable prospective condition of the authority by which the representative in question be appoint this information be receive the application of the established rule of we government in like case be no longer withhold considerable advance have be make during the present year in the adjustment of claim of we citizen upon denmark for spoliation but all that we have a right to demand from that government in they behalf have not yet be concede from the liberal footing however upon which this subject have with the approbation of the claimant be place by the government together with the uniformly just and friendly disposition which have be evince by he danish majesty there be a reasonable ground to hope that this single subject of difference will speedily be remove we relation with the barbary power continue as they have long be of the most favorable character the policy of keep a adequate force in the mediterranean as security for the continuance of this tranquillity will be persevere in as well as a similar one for the protection of we commerce and fishery in the pacific the southern republic of we own hemisphere have not yet realize all the advantage for which they have be so long struggle we trust however that the day be not distant when the restoration of peace and internal quiet under permanent system of government secure the liberty and promote the happiness of the citizen will crown with complete success they long and arduous effort in the cause of self-government and enable we to salute they as friendly rival in all that be truly great and glorious the recent invasion of mexico and the effect thereby produce upon she domestic policy must have a controlling influence upon the great question of south american emancipation we have see the fall spirit of civil dissension rebuke and perhaps forever stifle in that republic by the love of independence if it be true as appearance strongly indicate that the spirit of independence be the master spirit and if a corresponding sentiment prevail in the other state this devotion to liberty can not be without a proper effect upon the counsel of the mother country the adoption by spain of a pacific policy toward she former colony -- a event consoling to humanity and a blessing to the world in which she herself can not fail largely to participate -- may be most reasonably expect the claim of we citizen upon the south american government generally be in a train of settlement while the principal part of those upon brazil have be adjust and a decree in council order bond to be issue by the minister of the treasury for they amount have receive the sanction of he imperial majesty this event together with the exchange of the ratification of the treaty negotiate and conclude in 1828 happily terminate all serious cause of difference with that power measure have be take to place we commercial relation with peru upon a better footing than that upon which they have hitherto rest and if meet by a proper disposition on the part of that government important benefit may be secure to both country deeply interested as we be in the prosperity of we sister republic and more particularly in that of we immediate neighbor it would be most gratifying to I be i permit to say that the treatment which we have receive at she hand have be as universally friendly as the early and constant solicitude manifest by the united state for she success give we a right to expect but it become my duty to inform you that prejudice long indulge by a portion of the inhabitant of mexico against the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the united state have have a unfortunate influence upon the affair of the two country and have diminish that usefulness to he own which be justly to be expect from he talent and zeal to this cause in a great degree be to be imputed the failure of several measure equally interesting to both party but particularly that of the mexican government to ratify a treaty negotiate and conclude in its own capital and under its own eye under these circumstance it appear expedient to give to mr poinsett the option either to return or not as in he judgment the interest of he country might require and instruction to that end be prepared but before they could be dispatch a communication be receive from the government of mexico through its chargé d'affaire here request the recall of we minister this be promptly comply with and a representative of a rank correspond with that of the mexican diplomatic agent near this government be appoint we conduct toward that republic have be uniformly of the most friendly character and have thus remove the only alleged obstacle to harmonious intercourse i can not but hope that a advantageous change will occur in we affair in justice to mr poinsett it be proper to say that my immediate compliance with the application for he recall and the appointment of a successor be not to be ascribe to any evidence that the imputation of a improper interference by he in the local politics of mexico be well found nor to a want of confidence in he talent or integrity and to add that the truth of that charge have never be affirm by the federal government of mexico in its communication with this i consider it one of the most urgent of my duty to bring to you attention the propriety of amend that part of we constitution which relate to the election of president and vice-president we system of government be by its framer deem a experiment and they therefore consistently provide a mode of remedy its defect to the people belong the right of elect they chief magistrate it be never design that they choice should in any case be defeat either by the intervention of electoral college or by the agency confide under certain contingency to the house of representative experience prove that in proportion as agent to execute the will of the people be multiply there be danger of they wish be frustrate some may be unfaithful all be liable to err so far therefore as the people can with convenience speak it be safer for they to express they own will the number of aspirant to the presidency and the diversity of the interest which may influence they claim leave little reason to expect a choice in the first instance and in that event the election must devolve on the house of representative where it be obvious the will of the people may not be always ascertain or if ascertain may not be regard from the mode of voting by state the choice be to be make by 24 vote and it may often occur that one of these will be control by a individual representative honor and office be at the disposal of the successful candidate repeat balloting may make it apparent that a single individual hold the cast in he hand may he not be tempt to name he reward but even without corruption suppose the probity of the representative to be proof against the powerful motive by which it may be assail the will of the people be still constantly liable to be misrepresent one may err from ignorance of the wish of he constituent another from a conviction that it be he duty to be govern by he own judgment of the fitness of the candidate finally although all be inflexibly honest all accurately inform of the wish of they constituent yet under the present mode of election a minority may often elect a president and when this happen it may reasonably be expect that effort will be make on the part of the majority to rectify this injurious operation of they institution but although no evil of this character should result from such a perversion of the first principle of we system -- _ that the majority be to govern _ -- it must be very certain that a president elect by a minority can not enjoy the confidence necessary to the successful discharge of he duty in this as in all other matter of public concern policy require that as few impediment as possible should exist to the free operation of the public will let we then endeavor so to amend we system that the office of chief magistrate may not be confer upon any citizen but in pursuance of a fair expression of the will of the majority i would therefore recommend such a amendment of the constitution as may remove all intermediate agency in the election of the president and vice-president the mode may be so regulate as to preserve to each state its present relative weight in the election and a failure in the first attempt may be provide for by confine the second to a choice between the two highest candidate in connection with such a amendment it would seem advisable to limit the service of the chief magistrate to a single term of either four or six year if however it should not be adopt it be worthy of consideration whether a provision disqualify for office the representative in congress on whom such a election may have devolve would not be proper while member of congress can be constitutionally appoint to office of trust and profit it will be the practice even under the most conscientious adherence to duty to select they for such station as they be believe to be better qualify to fill than other citizen but the purity of we government would doubtless be promote by they exclusion from all appointment in the gift of the president in whose election they may have be officially concern the nature of the judicial office and the necessity of secure in the cabinet and in diplomatic station of the highest rank the best talent and political experience should perhaps except these from the exclusion there be perhaps few man who can for any great length of time enjoy office and power without be more or less under the influence of feeling unfavorable to the faithful discharge of they public duty they integrity may be proof against improper consideration immediately address to themselves but they be apt to acquire a habit of look with indifference upon the public interest and of tolerate conduct from which a unpracticed man would revolt office be consider as a species of property and government rather as a means of promote individual interest than as a instrument create solely for the service of the people corruption in some and in other a perversion of correct feeling and principle divert government from its legitimate end and make it a engine for the support of the few at the expense of the many the duty of all public officer be or at least admit of be make so plain and simple that man of intelligence may readily qualify themselves for they performance and i can not but believe that more be lose by the long continuance of man in office than be generally to be gain by they experience i submit therefore to you consideration whether the efficiency of the government would not be promote and official industry and integrity better secure by a general extension of the law which limit appointment to four year in a country where office be create solely for the benefit of the people no one man have any more intrinsic right to official station than another office be not establish to give support to particular man at the public expense no individual wrong be therefore do by removal since neither appointment to nor continuance in office be matter of right the incumbent become a officer with a view to public benefit and when these require he removal they be not to be sacrifice to private interest it be the people and they alone who have a right to complain when a bad officer be substitute for a good one he who be remove have the same means of obtain a living that be enjoy by the million who never hold office the propose limitation would destroy the idea of property now so generally connect with official station and although individual distress may be sometimes produce it would by promote that rotation which constitute a lead principle in the republican creed give healthful action to the system no very considerable change have occur during the recess of congress in the condition of either we agriculture commerce or manufacture the operation of the tariff have not prove so injurious to the two former or as beneficial to the latter as be anticipate importation of foreign goods have not be sensibly diminish while domestic competition under a illusive excitement have increase the production much beyond the demand for home consumption the consequence have be low price temporary embarrassment and partial loss that such of we manufacturing establishment as be base upon capital and be prudently manage will survive the shock and be ultimately profitable there be no good reason to doubt to regulate its conduct so as to promote equally the prosperity of these three cardinal interest be one of the most difficult task of government and it may be regret that the complicated restriction which now embarrass the intercourse of nation could not by common consent be abolish and commerce allow to flow in those channel to which individual enterprise always its surest guide might direct it but we must ever expect selfish legislation in other nation and be therefore compel to adapt we own to they regulation in the manner best calculate to avoid serious injury and to harmonize the conflict interest of we agriculture we commerce and we manufacture under these impression i invite you attention to the exist tariff believe that some of its provision require modification the general rule to be apply in graduate the duty upon article of foreign growth or manufacture be that which will place we own in fair competition with those of other country and the inducement to advance even a step beyond this point be control in regard to those article which be of primary necessity in time of war when we reflect upon the difficulty and delicacy of this operation it be important that it should never be attempt but with the utmost caution frequent legislation in regard to any branch of industry affect its value and by which its capital may be transfer to new channel must always be productive of hazardous speculation and loss in deliberate therefore on these interesting subject local feeling and prejudice should be merge in the patriotic determination to promote the great interest of the whole all attempt to connect they with the party conflict of the day be necessarily injurious and should be discountenance we action upon they should be under the control of higher and purer motive legislation subject to such influence can never be just and will not long retain the sanction of a people whose active patriotism be not bound by sectional limit nor insensible to that spirit of concession and forbearance which give life to we political compact and still sustain it discard all calculation of political ascendency the north the south the east and the west should unite in diminish any burthen of which either may justly complain the agricultural interest of we country be so essentially connect with every other and so superior in importance to they all that it be scarcely necessary to invite to it you particular attention it be principally as manufacture and commerce tend to increase the value of agricultural production and to extend they application to the want and comfort of society that they deserve the foster care of government look forward to the period not far distant when a sink fund will no longer be require the duty on those article of importation which can not come in competition with we own production be the first that should engage the attention of congress in the modification of the tariff of these tea and coffee be the most prominent they enter largely into the consumption of the country and have become article of necessity to all class a reduction therefore of the exist duty will be feel as a common benefit but like all other legislation connect with commerce to be efficacious and not injurious it should be gradual and certain the public prosperity be evince in the increase revenue arise from the sale of the public land and in the steady maintenance of that produce by impost and tonnage notwithstanding the additional duty impose by the act of 19th may 1828 and the unusual importation in the early part of that year the balance in the treasury on January 1 1829 be $ 597243581 the receipt of the current year be estimate at $ 24602230 and the expenditure for the same time at $ 26164595 leave a balance in the treasury on the 1st of January next of $ 441007081 there will have be pay on account of the public debt during the present year the sum of $ 1240500580 reduce the whole debt of the government on the 1st of January next to $ 4856540650 include seven million of 5 per cent stock subscribe to the bank of the united state the payment on account of public debt make on the 1st of July last be $ 871546287 it be apprehend that the sudden withdrawal of so large a sum from the bank in which it be deposit at a time of unusual pressure in the money market might cause much injury to the interest dependent on bank accommodation but this evil be wholly avert by a early anticipation of it at the treasury aid by the judicious arrangement of the officer of the bank of the united state this state of the finances exhibit the resource of the nation in a aspect highly flattering to its industry and auspicious of the ability of government in a very short time to extinguish the public debt when this shall be do we population will be relieve from a considerable portion of its present burthen and will find not only new motive to patriotic affection but additional means for the display of individual enterprise the fiscal power of the state will also be increase and may be more extensively exert in favor of education and other public object while ample means will remain in the federal government to promote the general weal in all the mode permit to its authority after the extinction of the public debt it be not probable that any adjustment of the tariff upon principle satisfactory to the people of the union will until a remote period if ever leave the government without a considerable surplus in the treasury beyond what may be require for its current service as then the period approach when the application of the revenue to the payment of debt will cease the disposition of the surplus will present a subject for the serious deliberation of congress and it may be fortunate for the country that it be yet to be decide consider in connection with the difficulty which have heretofore attend appropriation for purpose of internal improvement and with those which this experience tell we will certainly arise whenever power over such subject may be exercise by the general government it be hope that it may lead to the adoption of some plan which will reconcile the diversified interest of the state and strengthen the bond which unite they every member of the union in peace and in war will be benefit by the improvement of inland navigation and the construction of highway in the several state let we then endeavor to attain this benefit in a mode which will be satisfactory to all that hitherto adopt have by many of we fellow-citizen be deprecate as a infraction of the constitution while by other it have be view as inexpedient all feel that it have be employ at the expense of harmony in the legislative council to avoid these evil it appear to I that the most safe just and federal disposition which could be make of the surplus revenue would be its apportionment among the several state accord to they ratio of representation and should this measure not be find warrant by the constitution that it would be expedient to propose to the state a amendment authorize it i regard a appeal to the source of power in case of real doubt and where its exercise be deem indispensable to the general welfare as among the most sacred of all we obligation upon this country more than any other have in the providence of god be cast the special guardianship of the great principle of adherence to write constitution if it fail here all hope in regard to it will be extinguish that this be intend to be a government of limited and specific and not general power must be admit by all and it be we duty to preserve for it the character intend by its framer if experience point out the necessity for a enlargement of these power let we apply for it to those for whose benefit it be to be exercise and not undermine the whole system by a resort to overstrained construction the scheme have work well it have exceed the hope of those who devise it and become a object of admiration to the world we be responsible to we country and to the glorious cause of self-government for the preservation of so great a good the great mass of legislation relate to we internal affair be intend to be leave where the federal convention find it -- in the state government nothing be clearer in my view than that we be chiefly indebted for the success of the constitution under which we be now act to the watchful and auxiliary operation of the state authority this be not the reflection of a day but belong to the most deeply rooted conviction of my mind i can not therefore too strongly or too earnestly for my own sense of its importance warn you against all encroachment upon the legitimate sphere of state sovereignty sustain by its healthful and invigorating influence the federal system can never fall in the collection of the revenue the long credit authorize on goods import from beyond the cape of good hope be the chief cause of the loss at present sustained if these be shorten to six nine and twelve month and warehouse provide by government sufficient to receive the goods offer in deposit for security and for debenture and if the right of the united state to a priority of payment out of the estate of its insolvent debtor be more effectually secure this evil would in a great measure be obviate a authority to construct such house be therefore with the propose alteration of the credit recommend to you attention it be worthy of notice that the law for the collection and security of the revenue arise from impost be chiefly frame when the rate of duty on import goods present much less temptation for illicit trade than at present exist there be reason to believe that these law be in some respects quite insufficient for the proper security of the revenue and the protection of the interest of those who be dispose to observe they the injurious and demoralizing tendency of a successful system of smuggling be so obvious as not to require comment and can not be too carefully guard against i therefore suggest to congress the propriety of adopt efficient measure to prevent this evil avoid however as much as possible every unnecessary infringement of individual liberty and embarrassment of fair and lawful business on a examination of the record of the treasury i have be forcibly strike with the large amount of public money which appear to be outstanding of the sum thus due from individual to the government a considerable portion be undoubtedly desperate and in many instance have probably be render so by remissness in the agent charge with its collection by proper exertion a great part however may yet be recover and whatever may be the portion respectively belong to these two class it behoove the government to ascertain the real state of the fact this can be do only by the prompt adoption of judicious measure for the collection of such as may be make available it be believe that a very large amount have be lose through the inadequacy of the means provide for the collection of debt due to the public and that this inadequacy lie chiefly in the want of legal skill habitually and constantly employ in the direction of the agent engage in the service it must i think be admit that the supervisory power over suit bring by the public which be now vest in a _ accounting _ officer of the treasury not select with a view to he legal knowledge and encumber as he be with numerous other duty operate unfavorably to the public interest it be important that this branch of the public service should be subject to the supervision of such professional skill as will give it efficiency the expense attendant upon such a modification of the executive department would be justify by the soundest principle of economy i would recommend therefore that the duty now assign to the agent of the treasury so far as they relate to the superintendence and management of legal proceedings on the part of the united state be transfer to the attorney-general and that this officer be place on the same footing in all respects as the head of the other department receive like compensation and have such subordinate officer provide for he department as may be requisite for the discharge of these additional duty the professional skill of the attorney-general employ in direct the conduct of marshal and district attorney would hasten the collection of debt now in suit and hereafter save much to the government it might be further extend to the superintendence of all criminal proceedings for offens against the united state in make this transfer great care should be take however that the power necessary to the treasury department be not impaired one of its greatest security consist in a control over all account until they be audit or report for suit in connection with the foregoing view i would suggest also a inquiry whether the provision of the act of congress authorize the discharge of the person of debtor to the government from imprisonment may not consistently with the public interest be extend to the release of the debt where the conduct of the debtor be wholly exempt from the imputation of fraud some more liberal policy than that which now prevail in reference to this unfortunate class of citizen be certainly due to they and would prove beneficial to the country the continuance of the liability after the means to discharge it have be exhaust can only serve to dispirit the debtor or where he resource be but partial the want of power in the government to compromise and release the demand instigate to fraud as the only resource for secure a support to he family he thus sink into a state of apathy and become a useless drone in society or a vicious member of it if not a feeling witness of the rigor and inhumanity of he country all experience prove that oppressive debt be the bane of enterprise and it should be the care of a republic not to exert a grind power over misfortune and poverty since the last session of congress numerous fraud on the treasury have be discover which i think it my duty to bring under the cognizance of the united state court for this district by a criminal prosecution it be my opinion and that of able counsel who be consult that the case come within the penalty of the act of the seventeenth congress approve 3d march 1823 provide for the punishment of fraud commit on the government of the united state either from some defect in the law or in its administration every effort to bring the accuse to trial under its provision prove ineffectual and the government be drive to the necessity of resort to the vague and inadequate provision of the common law it be therefore my duty to call you attention to the law which have be pass for the protection of the treasury if indeed there be no provision by which those who may be unworthily intrust with its guardianship can be punish for the most flagrant violation of duty extend even to the most fraudulent appropriation of the public fund to they own use it be time to remedy so dangerous a omission or if the law have be pervert from its original purpose and criminal deserving to be punish under its provision have be rescue by legal subtlety it ought to be make so plain by amendatory provision as to baffle the art of perversion and accomplish the end of its original enactment in one of the most flagrant case the court decide that the prosecution be bar by the statute which limit prosecution for fraud to two year in this case all the evidence of the fraud and indeed all knowledge that a fraud have be commit be in possession of the party accuse until after the two year have elapse surely the statute ought not to run in favor of any man while he retain all the evidence of he crime in he own possession and least of all in favor of a public officer who continue to defraud the treasury and conceal the transaction for the brief term of two year i would therefore recommend such a alteration of the law as will give the injured party and the government two year after the disclosure of the fraud or after the accuse be out of office to commence they prosecution in connection with this subject i invite the attention of congress to a general and minute inquiry into the condition of the government with a view to ascertain what office can be dispense with what expense retrench and what improvement may be make in the organization of its various part to secure the proper responsibility of public agent and promote efficiency and justice in all its operation the report of the secretary of war will make you acquaint with the condition of we army fortification arsenal and indian affair the proper discipline of the army the training and equipment of the militia the education bestow at west point and the accumulation of the means of defense applicable to the naval force will tend to prolong the peace we now enjoy and which every good citizen more especially those who have feel the misery of even a successful warfare must ardently desire to perpetuate the return from the subordinate branch of this service exhibit a regularity and order highly creditable to its character both officer and soldier seem imbue with a proper sense of duty and conform to the restraint of exact discipline with that cheerfulness which become the profession of arm there be need however of further legislation to obviate the inconvenience specify in the report under consideration to some of which it be proper that i should call you particular attention the act of congress of the 2d march 1821 to reduce and fix the military establishment remain unexecuted as it regard the command of one of the regiment of artillery can not now be deem a guide to the executive in make the proper appointment a explanatory act designate the class of officer out of which this grade be to be fill -- whether from the military list as exist prior to the act of 1821 or from it as it have be fix by that act -- would remove this difficulty it be also important that the law regulate the pay and emolument of officer generally should be more specific than they now be those for example in relation to the paymaster and surgeon general assign to they a annual salary of $ 2500 but be silent as to allowance which in certain exigency of the service may be deem indispensable to the discharge of they duty this circumstance have be the authority for extend to they various allowance at different time under former administration but no uniform rule have be observe on the subject similar inconvenience exist in other case in which the construction put upon the law by the public accountant may operate unequally produce confusion and expose officer to the odium of claim what be not they due i recommend to you foster care as one of we safest means of national defense the military academy this institution have already exercise the happiest influence upon the moral and intellectual character of we army and such of the graduate as from various cause may not pursue the profession of arm will be scarcely less useful as citizen they knowledge of the military art will be advantageously employ in the militia service and in a measure secure to that class of troops the advantage which in this respect belong to stand army i would also suggest a review of the pension law for the purpose of extend its benefit to every revolutionary soldier who aid in establish we liberty and who be unable to maintain himself in comfort these relic of the war of independence have strong claim upon they country 's gratitude and bounty the law be defective in not embrace within its provision all those who be during the last war disabled from support themselves by manual labor such a amendment would add but little to the amount of pension and be call for by the sympathy of the people as well as by consideration of sound policy it will be perceive that a large addition to the list of pensioner have be occasion by a order of the late administration depart materially from the rule which have previously prevail consider it a act of legislation i suspend its operation as soon as i be inform that it have commence before this period however application under the new regulation have be prefer to the number of 154 of which on the 27th march the date of its revocation 87 be admit for the amount there be neither estimate nor appropriation and besides this deficiency the regular allowance accord to the rule which have heretofore govern the department exceed the estimate of its late secretary by about $ 50000 for which a appropriation be ask you particular attention be request to that part of the report of the secretary of war which relate to the money hold in trust for the seneca tribe of indian it will be perceive that without legislative aid the executive can not obviate the embarrassment occasion by the diminution of the dividend on that fund which originally amount to $ 100000 and have recently be invest in united state 3 per cent stock the condition and ulterior destiny of the indian tribe within the limit of some of we state have become object of much interest and importance it have long be the policy of government to introduce among they the art of civilization in the hope of gradually reclaim they from a wander life this policy have however be couple with another wholly incompatible with its success profess a desire to civilize and settle they we have at the same time lose no opportunity to purchase they land and thrust they farther into the wilderness by this mean they have not only be keep in a wander state but be lead to look upon we as unjust and indifferent to they fate thus though lavish in its expenditure upon the subject government have constantly defeat its own policy and the indian in general recede farther and farther to the west have retain they savage habit a portion however of the southern tribe have mingle much with the whites and make some progress in the art of civilized life have lately attempt to erect a independent government within the limit of georgium and alabama these state claim to be the only sovereign within they territory extend they law over the indian which induce the latter to call upon the united state for protection under these circumstance the question present be whether the general government have a right to sustain those people in they pretension the constitution declare that no new state shall be form or erect within the jurisdiction of any other state without the consent of its legislature if the general government be not permit to tolerate the erection of a confederate state within the territory of one of the member of this union against she consent much less could it allow a foreign and independent government to establish itself there georgia become a member of the confederacy which eventuate in we federal union as a sovereign state always assert she claim to certain limit which have be originally define in she colonial charter and subsequently recognize in the treaty of peace she have ever since continue to enjoy except as they have be circumscribe by she own voluntary transfer of a portion of she territory to the united state in the article of cession of 1802 alabama be admit into the union on the same footing with the original state with boundary which be prescribe by congress there be no constitutional conventional or legal provision which allow they less power over the indian within they border than be possess by maine or new york would the people of maine permit the penobscot tribe to erect a independent government within they state and unless they do would it not be the duty of the general government to support they in resist such a measure would the people of new york permit each remnant of the six nation within she border to declare itself a independent people under the protection of the united state could the indian establish a separate republic on each of they reservation in ohio and if they be so disposed would it be the duty of this government to protect they in the attempt if the principle involve in the obvious answer to these question be abandon it will follow that the object of this government be reverse and that it have become a part of its duty to aid in destroy the state which it be establish to protect actuate by this view of the subject i inform the indian inhabit part of georgium and alabama that they attempt to establish a independent government would not be countenance by the executive of the united state and advise they to emigrate beyond the mississippus or submit to the law of those state we conduct toward these people be deeply interesting to we national character they present condition contrast with what they once be make a most powerful appeal to we sympathy we ancestor find they the uncontrolled possessor of these vast region by persuasion and force they have be make to retire from river to river and from mountain to mountain until some of the tribe have become extinct and other have leave but remnant to preserve for awhile they once terrible name surround by the whites with they art of civilization which by destroy the resource of the savage doom he to weakness and decay the fate of the mohegan the narragansett and the delaware be fast overtake the choctaw the cherokee and the creek that this fate surely await they if they remain within the limit of the state do not admit of a doubt humanity and national honor demand that every effort should be make to avert so great a calamity it be too late to inquire whether it be just in the united state to include they and they territory within the bound of new state whose limit they could control that step can not be retrace a state can not be dismember by congress or restricted in the exercise of she constitutional power but the people of those state and of every state actuate by feeling of justice and a regard for we national honor submit to you the interesting question whether something can not be do consistently with the rights of the state to preserve this much-injured race as a means of effect this end i suggest for you consideration the propriety of set apart a ample district west of the mississippus and without the limit of any state or territory now form to be guarantee to the indian tribe as long as they shall occupy it each tribe have a distinct control over the portion designate for its use there they may be secure in the enjoyment of government of they own choice subject to no other control from the united state than such as may be necessary to preserve peace on the frontier and between the several tribe there the benevolent may endeavor to teach they the art of civilization and by promote union and harmony among they to raise up a interesting commonwealth destine to perpetuate the race and to attest the humanity and justice of this government this emigration should be voluntary for it would be as cruel as unjust to compel the aborigine to abandon the grave of they father and seek a home in a distant land but they should be distinctly inform that if they remain within the limit of the state they must be subject to they law in return for they obedience as individual they will without doubt be protect in the enjoyment of those possession which they have improve by they industry but it seem to I visionary to suppose that in this state of thing claim can be allow on tract of country on which they have neither dwell nor make improvement merely because they have see they from the mountain or pass they in the chase submit to the law of the state and receive like other citizen protection in they person and property they will ere long become merge in the mass of we population the accompany report of the secretary of the navy will make you acquaint with the condition and useful employment of that branch of we service during the present year constitute as it do the best standing security of this country against foreign aggression it claim the especial attention of government in this spirit the measure which since the termination of the last war have be in operation for its gradual enlargement be adopt and it should continue to be cherish as the offspring of we national experience it will be see however that notwithstanding the great solicitude which have be manifest for the perfect organization of this arm and the liberality of the appropriation which that solicitude have suggest this object have in many important respects not be secure in time of peace we have need of no more ship of war than be requisite to the protection of we commerce those not want for this object must lay in the harbor where without proper cover they rapidly decay and even under the best precaution for they preservation must soon become useless such be already the case with many of we finest vessel which though unfinished will now require immense sum of money to be restore to the condition in which they be when commit to they proper element on this subject there can be but little doubt that we best policy would be to discontinue the building of ship of the first and second class and look rather to the possession of ample material prepare for the emergency of war than to the number of vessel which we can float in a season of peace as the index of we naval power judicious deposit in navy-yard of timber and other material fashion under the hand of skillful workman and fit for prompt application to they various purpose would enable we at all time to construct vessel as fast as they can be man and save the heavy expense of repair except to such vessel as must be employ in guard we commerce the proper point for the establishment of these yard be indicate with so much force in the report of the navy board that in recommend it to you attention i deem it unnecessary to do more than express my hearty concurrence in they view the yard in this district be already furnish with most of the machinery necessary for shipbuilding will be competent to the supply of the two select by the board as the best for the concentration of material and from the facility and certainty of communication between they it will be useless to incur at those depot the expense of similar machinery especially that use in prepare the usual metallic and wooden furniture of vessel another improvement would be effect by dispense altogether with the navy board as now constitute and substitute in its stead bureau similar to those already exist in the war department each member of the board transfer to the head of a separate bureau charge with specific duty would feel in its highest degree that wholesome responsibility which can not be divide without a far more than proportionate diminution of its force they valuable service would become still more so when separately appropriate to distinct portion of the great interest of the navy to the prosperity of which each would be impel to devote himself by the strongest motive under such a arrangement every branch of this important service would assume a more simple and precise character its efficiency would be increase and scrupulous economy in the expenditure of public money promote i would also recommend that the marine corps be merge in the artillery or infantry as the best mode of cure the many defect in its organization but little exceed in number any of the regiment of infantry that corps have besides its lieutenant-colonel commandant five brevet lieutenant-colonel who receive the full pay and emolument of they brevet rank without render proportionate service detail for marine service could as well be make from the artillery or infantry there be no peculiar training requisite for it with these improvement and such other as zealous watchfulness and mature consideration may suggest there can be little doubt that under a energetic administration of its affair the navy may soon be make everything that the nation wish it to be its efficiency in the suppression of piracy in the west indium sea and wherever its squadron have be employ in secure the interest of the country will appear from the report of the secretary to which i refer you for other interesting detail among these i would bespeak the attention of congress for the view present in relation to the inequality between the army and navy as to the pay of officer no such inequality should prevail between these brave defender of they country and where it do exist it be submit to congress whether it ought not to be rectify the report of the postmaster general be refer to as exhibit a highly satisfactory administration of that department abuse have be reform increase expedition in the transportation of the mail secure and its revenue much improve in a political point of view this department be chiefly important as afford the means of diffuse knowledge it be to the body politic what the vein and artery be to the natural -- convey rapidly and regularly to the remotest part of the system correct information of the operation of the government and bring back to it the wish and feeling of the people through its agency we have secure to ourselves the full enjoyment of the blessing of a free press in this general survey of we affair a subject of high importance present itself in the present organization of the judiciary a uniform operation of the federal government in the different state be certainly desirable and exist as they do in the union on the basis of perfect equality each state have a right to expect that the benefit confer on the citizen of other should be extend to hers the judicial system of the united state exist in all its efficiency in only fifteen member of the union to three other the circuit court which constitute a important part of that system have be imperfectly extend and to the remain six altogether deny the effect have be to withhold from the inhabitant of the latter the advantage afford -lrb- by the supreme court -rrb- to they fellow-citizen in other state in the whole extent of the criminal and much of the civil authority of the federal judiciary that this state of thing ought to be remedy if it can be do consistently with the public welfare be not to be doubt neither be it to be disguise that the organization of we judicial system be at once a difficult and delicate task to extend the circuit court equally throughout the different part of the union and at the same time to avoid such a multiplication of member as would encumber the supreme appellate tribunal be the object desire perhaps it might be accomplish by divide the circuit judge into two class and provide that the supreme court should be hold by these class alternately the chief justice always preside if a extension of the circuit-court system to those state which do not now enjoy its benefit should be determine upon it would of course be necessary to revise the present arrangement of the circuit and even if that system should not be enlarged such a revision be recommend a provision for take the census of the people of the united state will to insure the completion of that work within a convenient time claim the early attention of congress the great and constant increase of business in the department of state force itself at a early period upon the attention of the executive thirteen year ago it be in mr madison 's last message to congress make the subject of a earnest recommendation which have be repeat by both of he successor and my comparatively limited experience have satisfy I of its justness it have arise from many cause not the least of which be the large addition that have be make to the family of independent nation and the proportionate extension of we foreign relation the remedy propose be the establishment of a home department -- a measure which do not appear to have meet the view of congress on account of its suppose tendency to increase gradually and imperceptibly the already too strong bias of the federal system toward the exercise of authority not delegate to it i be not therefore dispose to revive the recommendation but be not the less impressed with the importance of so organize that department that its secretary may devote more of he time to we foreign relation clearly satisfy that the public good would be promote by some suitable provision on the subject i respectfully invite you attention to it the charter of the bank of the united state expire in 1836 and its stockholder will most probably apply for a renewal of they privilege in order to avoid the evil result from precipitancy in a measure involve such important principle and such deep pecuniary interest i feel that i can not in justice to the party interested too soon present it to the deliberate consideration of the legislature and the people both the constitutionality and the expediency of the law create this bank be well question by a large portion of we fellow-citizen and it must be admit by all that it have fail in the great end of establish a uniform and sound currency under these circumstance if such a institution be deem essential to the fiscal operation of the government i submit to the wisdom of the legislature whether a national one found upon the credit of the government and its revenue might not be devise which would avoid all constitutional difficulty and at the same time secure all the advantage to the government and country that be expect to result from the present bank i can not close this communication without bring to you view the just claim of the representative of commodore decatur he officer and crew arise from the recapture of the frigate _ philadelphium _ under the heavy battery of tripolus although sensible as a general rule of the impropriety of executive interference under a government like ours where every individual enjoy the right of directly petition congress yet view this case as one of very peculiar character i deem it my duty to recommend it to you favorable consideration besides the justice of this claim as correspond to those which have be since recognize and satisfy it be the fruit of a deed of patriotic and chivalrous daring which infuse life and confidence into we infant navy and contribute as much as any exploit in its history to elevate we national character public gratitude therefore stamp she seal upon it and the meed should not be withhold which may hereafter operate as a stimulus to we gallant tar i now commend you fellow-citizen to the guidance of almighty god with a full reliance on he merciful providence for the maintenance of we free institution and with a earnest supplication that whatever error it may be my lot to commit in discharge the arduous duty which have devolve on I will find a remedy in the harmony and wisdom of you counsel andrew jackson December 8 1829 special message _ December 14 1829 _ _ the

entitle to receive it will be proper andrew jackson washington _ January 26 1830 _ _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : i submit to congress a communication from the secretary of state together with the report of the superintendent of the patent office to which it refer show the present condition of that office and suggest the necessity of further legislative provision in regard to it and i recommend the subject it embrace to the particular attention of congress it will be see that there be a unexplained deficiency in the account which have be render at the treasury of the fee receive at the office amounting to $ 4290 and that precaution have be provide to guard against similar delinquency in future congress will decide on they sufficiency and whether any legislative aid be necessary upon this branch of the subject refer to in the report andrew jackson _ January 26 1830 _ _ to the senate and house of representative _ : i find it necessary to recommend to congress a revision of the law relate to the direct and contingent expense of we intercourse with foreign nation and particularly of the act of may 1 1810 entitle a act fix the compensation of public minister and of consul reside on the coast of barbary and for other purpose a letter from the fifth auditor of the treasury to the secretary of state herewith transmit which notice the difficulty incident to the settlement of the account of certain diplomatic agent of the united state serve to show the necessity of this revision this branch of the government be incessantly call upon to sanction allowance which not unfrequently appear to have just and equitable foundation in usage but which be believe to be incompatible with the provision of the act of 1810 the letter from the fifth auditor contain a description of several claim of this character which be submit to congress as the only tribunal competent to afford the relief to which the party consider themselves entitle among the most prominent question of this description be the following : _ i claim for outfit by minister and charge d'affaire duly appoint by the president and senate _ the act of 1790 regulate the expenditure for foreign intercourse provide that exclusive of a outfit which shall in no case exceed one year 's full salary to the minister plenipotentiary or chargé d'affaire to whom the same may be allow the president shall not allow to any minister plenipotentiary a greater sum than at the rate of $ 9000 per annum as a compensation for all he personal service and other expense nor a greater sum for the same than $ 4500 per annum to a chargé d'affaire by this provision the maximum of allowance only be fix leave the question as to any outfit either in whole or in part to the discretion of the president to be decide accord to circumstance under it a variety of case occur in which outfit have be give to diplomatic agent on they first appointment afterwards upon they be transfer to other court or send upon special and distinct mission full or half outfit be again allow this act it will be perceive although it fix the maximum of outfit be altogether silent as to the circumstance under which outfit might be allow indeed the authority to allow they at all be not expressly convey but only incidentally advert to in limit the amount this limitation continue to be the only restriction upon the executive until 1810 the act of 1790 have be keep in force till that period by five successive reenactment in which it be either refer to by means of its title or its term be repeat verbatim in 1810 a act pass wherein the phraseology which have be in use for twenty year be depart from fix the same limit precisely to the _ amount _ of salary and outfit to minister and chargés as have be six time fix since 1790 it differ from precede act by formally convey a authority to allow a outfit to a minister plenipotentiary or chargé d'affaire _ on go from the united state to any foreign country _ and in addition to this specification of the circumstance under which the outfit may be allow it contain one of the condition which shall be requisite to entitle a chargé or secretary to the compensation therein provide upon a view of all the circumstance connect with the subject i can not permit myself to doubt that it be with reference to the practice of multiply outfit to the same person and in the intention of prohibit it in future that this act be pass it be however frequently deem advantageous to transfer minister already abroad from one court to another or to employ those who be resident at a particular court upon special occasion elsewhere it seem to have be consider that it be not the intention of congress to restrain the executive from so do it be further contend that the president be leave free to select for minister citizen whether at home or abroad a right on the part of such minister to the usual emolument follow as a matter of course this view be sustain by the opinion of the law officer of the government and the act of 1810 be construe to leave the whole subject of salary and outfit where it find it under the law of 1790 that be to say completely at the discretion of the president without any other restriction than the maximum already fix by that law this discretion have from time to time be exercise by successive president but whilst i can not but consider the restriction in this respect impose by the act of 1810 as inexpedient i can not feel myself justified in adopt a construction which defeat the only operation of which this part of it seem susceptible at least not unless congress after have the subject distinctly bring to they consideration should virtually give they assent to that construction whatever may be think of the propriety of give a outfit to secretary of legation or other who may be consider as only temporarily charge with the affair intrust to they i be impressed with the justice of such a allowance in the case of a citizen who happen to be abroad when first appoint and that of a minister already in place when the public interest require he transfer and from the break up of he establishment and other circumstance connect with the change he incur expense to which he would not otherwise have be subject _ ii claim for outfit and salary by chargés d'affaire and secretary of legation who have not be appoint by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate _ by the second section of the act of 1810 it be provide -- that to entitle any chargé d'affaire or secretary of any legation or embassy to any foreign country or secretary of any minister plenipotentiary to the compensation hereinbefore provide they shall respectively be appoint by the president of the united state by and with the advice and consent of the senate but in the recess of the senate the president be hereby authorize to make such appointment which shall be submit to the senate at the next session thereafter for they advice and consent and no compensation shall be allow to any chargé d'affaire or any of the secretary hereinbefore describe who shall not be appoint as aforesaid notwithstanding the explicit language of this act claim for outfit and salary have be make -- and allow at the treasury -- by chargés d'affaire and secretary of legation who have not be appoint in the manner specify among the accompany document will be find several claim of this description of which a detailed statement be give in the letter of the fifth auditor the case of mr william b lawrence late chargé d'affaire at london be of a still more peculiar character in consequence of he have actually draw he outfit and salary from the banker employ by the government and from the length of time he officiate in that capacity mr lawrence 's account be render to the late administration but not settle i have refuse to sanction the allowance claim because the law do not authorize it but have refrain from direct any proceedings to compel a reimbursement of the money thus in my judgment illegally receive until a opportunity should be afford to congress to pass upon the equity of the claim appropriation be annually and necessarily make for the contingent expense of all the mission abroad and for the contingent expense of foreign intercourse and the expenditure of these fund intrust to the discretion of the president it be out of those appropriation that allowance of this character have be claim and it be presume make deem however that the discretion thus commit to the executive do not extend to the allowance of charge prohibit by express law i have feel it my duty to refer all exist claim to the action of congress and to submit to they consideration whether any alteration of the law in this respect be necessary _ iii the allowance of a quarter 's salary to minister and chargés d'affaire to defray they expense home _ this allowance have be uniformly make but be without authority by law rest in executive discretion it have accord to circumstance be extend to case where the minister die abroad to defray the return of he family and be recently claim in a case where the minister have no family on grounds of general equity a charge of this description can hardly be regard as a contingent one and if allow at all must be in lieu of salary as such it be altogether arbitrary although it be not believe that the interest of the treasury be upon the whole much affect by the substitution in some case the allowance be for a longer period than be occupy in the return of the minister in other for one somewhat less and it seem to do away all inducement to unnecessary delay the subject be however susceptible of positive regulation by law and it be on many account highly expedient that it should be place on that footing i have therefore without direct any alteration in the exist practice feel it my duty to bring it to you notice _ iv travel and other expense in follow the court in case where its residence be not stationary _ the only legation by which expense of this description be incur and charge be those to spain and the netherland and to they they have on several occasion be allow among the document herewith communicate will be find with other charge require legislative interference a account for travel expense with a statement of the grounds upon which they reimbursement be claim this account have be suspend by the officer of the treasury to whom its settlement belong and as the question will be one of frequent recurrence i have deem the occasion a fit one to submit the whole subject to the revision of congress the justice of these charge for extraordinary expense unavoidably incur have be admit by former administration and the claim allow my difficulty grow out of the language of the act of 1810 which expressly declare that the salary and outfit it authorize to the minister and chargé d'affaire shall be a compensation for all he personal service and expense the item which ordinarily form the contingent expense of a foreign mission be of a character distinct from the _ personal _ expense of the minister the difficulty of regard those now refer to in that light be obvious there be certainly strong consideration of equity in favor of a remuneration for they at the two court where they be alone incur and if such should be the opinion of congress it be desirable that authority to make it should be expressly confer by law rather than continue to rest upon doubtful construction _ v charge of consul for discharge diplomatic function without appointment during a temporary vacancy in the office of chargé d'affaire _ it have sometimes happen that consul of the united state upon the occurrence of vacancy at they place of residence in the diplomatic office of the united state by the death or retirement of we minister or chargé d'affaire have take under they care the papers of such mission and usefully discharge diplomatic function in behalf of they government and fellow-citizen till the vacancy be regularly fill in some instance this be state to have be do to the abandonment of other pursuit and at a considerably increase expense of live there be exist claim of this description which can not be finally adjust or allow without the sanction of congress a particular statement of they accompany this communication the nature of this branch of the public service make it necessary to commit portion of the expense incur in it to executive discretion but it be desirable that such portion should be as small as possible the purity and permanent success of we political institution depend in a great measure upon definite appropriation and a rigid adherence to the enactment of the legislature dispose of public money my desire be to have the subject place upon a more simple and precise but not less liberal footing than it stand on at present so far as that may be find practicable a opinion that the salary allow by law to we agent abroad be in many case inadequate be very general and it be reasonable to suppose that this impression have not be without its influence in the construction of the law by which those salary be fix there be certainly motive which it be difficult to resist to a increase expense on the part of some of we functionary abroad greatly beyond that which would be require at home should congress be of opinion that any alteration for the better can be make either in the rate of salary now allow or in the rank and gradation of we diplomatic agent or both the present would be a fit occasion for a revision of the whole subject andrew jackson _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ gentleman : i transmit herewith the annual report of the inspector of the penitentiary in the district of columbium and beg leave to recommend the propriety of provide by law a reasonable compensation for the service of those officer the act of congress

these measure be the voluntary act of the indian themselves the government be not represent in the council which adopt they nor have it any previous intimation that such step be in contemplation the indian convene of they own accord settle and execute the proposition contain in the treaty present to I and agree to be bind by they if within three month they should receive the approbation of the president and senate the other measure be equally they own it be certainly desirous on various and very press account as will appear from the accompany document that some agreement should be conclude with the indian by which a object so important as they removal beyond the territorial limit of the state may be effect in settle the term of such a agreement i be dispose to exercise the utmost liberality and to concur in any which be consistent with the constitution and not incompatible with the interest of the united state and they duty to the indian i can not however regard the term propose by the choctaw to be in all respects of this character but desirous of conclude a arrangement upon such as be i have draw up the accompany amendment which i propose to offer to the choctaw if they meet the approbation of the senate the condition which they offer be such as in my judgment will be most likely to be acceptable to both party and be liable to the fewest objection not be tenacious though on the subject i will most cheerfully adopt any modification which on a frank interchange of opinion my constitutional adviser may suggest and which i shall be satisfy be reconcilable with my official duty with these view i ask the opinion of the senate upon the follow question : will the senate advise the conclusion of a treaty with the choctaw nation accord to the term which they propose or will the senate advise the conclusion of a treaty with that tribe as modify by the alteration suggest by I if not what further alteration or modification will the senate propose i be fully aware that in thus resort to the early practice of the government by ask the previous advice of the senate in the discharge of this portion of my duty i be depart from a long and for many year a unbroken usage in similar case but be satisfy that this resort be consistent with the provision of the constitution that it be strongly recommend in this instance by consideration of expediency and that the reason which have lead to the observance of a different practice though very cogent in negotiation with foreign nation do not apply with equal force to those make with indian tribe i flatter myself that it will not meet the disapprobation of the senate among the reason for a previous expression of the view of the senate the follow be state as most prominent : 1 the indian have request that they proposition should be submit to the senate 2 the opinion of the senate in relation to the term to be propose will have a salutary effect in a future negotiation if one should be deem proper 3 the choctaw be one of the most numerous and powerful tribe within we border and as the conclusion of a treaty with they may have a controlling effect upon other tribe it be important that its term should be well consider those now propose by the choctaw though objectionable it be believe be susceptible of modification which will leave they conformable to the humane and liberal policy which the government desire to observe toward the indian tribe and be at the same time acceptable to they to be possess of the view of the senate on this important and delicate branch of we future negotiation would enable the president to act much more effectively in the exercise of he particular function there be also the best reason to believe that measure in this respect emanate from the united counsel of the treaty-making power would be more satisfactory to the american people and to the indian it will be see that the pecuniary stipulation be large and in bring this subject to the consideration of the senate i may be allow to remark that the amount of money which may be secure to be pay should in my judgment be view as of minor importance if a fund adequate to the object in view can be obtain from the land which they cede all the purpose of the government should be regard as answer the great desideratum be the removal of the indian and the settlement of the perplexing question involve in they present location -- a question in which several of the state of this union have the deepest interest and which if leave undecided much longer may eventuate in serious injury to the indian andrew

for the continuance of the road beyond the limit of the territory of michigan i desire to be understand as have approve this bill with the understanding that the road authorize by this section be not to be extend beyond the limit of the say territory andrew jackson veto message _ may 27 1830 _ _ to the house of representative _ gentleman : i have maturely consider the bill propose to authorize a subscription of stock in the maysville washington pari and lexington turnpike road company and now return the same to the house of representative in which it originate with my objection to its passage sincerely friendly to the improvement of we country by means of road and canal i regret that any difference of opinion in the mode of contribute to it should exist between we and if in state this difference i go beyond what the occasion may be deem to call for i hope to find a apology in the great importance of the subject a unfeigned respect for the high source from which this branch of it have emanate and a anxious wish to be correctly understand by my constituent in the discharge of all my duty diversity of sentiment among public functionary actuate by the same general motive on the character and tendency of particular measure be a incident common to all government and the more to be expect in one which like ours owe its existence to the freedom of opinion and must be uphold by the same influence control as we thus be by a higher tribunal before which we respective act will be canvass with the indulgence due to the imperfection of we nature and with that intelligence and unbiased judgment which be the true corrective of error all that we responsibility demand be that the public good should be the measure of we view dictate alike they frank expression and honest maintenance in the message which be present to congress at the opening of its present session i endeavor to exhibit briefly my view upon the important and highly interesting subject to which we attention be now to be direct i be desirous of present to the representative of the several state in congress assemble the inquiry whether some mode could not be devise which would reconcile the diversity of opinion concern the power of this government over the subject of internal improvement and the manner in which these power if confer by the constitution ought to be exercise the act which i be call upon to consider have therefore be pass with a knowledge of my view on this question as these be express in the message refer to in that document the follow suggestion will be find : after the extinction of the public debt it be not probable that any adjustment of the tariff upon principle satisfactory to the people of the union will until a remote period if ever leave the government without a considerable surplus in the treasury beyond what may be require for its current service as then the period approach when the application of the revenue to the payment of debt will cease the disposition of the surplus will present a subject for the serious deliberation of congress and it may be fortunate for the country that it be yet to be decide consider in connection with the difficulty which have heretofore attend appropriation for purpose of internal improvement and with those which this experience tell we will certainly arise whenever power over such subject may be exercise by the general government it be hope that it may lead to the adoption of some plan which will reconcile the diversified interest of the state and strengthen the bond which unite they every member of the union in peace and in war will be benefit by the improvement of inland navigation and the construction of highway in the several state let we then endeavor to attain this benefit in a mode which will be satisfactory to all that hitherto adopt have by many of we fellow-citizen be deprecate as a infraction of the constitution while by other it have be view as inexpedient all feel that it have be employ at the expense of harmony in the legislative council and adverting to the constitutional power of congress to make what i consider a proper disposition of the surplus revenue i subjoin the follow remark : to avoid these evil it appear to I that the most safe just and federal disposition which could be make of the surplus revenue would be its apportionment among the several state accord to they ratio of representation and should this measure not be find warrant by the constitution that it would be expedient to propose to the state a amendment authorize it the constitutional power of the federal government to construct or promote work of internal improvement present itself in two point of view -- the first as bear upon the sovereignty of the state within whose limit they execution be contemplate if jurisdiction of the territory which they may occupy be claim as necessary to they preservation and use the second as assert the simple right to appropriate money from the national treasury in aid of such work when undertake by state authority surrender the claim of jurisdiction in the first view the question of power be a open one and can be decide without the embarrassment attend the other arise from the practice of the government although frequently and strenuously attempt the power to this extent have never be exercise by the government in a single instance it do not in my opinion possess it and no bill therefore which admit it can receive my official sanction but in the other view of the power the question be differently situate the ground take at a early period of the government be that whenever money have be raise by the general authority and be to be apply to a particular measure a question arise whether the particular measure be within the enumerate authority vest in congress if it be the money requisite for it may be apply to it if not no such application can be make the document in which this principle be first advance be of deservedly high authority and should be hold in grateful remembrance for its immediate agency in rescue the country from much exist abuse and for its conservative effect upon some of the most valuable principle of the constitution the symmetry and purity of the government would doubtless have be better preserved if this restriction of the power of appropriation could have be maintain without weaken its ability to fulfill the general object of its institution a effect so likely to attend its admission notwithstanding its apparent fitness that every subsequent administration of the government embrace a period of thirty out of the forty-two year of its existence have adopt a more enlarged construction of the power it be not my purpose to detain you by a minute recital of the act which sustain this assertion but it be proper that i should notice some of the most prominent in order that the reflection which they suggest to my mind may be better understand in the administration of mr jefferson we have two example of the exercise of the right of appropriation which in the consideration that lead to they adoption and in they effect upon the public mind have have a greater agency in mark the character of the power than any subsequent event i allude to the payment of $ 15000000 for the purchase of louisiana and to the original appropriation for the construction of the cumberland road the latter act derive much weight from the acquiescence and approbation of three of the most powerful of the original member of the confederacy express through they respective legislature although the circumstance of the latter case may be such as to deprive so much of it as relate to the actual construction of the road of the force of a obligatory exposition of the constitution it must nevertheless be admit that so far as the mere appropriation of money be concern they present the principle in its most impose aspect no less than twenty-three different law have be pass through all the form of the constitution appropriate upward of $ 2500000 out of the national treasury in support of that improvement with the approbation of every president of the united state include my predecessor since its commencement independently of the sanction give to appropriation for the cumberland and other road and object under this power the administration of mr madison be characterize by a act which furnish the strongest evidence of he opinion of its extent a bill be pass through both house of congress and present for he approval set apart and pledge certain fund for construct road and canal and improve the navigation of water course in order to facilitate promote and give security to internal commerce among the several state and to render more easy and less expensive the means and provision for the common defense regard the bill as assert a power in the federal government to construct road and canal within the limit of the state in which they be make he object to its passage on the ground of its unconstitutionality declare that the assent of the respective state in the mode provide by the bill could not confer the power in question that the only case in which the consent and cession of particular state can extend the power of congress be those specify and provide for in the constitution and superadding to these avowal he opinion that a restriction of the power ` to provide for the common defense and general welfare ' to case which be to be provide for by the expenditure of money would still leave within the legislative power of congress all the great and most important measure of government money be the ordinary and necessary means of carry they into execution i have not be able to consider these declaration in any other point of view than as a concession that the right of appropriation be not limit by the power to carry into effect the measure for which the money be ask as be formerly contend the view of mr monroe upon this subject be not leave to inference during he administration a bill be pass through both house of congress confer the jurisdiction and prescribe the mode by which the federal government should exercise it in the case of the cumberland road he return it with objection to its passage and in assign they take occasion to say that in the early stage of the government he have incline to the construction that it have no right to expend money except in the performance of act authorize by the other specific grant of power accord to a strict construction of they but that on further reflection and observation he mind have undergo a change that he opinion then be that congress have a unlimited power to raise money and that in its appropriation they have a discretionary power restricted only by the duty to appropriate it to purpose of common defense and of general not local national not state benefit and this be avow to be the govern principle through the residue of he administration the view of the last administration be of such recent date as to render a particular reference to they unnecessary it be well know that the appropriate power to the utmost extent which have be claim for it in relation to internal improvement be fully recognize and exercise by it this brief reference to known fact will be sufficient to show the difficulty if not impracticability of bring back the operation of the government to the construction of the constitution set up in 1798 assume that to be its true reading in relation to the power under consideration thus give a admonitory proof of the force of implication and the necessity of guard the constitution with sleepless vigilance against the authority of precedent which have not the sanction of its most plainly define power for although it be the duty of all to look to that sacred instrument instead of the statute book to repudiate at all time encroachment upon its spirit which be too apt to be effect by the conjuncture of peculiar and facilitate circumstance it be not less true that the public good and the nature of we political institution require that individual difference should yield to a well-settled acquiescence of the people and confederated authority in particular construction of the constitution on doubtful point not to concede this much to the spirit of we institution would impair they stability and defeat the object of the constitution itself the bill before I do not call for a more definite opinion upon the particular circumstance which will warrant appropriation of money by congress to aid work of internal improvement for although the extension of the power to apply money beyond that of carry into effect the object for which it be appropriate have as we have see be long claim and exercise by the federal government yet such grant have always be professedly under the control of the general principle that the work which might be thus aid should be of a general not local national not state character a disregard of this distinction would of necessity lead to the subversion of the federal system that even this be a unsafe one arbitrary in its nature and liable consequently to great abuse be too obvious to require the confirmation of experience it be however sufficiently definite and imperative to my mind to forbid my approbation of any bill have the character of the one under consideration i have give to its provision all the reflection demand by a just regard for the interest of those of we fellow-citizen who have desire its passage and by the respect which be due to a coordinate branch of the government but i be not able to view it in any other light than as a measure of purely local character or if it can be consider national that no further distinction between the appropriate duty of the general and state government need be attempt for there can be no local interest that may not with equal propriety be denominate national it have no connection with any established system of improvement be exclusively within the limit of a state start at a point on the ohio river and run out 60 mile to a interior town and even as far as the state be interested confer partial instead of general advantage consider the magnitude and importance of the power and the embarrassment to which from the very nature of the thing its exercise must necessarily be subject the real friend of internal improvement ought not to be willing to confide it to accident and chance what be properly _ national _ in its character or otherwise be a inquiry which be often extremely difficult of solution the appropriation of one year for a object which be consider national may be render nugatory by the refusal of a succeed congress to continue the work on the ground that it be local no aid can be derive from the intervention of corporation the question regard the character of the work not that of those by whom it be to be accomplish notwithstanding the union of the government with the corporation by whose immediate agency any work of internal improvement be carry on the inquiry will still remain be it national and conducive to the benefit of the whole or local and operate only to the advantage of a portion of the union but although i might not feel it to be my official duty to interpose the executive veto to the passage of a bill appropriate money for the construction of such work as be authorize by the state and be national in they character i do not wish to be understand as express a opinion that it be expedient at this time for the general government to embark in a system of this kind and anxious that my constituent should be possess of my view on this as well as on all other subject which they have commit to my discretion i shall state they frankly and briefly besides many minor consideration there be two prominent view of the subject which have make a deep impression upon my mind which i think be well entitle to you serious attention and will i hope be maturely weigh by the people from the official communication submit to you it appear that if no adverse and unforeseen contingency happen in we foreign relation and no unusual diversion be make of the fund set apart for the payment of the national debt we may look with confidence to its entire extinguishment in the short period of four year the extent to which this please anticipation be dependent upon the policy which may be pursue in relation to measure of the character of the one now under consideration must be obvious to all and equally so that the event of the present session be well calculate to awaken public solicitude upon the subject by the statement from the treasury department and those from the clerk of the senate and house of representative herewith submit it appear that the bill which have pass into law and those which in all probability will pass before the adjournment of congress anticipate appropriation which with the ordinary expenditure for the support of government will exceed considerably the amount in the treasury for the year 1830 thus whilst we be diminish the revenue by a reduction of the duty on tea coffee and cocoa the appropriation for internal improvement be increase beyond the available means of the treasury and if to this calculation be add the amount contain in bill which be pend before the two house it may be safely affirm that $ 10000000 would not make up the excess over the treasury receipt unless the payment of the national debt be postpone and the means now pledge to that object apply to those enumerate in these bill without a well-regulated system of internal improvement this exhausting mode of appropriation be not likely to be avoid and the plain consequence must be either a continuance of the national debt or a resort to additional tax although many of the state with a laudable zeal and under the influence of a enlighten policy be successfully apply they separate effort to work of this character the desire to enlist the aid of the general government in the construction of such as from they nature ought to devolve upon it and to which the means of the individual state be inadequate be both rational and patriotic and if that desire be not gratify now it do not follow that it never will be the general intelligence and public spirit of the american people furnish a sure guaranty that at the proper time this policy will be make to prevail under circumstance more auspicious to its successful prosecution than those which now exist but great as this object undoubtedly be it be not the only one which demand the foster care of the government the preservation and success of the republican principle rest with we to elevate its character and extend its influence rank among we most important duty and the best means to accomplish this desirable end be those which will rivet the attachment of we citizen to the government of they choice by the comparative lightness of they public burthen and by the attraction which the superior success of its operation will present to the admiration and respect of the world through the favor of a overrule and indulgent providence we country be bless with general prosperity and we citizen exempt from the pressure of taxation which other less favored portion of the human family be oblige to bear yet it be true that many of the tax collect from we citizen through the medium of impost have for a considerable period be onerous in many particulars these tax have bear severely upon the labor and less prosperous class of the community be impose on the necessaries of life and this too in case where the burthen be not relieve by the consciousness that it would ultimately contribute to make we independent of foreign nation for article of prime necessity by the encouragement of they growth and manufacture at home they have be cheerfully bear because they be think to be necessary to the support of government and the payment of the debt unavoidably incur in the acquisition and maintenance of we national rights and liberty but have we a right to calculate on the same cheerful acquiescence when it be know that the necessity for they continuance would cease be it not for irregular improvident and unequal appropriation of the public fund will not the people demand as they have a right to do such a prudent system of expenditure as will pay the debt of the union and authorize the reduction of every tax to as low a point as the wise observance of the necessity to protect that portion of we manufacture and labor whose prosperity be essential to we national safety and independence will allow when the national debt be pay the duty upon those article which we do not raise may be repeal with safety and still leave i trust without oppression to any section of the country a accumulate surplus fund which may be beneficially apply to some well-digested system of improvement under this view the question as to the manner in which the federal government can or ought to embark in the construction of road and canal and the extent to which it may impose burthen on the people for these purpose may be present on its own merit free of all disguise and of every embarrassment except such as may arise from the constitution itself assume these suggestion to be correct will not we constituent require the observance of a course by which they can be effect ought they not to require it with the best disposition to aid as far as i can conscientiously in furtherance of work of internal improvement my opinion be that the soundest view of national policy at this time point to such a course besides the avoidance of a evil influence upon the local concern of the country how solid be the advantage which the government will reap from it in the elevation of its character how gratify the effect of present to the world the sublime spectacle of a republic of more than 12000000 happy people in the fifty-fourth year of she existence after have pass through two protracted war -- the one for the acquisition and the other for the maintenance of liberty -- free from debt and with all she immense resource unfettered what a salutary influence would not such a exhibition exercise upon the cause of liberal principle and free government throughout the world would we not ourselves find in its effect a additional guaranty that we political institution will be transmit to the most remote posterity without decay a course of policy destine to witness event like these can not be benefit by a legislation which tolerate a scramble for appropriation that have no relation to any general system of improvement and whose good effect must of necessity be very limit in the best view of these appropriation the abuse to which they lead far exceed the good which they be capable of promote they may be resort to as artful expedient to shift upon the government the loss of unsuccessful private speculation and thus by minister to personal ambition and self-aggrandizement tend to sap the foundation of public virtue and taint the administration of the government with a demoralizing influence in the other view of the subject and the only remain one which it be my intention to present at this time be involve the expediency of embark in a system of internal improvement without a previous amendment of the constitution explain and define the precise power of the federal government over it assume the right to appropriate money to aid in the construction of national work to be warrant by the cotemporaneous and continue exposition of the constitution its insufficiency for the successful prosecution of they must be admit by all candid mind if we look to usage to define the extent of the right that will be find so variant and embrace so much that have be overrule as to involve the whole subject in great uncertainty and to render the execution of we respective duty in relation to it replete with difficulty and embarrassment it be in regard to such work and the acquisition of additional territory that the practice obtain its first footing in most if not all other disputed question of appropriation the construction of the constitution may be regard as unsettled if the right to apply money in the enumerated case be place on the ground of usage this subject have be one of much and i may add painful reflection to I it have bearing that be well calculate to exert a powerful influence upon we hitherto prosperous system of government and which on some account may even excite despondency in the breast of a american citizen i will not detain you with profession of zeal in the cause of internal improvement if to be they friend be a virtue which deserve commendation we country be bless with a abundance of it for i do not suppose there be a intelligent citizen who do not wish to see they flourish but though all be they friend but few i trust be unmindful of the means by which they should be promote none certainly be so degenerate as to desire they success at the cost of that sacred instrument with the preservation of which be indissolubly bind we country 's hope if different impression be entertain in any quarter if it be expect that the people of this country reckless of they constitutional obligation will prefer they local interest to the principle of the union such expectation will in the end be disappoint or if it be not so then indeed have the world but little to hope from the example of free government when a honest observance of constitutional compact can not be obtain from community like ours it need not be anticipate elsewhere and the cause in which there have be so much martyrdom and from which so much be expect by the friend of liberty may be abandon and the degrading truth that man be unfit for self-government admit and this will be the case if _ expediency _ be make a rule of construction in interpret the constitution power in no government could desire a better shield for the insidious advance which it be ever ready to make upon the check that be design to restrain its action but i do not entertain such gloomy apprehension if it be the wish of the people that the construction of road and canal should be conduct by the federal government it be not only highly expedient but indispensably necessary that a previous amendment of the constitution delegate the necessary power and define and restrict its exercise with reference to the sovereignty of the state should be make without it nothing extensively useful can be effect the right to exercise as much jurisdiction as be necessary to preserve the work and to raise fund by the collection of toll to keep they in repair can not be dispense with the cumberland road should be a instructive admonition of the consequence of act without this right year after year contest be witness grow out of effort to obtain the necessary appropriation for complete and repair this useful work whilst one congress may claim and exercise the power a succeed one may deny it and this fluctuation of opinion must be unavoidably fatal to any scheme which from its extent would promote the interest and elevate the character of the country the experience of the past have show that the opinion of congress be subject to such fluctuation if it be the desire of the people that the agency of the federal government should be confine to the appropriation of money in aid of such undertaking in virtue of state authority then the occasion the manner and the extent of the appropriation should be make the subject of constitutional regulation this be the more necessary in order that they may be equitable among the several state promote harmony between different section of the union and they representative preserve other part of the constitution from be undermine by the exercise of doubtful power or the too great extension of those which be not so and protect the whole subject against the deleterious influence of combination to carry by concert measure which consider by themselves might meet but little countenance that a constitutional adjustment of this power upon equitable principle be in the highest degree desirable can scarcely be doubt nor can it fail to be promote by every sincere friend to the success of we political institution in no government be appeal to the source of power in case of real doubt more suitable than in ours no good motive can be assign for the exercise of power by the constitute authority while those for whose benefit it be to be exercise have not confer it and may not be willing to confer it it would seem to I that a honest application of the concede power of the general government to the advancement of the common weal present a sufficient scope to satisfy a reasonable ambition the difficulty and suppose impracticability of obtain a amendment of the constitution in this respect be i firmly believe in a great degree unfounded the time have never yet be when the patriotism and intelligence of the american people be not fully equal to the greatest exigency and it never will when the subject call forth they interposition be plainly present to they to do so with the question involve in this bill and to urge they to a early zealous and full consideration of they deep importance be in my estimation among the highest of we duty a suppose connection between appropriation for internal improvement and the system of protect duty grow out of the anxiety of those more immediately interested in they success have give rise to suggestion which it be proper i should notice on this occasion my opinion on these subject have never be conceal from those who have a right to know they those which i have entertain on the latter have frequently place I in opposition to individual as well as community whose claim upon my friendship and gratitude be of the strongest character but i trust there have be nothing in my public life which have expose I to the suspicion of be think capable of sacrifice my view of duty to private consideration however strong they may have be or deep the regret which they be capable of exciting as long as the encouragement of domestic manufacture be direct to national end it shall receive from I a temperate but steady support there be no necessary connection between it and the system of appropriation on the contrary it appear to I that the supposition of they dependence upon each other be calculate to excite the prejudice of the public against both the former be sustain on the grounds of its consistency with the letter and spirit of the constitution of its origin be trace to the assent of all the party to the original compact and of its have the support and approbation of a majority of the people on which account it be at least entitle to a fair experiment the suggestion to which i have allude refer to a forced continuance of the national debt by means of large appropriation as a substitute for the security which the system derive from the principle on which it have hitherto be sustain such a course would certainly indicate either a unreasonable distrust of the people or a consciousness that the system do not possess sufficient soundness for its support if leave to they voluntary choice and its own merit those who suppose that any policy thus found can be long uphold in this country have look upon its history with eye very different from mine this policy like every other must abide the will of the people who will not be likely to allow any device however specious to conceal its character and tendency in present these opinion i have speak with the freedom and candor which i think the occasion for they expression call for and now respectfully return the bill which have be under consideration for you further deliberation and judgment andrew jackson washington _ may 31 1830 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ gentleman : i have consider

which combine the hardihood of enterprise with the considerateness of wisdom we see in every section of we happy country a steady improvement in the means of social intercourse and correspondent effect upon the genius and law of we extended republic the apparent exception to the harmony of the prospect be to be refer rather to inevitable diversity in the various interest which enter into the composition of so extensive a whole than to any want of attachment to the union -- interest whose collision serve only in the end to foster the spirit of conciliation and patriotism so essential to the preservation of that union which i most devoutly hope be destine to prove imperishable in the midst of these blessing we have recently witness change in the condition of other nation which may in they consequence call for the utmost vigilance wisdom and unanimity in we council and the exercise of all the moderation and patriotism of we people the important modification of they government

universal burst of applause in which you have participate in congratulating you my fellow-citizen upon a event so auspicious to the dearest interest of mankind i do no more than respond to the voice of my country without transcend in the slightest degree that salutary maxim of the illustrious washington which enjoin a abstinence from all interference with the internal affair of other nation from

paramount authority of the public will -- that the american people rejoice i be happy to inform you that the anticipation which be indulge at the date of my last communication on the subject of we foreign affair have be fully realize in several important particulars a arrangement have be effect with great britain in relation to the trade between the united state and she west indium and north american colony which have settle a question that have for year afford matter for contention and almost uninterrupted discussion and have be the subject of no less than six negotiation in a manner which promise result highly favorable to the party the abstract right of great britain to monopolize the trade with she colony or to exclude we from a participation therein have never be deny by the united state but we have contend and with reason that if at any time great britain may desire the production of this country as necessary to she colony they must be receive upon principle of just reciprocity and further that it be make a invidious and unfriendly distinction to open she colonial port to the vessel of other nation and close they against those of the united state antecedently to 1794 a portion of we production be admit into the colonial island of great britain by particular concession limit to the term of one year but renew from year to year in the transportation of these production however we vessel be not allow to engage this be a privilege reserve to british shipping by which alone we produce could be take to the island and theirs bring to we in return from newfoundland and she continental possession all we production as well as we vessel be exclude with occasional relaxation by which in season of distress the former be admit in british bottom by the treaty of 1794 she offer to concede to we for a limited time the right of carry to she west indium possession in we vessel not exceed 70 ton burthen and upon the same term as british vessel any production of the united state which british vessel might import therefrom but this privilege be couple with condition which be suppose to have lead to its rejection by the senate that be that american vessel should land they return cargo in the united state only and moreover that they should during the continuance of the privilege be preclude from carry molasses sugar coffee cocoa or cotton either from those island or from the united state to any other part of the world great britain readily consent to expunge this article from the treaty and subsequent attempt to arrange the term of the trade either by treaty stipulation or concerted legislation have fail it have be successively suspend and allow accord to the vary legislation of the party the following be the prominent point which have in later year separate the two government : besides a restriction whereby all importation into she colony in american vessel be confine to we own product carry hence a restriction to which it do not appear that we have ever object a lead object on the part of great britain have be to prevent we from become the carrier of british west indium commodity to any other country than we own on the part of the united state it have be contend first that the subject should be regulate by treaty stipulation in preference to separate legislation second that we production when import into the colony in question should not be subject to higher duty than the production of the mother country or of she other colonial possession and third that we vessel should be allow to participate in the circuitous trade between the united state and different part of the british dominion the first point after have be for a long time strenuously insist upon by great britain be give up by the act of parliament of July 1825 all vessel suffer to trade with the colony be permit to clear from thence with any article which british vessel might export and proceed to any part of the world great britain and she dependency alone except on we part each of the above point have in succession be explicitly abandon in negotiation precede that of which the result be now announce this arrangement secure to the united state every advantage ask by they and which the state of the negotiation allow we to insist upon the trade will be place upon a footing decidedly more favorable to this country than any on which it ever stand and we commerce and navigation will enjoy in the colonial port of great britain every privilege allow to other nation that the prosperity of the country so far as it depend on this trade will be greatly promote by the new arrangement there can be no doubt independently of the more obvious advantage of a open and direct intercourse its establishment will be attend with other consequence of a higher value that which have be carry on since the mutual interdict under all the expense and inconvenience unavoidably incident to it would have be insupportably onerous have it not be in a great degree lighten by concerted evasion in the mode of make the trans-shipment at what be call the neutral port these indirection be inconsistent with the dignity of nation that have so many motive not only to cherish feeling of mutual friendship but to maintain such relation as will stimulate they respective citizen and subject to effort of direct open and honorable competition only and preserve they from the influence of seductive and vitiate circumstance when you preliminary interposition be ask at the close of the last session a copy of the instruction under which mr mclane have act together with the communication which have at that time pass between he and the british government be lay before you although there have not be anything in the act of the two government which require secrecy it be think most proper in the then state of the negotiation to make that communication a confidential one so soon however as the evidence of execution on the part of great britain be receive the whole matter shall be lay before you when it will be see that the apprehension which appear to have suggest one of the provision of the act pass at you last session that the restoration of the trade in question might be connect with other subject and be seek to be obtain at the sacrifice of the public interest in other particulars be wholly unfounded and that the change which have take place in the view of the british government have be induce by consideration as honorable to both party as i trust the result will prove beneficial this desirable result be it will be see greatly promote by the liberal and confide provision of the act of congress of the last session by which we port be upon the reception and annunciation by the president of the require assurance on the part of great britain forthwith open to she vessel before the arrangement could be carry into effect on she part pursue in this act of prospective legislation a similar course to that adopt by great britain in abolish by she act of parliament in 1825 a restriction then exist and permit we vessel to clear from the colony on they return voyage for any foreign country whatever before british vessel have be relieve from the restriction impose by we law of return directly from the united state to the colony a restriction which she require and expect that we should abolish upon each occasion a limited and temporary advantage have be give to the opposite party but a advantage of no importance in comparison with the restoration of mutual confidence and good feeling and the ultimate establishment of the trade upon fair principle it give I unfeigned pleasure to assure you that this negotiation have be throughout characterize by the most frank and friendly spirit on the part of great britain and conclude in a manner strongly indicative of a sincere desire to cultivate the best relation with the united state to reciprocate this disposition to the fullest extent of my ability be a duty which i shall deem it a privilege to discharge although the result be itself the best commentary on the service render to he country by we minister at the court of st jame it would be do violence to my feeling be i to dismiss the subject without express the very high sense i entertain of the talent and exertion which have be display by he on the occasion the injury to the commerce of the united state result from the exclusion of we vessel from the black sea and the previous footing of mere sufferance upon which even the limited trade enjoy by we with turkey have hitherto be place have for a long time be a source of much solicitude to this government and several endeavor have be make to obtain a better state of thing sensible of the importance of the object i feel it my duty to leave no proper means unemployed to acquire for we flag the same privilege that be enjoy by the principal power of europe commissioner be consequently appoint to open a negotiation with the sublime porte not long after the member of the commission who go directly from the united state have sail the account of the treaty of adrianople by which one of the object in view be suppose to be secure reach this country the black sea be understand to be open to we under the supposition that this be the case the additional facility to be derive from the establishment of commercial regulation with the porte be deem of sufficient importance to require a prosecution of the negotiation as originally contemplate it be therefore persevere in and result in a treaty which will be forthwith lay before the senate by its provision a free passage be secure without limitation of time to the vessel of the united state to and from the black sea include the navigation thereof and we trade with turkey be place on the footing of the most favored nation the latter be a arrangement wholly independent of the treaty of adrianople and the former derive much value not only from the increase security which under any circumstance it would give to the right in question but from the fact ascertain in the course of the negotiation that by the construction put upon that treaty by turkey the article relate to the passage of the bosphorus be confine to nation have treaty with the porte the most friendly feeling appear to be entertain by the sultan and a enlighten disposition be evince by he to foster the intercourse between the two country by the most liberal arrangement this disposition it will be we duty and interest to cherish we relation with russium be of the most stable character respect for that empire and confidence in its friendship toward the united state have be so long entertain on we part and so carefully cherish by the present emperor and he illustrious predecessor as to have become incorporate with the public sentiment of the united state no means will be leave unemployed on my part to promote these salutary feeling and those improvement of which the commercial intercourse between the two country be susceptible and which have derive increase importance from we treaty with the sublime porte i sincerely regret to inform you that we minister lately commission to that court on whose distinguished talent and great experience in public affair i place great reliance have be compel by extreme indisposition to exercise a privilege which in consideration of the extent to which he constitution have be impair in the public service be commit to he discretion -- of leave temporarily he post for the advantage of a more genial climate if as it be to be hope the improvement of he health should be such as to justify he in do so he will repair to st petersburg and resume the discharge of he official duty i have receive the most satisfactory assurance that in the meantime the public interest in that quarter will be preserve from prejudice by the intercourse which he will continue through the secretary of legation with the russian cabinet you be apprise although the fact have not yet be officially announce to the house of representative that a treaty be in the month of march last conclude between the united state and denmark by which $ 650000 be secure to we citizen as a indemnity for spoliation upon they commerce in the year 1808 1809 1810 and 1811 this treaty be sanction by the senate at the close of its last session and it now become the duty of congress to pass the necessary law for the organization of the board of commissioner to distribute the indemnity among the claimant it be a agreeable circumstance in this adjustment that the term be in conformity with the previously ascertain view of the claimant themselves thus remove all pretense for a future agitation of the subject in any form the negotiation in regard to such point in we foreign relation as remain to be adjust have be actively prosecute during the recess material advance have be make which be of a character to promise favorable result we country by the blessing of god be not in a situation to invite aggression and it will be we fault if she ever become so sincerely desirous to cultivate the most liberal and friendly relation with all ever ready to fulfill we engagement with scrupulous fidelity limit we demand upon other to mere justice hold ourselves ever ready to do unto they as we would wish to be do by and avoid even the appearance of undue partiality to any nation it appear to I impossible that a simple and sincere application of we principle to we foreign relation can fail to place they ultimately upon the footing on which it be we wish they should rest of the point refer to the most prominent be we claim upon france for spoliation upon we commerce similar claim upon spain together with embarrassment in the commercial intercourse between the two country which ought to be remove the conclusion of the treaty of commerce and navigation with mexico which have be so long in suspense as well as the final settlement of limit between ourselves and that republic and finally the arbitrament of the question between the united state and great britain in regard to the northeastern boundary the negotiation with france have be conduct by we minister with zeal and ability and in all respects to my entire satisfaction although the prospect of a favorable termination be occasionally dim by counter pretension to which the united state could not assent he yet have strong hope of be able to arrive at a satisfactory settlement with the late government the negotiation have be renew with the present authority and sensible of the general and lively confidence of we citizen in the justice and magnanimity of regenerated france i regret the more not to have it in my power yet to announce the result so confidently anticipate no ground however inconsistent with this expectation have yet be take and i do not allow myself to doubt that justice will soon be do we the amount of the claim the length of time they have remain unsatisfied and they incontrovertible justice make a earnest prosecution of they by this government a urgent duty the illegality of the seizure and confiscation out of which they have arise be not dispute and whatever distinction may have heretofore be set up in regard to the liability of the exist government it be quite clear that such consideration can not now be interpose the commercial intercourse between the two country be susceptible of highly advantageous improvement but the sense of this injury have have and must continue to have a very unfavorable influence upon they from its satisfactory adjustment not only a firm and cordial friendship but a progressive development of all they relation may be expect it be therefore my earnest hope that this old and vexatious subject of difference may be speedily remove i feel that my confidence in we appeal to the motive which should govern a just and magnanimous nation be alike warrant by the character of the french people and by the high voucher we possess for the enlarged view and pure integrity of the monarch who now preside over they council and nothing shall be want on my part to meet any manifestation of the spirit we anticipate in one of corresponding frankness and liberality the subject of difference with spain have be bring to the view of that government by we minister there with much force and propriety and the strongest assurance have be receive of they early and favorable consideration the step which remain to place the matter in controversy between great britain and the united state fairly before the arbitrator have all be take in the same liberal and friendly spirit which characterize those before announce recent event have doubtless serve to delay the decision but we minister at the court of the distinguished arbitrator have be assure that it will be make within the time contemplate by the treaty i be particularly gratify in be able to state that a decidedly favorable and as i hope lasting change have be effect in we relation with the neighbor republic of mexico the unfortunate and unfounded suspicion in regard to we disposition which it become my painful duty to advert to on a former occasion have be i believe entirely remove and the government of mexico have be make to understand the real character of the wish and view of this in regard to that country the consequence be the establishment of friendship and mutual confidence such be the assurance i have receive and i see no cause to doubt they sincerity i have reason to expect the conclusion of a commercial treaty with mexico in season for communication on the present occasion circumstance which be not explain but which i be persuade be not the result of a indisposition on she part to enter into it have produce the delay there be reason to fear in the course of the last summer that the harmony of we relation might be disturb by the act of certain claimant under mexican grant of territory which have hitherto be under we jurisdiction the cooperation of the representative of mexico near this government be ask on the occasion and be readily afford instruction and advice have be give to the governor of arkansa and the officer in command in the adjoining mexican state by which it be hope the quiet of that frontier will be preserve until a final settlement of the divide line shall have remove all ground of controversy the exchange of ratification of the treaty conclude last year with austrium have not yet take place the delay have be occasion by the nonarrival of the ratification of that government within the time prescribe by the treaty renew authority have be ask for by the representative of austrium and in the meantime the rapidly increase trade and navigation between the two country have be place upon the most liberal footing of we navigation act several alleged depredation have be recently commit on we commerce by the national vessel of portugal they have be make the subject of immediate remonstrance and reclamation i be not yet possess of sufficient information to express a definitive opinion of they character but expect soon to receive it no proper means shall be omit to obtain for we citizen all the redress to which they may appear to be entitle almost at the moment of the adjournment of you last session two bill -- the one entitle a act for make appropriation for build light-house light-boat beacon and monument place buoy and for improve harbor and direct survey and the other a act to authorize a subscription for stock in the louisville and portland canal company -- be submit for my approval it be not possible within the time allow I before the close of the session to give to these bill the consideration which be due to they character and importance and i be compel to retain they for that purpose i now avail myself of this early opportunity to return they to the house in which they respectively originate with the reason which after mature deliberation compel I to withhold my approval the practice of defray out of the treasury of the united state the expense incur by the establishment and support of light-houses beacon buoy and public pier within the bay inlet harbor and port of the united state to render the navigation thereof safe and easy be coeval with the adoption of the constitution and have be continue without interruption or dispute as we foreign commerce increase and be extend into the interior of the country by the establishment of port of entry and delivery upon we navigable river the sphere of those expenditure receive a corresponding enlargement light-house beacon buoy public pier and the removal of sand bar sawyer and other partial or temporary impediment in the navigable river and harbor which be embrace in the revenue district from time to time establish by law be authorize upon the same principle and the expense defray in the same manner that these expense have at time be extravagant and disproportionate be very probable the circumstance under which they be incur be well calculate to lead to such a result unless they application be subject to the closest scrutiny the local advantage arise from the disbursement of public money too frequently it be to be fear invite appropriation for object of this character that be neither necessary nor useful the number of light-house keeper be already very large and the bill before I propose to add to it fifty-one more of various description from representation upon the subject which be understand to be entitle to respect i be induce to believe that there have not only be great improvidence in the past expenditure of the government upon these object but that the security of navigation have in some instance be diminish by the multiplication of light-house and consequent change of light upon the coast it be in this as in other respects we duty to avoid all unnecessary expense as well as every increase of patronage not call for by the public service but in the discharge of that duty in this particular it must not be forget that in relation to we foreign commerce the burden and benefit of protect and accommodate it necessarily go together and must do so as long as the public revenue be draw from the people through the custom-house it be indisputable that whatever give facility and security to navigation cheapen import and all who consume they be alike interested in whatever produce this effect if they consume they ought as they now do to pay otherwise they do not pay the consumer in the most inland state derive the same advantage from every necessary and prudent expenditure for the facility and security of we foreign commerce and navigation that he do who reside in a maritime state local expenditure have not of themselves a corresponding operation from a bill make _ direct _ appropriation for such object i should not have withhold my assent the one now return do so in several particulars but it also contain appropriation for survey of a local character which i can not approve it give I satisfaction to find that no serious inconvenience have arise from withhold my approval from this bill nor will it i trust be cause of regret that a opportunity will be thereby afford for congress to review its provision under circumstance better calculate for full investigation than those under which it be pass in speaking of direct appropriation i mean not to include a practice which have obtain to some extent and to which i have in one instance in a different capacity give my assent -- that of subscribe to the stock of private association positive experience and a more thorough consideration of the subject have convince I of the impropriety as well as inexpediency of such investment all improvement effect by the fund of the nation for general use should be open to the enjoyment of all we fellow-citizen exempt from the payment of toll or any imposition of that character the practice of thus mingle the concern of the government with those of the state or of individual be inconsistent with the object of its institution and highly impolitic the successful operation of the federal system can only be preserve by confine it to the few and simple but yet important object for which it be design a different practice if allow to progress would ultimately change the character of this government by consolidate into one the general and state government which be intend to be keep forever distinct i can not perceive how bill authorize such subscription can be otherwise regard than as bill for revenue and consequently subject to the rule in that respect prescribe by the constitution if the interest of the government in private company be subordinate to that of individual the management and control of a portion of the public fund be delegate to a authority unknown to the constitution and beyond the supervision of we constituent if superior its officer and agent will be constantly expose to imputation of favoritism and oppression direct prejudice to the public interest or a alienation of the affection and respect of portion of the people may therefore in addition to the general discredit result to the government from embark with its constituent in pecuniary stipulation be look for as the probable fruit of such association it be no answer to this objection to say that the extent of consequence like these can not be great from a limited and small number of investment because experience in other matter teach we -- and we be not at liberty to disregard its admonition -- that unless a entire stop be put to they it will soon be impossible to prevent they accumulation until they be spread over the whole country and make to embrace many of the private and appropriate concern of individual the power which the general government would acquire within the several state by become the principal stockholder in corporation control every canal and each 60 or 100 mile of every important road and give a proportionate vote in all they election be almost inconceivable and in my view dangerous to the liberty of the people this mode of aid such work be also in its nature deceptive and in many case conducive to improvidence in the administration of the national fund appropriation will be obtain with much greater facility and grant with less security to the public interest when the measure be thus disguise than when definite and direct expenditure of money be ask for the interest of the nation would doubtless be better serve by avoid all such indirect mode of aid particular object in a government like ours more especially should all public act be as far as practicable simple undisguised and intelligible that they may become fit subject for the approbation or animadversion of the people the bill authorize a subscription to the louisville and portland canal afford a striking illustration of the difficulty of withhold additional appropriation for the same object when the first erroneous step have be take by institute a partnership between the government and private company it propose a third subscription on the part of the united state when each precede one be at the time regard as the extent of the aid which government be to render to that work and the accompany bill for light-house etc contain a appropriation for a survey of the bed of the river with a view to its improvement by remove the obstruction which the canal be design to avoid this improvement if successful would afford a free passage of the river and render the canal entirely useless to such improvidence be the course of legislation subject in relation to internal improvement on local matter even with the best intention on the part of congress although the motive which have influence I in this matter may be already sufficiently state i be nevertheless induce by its importance to add a few observation of a general character in my objection to the bill authorize subscription to the maysville and rockville road company i express my view fully in regard to the power of congress to construct road and canal within a state or to appropriate money for improvement of a local character i at the same time intimate my belief that the right to make appropriation for such as be of a national character have be so generally act upon and so long acquiesce in by the federal and state government and the constituent of each as to justify its exercise on the ground of continue and uninterrupted usage but that it be nevertheless highly expedient that appropriation even of that character should with the exception make at the time be defer until the national debt be pay and that in the meanwhile some general rule for the action of the government in that respect ought to be establish these suggestion be not necessary to the decision of the question then before I and be i readily admit intend to awake the attention and draw forth the opinion and observation of we constituent upon a subject of the highest importance to they interest and one destine to exert a powerful influence upon the future operation of we political system i know of no tribunal to which a public man in this country in a case of doubt and difficulty can appeal with greater advantage or more propriety than the judgment of the people and although i must necessarily in the discharge of my official duty be govern by the dictate of my own judgment i have no desire to conceal my anxious wish to conform as far as i can to the view of those for whom i act all irregular expression of public opinion be of necessity attend with some doubt as to they accuracy but make full allowance on that account i can not i think deceive myself in believe that the act refer to as well as the suggestion which i allow myself to make in relation to they bearing upon the future operation of the government have be approve by the great body of the people that those whose immediate pecuniary interest be to be affect by propose expenditure should shrink from the application of a rule which prefer they more general and remote interest to those which be personal and immediate be to be expect but even such objection must from the nature of we population be but temporary in they duration and if it be otherwise we course should be the same for the time be yet i hope far distant when those intrust with power to be exercise for the good of the whole will consider it either honest or wise to purchase local favor at the sacrifice of principle and general good so understand public sentiment and thoroughly satisfied that the best interest of we common country imperiously require that the course which i have recommend in this regard should be adopt i have upon the most mature consideration determine to pursue it it be due to candor as well as to my own feeling that i should express the reluctance and anxiety which i must at all time experience in exercise the undoubted right of the executive to withhold he assent from bill on other grounds than they constitutionality that this right should not be exercise on slight occasion all will admit it be only in matter of deep interest when the principle involve may be justly regard as next in importance to infraction of the constitution itself that such a step can be expect to meet with the approbation of the people such a occasion do i conscientiously believe the present to be in the discharge of this delicate and highly responsible duty i be sustain by the reflection that the exercise of this power have be deem consistent with the obligation of official duty by several of my predecessor and by the persuasion too that whatever liberal institution may have to fear from the encroachment of executive power which have be everywhere the cause of so much strife and bloody contention but little danger be to be apprehend from a precedent by which that authority deny to itself the exercise of power that bring in they train influence and patronage of great extent and thus exclude the operation of personal interest everywhere the bane of official trust i derive too no small degree of satisfaction from the reflection that if i have mistake the interest and wish of the people the constitution afford the means of soon redress the error by select for the place they favor have bestow upon I a citizen whose opinion may accord with they own i trust in the meantime the interest of the nation will be save from prejudice by a rigid application of that portion of the public fund which might otherwise be apply to different object to that highest of all we obligation the payment of the public debt and a opportunity be afford for the adoption of some better rule for the operation of the government in this matter than any which have hitherto be act upon profoundly impressed with the importance of the subject not merely as relate to the general prosperity of the country but to the safety of the federal system i can not avoid repeat my earnest hope that all good citizen who take a proper interest in the success and harmony of we admirable political institution and who be incapable of desire to convert a opposite state of thing into means for the gratification of personal ambition will lay aside minor consideration and discard local prejudice unite they honest exertion to establish some fixed general principle which shall be calculate to effect the greatest extent of public good in regard to the subject of internal improvement and afford the least ground for sectional discontent the general grounds of my objection to local appropriation have be heretofore express and i shall endeavor to avoid a repetition of what have be already urge -- the importance of sustain the state sovereignty as far as be consistent with the rightful action of the federal government and of preserve the greatest attainable harmony between they i will now only add a expression of my conviction -- a conviction which every day 's experience serve to confirm -- that the political creed which inculcate the pursuit of those great object as a paramount duty be the true faith and one to which we be mainly indebted for the present success of the entire system and to which we must alone look for its future stability that there be diversity in the interest of the different state which compose this extensive confederacy must be admit those diversity arise from situation climate population and pursuit be doubtless as it be natural they should be greatly exaggerate by jealousy and that spirit of rivalry so inseparable from neighbor community these circumstance make it the duty of those who be intrust with the management of its affair to neutralize they effect as far as practicable by make the beneficial operation of the federal government as equal and equitable among the several state as can be do consistently with the great end of its institution it be only necessary to refer to undoubted fact to see how far the past act of the government upon the subject under consideration have fall short of this object the expenditure heretofore make for internal improvement amount to upward of $ 5000000 and have be distribute in very unequal proportion amongst the state the estimate expense of work of which survey have be make together with that of other project and partially survey amount to more than $ 96000000 that such improvement on account of particular circumstance may be more advantageously and beneficially make in some state than in other be doubtless true but that they be of a character which should prevent a equitable distribution of the fund amongst the several state be not to be concede the want of this equitable distribution can not fail to prove a prolific source of irritation among the state we have it constantly before we eye that profession of superior zeal in the cause of internal improvement and a disposition to lavish the public fund upon object of this character be daily and earnestly put forth by aspirant to power as constitute the highest claim to the confidence of the people would it be strange under such circumstance and in time of great excitement that grant of this description should find they motive in object which may not accord with the public good those who have not have occasion to see and regret the indication of a sinister influence in these matter in past time have be more fortunate than myself in they observation of the course of public affair if to these evil be add the combination and angry contention to which such a course of thing give rise with they baleful influence upon the legislation of congress touch the lead and appropriate duty of the federal government it be but do justice to the character of we people to expect the severe condemnation of the past which the recent exhibition of public sentiment have evince nothing short of a radical change in the action of the government upon the subject can in my opinion remedy the evil if as it would be natural to expect the state which have be least favor in past appropriation should insist on be redress in those hereafter to be make at the expense of the state which have so largely and disproportionately participate we have as matter now stand but little security that the attempt would do more than change the inequality from one quarter to another thus view the subject i have heretofore feel it my duty to recommend the adoption of some plan for the distribution of the surplus fund which may at any time remain in the treasury after the national debt shall have be pay among the state in proportion to the number of they representative to be apply by they to object of internal improvement although this plan have meet with favor in some portion of the union it have also elicit objection which merit deliberate consideration a brief notice of these objection here will not therefore i trust be regard as out of place they rest as far as they have come to my knowledge on the follow grounds : first a objection to the ratio of distribution second a apprehension that the existence of such a regulation would produce improvident and oppressive taxation to raise the fund for distribution third that the mode propose would lead to the construction of work of a local nature to the exclusion of such as be general and as would consequently be of a more useful character and last that it would create a discreditable and injurious dependence on the part of the state government upon the federal power of those who object to the ratio of representation as the basis of distribution some insist that the importation of the respective state would constitute one that would be more equitable and other again that the extent of they respective territory would furnish a standard which would be more expedient and sufficiently equitable the ratio of representation present itself to my mind and it still do as one of obvious equity because of its be the ratio of contribution whether the fund to be distribute be derive from the custom or from direct taxation it do not follow however that its adoption be indispensable to the establishment of the system propose there may be consideration appertain to the subject which would render a departure to some extent from the rule of contribution proper nor be it absolutely necessary that the basis of distribution be confine to one ground it may if in the judgment of those whose right it be to fix it be deem politic and just to give it that character have regard to several in my first message i state it to be my opinion that it be not probable that any adjustment of the tariff upon principle satisfactory to the people of the union will until a remote period if ever leave the government without a considerable surplus in the treasury beyond what may be require for its current service i have have no cause to change that opinion but much to confirm it should these expectation be realize a suitable fund would thus be produce for the plan under consideration to operate upon and if there be no such fund its adoption will in my opinion work no injury to any interest for i can not assent to the justness of the apprehension that the establishment of the proposed system would tend to the encouragement of improvident legislation of the character suppose whatever the proper authority in the exercise of constitutional power shall at any time hereafter decide to be for the general good will in that as in other respects deserve and receive the acquiescence and support of the whole country and we have ample security that every abuse of power in that regard by agent of the people will receive a speedy and effectual corrective at they hand the view which i take of the future found on the obvious and increase improvement of all class of we fellow-citizen in intelligence and in public and private virtue leave I without much apprehension on that head i do not doubt that those who come after we will be as much alive as we be to the obligation upon all the trustee of political power to exempt those for whom they act from all unnecessary burthen and as sensible of the great truth that the resource of the nation beyond those require for immediate and necessary purpose of government can nowhere be so well deposit as in the pocket of the people it may sometimes happen that the interest of particular state would not be deem to coincide with the general interest in relation to improvement within such state but if the danger to be apprehend from this source be sufficient to require it a discretion might be reserve to congress to direct to such improvement of a general character as the state concern might not be dispose to unite in the application of the quota of those state under the restriction of confine to each state the expenditure of its appropriate quota it may however be assume as a safe general rule that such improvement as serve to increase the prosperity of the respective state in which they be make by give new facility to trade and thereby augment the wealth and comfort of they inhabitant constitute the surest mode of confer permanent and substantial advantage upon the whole the strength as well as the true glory of the confederacy be found on the prosperity and power of the several independent sovereignty of which it be compose and the certainty with which they can be bring into successful active cooperation through the agency of the federal government it be moreover within the knowledge of such as be at all conversant with public affair that scheme of internal improvement have from time to time be propose which from they extent and seem magnificence be readily regard as of national concernment but which upon fuller consideration and further experience would now be reject with great unanimity that the plan under consideration would derive important advantage from its certainty and that the money set apart for these purpose would be more judiciously apply and economically expend under the direction of the state legislature in which every part of each state be immediately represent can not i think be doubt in the new state particularly where a comparatively small population be scatter over a extensive surface and the representation in congress consequently very limited it be natural to expect that the appropriation make by the federal government would be more likely to be expend in the vicinity of those member through whose immediate agency they be obtain than if the fund be place under the control of the legislature in which every county of the state have its own representative this supposition do not necessarily impugn the motive of such congressional representative nor be it so intend we be all sensible of the bias to which the strongest mind and purest heart be under such circumstance liable in respect to the last objection -- its probable effect upon the dignity and independence of state government -- it appear to I only necessary to state the case as it be and as it would be if the measure propose be adopt to show that the operation be most likely to be the very reverse of that which the objection suppose in the one case the state would receive its quota of the national revenue for domestic use upon a fix principle as a matter of right and from a fund to the creation of which it have itself contribute its fair proportion surely there could be nothing derogatory in that as matter now stand the state themselves in they sovereign character be not unfrequently petitioner at the bar of the federal legislature for such allowance out of the national treasury as it may comport with they pleasure or sense of duty to bestow upon they it can not require argument to prove which of the two course be most compatible with the efficiency or respectability of the state government but all these be matter for discussion and dispassionate consideration that the desire adjustment would be attend with difficulty afford no reason why it should not be attempt the effective operation of such motive would have prevent the adoption of the constitution under which we have so long live and under the benign influence of which we beloved country have so signally prosper the framer of that sacred instrument have greater difficulty to overcome and they do overcome they the patriotism of the people direct by a deep conviction of the importance of the union produce mutual concession and reciprocal forbearance strict right be merge in a spirit of compromise and the result have consecrate they disinterested devotion to the general weal unless the american people have degenerate the same result can be again effect whenever experience point out the necessity of a resort to the same means to uphold the fabric which they father have rear it be beyond the power of man to make a system of government like ours or any other operate with precise equality upon state situate like those which compose this confederacy nor be inequality always injustice every state can not expect to shape the measure of the general government to suit its own particular interest the cause which prevent it be seat in the nature of thing and can not be entirely counteract by human means mutual forbearance become therefore a duty obligatory upon all and we may i be confident count upon a cheerful compliance with this high injunction on the part of we constituent it be not to be suppose that they will object to make such comparatively inconsiderable sacrifice for the preservation of rights and privilege which other less favored portion of the world have in vain wade through sea of blood to acquire we course be a safe one if it be but faithfully adhere to acquiescence in the constitutionally express will of the majority and the exercise of that will in a spirit of moderation justice and brotherly kindness will constitute a cement which would forever preserve we union those who cherish and inculcate sentiment like these render a most essential service to they country while those who seek to weaken they influence be however conscientious and praiseworthy they intention in effect its worst enemy if the intelligence and influence of the country instead of labor to foment sectional prejudice to be make subservient to party warfare be in good faith apply to the eradication of cause of local discontent by the improvement of we institution and by facilitate they adaptation to the condition of the time this task would prove one of less difficulty may we not hope that the obvious interest of we common country and the dictate of a enlighten patriotism will in the end lead the public mind in that direction after all the nature of the subject do not admit of a plan wholly free from objection that which have for some time be in operation be perhaps the worst that could exist and every advance that can be make in its improvement be a matter eminently worthy of you most deliberate attention it be very possible that one better calculate to effect the object in view may yet be devise if so it be to be hope that those who disapprove the past and dissent from what be propose for the future will feel it they duty to direct they attention to it as they must be sensible that unless some fix rule for the action of the federal government in this respect be establish the course now attempt to be arrest will be again resort to any mode which be calculate to give the greatest degree of effect and harmony to we legislation upon the subject which shall best serve to keep the movement of the federal government within the sphere intend by those who model and those who adopt it which shall lead to the extinguishment of the national debt in the shortest period and impose the lightest burthen upon we constituent shall receive from I a cordial and firm support among the object of great national concern i can not omit to press again upon you attention that part of the constitution which regulate the election of president and vice-president the necessity for its amendment be make so clear to my mind by observation of its evil and by the many able discussion which they have elicit on the floor of congress and elsewhere that i should be want to my duty be i to withhold another expression of my deep solicitude on the subject we system fortunately contemplate a recurrence to first principle differ in this respect from all that have precede it and secure it i trust equally against the decay and the commotion which have mark the progress of other government we fellow-citizen too who in proportion to they love of liberty keep a steady eye upon the means of sustain it do not require to be remind of the duty they owe to themselves to remedy all essential defect in so vital a part of they system while they be sensible that every evil attendant upon its operation be not necessarily indicative of a bad organization but may proceed from temporary cause yet the habitual presence or even a single instance of evil which can be clearly trace to a organic defect will not i trust be overlook through a too scrupulous veneration for the work of they ancestor the constitution be a experiment commit to the virtue and intelligence of the great mass of we countryman in whose rank the framer of it themselves be to perform the part of patriotic observation and scrutiny and if they have pass from the stage of existence with a increase confidence in its general adaptation to we condition we should learn from authority so high the duty of fortify the point in it which time prove to be expose rather than be deter from approach they by the suggestion of fear or the dictate of misplace reverence a provision which do not secure to the people a direct choice of they chief magistrate but have a tendency to defeat they will present to my mind such a inconsistency with the general spirit of we institution that i be induce to suggest for you consideration the substitute which appear to I at the same time the most likely to correct the evil and to meet the view of we constituent the most mature reflection since have add strength to the belief that the best interest of we country require the speedy adoption of some plan calculate to effect this end a contingency which sometimes place it in the power of a single member of the house of representative to decide a election of so high and solemn a character be unjust to the people and become when it occur a source of embarrassment to the individual thus bring into power and a cause of distrust of the representative body liable as the confederacy be from its great extent to party found upon sectional interest and to a corresponding multiplication of candidate for the presidency the tendency of the constitutional reference to the house of representative be to devolve the election upon that body in almost every instance and whatever choice may then be make among the candidate thus present to they to swell the influence of particular interest to a degree inconsistent with the general good the consequence of this feature of the constitution appear far more threatening to the peace and integrity of the union than any which i can conceive as likely to result from the simple legislative action of the federal government it be a lead object with the framer of the constitution to keep as separate as possible the action of the legislative and executive branch of the government to secure this object nothing be more essential than to preserve the former from all temptation of private interest and therefore so to direct the patronage of the latter as not to permit such temptation to be offer experience abundantly demonstrate that every precaution in this respect be a valuable safeguard of liberty and one which my reflection upon the tendency of we system incline I to think should be make still stronger it be for this reason that in connection with a amendment of the constitution remove all intermediate agency in the choice of the president i recommend some restriction upon the reeligibility of that officer and upon the tenure of office generally the reason still exist and i renew the recommendation with a increase confidence that its adoption will strengthen those check by which the constitution design to secure the independence of each department of the government and promote the healthful and equitable administration of all the trust which it have create the agent most likely to contravene this design of the constitution be the chief magistrate in order particularly that he appointment may as far as possible be place beyond the reach of any improper influence in order that he may approach the solemn responsibility of the highest office in the gift of a free people uncommitted to any other course than the strict line of constitutional duty and that the security for this independence may be render as strong as the nature of power and the weakness of its possessor will admit i can not too earnestly invite you attention to the propriety of promote such a amendment of the constitution as will render he ineligible after one term of service it give I pleasure to announce to congress that the benevolent policy of the government steadily pursue for nearly thirty year in relation to the removal of the indian beyond the white settlement be approach to a happy consummation two important tribe have accept the provision make for they removal at the last session of congress and it be believe that they example will induce the remain tribe also to seek the same obvious advantage the consequence of a speedy removal will be important to the united state to individual state and to the indian themselves the pecuniary advantage which it promise to the government be the least of its recommendation it put a end to all possible danger of collision between the authority of the general and state government on account of the indian it will place a dense and civilized population in large tract of country now occupy by a few savage hunter by open the whole territory between tennessee on the north and louisiana on the south to the settlement of the whites it will incalculably strengthen the southwestern frontier and render the adjacent state strong enough to repel future invasion without remote aid it will relieve the whole state of mississippus and the western part of alabama of indian occupancy and enable those state to advance rapidly in population wealth and power it will separate the indian from immediate contact with settlement of whites free they from the power of the state enable they to pursue happiness in they own way and under they own rude institution will retard the progress of decay which be lessen they number and perhaps cause they gradually under the protection of the government and through the influence of good counsel to cast off they savage habit and become a interesting civilized and christian community these consequence some of they so certain and the rest so probable make the complete execution of the plan sanction by congress at they last session a object of much solicitude toward the aborigine of the country no one can indulge a more friendly feeling than myself or would go further in attempt to reclaim they from they wander habit and make they a happy prosperous people i have endeavor to impress upon they my own solemn conviction of the duty and power of the general government in relation to the state authority for the justice of the law pass by the state within the scope of they reserved power they be not responsible to this government as individual we may entertain and express we opinion of they act but as a government we have as little right to control they as we have to prescribe law for other nation with a full understanding of the subject the choctaw and the chickasaw tribe have with great unanimity determine to avail themselves of the liberal offer present by the act of congress and have agree to remove beyond the mississippus river treaty have be make with they which in due season will be submit for consideration in negotiate these treaty they be make to understand they true condition and they have prefer maintain they independence in the western forest to submit to the law of the state in which they now reside these treaty be probably the last which will ever be make with they be characterize by great liberality on the part of the government they give the indian a liberal sum in consideration of they removal and comfortable subsistence on they arrival at they new home if it be they real interest to maintain a separate existence they will there be at liberty to do so without the inconvenience and vexation to which they would unavoidably have be subject in alabama and mississippus humanity have often weep over the fate of the aborigine of this country and philanthropy have be long busily employ in devise means to avert it but its progress have never for a moment be arrest and one by one have many powerful tribe disappear from the earth to follow to the tomb the last of he race and to tread on the grave of extinct nation excite melancholy reflection but true philanthropy reconcile the mind to these vicissitude as it do to the extinction of one generation to make room for another in the monument and fortress of a unknown people spread over the extensive region of the west we behold the memorial of a once powerful race which be exterminate or have disappear to make room for the exist savage tribe nor be there anything in this which upon a comprehensive view of the general interest of the human race be to be regret philanthropy could not wish to see this continent restore to the condition in which it be find by we forefather what good man would prefer a country cover with forest and range by a few thousand savage to we extensive republic stud with city town and prosperous farm embellish with all the improvement which art can devise or industry execute occupy by more than 12000000 happy people and fill with all the blessing of liberty civilization and religion the present policy of the government be but a continuation of the same progressive change by a milder process the tribe which occupy the country now constitute the eastern state be annihilate or have melt away to make room for the whites the wave of population and civilization be roll to the westward and we now propose to acquire the country occupy by the red man of the south and west by a fair exchange and at the expense of the united state to send they to a land where they existence may be prolonged and perhaps make perpetual doubtless it will be painful to leave the grave of they father but what do they more than we ancestor do or than we child be now do to better they condition in a unknown land we forefather leave all that be dear in earthly object we child by thousand yearly leave the land of they birth to seek new home in distant region do humanity weep at these painful separation from everything animate and inanimate with which the young heart have become entwine far from it it be rather a source of joy that we country afford scope where we young population may range unconstrained in body or in mind develop the power and faculty of man in they highest perfection these remove hundred and almost thousand of mile at they own expense purchase the land they occupy and support themselves at they new home from the moment of they arrival can it be cruel in this government when by event which it can not control the indian be make discontented in he ancient home to purchase he land to give he a new and extensive territory to pay the expense of he removal and support he a year in he new abode how many thousand of we own people would gladly embrace the opportunity of remove to the west on such condition if the offer make to the indian be extend to they they would be hail with gratitude and joy and be it suppose that the wander savage have a stronger attachment to he home than the settle civilized christian be it more afflict to he to leave the grave of he father than it be to we brother and child rightly consider the policy of the general government toward the red man be not only liberal but generous he be unwilling to submit to the law of the state and mingle with they population to save he from this alternative or perhaps utter annihilation the general government kindly offer he a new home and propose to pay the whole expense of he removal and settlement in the consummation of a policy originate at a early period and steadily pursue by every administration within the present century -- so just to the state and so generous to the indian -- the executive feel it have a right to expect the cooperation of congress and of all good and disinterested man the state moreover have a right to demand it it be substantially a part of the compact which make they member of we confederacy with georgium there be a express contract with the new state a imply one of equal obligation why in authorize ohio indiana illinoi missourus mississippus and alabama to form constitution and become separate state do congress include within they limit extensive tract of indian land and in some instance powerful indian tribe be it not understand by both party that the power of the state be to be coextensive with they limit and that with all convenient dispatch the general government should extinguish the indian title and remove every obstruction to the complete jurisdiction of the state government over the soil probably not one of those state would have accept a separate existence -- certainly it would never have be grant by congress -- have it be understand that they be to be confine forever to those small portion of they nominal territory the indian title to which have at the time be extinguish it be therefore a duty which this government owe to the new state to extinguish as soon as possible the indian title to all land which congress themselves have include within they limit when this be do the duty of the general government in relation to the state and the indian within they limit be at a end the indian may leave the state or not as they choose the purchase of they land do not alter in the least they personal relation with the state government no act of the general government have ever be deem necessary to give the state jurisdiction over the person of the indian that they possess by virtue of they sovereign power within they own limit in as full a manner before as after the purchase of the indian land nor can this government add to or diminish it may we not hope therefore that all good citizen and none more zealously than those who think the indian oppress by subjection to the law of the state will unite in attempt to open the eye of those child of the forest to they true condition and by a speedy removal to relieve they from all the evil real or imaginary present or prospective with which they may be suppose to be threaten among the numerous cause of congratulation the condition of we impost revenue deserve special mention inasmuch as it promise the means of extinguish the public debt sooner than be anticipate and furnish a strong illustration of the practical effect of the present tariff upon we commercial interest the object of the tariff be object to by some as unconstitutional and it be consider by almost all as defective in many of its part the power to impose duty on import originally belong to the several state the right to adjust those duty with a view to the encouragement of domestic branch of industry be so completely incidental to that power that it be difficult to suppose the existence of the one without the other the state have delegate they whole authority over import to the general government without limitation or restriction save the very inconsiderable reservation relate to they inspection law this authority have thus entirely pass from the state the right to exercise it for the purpose of protection do not exist in they and consequently if it be not possess by the general government it must be extinct we political system would thus present the anomaly of a people strip of the right to foster they own industry and to counteract the most selfish and destructive policy which might be adopt by foreign nation this surely can not be the case this indispensable power thus surrender by the state must be within the scope of the authority on the subject expressly delegate to congress in this conclusion i be confirm as well by the opinion of president washington jefferson madison and monroe who have each repeatedly recommend the exercise of this right under the constitution as by the uniform practice of congress the continue acquiescence of the state and the general understanding of the people the difficulty of a more expedient adjustment of the present tariff although great be far from be insurmountable some be unwilling to improve any of its part because they would destroy the whole other fear to touch the objectionable part lest those they approve should be jeopard i be persuade that the advocate of these conflicting view do injustice to the american people and to they representative the general interest be the interest of each and my confidence be entire that to insure the adoption of such modification of the tariff as the general interest require it be only necessary that that interest should be understand it be a infirmity of we nature to mingle we interest and prejudice with the operation of we reasoning power and attribute to the object of we likes and dislike quality they do not possess and effect they can not produce the effect of the present tariff be doubtless overrated both in its evil and in its advantage by one class of reasoner the reduce price of cotton and other agricultural product be ascribe wholly to its influence and by another the reduce price of manufacture article the probability be that neither opinion approach the truth and that both be induce by that influence of interest and prejudice to which i have refer the decrease of price extend throughout the commercial world embrace not only the raw material and the manufactured article but provision and land the cause must therefore be deeper and more pervading than the tariff of the united state it may in a measure be attributable to the increase value of the precious metal produce by a diminution of the supply and a increase in the demand while commerce have rapidly extend itself and population have augment the supply of gold and silver the general medium of exchange have be greatly interrupt by civil convulsion in the country from which they be principally draw a part of the effect too be doubtless owe to a increase of operative and improvement in machinery but on the whole it be questionable whether the reduction in the price of land produce and manufacture have be greater than the appreciation of the standard of value while the chief object of duty should be revenue they may be so adjust as to encourage manufacture in this adjustment however it be the duty of the government to be guide by the general good object of national importance alone ought to be protect of these the production of we soil we mine and we workshop essential to national defense occupy the first rank whatever other species of domestic industry have the importance to which i have refer may be expect after temporary protection to compete with foreign labor on equal term merit the same attention in a subordinate degree the present tariff tax some of the comfort of life unnecessarily high it undertake to protect interest too local and minute to justify a general exaction and it also attempt to force some kind of manufacture for which the country be not ripe much relief will be derive in some of these respects from the measure of you last session the best as well as fairest mode of determine whether from any just consideration a particular interest ought to receive protection would be to submit the question singly for deliberation if after due examination of its merit unconnected with extraneous consideration -- such as a desire to sustain a general system or to purchase support for a different interest -- it should enlist in its favor a majority of the representative of the people there can be little danger of wrong or injury in adjust the tariff with reference to its protective effect if this obviously just principle be honestly adhere to the branch of industry which deserve protection would be save from the prejudice excite against they when that protection form part of a system by which portion of the country feel or conceive themselves to be oppress what be incalculably more important the vital principle of we system -- that principle which require acquiescence in the will of the majority -- would be secure from the discredit and danger to which it be expose by the act of majority found not on identity of conviction but on combination of small minority enter into for the purpose of mutual assistance in measure which rest solely on they own merit could never be carry i be well aware that this be a subject of so much delicacy on account of the extend interest it involve as to require that it should be touch with the utmost caution and that while a abandonment of the policy in which it originate -- a policy coeval with we government and pursue through successive administration -- be neither to be expect or desire the people have a right to demand and have demand that it be so modify as to correct abuse and obviate injustice that we deliberation on this interesting subject should be uninfluenced by those partisan conflict that be incident to free institution be the fervent wish of my heart to make this great question which unhappily so much divide and excite the public mind subservient to the short sighted view of faction must destroy all hope of settle it satisfactorily to the great body of the people and for the general interest i can not therefore in take leave of the subject too earnestly for my own feeling or the common good warn you against the blighting consequence of such a course accord to the estimate at the treasury department the receipt in the treasury during the present year will amount to $ 24161018 which will exceed by about $ 300000 the estimate present in the last annual report of the secretary of the treasury the total expenditure during the year exclusive of public debt be estimate at $ 13742311 and the payment on account of public debt for the same period will have be $ 11354630 leave a balance in the treasury on the 1st of January 1831 of $ 4819781 in connection with the condition of we finances it afford I pleasure to remark that judicious and efficient arrangement have be make by the treasury department for secure the pecuniary responsibility of the public officer and the more punctual payment of the public due the revenue-cutter service have be organize and place on a good footing and aid by a increase of inspector at expose point and regulation adopt under the act of may 1830 for the inspection and appraisement of merchandise have produce much improvement in the execution of the law and more security against the commission of fraud upon the revenue abuse in the allowance for fishing bounty have also be correct and a material saving in that branch of the service thereby effect in addition to these improvement the system of expenditure for sick seaman belong to the merchant service have be revise and be render uniform and economical the benefit of the fund applicable to this object have be usefully extend the prosperity of we country be also further evince by the increase revenue arise from the sale of public land as will appear from the report of the commissioner of the general land office and the document accompany it which be herewith transmit i beg leave to draw you attention to this report and to the propriety of make early appropriation for the object which it specify you attention be again invite to the subject connect with that portion of the public interest intrust to the war department some of they be refer to in my former message and they be present in detail in the report of the secretary of war herewith submit i refer you also to the report of that officer for a knowledge of the state of the army fortification arsenal and indian affair all of which it will be perceive have be guard with zealous attention and care it be worthy of you consideration whether the armament necessary for the fortification on we maritime frontier which be now or shortly will be complete should not be in readiness sooner than the customary appropriation will enable the department to provide they this precaution seem to be due to the general system of fortification which have be sanction by congress and be recommend by that maxim of wisdom which tell we in peace to prepare for war i refer you to the report of the secretary of the navy for a highly satisfactory account of the manner in which the concern of that department have be conduct during the present year we position in relation to the most powerful nation of the earth and the present condition of europe admonish we to cherish this arm of we national defense with peculiar care separate by wide sea from all those government whose power we might have reason to dread we have nothing to apprehend from attempt at conquest it be chiefly attack upon we commerce and harass inroad upon we coast against which we have to guard a naval force adequate to the protection of we commerce always afloat with a accumulation of the means to give it a rapid extension in case of need furnish the power by which all such aggression may be prevent or repel the attention of the government have therefore be recently direct more to preserve the public vessel already build and provide material to be place in depot for future use than to increase they number with the aid of congress in a few year the government will be prepare in case of emergency to put afloat a powerful navy of new ship almost as soon as old one could be repair the modification in this part of the service suggest in my last annual message which be notice more in detail in the report of the secretary of the navy be again recommend to you serious attention the report of the postmaster-general in like manner exhibit a satisfactory view of the important branch of the government under he charge in addition to the benefit already secure by the operation of the post-office department considerable improvement within the present year have be make by a increase in the accommodation afford by stage coach and in the frequency and celerity of the mail between some of the most important point of the union under the late contract improvement have be provide for the southern section of the country and at the same time a annual saving make of upward of $ 72000 notwithstanding the excess of expenditure beyond the current receipt for a few year past necessarily incur in the fulfillment of exist contract and in the additional expense between the period of contract to meet the demand create by the rapid growth and extension of we nourishing country yet the satisfactory assurance be give that the future revenue of the department will be sufficient to meet its extensive engagement the system recently introduce that subject its receipt and disbursement to strict regulation have entirely fulfil its design it give full assurance of the punctual transmission as well as the security of the fund of the department the efficiency and industry of its officer and the ability and energy of contractor justify a increase confidence in its continued prosperity the attention of congress be call on a former occasion to the necessity of such a modification in the office of attorney-general of the united state as would render it more adequate to the want of the public service this result in the establishment of the office of solicitor of the treasury and the earliest measure be take to give effect to the provision of the law which authorize the appointment of that officer and define he duty but it be not believe that this provision however useful in itself be calculate to supersede the necessity of extend the duty and power of the attorney-general 's office on the contrary i be convince that the public interest would be greatly promote by give to that officer the general superintendence of the various law agent of the government and of all law proceedings whether civil or criminal in which the united state may be interested allow he at the same time such a compensation as would enable he to devote he undivided attention to the public business i think such a provision be alike due to the public and to the officer occasion of reference from the different executive department to the attorney-general be of frequent occurrence and the prompt decision of the question so refer tend much to facilitate the dispatch of business in those department the report of the secretary of the treasury hereto append show also a branch of the public service not specifically intrust to any officer which might be advantageously commit to the attorney-general but independently of those consideration this office be now one of daily duty it be originally organize and its compensation fix with a view to occasional service leave to the incumbent time for the exercise of he profession in private practice the state of thing which warrant such a organization no longer exist the frequent claim upon the service of this officer would render he absence from the seat of government in professional attendance upon the court injurious to the public service and the interest of the government could not fail to be promote by charge he with the general superintendence of all its legal concern under a strong conviction of the justness of these suggestion i recommend it to congress to make the necessary provision for give effect to they and to place the attorney-general in regard to compensation on the same footing with the head of the several executive department to this officer might also be intrust a cognizance of the case of insolvency in public debtor especially if the view which i submit on this subject last year should meet the approbation of congress -- to which i again solicit you attention you attention be respectfully invite to the situation of the district of columbium place by the constitution under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of congress this district be certainly entitle to a much greater share of its consideration than it have yet receive there be a want of uniformity in its law particularly in those of a penal character which increase the expense of they administration and subject the people to all the inconvenience which result from the operation of different code in so small a territory on different side of the potomac the same offense be punishable in unequal degree and the peculiarity of many of the early law of maryland and virginium remain in force notwithstanding they repugnance in some case to the improvement which have supersede they in those state besides a remedy for these evil which be loudly call for it be respectfully submit whether a provision authorize the election of a delegate to represent the want of the citizen of this district on the floor of congress be not due to they and to the character of we government no portion of we citizen should be without a practical enjoyment of the principle of freedom and there be none more important than that which cultivate a proper relation between the governor and the govern imperfect as this must be in this case yet it be believe that it would be greatly improve by a representation in congress with the same privilege that be allow to the other territory of the united state the penitentiary be ready for the reception of convict and only await the necessary legislation to put it into operation as one object of which i beg leave to recall you attention to the propriety of provide suitable compensation for the officer charge with its inspection the importance of the principle involve in the inquiry whether it will be proper to recharter the bank of the united state require that i should again call the attention of congress to the subject nothing have occur to lessen in any degree the danger which many of we citizen apprehend from that institution as at present organize in the spirit of improvement and compromise which distinguish we country and its institution it become we to inquire whether it be not possible to secure the advantage afford by the present bank through the agency of a bank of the united state so modify in its principle and structure as to obviate constitutional and other objection it be think practicable to organize such a bank with the necessary officer as a branch of the treasury department base on the public and individual deposit without power to make loan or purchase property which shall remit the fund of the government and the expense of which may be pay if think advisable by allow its officer to sell bill of exchange to private individual at a moderate premium not be a corporate body have no stockholder debtor or property and but few officer it would not be obnoxious to the constitutional objection which be urge against the present bank and have no means to operate on the hope fear or interest of large mass of the community it would be shear of the influence which make that bank formidable the state would be strengthen by have in they hand the means of furnish the local paper currency through they own bank while the bank of the united state though issue no paper would check the issue of the state bank by take they note in deposit and for exchange only so long as they continue to be redeem with specie in time of public emergency the capacity of such a institution might be enlarged by legislative provision these suggestion be make not so much as a recommendation as with a view of call the attention of congress to the possible modification of a system which can not continue to exist in its present form without occasional collision with the local authority and perpetual apprehension and discontent on the part of the state and the people in conclusion fellow-citizen allow I to invoke in behalf of you deliberation that spirit of conciliation and disinterestedness which be the gift of patriotism under a overrule and merciful providence the agency of this spirit have thus far be signalize in the prosperity and glory of we beloved country may its influence be eternal andrew

with on the part of the united state government and if they have not that he inform the senate of the reason that have induce the government to decline the enforcement of say act and i now reply to the same accord to my view of the act refer to i be not aware of any omission to carry into effect its provision in relation to trade and intercourse with the indian tribe so far as they execution depend on the agency confide to the executive the numerous provision of that act design to secure to the indian the peaceable possession of they land may be reduce substantially to the following : that citizen of the united state be restrain under sufficient penalty from enter upon the land for the purpose of hunting thereon or of settle they or of give they horse and cattle the benefit of a range upon they or of travel through they without a write permission and that the president of the united state be authorize to employ the military force of the country to secure the observance of these provision the authority to the president however be not imperative the language be : it shall be lawful for the president to take such measure and to employ such military force as he may judge necessary to remove from land belong to or secure by treaty to any indian tribe any citizen who shall make a settlement thereon by the nineteenth section of this act it be provide that nothing in it shall be construe to prevent any trade or intercourse with indian live on land surround by settlement of citizen of the united state and be within the ordinary jurisdiction of any of the individual state this provision i have interpret as be prospective in its operation and as applicable not only to indian tribe which at the date of its passage be subject to the jurisdiction of any state but to such also as should thereafter become so to this construction of its meaning i have endeavor to conform and have take no step inconsistent with it as soon therefore as the sovereign power of the state of georgium be exercise by a extension of she law throughout she limit and i have receive information of the same order be give to withdraw from the state the troops which have be detail to prevent intrusion upon the indian land within it and these order be execute the reason which dictate they shall be frankly communicate the principle recognize in the section last quote be not for the first time then avow it be conformable to the uniform practice of the government before the adoption of the constitution and amount to a distinct recognition by congress at that early day of the doctrine that that instrument have not vary the power of the federal government over indian affair from what they be under the article of confederation it be not believe that there be a single instance in the legislation of the country in which the indian have be regard as possess political rights independent of the control and authority of the state within the limit of which they reside as early as the year 1782 the journal of congress will show that no claim of such a character be countenance by that body in that year the application of a tribe of indian reside in south carolina to have certain tract of land which have be reserve for they use in that state secure to they free from intrusion and without the right of alienate they even with they own consent be bring to the consideration of congress by a report from the secretary of war the resolution which be adopt on that occasion be as follow : _ resolve _ that it be recommend to the legislature of south carolina to take such measure for the satisfaction and security of say tribe as the say legislature in they wisdom may think fit here be no assertion of the right of congress under the article of confederation to interfere with the jurisdiction of the state over indian within they limit but rather a negation of it they refuse to interfere with the subject and refer it under a general recommendation back to the state to be dispose of as she wisdom might decide if in addition to this act and the language of the article of confederation anything further can be want to show the early view of the government on the subject it will be find in the proclamation issue by congress in 1783 it contain this language : the united state in congress assemble have think proper to issue they proclamation and they do hereby prohibit and forbid all person from make settlement on land inhabit or claim by indian without the limit or jurisdiction of any particular state and again : _ resolve _ that the precede measure of congress relative to indian affair shall not be construe to affect the territorial claim of any of the state or they legislative rights within they respective limit it be not then pretend that the general government have the power in they relation with the indian to control or oppose the internal polity of the individual state of this union and if such be the case under the article of confederation the only question on the subject since must arise out of some more enlarged power or authority give to the general government by the present constitution do any such exist amongst the enumerated grant of the constitution that which relate to this subject be express in these word : congress shall have power to regulate commerce with the indian tribe in the interpretation of this power we ought certainly to be guide by what have be the practice of the government and the meaning which have be generally attach to the resolve of the old congress if the word use to convey it do not clearly import a different one as far as it affect the question of jurisdiction in the individual state the state ought not to be divest of any part of they antecedent jurisdiction by implication or doubtful construction test by this rule it seem to I to be unquestionable that the jurisdiction of the state be leave untouched by this clause of the constitution and that it be design to give to the general government complete control over the trade and intercourse of those indian only who be not within the limit of any state from a view of the act refer to and the uniform practice of the government it be manifest that until recently it have never be maintain that the right of jurisdiction by a state over indian within its territory be subordinate to the power of the federal government that doctrine have not be enforce nor even assert in any of the state of new england where tribe of indian have reside and where a few of they yet remain these tribe have be leave to the undisturbed control of the state in which they be find in conformity with the view which have be take of the opinion prevail up to 1789 and the clear interpretation of the act of 1802 in the state of new york where several tribe have reside it have be the policy of the government to avoid enter into quasi treaty engagement with they barely appoint commissioner occasionally on the part of the united state to facilitate the object of the state in its negotiation with they the southern state present a exception to this policy as early as 1784 the settlement within the limit of north carolina be advance farther to the west than the authority of the state to enforce a obedience of its law other be in a similar condition the necessity therefore and not the acknowledged principle of the government must have suggest the policy of treat with the indian in that quarter as the only practicable mode of conciliate they good will the united state at that period have just emerge from a protracted war for the achievement of they independence at the moment of its conclusion many of these tribe as powerful as they be ferocious in they mode of warfare remain in arm desolate we frontier settlement under these circumstance the first treaty in 1785 and 1790 with the cherokee be conclude by the government of the united state and be evidently sanction as measure of necessity adapt to the character of the indian and indispensable to the peace and security of the western frontier but they can not be understand as change the political relation of the indian to the state or to the federal government to effect this would have require the operation of quite a different principle and the intervention of a tribunal higher than that of the treaty-making power to infer from the assent of the government to this deviation from the practice which have before govern its intercourse with the indian and the accidental forbearance of the state to assert they right of jurisdiction over they that they have surrender this portion of they sovereignty and that its assumption now be usurpation be concede too much to the necessity which dictate those treaty and do violence to the principle of the government and the rights of the state without benefit in the least degree the indian the indian thus situate can not be regard in any other light than as member of a foreign government or of that of the state within whose chartered limit they reside if in the former the ordinary legislation of congress in relation to they be not warrant by the constitution which be establish for the benefit of we own not of a foreign people if in the latter then like other citizen or people resident within the limit of the state they be subject to they jurisdiction and control to maintain a contrary doctrine and to require the executive to enforce it by the employment of a military force would be to place in he hand a power to make war upon the rights of the state and the liberty of the country -- a power which should be place in the hand of no individual if indeed the indian be to be regard as people possess rights which they can exercise independently of the state much error have arise in the intercourse of the government with they why be it that they have be call upon to assist in we war without the privilege of exercise they own discretion if a independent people they should as such be consult and advise with but they have not be in a order which be issue to I from the war department in September 1814 this language be employ : all the friendly indian should be organize and prepare to cooperate with you other force there appear to be some dissatisfaction among the choctaw they friendship and service should be secure without delay the friendly indian must be feed and pay and _ make to fight when _ and _ where they service may be require _ to a independent and foreign people this would seem to be assume i should suppose rather too lofty a tone -- one which the government would not have assume if they have consider they in that light again by the constitution the power of declare war belong exclusively to congress we have be often engage in war with the indian tribe within we limit but when have these hostility be precede or accompany by a act of congress declare war against the tribe which be the object of they and be the prosecution of such hostility a usurpation in each case by the executive which conduct they of the constitutional power of congress it must have be so i apprehend if these tribe be to be consider as foreign and independent nation the step take to prevent intrusion upon indian land have they origin with the commencement of we government and become the subject of special legislation in 1802 with the reservation which have be mention in favor of the jurisdiction of the state with the exception of south carolina who have uniformly regulate the indian within she limit without the aid of the general government they have be feel within all the state of the south without be understand to affect they rights or prevent the exercise of they jurisdiction whenever they be in a situation to assume and enforce it georgium though materially concerned have on this principle forborne to spread she legislation farther than the settlement of she own white citizen until she have recently perceive within she limit a people claim to be capable of self-government sit in legislative council organize court and administer justice to disarm such a anomalous invasion of she sovereignty she have declare she determination to execute she own law throughout she limit -- a step which seem to have be anticipate by the proclamation of 1783 and which be perfectly consistent with the nineteenth section of the act of 1802 accord to the language and reasoning of that section the tribe to the south and the southwest be not only surround by settlement of the citizen of the united state but be now also within the ordinary jurisdiction of the individual state they become so from the moment the law of the state be extend over they and the same result follow the similar determination of alabama and mississippus these state have each a right to claim in behalf of they position now on this question the same respect which be concede to the other state of the union toward this race of people i entertain the kindest feeling and be not sensible that the view which i have take of they true interest be less favorable to they than those which oppose they emigration to the west year since i state to they my belief that if the state choose to extend they law over they it would not be in the power of the federal government to prevent it my opinion remain the same and i can see no alternative for they but that of they removal to the west or a quiet submission to the state law if they prefer to remove the united state agree to defray they expense to supply they the means of transportation and a year 's support after they reach they new home -- a provision too liberal and kind to deserve the stamp of injustice either course promise they peace and happiness whilst a obstinate perseverance in the effort to maintain they possession independent of the state authority can not fail to render they condition still more helpless and miserable such a effort ought therefore to be discountenance by all who sincerely sympathize in the fortune of this peculiar people and especially by the political body of the union as calculate to disturb the harmony of the two government and to endanger the safety of the many blessing which they enable we to enjoy as connect with the subject of this inquiry i beg leave to refer to the accompany letter from the secretary of war inclose the order which proceed from that department and a

communication of the state of the nation to its representative generally these communication have be of the most gratifying nature testify a advance in all the improvement of social and all the security of political life but frequently and justly as you have be call on to be grateful for the bounty of providence at few period have they be more abundantly or extensively bestow than at the present rarely if ever have we have greater reason to congratulate each other on the continue and increase prosperity of we beloved country agriculture the first and most important occupation of man have compensate the labor of the husbandman with plentiful crop of all the varied product of we extensive country manufacture have be establish in which the fund of the capitalist find a profitable investment and which give employment and subsistence to a numerous and increase body of industrious and dexterous mechanic the laborer be reward by high wages in the construction of work of internal improvement which be extend with unprecedented rapidity science be steadily penetrate the recess of nature and disclose she secret while the ingenuity of free mind be subject the element to the power of man and make each new conquest auxiliary to he comfort by we mail whose speed be regularly increase and whose route be every year extend the communication of public intelligence and private business be render frequent and safe the intercourse between distant city which it formerly require week to accomplish be now effect in a few day and in the construction of railroad and the application of steam power we have a reasonable prospect that the extreme part of we country will be so much approximate and those most isolate by the obstacle of nature render so accessible as to remove a apprehension sometimes entertain that the great extent of the union would endanger its permanent existence if from the satisfactory view of we agriculture manufacture and internal improvement we turn to the state of we navigation and trade with foreign nation and between the state we shall scarcely find less cause for gratulation a beneficent providence have provide for they exercise and encouragement a extensive coast indent by capacious bay noble river inland sea with a country productive of every material for shipbuilding and every commodity for gainful commerce and fill with a population active intelligent well-informed and fearless of danger these advantage be not neglect and a impulse have lately be give to commercial enterprise which fill we shipyard with new construction encourage all the art and branch of industry connect with they crowd the wharf of we city with vessel and cover the most distant sea with we canvas let we be grateful for these blessing to the beneficent be who have confer they and who suffer we to indulge a reasonable hope of they continuance and extension while we neglect not the means by which they may be preserve if we may dare to judge of he future design by the manner in which he past favor have be bestow he have make we national prosperity to depend on the preservation of we liberty we national force on we federal union and we individual happiness on the maintenance of we state rights and wise institution if we be prosperous at home and respect abroad it be because we be free unite industrious and obedient to the law while we continue so we shall by the blessing of heaven go on in the happy career we have begin and which have bring we in the short period of we political existence from a population of three to thirteen million from thirteen separate colony to twenty-four united state from weakness to strength from a rank scarcely mark in the scale of nation to a high place in they respect this last advantage be one that have result in a great degree from the principle which have guide we intercourse with foreign power since we have assume a equal station among they and hence the annual account which the executive render to the country of the manner in which that branch of he duty have be fulfil prove instructive and salutary the pacific and wise policy of we government keep we in a state of neutrality during the war that have at different period since we political existence be carry on by other power but this policy while it give activity and extent to we commerce expose it in the same proportion to injury from the belligerent nation hence have arise claim of indemnity for those injury england france spain holland sweden denmark naple and lately portugal have all in a greater or less degree infringe we neutral rights demand for reparation be make upon all they have have in all and continue to have in some case a leading influence on the nature of we relation with the power on whom they be make of the claim upon england it be unnecessary to speak further than to say that the state of thing to which they prosecution and denial give rise have be succeed by arrangement productive of mutual good feeling and amicable relation between the two country which it be hope will not be interrupted one of these arrangement be that relate to the colonial trade which be communicate to congress at the last session and although the short period during which it have be in force will not enable I to form a accurate judgment of its operation there be every reason to believe that it will prove highly beneficial the trade thereby authorize have employ to the 30th September last upward of 30000 ton of american and 15000 ton of foreign shipping in the outward voyage and in the inward nearly a equal amount of american and 20000 only of foreign tonnage advantage too have result to we agricultural interest from the state of the trade between canada and we territory and state border on the st lawrence and the lake which may prove more than equivalent to the loss sustain by the discrimination make to favor the trade of the northern colony with the west indy after we transition from the state of colony to that of a independent nation many point be find necessary to be settle between we and great britain among they be the demarcation of boundary not describe with sufficient precision in the treaty of peace some of the line that divide the state and territory of the united state from the british province have be definitively fix that however which separate we from the province of canada and new brunswick to the north and the east be still in dispute when i come into office but i find arrangement make for its settlement over which i have no control the commissioner who have be appoint under the provision of the treaty of ghent have be unable to agree a convention be make with great britain by my immediate predecessor in office with the advice and consent of the senate by which it be agree that the point of difference which have arise in the settlement of the boundary line between the american and british dominion as describe in the fifth article of the treaty of ghent shall be refer as therein provide to some friendly sovereign or state who shall be invite to investigate and make a decision upon such point of difference and the king of the netherland have by the late president and he britannic majesty be designate as such friendly sovereign it become my duty to carry with good faith the agreement so make into full effect to this end i cause all the measure to be take which be necessary to a full exposition of we case to the sovereign arbiter and nominate as minister plenipotentiary to he court a distinguished citizen of the state most interested in the question and who have be one of the agent previously employ for settle the controversy on the 10th day of January last he majesty the king of the netherland deliver to the plenipotentiary of the united state and of great britain he written opinion on the case refer to he the papers in relation to the subject will be communicate by a special message to the proper branch of the government with the perfect confidence that its wisdom will adopt such measure as will secure a amicable settlement of the controversy without infringe any constitutional right of the state immediately interested it afford I satisfaction to inform you that suggestion make by my direction to the chargé d'affaire of he britannic majesty to this government have have they desire effect in produce the release of certain american citizen who be imprison for set up the authority of the state of maine at a place in the dispute territory under the actual jurisdiction of he britannic majesty from this and the assurance i have receive of the desire of the local authority to avoid any cause of collision i have the best hope that a good understanding will be keep up until it be confirm by the final disposition of the subject the amicable relation which now subsist between the united state and great britain the increase intercourse between they citizen and the rapid obliteration of unfriendly prejudice to which former event naturally give rise concur to present this as a fit period for renew we endeavor to provide against the recurrence of cause of irritation which in the event of war between great britain and any other power would inevitably endanger we peace animated by the sincerest desire to avoid such a state of thing and peacefully to secure under all possible circumstance the rights and honor of the country i have give such instruction to the minister lately send to the court of london as will evince that desire and if meet by a correspondent disposition which we can not doubt will put a end to cause of collision which without advantage to either tend to estrange from each other two nation who have every motive to preserve not only peace but a intercourse of the most amicable nature in my message at the opening of the last session of congress i express a confident hope that the justice of we claim upon france urge as they be with perseverance and signal ability by we minister there would finally be acknowledge this hope have be realize a treaty have be sign which will immediately be lay before the senate for its approbation and which contain stipulation that require legislative act must have the concurrence of both house before it can be carry into effect by it the french government engage to pay a sum which if not quite equal to that which may be find due to we citizen will yet it be believe under all circumstance be deem satisfactory by those interested the offer of a gross sum instead of the satisfaction of each individual claim be accept because the only alternative be a rigorous exaction of the whole amount state to be due on each claim which might in some instance be exaggerate by design in other overrate through error and which therefore it would have be both ungracious and unjust to have insist on or a settlement by a mixed commission to which the french negotiator be very averse and which experience in other case have shew to be dilatory and often wholly inadequate to the end a comparatively small sum be stipulate on we part to go to the extinction of all claim by french citizen on we government and a reduction of duty on we cotton and they wine have be agree on as a consideration for the renunciation of a important claim for commercial privilege under the construction they give to the treaty for the cession of louisiana should this treaty receive the proper sanction a source of irritation will be stop that have for so many year in some degree alienate from each other two nation who from interest as well as the remembrance of early association ought to cherish the most friendly relation a encouragement will be give for perseverance in the demand of justice by this new proof that if steadily pursue they will be listen to and admonition will be offer to those power if any which may be incline to evade they that they will never be abandon above all a just confidence will be inspire in we fellow-citizen that they government will exert all the power with which they have invest it in support of they just claim upon foreign nation at the same time that the frank acknowledgment and provision for the payment of those which be address to we equity although unsupported by legal proof afford a practical illustration of we submission to the divine rule of do to other what we desire they should do unto we sweden and denmark have make compensation for the irregularity commit by they vessel or in they port to the perfect satisfaction of the party concern and have renew the treaty of commerce enter into with they we political and commercial relation with those power continue to be on the most friendly footing with spain we difference up to the 22d of February 1819 be settle by the treaty of washington of that date but at a subsequent period we commerce with the state formerly colony of spain on the continent of america be annoyed and frequently interrupt by she public and private armed ship they capture many of we vessel prosecute a lawful commerce and sell they and they cargo and at one time to we demand for restoration and indemnity oppose the allegation that they be take in the violation of a blockade of all the port of those state this blockade be declaratory only and the inadequacy of the force to maintain it be so manifest that this allegation be vary to a charge of trade in contraband of war this in its turn be also find untenable and the minister whom i send with instruction to press for the reparation that be due to we injured fellow-citizen have transmit a answer to he demand by which the capture be declare to have be legal and be justified because the independence of the state of america never have be acknowledge by spain she have a right to prohibit trade with they under she old colonial law this ground of defense be contradictory not only to those which have be formerly allege but to the uniform practice and established law of nation and have be abandon by spain herself in the convention which grant indemnity to british subject for capture make at the same time under the same circumstance and for the same allegation with those of which we complain i however indulge the hope that further reflection will lead to other view and feel confident that when he catholic majesty shall be convince of the justice of the claim he desire to preserve friendly relation between the two country which it be my earnest endeavor to maintain will induce he to accede to we demand i have therefore dispatch a special messenger with instruction to we minister to bring the case once more to he consideration to the end that if -lrb- which i can not bring myself to believe -rrb- the same decision -lrb- that can not but be deem a unfriendly denial of justice -rrb- should be persist in the matter may before you adjournment be lay before you the constitutional judge of what be proper to be do when negotiation for redress of injury fail the conclusion of a treaty for indemnity with france seem to present a favorable opportunity to renew we claim of a similar nature on other power and particularly in the case of those upon naple more especially as in the course of former negotiation with that power we failure to induce france to render we justice be use as a argument against we the desire of the merchant who be the principal sufferer have therefore be accede to and a mission have be institute for the special purpose of obtain for they a reparation already too long delay this measure have be resolve on it be put in execution without wait for the meeting of congress because the state of europe create a apprehension of event that might have render we application ineffectual we demand upon the government of the two sicily be of a peculiar nature the injury on which they be found be not deny nor be the atrocity and perfidy under which those injury be perpetrate attempt to be extenuate the sole ground on which indemnity have be refuse be the alleged illegality of the tenure by which the monarch who make the seizure hold he crown this defense always unfounded in any principle of the law of nation now universally abandon even by those power upon whom the responsibility for act of past ruler bear the most heavily will unquestionably be give up by he sicilian majesty whose counsel will receive a impulse from that high sense of honor and regard to justice which be say to characterize he and i feel the fullest confidence that the talent of the citizen commission for that purpose will place before he the just claim of we injured citizen in such a light as will enable I before you adjournment to announce that they have be adjust and secure precise instruction to the effect of bring the negotiation to a speedy issue have be give and will be obey in the late blockade of terceira some of the portuguese fleet capture several of we vessel and commit other excess for which reparation be demand and i be on the point of dispatch a armed force to prevent any recurrence of a similar violence and protect we citizen in the prosecution of they lawful commerce when official assurance on which i rely make the sailing of the ship unnecessary since that period frequent promise have be make that full indemnity shall be give for the injury inflict and the loss sustain in the performance there have be some perhaps unavoidable delay but i have the fullest confidence that my earnest desire that this business may at once be close which we minister have be instruct strongly to express will very soon be gratify i have the better ground for this hope from the evidence of a friendly disposition which that government have show by a actual reduction in the duty on rice the produce of we southern state authorize the anticipation that this important article of we export will soon be admit on the same footing with that produce by the most favored nation with the other power of europe we have fortunately have no cause of discussion for the redress of injury with the empire of the russia we political connection be of the most friendly and we commercial of the most liberal kind we enjoy the advantage of navigation and trade give to the most favored nation but it have not yet suit they policy or perhaps have not be find convenient from other consideration to give stability and reciprocity to those privilege by a commercial treaty the ill health of the minister last year charge with make a proposition for that arrangement do not permit he to remain at st petersburg and the attention of that government during the whole of the period since he departure have be occupy by the war in which it be engage we have be assure that nothing could have be effect by he presence a minister will soon be nominate as well to effect this important object as to keep up the relation of amity and good understanding of which we have receive so many assurance and proof from he imperial majesty and the emperor he predecessor the treaty with austrium be open to we a important trade with the hereditary dominion of the emperor the value of which have be hitherto little known and of course not sufficiently appreciate while we commerce find a entrance into the south of germany by means of this treaty those we have form with the hanseatic town and prussium and other now in negotiation will open that vast country to the enterprising spirit of we merchant on the north -- a country abound in all the material for a mutually beneficial commerce fill with enlighten and industrious inhabitant hold a important place in the politics of europe and to which we owe so many valuable citizen the ratification of the treaty with the porte be send to be exchange by the gentleman appoint we chargé d'affaire to that court some difficulty occur on he arrival but at the date of he last official dispatch he suppose they have be obviate and that there be every prospect of the exchange be speedily effect this finish the connected view i have think it proper to give of we political and commercial relation in europe every effort in my power will be continue to strengthen and extend they by treaty found on principle of the most perfect reciprocity of interest neither ask nor concede any exclusive advantage but liberating as far as it lie in my power the activity and industry of we fellow-citizen from the shackle which foreign restriction may impose to china and the east indy we commerce continue in its usual extent and with increase facility which the credit and capital of we merchant afford by substitute bill for payment in specie a daring outrage have be commit in those sea by the plunder of one of we merchantman engage in the pepper trade at a port in sumatra and the piratical perpetrator belong to tribe in such a state of society that the usual course of proceedings between civilized nation could not be pursue i forthwith dispatch a frigate with order to require immediate satisfaction for the injury and indemnity to the sufferer few change have take place in we connection with the independent state of america since my last communication to congress the ratification of a commercial treaty with the unite republic of mexico have be for some time under deliberation in they congress but be still undecided at the date of we last dispatch the unhappy civil commotion that have prevail there be undoubtedly the cause of the delay but as the government be now say to be tranquillize we may hope soon to receive the ratification of the treaty and a arrangement for the demarcation of the boundary between we in the meantime a important trade have be open with mutual benefit from st loui in the state of missourus by caravan to the interior province of mexico this commerce be protect in its progress through the indian country by the troops of the united state which have be permit to escort the caravan beyond we boundary to the settle part of the mexican territory from central america i have receive assurance of the most friendly kind and a gratifying application for we good office to remove a suppose indisposition toward that government in a neighboring state this application be immediately and successfully comply with they give we also the pleasing intelligence that difference which have prevail in they internal affair have be peaceably adjust we treaty with this republic continue to be faithfully observe and promise a great and beneficial commerce between the two country -- a commerce of the greatest importance if the magnificent project of a ship canal through the dominion of that state from the atlantic to the pacific ocean now in serious contemplation shall be execute i have great satisfaction in communicate the success which have attend the exertion of we minister in colombium to procure a very considerable reduction in the duty on we flour in that republic indemnity also have be stipulate for injury receive by we merchant from illegal seizure and renew assurance be give that the treaty between the two country shall be faithfully observe chili and peru seem to be still threaten with civil commotion and until they shall be settle disorder may naturally be apprehend require the constant presence of a naval force in the pacific ocean to protect we fishery and guard we commerce the disturbance that take place in the empire of brazil previously to and immediately consequent upon the abdication of the late emperor necessarily suspend any effectual application for the redress of some past injury suffer by we citizen from that government while they have be the cause of other in which all foreigner seem to have participate instruction have be give to we minister there to press for indemnity due for loss occasion by these irregularity and to take care that we fellow-citizen shall enjoy all the privilege stipulate in they favor by the treaty lately make between the two power all which the good intelligence that prevail between we minister at rio janeiro and the regency give we the best reason to expect i should have place bueno ayre in the list of south american power in respect to which nothing of importance affect we be to be communicate but for occurrence which have lately take place at the falkland island in which the name of that republic have be use to cover with a show of authority act injurious to we commerce and to the property and liberty of we fellow-citizen in the course of the present year one of we vessel engage in the pursuit of a trade which we have always enjoy without molestation have be capture by a band act as they pretend under the authority of the government of bueno ayre i have therefore give order for the dispatch of a armed vessel to join we squadron in those sea and aid in afford all lawful protection to we trade which shall be necessary and shall without delay send a minister to inquire into the nature of the circumstance and also of the claim if any that be set up by that government to those island in the meantime i submit the case to the consideration of congress to the end that they may clothe the executive with such authority and mean as they may deem necessary for provide a force adequate to the complete protection of we fellow-citizen fishing and trading in those sea this rapid sketch of we foreign relation it be hope fellow-citizen may be of some use in so much of you legislation as may bear on that important subject while it afford to the country at large a source of high gratification in the contemplation of we political and commercial connection with the rest of the world at peace with all have subject of future difference with few and those susceptible of easy adjustment extend we commerce gradually on all side and on none by any but the most liberal and mutually beneficial means we may by the blessing of providence hope for all that national prosperity which can be derive from a intercourse with foreign nation guide by those eternal principle of justice and reciprocal good will which be bind as well upon state as the individual of whom they be compose i have great satisfaction in make this statement of we affair because the course of we national policy enable I to do it without any indiscreet exposure of what in other government be usually conceal from the people have none but a straightforward open course to pursue guide by a single principle that will bear the strongest light we have happily no political combination to form no alliance to entangle we no complicated interest to consult and in subject all we have do to the consideration of we citizen and to the inspection of the world we give no advantage to other nation and lay ourselves open to no injury it may not be improper to add that to preserve this state of thing and give confidence to the world in the integrity of we design all we consular and diplomatic agent be strictly enjoin to examine well every cause of complaint prefer by we citizen and while they urge with proper earnestness those that be well found to countenance none that be unreasonable or unjust and to enjoin on we merchant and navigator the strictest obedience to the law of the country to which they resort and a course of conduct in they dealings that may support the character of we nation and render we respect abroad connect with this subject i must recommend a revisal of we consular law defect and omission have be discover in they operation that ought to be remedy and supply for you further information on this subject i have direct a report to be make by the secretary of state which i shall hereafter submit to you consideration the internal peace and security of we confederated state be the next principal object of the general government time and experience have prove that the abode of the native indian within they limit be dangerous to they peace and injurious to himself in accordance with my recommendation at a former session of congress a appropriation of half a million of dollar be make to aid the voluntary removal of the various tribe beyond the limit of the state at the last session i have the happiness to announce that the chickasaw and choctaw have accept the generous offer of the government and agree to remove beyond the mississippus river by which the whole of the state of mississippus and the western part of alabama will be free from indian occupancy and open to a civilized population the treaty with these tribe be in a course of execution and they removal it be hope will be complete in the course of 1832 at the request of the authority of georgium the registration of cherokee indian for emigration have be resume and it be confidently expect that one-half if not two-third of that tribe will follow the wise example of they more westerly brethren those who prefer remain at they present home will hereafter be govern by the law of georgium as all she citizen be and cease to be the object of peculiar care on the part of the general government during the present year the attention of the government have be particularly direct to those tribe in the powerful and grow state of ohio where considerable tract of the finest land be still occupy by the aboriginal proprietor treaty either absolute or conditional have be make extinguish the whole indian title to the reservation in that state and the time be not distant it be hope when ohio will be no longer embarrass with the indian population the same measure will be extend to indiana as soon as there be reason to anticipate success it be confidently believe that perseverance for a few year in the present policy of the government will extinguish the indian title to all land lie within the state compose we federal union and remove beyond they limit every indian who be not willing to submit to they law thus will all conflict claim to jurisdiction between the state and the indian tribe be put to rest it be please to reflect that result so beneficial not only to the state immediately concerned but to the harmony of the union will have be accomplish by measure equally advantageous to the indian what the native savage become when surround by a dense population and by mix with the whites may be see in the miserable remnant of a few eastern tribe deprive of political and civil rights forbid to make contract and subject to guardian drag out a wretched existence without excitement without hope and almost without thought but the removal of the indian beyond the limit and jurisdiction of the state do not place they beyond the reach of philanthropic aid and christian instruction on the contrary those whom philanthropy or religion may induce to live among they in they new abode will be more free in the exercise of they benevolent function than if they have remain within the limit of the state embarrass by they internal regulation now subject to no control but the superintend agency of the general government exercise with the sole view of preserve peace they may proceed unmolested in the interesting experiment of gradually advance a community of american indian from barbarism to the habit and enjoyment of civilized life among the happiest effect of the improved relation of we republic have be a increase of trade produce a corresponding increase of revenue beyond the most sanguine anticipation of the treasury department the state of the public finances will be fully show by the secretary of the treasury in the report which he will presently lay before you i will here however congratulate you upon they prosperous condition the revenue receive in the present year will not fall short of $ 27700000 and the expenditure for all object other than the public debt will not exceed $ 14700000 the payment on account of the principal and interest of the debt during the year will exceed $ 16500000 a greater sum than have be apply to that object out of the revenue in any year since the enlargement of the sink fund except the two year follow immediately thereafter the amount which will have be apply to the public debt from the 4th of march 1829 to the 1st of January next which be less than three year since the administration have be place in my hand will exceed $ 40000000 from the large importation of the present year it may be safely estimate that the revenue which will be receive into the treasury from that source during the next year with the aid of that receive from the public land will considerably exceed the amount of the receipt of the present year and it be believe that with the means which the government will have at its disposal from various source which will be fully state by the proper department the whole of the public debt may be extinguish either by redemption or purchase within the four year of my administration we shall then exhibit the rare example of a great nation abound in all the means of happiness and security altogether free from debt the confidence with which the extinguishment of the public debt may be anticipate present a opportunity for carry into effect more fully the policy in relation to import duty which have be recommend in my former message a modification of the tariff which shall produce a reduction of we revenue to the want of the government and a adjustment of the duty on import with a view to equal justice in relation to all we national interest and to the counteraction of foreign policy so far as it may be injurious to those interest be deem to be one of the principal object which demand the consideration of the present congress justice to the interest of the merchant as well as the manufacturer require that material reduction in the import duty be prospective and unless the present congress shall dispose of the subject the propose reduction can not properly be make to take effect at the period when the necessity for the revenue arise from present rate shall cease it be therefore desirable that arrangement be adopt at you present session to relieve the people from unnecessary taxation after the extinguishment of the public debt in the exercise of that spirit of concession and conciliation which have distinguish the friend of we union in all great emergency it be believe that this object may be effect without injury to any national interest in my annual message of December 1829 i have the honor to recommend the adoption of a more liberal policy than that which then prevail toward unfortunate debtor to the government and i deem it my duty again to invite you attention to this subject actuate by similar view congress at they last session pass a act for the relief of certain insolvent debtor of the united state but the provision of that law have not be deem such as be adequate to that relief to this unfortunate class of we fellow-citizen which may be safely extend to they the point in which the law appear to be defective will be particularly communicate by the secretary of the treasury and i take pleasure in recommend such a extension of its provision as will unfetter the enterprise of a valuable portion of we citizen and restore to they the means of usefulness to themselves and the community while deliberate on this subject i would also recommend to you consideration the propriety of so modify the law for enforce the payment of debt due either to the public or to individual sue in the court of the united state as to restrict the imprisonment of the person to case of fraudulent concealment of property the personal liberty of the citizen seem too sacred to be hold as in many case it now be at the will of a creditor to whom he be willing to surrender all the means he have of discharge he debt the report from the secretary of the war and navy department and from the postmaster-general which accompany this message present satisfactory view of the operation of the department respectively under they charge and suggest improvement which be worthy of and to which i invite the serious attention of congress certain defect and omission have be discover in the operation of the law respect patent they be point out in the accompany report from the secretary of state i have heretofore recommend amendment of the federal constitution give the election of president and vice-president to the people and limit the service of the former to a single term so important do i consider these change in we fundamental law that i can not in accordance with my sense of duty omit to press they upon the consideration of a new congress for my view more at large as well in relation to these point as to the disqualification of member of congress to receive a office from a president in whose election they have have a official agency which i propose as a substitute i refer you to my former message we system of public account be extremely complicated and it be believe may be much improve much of the present machinery and a considerable portion of the expenditure of public money may be dispense with while greater facility can be afford to the liquidation of claim upon the government and a examination into they justice and legality quite as efficient as the present secure with a view to a general reform in the system i recommend the subject to the attention of congress i deem it my duty again to call you attention to the condition of the district of columbium it be doubtless wise in the framer of we constitution to place the people of this district under the jurisdiction of the general government but to accomplish the object they have in view it be not necessary that this people should be deprive of all the privilege of self-government independently of the difficulty of induce the representative of distant state to turn they attention to project of law which be not of the highest interest to they constituent they be not individually nor in congress collectively well qualify to legislate over the local concern of this district consequently its interest be much neglect and the people be almost afraid to present they grievance lest a body in which they be not represent and which feel little sympathy in they local relation should in its attempt to make law for they do more harm than good govern by the law of the state whence they be sever the two shore of the potomac within the 10 mile square have different penal code -- not the present code of virginium and mary land but such as exist in those state at the time of the cession to the united state as congress will not form a new code and as the people of the district can not make one for themselves they be virtually under two government be it not just to allow they at least a delegate in congress if not a local legislature to make law for the district subject to the approval or rejection of congress i earnestly recommend the extension to they of every political right which they interest require and which may be compatible with the constitution the extension of the judiciary system of the united state be deem to be one of the duty of government one-fourth of the state in the union do not participate in the benefit of a circuit court to the state of indiana illinoi missourus alabama mississippus and louisiana admit into the union since the present judicial system be organize only a district court have be allow if this be sufficient then the circuit court already exist in eighteen state ought to be abolish if it be not sufficient the defect ought to be remedy and these state place on the same footing with the other member of the union it be on this condition and on this footing that they enter the union and they may demand circuit court as a matter not of concession but of right i trust that congress will not adjourn leave this anomaly in we system entertain the opinion heretofore express in relation to the bank of the united state as at present organize i feel it my duty in my former message frankly to disclose they in order that the attention of the legislature and the people should be seasonably direct to that important subject and that it might be consider and finally disposed of in a manner best calculate to promote the end of the constitution and subserve the public interest have thus conscientiously discharge a constitutional duty i deem it proper on this occasion without a more particular reference to the view of the subject then express to leave it for the present to the investigation of a enlighten people and they representative in conclusion permit I to invoke that power which superintend all government to infuse into you deliberation at this important crisis of we history a spirit of mutual forbearance and conciliation in that spirit be we union form and in that spirit must it be preserve andrew jackson special message washington _ December 6 1831 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : i transmit to the senate for they advice with regard to its

with those of the negotiation precede that treaty from the year 1829 i transmit herewith a supplemental report from the secretary of state with the papers accompany the same andrew jackson veto message washington _ July 10 1832 _ _ to the senate _ : the bill to modify and continue the act entitle a act to incorporate the subscriber to the bank of the united state be present to I on the 4th July instant have consider it with that solemn regard to the principle of the constitution which the day be calculate to inspire and come to the conclusion that it ought not to become a law i herewith return it to the senate in which it originate with my objection a bank of the united state be in many respects convenient for the government and useful to the people entertain this opinion and deeply impressed with the belief that some of the power and privilege possess by the exist bank be unauthorized by the constitution subversive of the rights of the state and dangerous to the liberty of the people i feel it my duty at a early period of my administration to call the attention of congress to the practicability of organize a institution combine all its advantage and obviate these objection i sincerely regret that in the act before I i can perceive none of those modification of the bank charter which be necessary in my opinion to make it compatible with justice with sound policy or with the constitution of we country the present corporate body denominate the president director and company of the bank of the united state will have exist at the time this act be intend to take effect twenty year it enjoy a exclusive privilege of banking under the authority of the general government a monopoly of its favor and support and as a necessary consequence almost a monopoly of the foreign and domestic exchange the power privilege and favor bestow upon it in the original charter by increase the value of the stock far above its par value operate as a gratuity of many million to the stockholder a apology may be find for the failure to guard against this result in the consideration that the effect of the original act of incorporation could not be certainly foresee at the time of its passage the act before I propose another gratuity to the holder of the same stock and in many case to the same man of at least seven million more this donation find no apology in any uncertainty as to the effect of the act on all hand it be concede that its passage will increase at least 20 or 30 per cent more the market price of the stock subject to the payment of the annuity of $ 200000 per year secure by the act thus add in a moment one-fourth to its par value it be not we own citizen only who be to receive the bounty of we government more than eight million of the stock of this bank be hold by foreigner by this act the american republic propose virtually to make they a present of some million of dollar for these gratuity to foreigner and to some of we own opulent citizen the act secure no equivalent whatever they be the certain gain of the present stockholder under the operation of this act after make full allowance for the payment of the bonus every monopoly and all exclusive privilege be grant at the expense of the public which ought to receive a fair equivalent the many million which this act propose to bestow on the stockholder of the exist bank must come directly or indirectly out of the earnings of the american people it be due to they therefore if they government sell monopoly and exclusive privilege that they should at least exact for they as much as they be worth in open market the value of the monopoly in this case may be correctly ascertain the twenty-eight million of stock would probably be at a advance of 50 per cent and command in market at least $ 42000000 subject to the payment of the present bonus the present value of the monopoly therefore be $ 17000000 and this the act propose to sell for three million payable in fifteen annual installment of $ 200000 each it be not conceivable how the present stockholder can have any claim to the special favor of the government the present corporation have enjoy its monopoly during the period stipulate in the original contract if we must have such a corporation why should not the government sell out the whole stock and thus secure to the people the full market value of the privilege grant why should not congress create and sell twenty-eight million of stock incorporate the purchaser with all the power and privilege secure in this act and put the premium upon the sale into the treasury but this act do not permit competition in the purchase of this monopoly it seem to be predicate on the erroneous idea that the present stockholder have a prescriptive right not only to the favor but to the bounty of government it appear that more than a fourth part of the stock be hold by foreigner and the residue be hold by a few hundred of we own citizen chiefly of the richest class for they benefit do this act exclude the whole american people from competition in the purchase of this monopoly and dispose of it for many million less than it be worth this seem the less excusable because some of we citizen not now stockholder petition that the door of competition might be open and offer to take a charter on term much more favorable to the government and country but this proposition although make by man whose aggregate wealth be believe to be equal to all the private stock in the exist bank have be set aside and the bounty of we government be propose to be again bestow on the few who have be fortunate enough to secure the stock and at this moment wield the power of the exist institution i can not perceive the justice or policy of this course if we government must sell monopoly it would seem to be its duty to take nothing less than they full value and if gratuity must be make once in fifteen or twenty year let they not be bestow on the subject of a foreign government nor upon a designate and favor class of man in we own country it be but justice and good policy as far as the nature of the case will admit to confine we favor to we own fellow citizen and let each in he turn enjoy a opportunity to profit by we bounty in the bearing of the act before I upon these point i find ample reason why it should not become a law it have be urge as a argument in favor of recharter the present bank that the call in its loan will produce great embarrassment and distress the time allow to close its concern be ample and if it have be well manage its pressure will be light and heavy only in case its management have be bad if therefore it shall produce distress the fault will be its own and it would furnish a reason against renew a power which have be so obviously abused but will there ever be a time when this reason will be less powerful to acknowledge its force be to admit that the bank ought to be perpetual and as a consequence the present stockholder and those inherit they rights as successor be establish a privileged order clothe both with great political power and enjoy immense pecuniary advantage from they connection with the government the modification of the exist charter propose by this act be not such in my view as make it consistent with the rights of the state or the liberty of the people the qualification of the right of the bank to hold real estate the limitation of its power to establish branch and the power reserve to congress to forbid the circulation of small note be restriction comparatively of little value or importance all the objectionable principle of the exist corporation and most of its odious feature be retain without alleviation the fourth section provide that the note or bill of the say corporation although the same be on the face thereof respectively make payable at one place only shall nevertheless be receive by the say corporation at the bank or at any of the office of discount and deposit thereof if tender in liquidation or payment of any balance or balance due to say corporation or to such office of discount and deposit from any other incorporated bank this provision secure to the state bank a legal privilege in the bank of the united state which be withhold from all private citizen if a state bank in philadelphium owe the bank of the united state and have note issue by the st loui branch it can pay the debt with those note but if a merchant mechanic or other private citizen be in like circumstance he can not by law pay he debt with those note but must sell they at a discount or send they to st loui to be cash this boon concede to the state bank though not unjust in itself be most odious because it do not measure out equal justice to the high and the low the rich and the poor to the extent of its practical effect it be a bond of union among the banking establishment of the nation erect they into a interest separate from that of the people and its necessary tendency be to unite the bank of the united state and the state bank in any measure which may be think conducive to they common interest the ninth section of the act recognize principle of worse tendency than any provision of the present charter it enact that the cashier of the bank shall annually report to the secretary of the treasury the name of all stockholder who be not resident citizen of the united state and on the application of the treasurer of any state shall make out and transmit to such treasurer a list of stockholder reside in or citizen of such state with the amount of stock own by each although this provision take in connection with a decision of the supreme court surrender by its silence the right of the state to tax the banking institution create by this corporation under the name of branch throughout the union it be evidently intend to be construe as a concession of they right to tax that portion of the stock which may be hold by they own citizen and resident in this light if the act become a law it will be understand by the state who will probably proceed to levy a tax equal to that pay upon the stock of bank incorporate by themselves in some state that tax be now 1 per cent either on the capital or on the share and that may be assume as the amount which all citizen or resident stockholder would be tax under the operation of this act as it be only the stock _ hold _ in the state and not that _ employ _ within they which would be subject to taxation and as the name of foreign stockholder be not to be report to the treasurer of the state it be obvious that the stock hold by they will be exempt from this burden they annual profit will therefore be 1 per cent more than the citizen stockholder and as the annual dividend of the bank may be safely estimate at 7 per cent the stock will be worth 10 or 15 per cent more to foreigner than to citizen of the united state to appreciate the effect which this state of thing will produce we must take a brief review of the operation and present condition of the bank of the united state by document submit to congress at the present session it appear that on the 1st of January 1832 of the twenty-eight million of private stock in the corporation $ 8405500 be hold by foreigner mostly of great britain the amount of stock hold in the nine western and southwestern state be $ 140200 and in the four southern state be $ 5623100 and in the middle and eastern state be about $ 13522000 the profit of the bank in 1831 as show in a statement to congress be about $ 3455598 of this there accrue in the nine western state about $ 1640048 in the four southern state about $ 352507 and in the middle and eastern state about $ 1463041 as little stock be hold in the west it be obvious that the debt of the people in that section to the bank be principally a debt to the eastern and foreign stockholder that the interest they pay upon it be carry into the eastern state and into europe and that it be a burden upon they industry and a drain of they currency which no country can bear without inconvenience and occasional distress to meet this burden and equalize the exchange operation of the bank the amount of specie draw from those state through its branch within the last two year as show by its official report be about $ 6000000 more than half a million of this amount do not stop in the eastern state but pass on to europe to pay the dividend of the foreign stockholder in the principle of taxation recognize by this act the western state find no adequate compensation for this perpetual burden on they industry and drain of they currency the branch bank at mobile make last year $ 95140 yet under the provision of this act the state of alabama can raise no revenue from these profitable operation because not a share of the stock be hold by any of she citizen mississippus and missourus be in the same condition in relation to the branch at natchez and st loui and such in a greater or less degree be the condition of every western state the tendency of the plan of taxation which this act propose will be to place the whole united state in the same relation to foreign country which the western state now bear to the eastern when by a tax on resident stockholder the stock of this bank be make worth 10 or 15 per cent more to foreigner than to resident most of it will inevitably leave the country thus will this provision in its practical effect deprive the eastern as well as the southern and western state of the means of raise a revenue from the extension of business and great profit of this institution it will make the american people debtor to alien in nearly the whole amount due to this bank and send across the atlantic from two to five million of specie every year to pay the bank dividend in another of its bearing this provision be fraught with danger of the twenty-five director of this bank five be choose by the government and twenty by the citizen stockholder from all voice in these election the foreign stockholder be exclude by the charter in proportion therefore as the stock be transfer to foreign holder the extent of suffrage in the choice of director be curtail already be almost a third of the stock in foreign hand and not represent in election it be constantly pass out of the country and this act will accelerate its departure the entire control of the institution would necessarily fall into the hand of a few citizen stockholder and the ease with which the object would be accomplish would be a temptation to design man to secure that control in they own hand by monopolize the remain stock there be danger that a president and director would then be able to elect themselves from year to year and without responsibility or control manage the whole concern of the bank during the existence of its charter it be easy to conceive that great evil to we country and its institution might flow from such a concentration of power in the hand of a few man irresponsible to the people be there no danger to we liberty and independence in a bank that in its nature have so little to bind it to we country the president of the bank have tell we that most of the state bank exist by its forbearance should its influence become concenter as it may under the operation of such a act as this in the hand of a self-elected directory whose interest be identify with those of the foreign stockholder will there not be cause to tremble for the purity of we election in peace and for the independence of we country in war they power would be great whenever they might choose to exert it but if this monopoly be regularly renew every fifteen or twenty year on term propose by themselves they might seldom in peace put forth they strength to influence election or control the affair of the nation but if any private citizen or public functionary should interpose to curtail its power or prevent a renewal of its privilege it can not be doubt that he would be make to feel its influence should the stock of the bank principally pass into the hand of the subject of a foreign country and we should unfortunately become involve in a war with that country what would be we condition of the course which would be pursue by a bank almost wholly own by the subject of a foreign power and manage by those whose interest if not affection would run in the same direction there can be no doubt all its operation within would be in aid of the hostile fleet and army without control we currency receive we public money and hold thousand of we citizen in dependence it would be more formidable and dangerous than the naval and military power of the enemy if we must have a bank with private stockholder every consideration of sound policy and every impulse of american feeling admonish that it should be _ purely american _ its stockholder should be compose exclusively of we own citizen who at least ought to be friendly to we government and willing to support it in time of difficulty and danger so abundant be domestic capital that competition in subscribe for the stock of local bank have recently lead almost to riot to a bank exclusively of american stockholder possess the power and privilege grant by this act subscription for $ 200000000 could be readily obtain instead of send abroad the stock of the bank in which the government must deposit its fund and on which it must rely to sustain its credit in time of emergency it would rather seem to be expedient to prohibit its sale to alien under penalty of absolute forfeiture it be maintain by the advocate of the bank that its constitutionality in all its feature ought to be consider as settle by precedent and by the decision of the supreme court to this conclusion i can not assent mere precedent be a dangerous source of authority and should not be regard as decide question of constitutional power except where the acquiescence of the people and the state can be consider as well settle so far from this be the case on this subject a argument against the bank might be base on precedent one congress in 1791 decide in favor of a bank another in 1811 decide against it one congress in 1815 decide against a bank another in 1816 decide in its favor prior to the present congress therefore the precedent draw from that source be equal if we resort to the state the expression of legislative judicial and executive opinion against the bank have be probably to those in its favor as 4 to 1 there be nothing in precedent therefore which if its authority be admit ought to weigh in favor of the act before I if the opinion of the supreme court cover the whole ground of this act it ought not to control the coordinate authority of this government the congress the executive and the court must each for itself be guide by its own opinion of the constitution each public officer who take a oath to support the constitution swear that he will support it as he understand it and not as it be understand by other it be as much the duty of the house of representative of the senate and of the president to decide upon the constitutionality of any bill or resolution which may be present to they for passage or approval as it be of the supreme judge when it may be bring before they for judicial decision the opinion of the judge have no more authority over congress than the opinion of congress have over the judge and on that point the president be independent of both the authority of the supreme court must not therefore be permit to control the congress or the executive when act in they legislative capacity but to have only such influence as the force of they reasoning may deserve but in the case rely upon the supreme court have not decide that all the feature of this corporation be compatible with the constitution it be true that the court have say that the law incorporate the bank be a constitutional exercise of power by congress but take into view the whole opinion of the court and the reasoning by which they have come to that conclusion i understand they to have decide that inasmuch as a bank be a appropriate means for carry into effect the enumerated power of the general government therefore the law incorporate it be in accordance with that provision of the constitution which declare that congress shall have power to make all law which shall be necessary and proper for carry those power into execution have satisfy themselves that the word _ necessary _ in the constitution mean _ needful requisite essential conducive to _ and that a bank be a convenient a useful and essential instrument in the prosecution of the government 's fiscal operation they conclude that to use one must be within the discretion of congress and that the act to incorporate the bank of the united state be a law make in pursuance of the constitution but say they _ where the law be not prohibit and be really calculate to effect any of the object intrust to the government to undertake here to inquire into the degree of its necessity would be to pass the line which circumscribe the judicial department and to tread on legislative ground _ the principle here affirm be that the degree of its necessity involve all the detail of a banking institution be a question exclusively for legislative consideration a bank be constitutional but it be the province of the legislature to determine whether this or that particular power privilege or exemption be necessary and proper to enable the bank to discharge its duty to the government and from they decision there be no appeal to the court of justice under the decision of the supreme court therefore it be the exclusive province of congress and the president to decide whether the particular feature of this act be _ necessary _ and _ proper _ in order to enable the bank to perform conveniently and efficiently the public duty assign to it as a fiscal agent and therefore constitutional or _ unnecessary _ and _ improper _ and therefore unconstitutional without comment on the general principle affirm by the supreme court let we examine the detail of this act in accordance with the rule of legislative action which they have lay down it will be find that many of the power and privilege confer on it can not be suppose necessary for the purpose for which it be propose to be create and be not therefore mean necessary to attain the end in view and consequently not justify by the constitution the original act of incorporation section 21 enact that no other bank shall be establish by any future law of the united state during the continuance of the corporation hereby create for which the faith of the united state be hereby pledge : _ provide _ congress may renew exist charter for bank within the district of columbium not increase the capital thereof and may also establish any other bank or bank in say district with capital not exceed in the whole $ 6000000 if they shall deem it expedient this provision be continue in force by the act before I fifteen year from the 3d of march 1836 if congress possess the power to establish one bank they have power to establish more than one if in they opinion two or more bank have be necessary to facilitate the execution of the power delegate to they in the constitution if they possess the power to establish a second bank it be a power derive from the constitution to be exercise from time to time and at any time when the interest of the country or the emergency of the government might make it expedient it be possess by one congress as well as another and by all congress alike and alike at every session but the congress of 1816 have take it away from they successor for twenty year and the congress of 1832 propose to abolish it for fifteen year more it can not be _ necessary _ or _ proper _ for congress to barter away or divest themselves of any of the power vest in they by the constitution to be exercise for the public good it be not _ necessary _ to the efficiency of the bank nor be it _ proper _ in relation to themselves and they successor they may _ properly _ use the discretion vest in they but they may not limit the discretion of they successor this restriction on themselves and grant of a monopoly to the bank be therefore unconstitutional in another point of view this provision be a palpable attempt to amend the constitution by a act of legislation the constitution declare that the congress shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation in all case whatsoever over the district of columbium its constitutional power therefore to establish bank in the district of columbium and increase they capital at will be unlimited and uncontrollable by any other power than that which give authority to the constitution yet this act declare that congress shall _ not _ increase the capital of exist bank nor create other bank with capital exceed in the whole $ 6000000 the constitution declare that congress _ shall _ have power to exercise exclusive legislation over this district _ in all case whatsoever _ and this act declare they shall not which be the supreme law of the land this provision can not be _ necessary _ or _ proper _ or _ constitutional _ unless the absurdity be admit that whenever it be necessary and proper in the opinion of congress they have a right to barter away one portion of the power vest in they by the constitution as a means of execute the rest on two subject only do the constitution recognize in congress the power to grant exclusive privilege or monopoly it declare that congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful art by secure for limited time to author and inventor the exclusive right to they respective writings and discovery out of this express delegation of power have grow we law of patent and copyright as the constitution expressly delegate to congress the power to grant exclusive privilege in these case as the means of execute the substantive power to promote the progress of science and useful art it be consistent with the fair rule of construction to conclude that such a power be not intend to be grant as a means of accomplish any other end on every other subject which come within the scope of congressional power there be a ever-living discretion in the use of proper means which can not be restricted or abolish without a amendment of the constitution every act of congress therefore which attempt by grant of monopoly or sale of exclusive privilege for a limited time or a time without limit to restrict or extinguish its own discretion in the choice of means to execute its delegated power be equivalent to a legislative amendment of the constitution and palpably unconstitutional this act authorize and encourage transfer of its stock to foreigner and grant they a exemption from all state and national taxation so far from be _ necessary and proper _ that the bank should possess this power to make it a safe and efficient agent of the government in its fiscal operation it be calculate to convert the bank of the united state into a foreign bank to impoverish we people in time of peace to disseminate a foreign influence through every section of the republic and in war to endanger we independence the several state reserve the power at the formation of the constitution to regulate and control title and transfer of real property and most if not all of they have law disqualify alien from acquire or hold land within they limit but this act in disregard of the undoubted right of the state to prescribe such disqualification give to alien stockholder in this bank a interest and title as member of the corporation to all the real property it may acquire within any of the state of this union this privilege grant to alien be not _ necessary _ to enable the bank to perform its public duty nor in any sense _ proper _ because it be vitally subversive of the rights of the state the government of the united state have no constitutional power to purchase land within the state except for the erection of fort magazine arsenal dockyard and other needful building and even for these object only by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be by make themselves stockholder in the bank and grant to the corporation the power to purchase land for other purpose they assume a power not grant in the constitution and grant to other what they do not themselves possess it be not _ necessary _ to the receive safe-keeping or transmission of the fund of the government that the bank should possess this power and it be not _ proper _ that congress should thus enlarge the power delegate to they in the constitution the old bank of the united state possess a capital of only $ 11000000 which be find fully sufficient to enable it with dispatch and safety to perform all the function require of it by the government the capital of the present bank be $ 35000000 -- at least twenty-four more than experience have prove to be _ necessary _ to enable a bank to perform its public function the public debt which exist during the period of the old bank and on the establishment of the new have be nearly pay off and we revenue will soon be reduce this increase of capital be therefore not for public but for private purpose the government be the only _ proper _ judge where its agent should reside and keep they office because it best know where they presence will be _ necessary _ it can not therefore be _ necessary _ or _ proper _ to authorize the bank to locate branch where it please to perform the public service without consult the government and contrary to its will the principle lay down by the supreme court concede that congress can not establish a bank for purpose of private speculation and gain but only as a means of execute the delegated power of the general government by the same principle a branch bank can not constitutionally be establish for other than public purpose the power which this act give to establish two branch in any state without the injunction or request of the government and for other than public purpose be not _ necessary _ to the due _ execution _ of the power delegate to congress the bonus which be exact from the bank be a confession upon the face of the act that the power grant by it be greater than be _ necessary _ to its character of a fiscal agent the government do not tax its officer and agent for the privilege of serve it the bonus of a million and a half require by the original charter and that of three million propose by this act be not exact for the privilege of give the necessary facility for transfer the public fund from place to place within the united state or the territory thereof and for distribute the same in payment of the public creditor without charge commission or claim allowance on account of the difference of exchange as require by the act of incorporation but for something more beneficial to the stockholder the original act declare that it -lrb- the bonus -rrb- be grant in consideration of the exclusive privilege and benefit confer by this act upon the say bank and the act before I declare it to be in consideration of the exclusive benefit and privilege continue by this act to the say corporation for fifteen year as aforesaid it be therefore for exclusive privilege and benefit confer for they own use and emolument and not for the advantage of the government that a bonus be exact these surplus power for which the bank be require to pay can not surely be _ necessary _ to make it the fiscal agent of the treasury if they be the exaction of a bonus for they would not be _ proper _ it be maintain by some that the bank be a means of execute the constitutional power to coin money and regulate the value thereof congress have establish a mint to coin money and pass law to regulate the value thereof the money so coin with its value so regulated and such foreign coin as congress may adopt be the only currency know to the constitution but if they have other power to regulate the currency it be confer to be exercise by themselves and not to be transfer to a corporation if the bank be establish for that purpose with a charter unalterable without its consent congress have part with they power for a term of year during which the constitution be a dead letter it be neither necessary nor proper to transfer its legislative power to such a bank and therefore unconstitutional by its silence consider in connection with the decision of the supreme court in the case of mcculloch against the state of maryland this act take from the state the power to tax a portion of the banking business carry on within they limit in subversion of one of the strongest barrier which secure they against federal encroachment bank like farm manufacturing or any other occupation or profession be _ a business _ the right to follow which be not originally derive from the law every citizen and every company of citizen in all of we state possess the right until the state legislature deem it good policy to prohibit private banking by law if the prohibitory state law be now repeal every citizen would again possess the right the state bank be a qualify restoration of the right which have be take away by the law against banking guard by such provision and limitation as in the opinion of the state legislature the public interest require these corporation unless there be a exemption in they charter be like private banker and banking company subject to state taxation the manner in which these tax shall be lay depend wholly on legislative discretion it may be upon the bank upon the stock upon the profit or in any other mode which the sovereign power shall will upon the formation of the constitution the state guard they taxing power with peculiar jealousy they surrender it only as it regard import and export in relation to every other object within they jurisdiction whether person property business or profession it be secure in as ample a manner as it be before possess all person though united state officer be liable to a poll tax by the state within which they reside the land of the united state be liable to the usual land tax except in the new state from whom agreement that they will not tax unsold land be exact when they be admit into the union horse wagon any beast or vehicle tool or property belong to private citizen though employ in the service of the united state be subject to state taxation every private business whether carry on by a officer of the general government or not whether it be mix with public concern or not even if it be carry on by the government of the united state itself separately or in partnership fall within the scope of the tax power of the state nothing come more fully within it than bank and the business of banking by whomsoever institute and carry on over this whole subject-matter it be just as absolute unlimited and uncontrollable as if the constitution have never be adopt because in the formation of that instrument it be reserve without qualification the principle be concede that the state can not rightfully tax the operation of the general government they can not tax the money of the government deposit in the state bank nor the agency of those bank in remit it but will any man maintain that they mere selection to perform this public service for the general government would exempt the state bank and they ordinary business from state taxation have the united state instead of establish a bank at philadelphium employ a private banker to keep and transmit they fund would it have deprive pennsylvanium of the right to tax he bank and he usual banking operation it will not be pretend upon what principle then be the banking establishment of the bank of the united state and they usual banking operation to be exempt from taxation it be not they public agency or the deposit of the government which the state claim a right to tax but they bank and they banking power institute and exercise within state jurisdiction for they private emolument -- those power and privilege for which they pay a bonus and which the state tax in they own bank the exercise of these power within a state no matter by whom or under what authority whether by private citizen in they original right by corporate body create by the state by foreigner or the agent of foreign government located within they limit form a legitimate object of state taxation from this and like source from the person property and business that be find reside located or carry on under they jurisdiction must the state since the surrender of they right to raise a revenue from import and export draw all the money necessary for the support of they government and the maintenance of they independence there be no more appropriate subject of taxation than bank banking and bank stock and none to which the state ought more pertinaciously to cling it can not be _ necessary _ to the character of the bank as a fiscal agent of the government that its private business should be exempt from that taxation to which all the state bank be liable nor can i conceive it _ proper _ that the substantive and most essential power reserve by the state shall be thus attack and annihilate as a means of execute the power delegate to the general government it may be safely assume that none of those sage who have a agency in form or adopt we constitution ever imagine that any portion of the tax power of the state not prohibit to they nor delegate to congress be to be sweep away and annihilate as a means of execute certain power delegate to congress if we power over means be so absolute that the supreme court will not call in question the constitutionality of a act of congress the subject of which be not prohibit and be really calculate to effect any of the object intrust to the government although as in the case before I it take away power expressly grant to congress and rights scrupulously reserve to the state it become we to proceed in we legislation with the utmost caution though not directly we own power and the rights of the state may be indirectly legislate away in the use of means to execute substantive power we may not enact that congress shall not have the power of exclusive legislation over the district of columbium but we may pledge the faith of the united state that as a means of execute other power it shall not be exercise for twenty year or forever we may not pass a act prohibit the state to tax the banking business carry on within they limit but we may as a means of execute we power over other object place that business in the hand of we agent and then declare it exempt from state taxation in they hand thus may we own power and the rights of the state which we can not directly curtail or invade be fritter away and extinguish in the use of means employ by we to execute other power that a bank of the united state competent to all the duty which may be require by the government might be so organize as not to infringe on we own delegated power or the reserved rights of the state i do not entertain a doubt have the executive be call upon to furnish the project of such a institution the duty would have be cheerfully perform in the absence of such a call it be obviously proper that he should confine himself to point out those prominent feature in the act present which in he opinion make it incompatible with the constitution and sound policy a general discussion will now take place elicit new light and settle important principle and a new congress elect in the midst of such discussion and furnish a equal representation of the people accord to the last census will bear to the capitol the verdict of public opinion and i doubt not bring this important question to a satisfactory result under such circumstance the bank come forward and ask a renewal of its charter for a term of fifteen year upon condition which not only operate as a gratuity to the stockholder of many million of dollar but will sanction any abuse and legalize any encroachment suspicion be entertain and charge be make of gross abuse and violation of its charter a investigation unwillingly concede and so restricted in time as necessarily to make it incomplete and unsatisfactory disclose enough to excite suspicion and alarm in the practice of the principal bank partially unveil in the absence of important witness and in numerous charge confidently make and as yet wholly uninvestigated there be enough to induce a majority of the committee of investigation -- a committee which be select from the most able and honorable member of the house of representative -- to recommend a suspension of further action upon the bill and a prosecution of the inquiry as the charter have yet four year to run and as a renewal now be not necessary to the successful prosecution of its business it be to have be expect that the bank itself conscious of its purity and proud of its character would have withdraw its application for the present and demand the severest scrutiny into all its transaction in they decline to do so there seem to be a additional reason why the functionary of the government should proceed with less haste and more caution in the renewal of they monopoly the bank be professedly establish as a agent of the executive branch of the government and its constitutionality be maintain on that ground neither upon the propriety of present action nor upon the provision of this act be the executive consult it have have no opportunity to say that it neither need nor want a agent clothe with such power and favor by such exemption there be nothing in its legitimate function which make it necessary or proper whatever interest or influence whether public or private have give birth to this act it can not be find either in the wish or necessity of the executive department by which present action be deem premature and the power confer upon its agent not only unnecessary but dangerous to the government and country it be to be regret that the rich and powerful too often bend the act of government to they selfish purpose distinction in society will always exist under every just government equality of talent of education or of wealth can not be produce by human institution in the full enjoyment of the gift of heaven and the fruit of superior industry economy and virtue every man be equally entitle to protection by law but when the law undertake to add to these natural and just advantage artificial distinction to grant title gratuity and exclusive privilege to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful the humble member of society -- the farmer mechanic and laborer -- who have neither the time nor the means of secure like favor to themselves have a right to complain of the injustice of they government there be no necessary evil in government its evil exist only in its abuse if it would confine itself to equal protection and as heaven do its rain shower its favor alike on the high and the low the rich and the poor it would be a unqualified blessing in the act before I there seem to be a wide and unnecessary departure from these just principle nor be we government to be maintain or we union preserve by invasion of the rights and power of the several state in thus attempt to make we general government strong we make it weak its true strength consist in leave individual and state as much as possible to themselves -- in make itself feel not in its power but in its beneficence not in its control but in its protection not in bind the state more closely to the center but leave each to move unobstructed in its proper orbit experience should teach we wisdom most of the difficulty we government now encounter and most of the danger which impend over we union have spring from a abandonment of the legitimate object of government by we national legislation and the adoption of such principle as be embody in this act many of we rich man have not be content with equal protection and equal benefit but have besought we to make they richer by act of congress by attempt to gratify they desire we have in the result of we legislation array section against section interest against interest and man against man in a fearful commotion which threaten to shake the foundation of we union it be time to pause in we career to review we principle and if possible revive that devoted patriotism and spirit of compromise which distinguish the sage of the revolution and the father of we union if we can not at once in justice to interest vest under improvident legislation make we government what it ought to be we can at least take a stand against all new grant of monopoly and exclusive privilege against any prostitution of we government to the advancement of the few at the expense of the many and in favor of compromise and gradual reform in we code of law and system of political economy i have now do my duty to my country if sustain by my fellow citizen i shall be grateful and happy if not i shall find in the motive which impel I ample grounds for contentment and peace in the difficulty which surround we and the danger which threaten we institution there be cause for neither dismay nor alarm for relief and deliverance let we firmly rely on that kind providence which i be sure watch with peculiar care over the destiny of we republic and on the intelligence and wisdom of we countryman through _ he _ abundant goodness and _ they _ patriotic devotion we liberty and union will be preserved andrew jackson fourth annual message _ December 4 1832 _ _ fellow-citizen of the senate and house of representative _ : it give I

operation the return which have be make out since we last meet will show a increase during the last preceding year of more than 80000 ton in we shipping and of near $ 40000000 in the aggregate of we import and export nor have we less reason to felicitate ourselves on the position of we political than of we commercial concern they remain in the state in which they be when i last address you -- a state of prosperity and peace the effect of a wise attention to the parting advice of the revered father of he country on this subject condensed into a maxim for the use of posterity by one of he most distinguished successor -- to cultivate free commerce and honest friendship with all nation but to make entangle alliance with none a strict adherence to this policy have keep we aloof from the perplexing question that now agitate the european world and have more than once deluge those country with blood should those scene unfortunately recur the party to the contest may count on a faithful performance of the duty incumbent on we as a neutral nation and we own citizen may equally rely on the firm assertion of they neutral rights with the nation that be we earliest friend and ally in the infancy of we political existence the most friendly relation have subsist through the late revolution of its government and from the event of the last promise a permanent duration it have make a approximation in some of its political institution to we own and raise a monarch to the throne who preserve it be say a friendly recollection of the period during which he acquire among we citizen the high consideration that could then have be produce by he personal qualification alone we commerce with that nation be gradually assume a mutually beneficial character and the adjustment of the claim

that i continue to receive assurance of the most amicable disposition which have on my part on all proper occasion be promptly and sincerely reciprocate the attention of that government have latterly be so much engross by matter of a deeply interesting domestic character that we could not press upon it the renewal of negotiation which have be unfortunately break off by the unexpected recall of we minister who have commence they with some hope of success my great object be the settlement of question which though now dormant might hereafter be revive under circumstance that would endanger the good understanding which it be the interest of both party to preserve inviolate cement as it be by a community of language manners and social habit and by the high obligation we owe to we british

remain unsettled in my last annual message i explain to you the situation in which i find that business on my come into office and the measure i think it my duty to pursue for assert the rights of the united state before the sovereign who have be choose by my predecessor to determine the question and also the manner in which he have dispose of it a special message to the senate in they executive capacity afterwards bring before they the question whether they would advise a submission to the opinion of the sovereign arbiter that body have consider the award as not obligatory and advise I to open a further negotiation the proposition be immediately make to the british government but the circumstance to which i have allude have hitherto prevent any answer be give to the overture early attention however have be promise to the subject and every effort on my part will be make for a satisfactory settlement of this question interesting to the union generally and particularly so to one of its member the claim of we citizen on spain be not yet acknowledge on a closer investigation of they than appear to have heretofore take place it be discover that some of these demand however strong they might be upon the equity of that government be not such as could be make the subject of national interference and faithful to the principle of ask nothing but what be clearly right additional instruction have be send to modify we demand so as to embrace those only on which accord to the law of nation we have a strict right to insist a inevitable delay in procure the document necessary for this review of the merit of these claim retard this operation until a unfortunate malady which have afflict he catholic majesty prevent a examination of they be now for the first time present in a unexceptionable form it be confidently hope that the application will be successful i have the satisfaction to inform you that the application i direct to be make for the delivery of a part of the archive of florida which have be carry to the havannah have produce a royal order for they delivery and that measure have be take to procure its execution by the report of the secretary of

in the continental port of spain than be levy on they national vessel the demand against portugal for illegal capture in the blockade of terceira have be allow to the full amount of the account present by the claimant and payment be promise to be make in three installment the first of these have be pay the second although due have not at the date of we last advice be receive owe it be allege to embarrassment in the finances consequent on the civil war in which that nation be engage the payment stipulate by the convention with denmark have be punctually make and the amount be ready for distribution among the claimant as soon as the board now sit shall have perform they function i regret that by the last advice from we chargé d'affaire at naple that government have still delay the satisfaction due to we citizen but at that date the effect of the last instruction be not know dispatch from thence be hourly expect and the result will be communicate to you without delay with the rest of europe we relation political and commercial remain unchanged negotiation be go on to put on a permanent basis the liberal system of commerce now carry on between we and the empire of russium the treaty conclude with austrium be execute by he imperial majesty with the most perfect good faith and as we have no diplomatic agent at he court he personally inquire into and correct a proceeding of some of he subaltern officer to the injury of we consul in one of he port we treaty with the sublime porte be produce its expected effect on we commerce new market be open for we commodity and a more extensive range for the employment of we ship a slight augmentation of the duty on we commerce inconsistent with the spirit of the treaty have be impose but on the representation of we charge d'affaire it have be promptly withdraw and we now enjoy the trade and navigation of the black sea and of all the port belong to the turkish empire and asia on the most perfect equality with all foreign nation i wish earnestly that in announce to you the continuance of friendship and the increase of a profitable commercial intercourse with mexico with central america and the state of the south i could accompany it with the assurance that they all be bless with that internal tranquillity and foreign peace which they heroic devotion to the cause of they independence merit in mexico a sanguinary struggle be now carry on which have cause some embarrassment to we commerce but both party profess the most friendly disposition toward we to the termination of this contest we look for the establishment of that secure intercourse so necessary to nation whose territory be contiguous how important it will be to we we may calculate from the fact that even in this unfavorable state of thing we maritime commerce have increase and a internal trade by caravan from st loui to santa fe under the protection of escort furnish by the government be carry on to great advantage and be daily increase the agent provide for by the treaty with this power to designate the boundary which it establish have be name on we part but one of the evil of the civil war now rage there have be that the appointment of those with whom they be to cooperate have not yet be announce to we the government of central america have expel from its territory the party which some time since disturb its peace desirous of foster a favorable disposition toward we which have on more than one occasion be evince by this interesting country i make a second attempt in this year to establish a diplomatic intercourse with they but the death of the distinguished citizen whom i have appoint for that purpose have retard the execution of measure from which i hope much advantage to we commerce the union of the three state which form the republic of colombium have be dissolve but they all it be believe consider themselves as separately bind by the treaty which be make in they federal capacity the minister accredit to the federation continue in that character near the government of new granada and hope be entertain that a new union would be form between the separate state at least for the purpose of foreign intercourse we minister have be instruct to use he good office whenever they shall be desire to produce the reunion so much to be wish for the domestic tranquillity of the party and the security and facility of foreign commerce some agitation naturally attendant on a infant reign have prevail in the empire of brazil which have have the usual effect upon commercial operation and while they suspend the consideration of claim create on similar occasion they have give rise to new complaint on the part of we citizen a proper consideration for calamity and difficulty of this nature have make we less urgent and peremptory in we demand for justice than duty to we fellow-citizen would under other circumstance have require but they claim be not neglect and will on all proper occasion be urge and it be hope with effect i refrain from make any communication on the subject of we affair with bueno ayre because the negotiation communicate to you in my last annual message be at the date of we last advice still pend and in a state that would render a publication of the detail inexpedient a treaty of amity and commerce have be form with the republic of chili which if approve by the senate will be lay before you that government seem to be establish and at peace with its neighbor and its port be the resort of we ship which be employ in the highly important trade of the fishery this commercial convention can not but be of great advantage to we fellow-citizen engage in that perilous but profitable business we commerce with the neighboring state of peru owe to the onerous duty levy on we principal article of export have be on the decline and all endeavor to procure a alteration have hitherto prove fruitless with bolivium we have yet no diplomatic intercourse and the continual contest carry on between it and peru have make I defer until a more favorable period the appointment of any agent for that purpose a act of atrocious piracy have be commit on one of we trading ship by the inhabitant of a settlement on the west coast of sumatra a frigate be dispatch with order to demand satisfaction for the injury if those who commit it should be find to be member of a regular government capable of maintain the usual relation with foreign nation but if as it be suppose and as they prove to be they be a band of lawless pirate to inflict such a chastisement as would deter they and other from like aggression this last be do and the effect have be a increase respect for we flag in those distant sea and additional security for we commerce in the view i have give of we connection with foreign power allusion have be make to they domestic disturbance or foreign war to they revolution or dissension it may be proper to observe that this be do solely in case where those event affect we political relation with they or to show they operation on we commerce further than this it be neither we policy nor we right to interfere we best wish on all occasion we good office when require will be afford to promote the domestic tranquillity and foreign peace of all nation with whom we have any intercourse any intervention in they affair further than this even by the expression of a official opinion be contrary to we principle of international policy and will always be avoid the report which the secretary of the treasury will in due time lay before you will exhibit the national finances in a highly prosperous state owe to the continued success of we commercial enterprise which have enable the merchant to fulfill they engagement with the government the receipt from custom during the year will exceed the estimate present at the last session and with the other means of the treasury will prove fully adequate not only to meet the increase expenditure result from the large appropriation make by congress but to provide for the payment of all the public debt which be at present redeemable it be now estimate that the custom will yield to the treasury during the present year upward of $ 28000000 the public land however have prove less productive than be anticipate and accord to present information will not much exceed two million the expenditure for all object other than the public debt be estimate to amount during the year to about sixteen million and a half while a still larger sum viz $ 18000000 will have be apply to the principal and interest of the public debt it be expect however that in consequence of the reduce rate of duty which will take effect after the 3d of march next there will be a considerable fall off in the revenue from custom in the year 1833 it will nevertheless be amply sufficient to provide for all the want of the public service estimate even upon a liberal scale and for the redemption and purchase of the remainder of the public debt on the 1st of January next the entire public debt of the united state fund and unfunded will be reduce to within a fraction of $ 7000000 of which $ 2227363 be not of right redeemable until the 1st of January 1834 and $ 4735296 not until the 2d of January 1835 the commissioner of the sinking fund however be invest with full authority to purchase the debt at the market price and the means of the treasury be ample it may be hope that the whole will be extinguish within the year 1833 i can not too cordially congratulate congress and my fellow-citizen on the near approach of that memorable and happy event -- the extinction of the public debt of this great and free nation faithful to the wise and patriotic policy mark out by the legislation of the country for this object the present administration have devote to it all the means which a flourish commerce have supply and a prudent economy preserve for the public treasury within the four year for which the people have confide the executive power to my charge $ 58000000 will have be apply to the payment of the public debt that this have be accomplish without stint the expenditure for all other proper object will be see by refer to the liberal provision make during the same period for the support and increase of we means of maritime and military defense for internal improvement of a national character for the removal and preservation of the indian and lastly for the gallant veteran of the revolution the final removal of this great burthen from we resource afford the means of further provision for all the object of general welfare and public defense which the constitution authorize and present the occasion for such further reduction in the revenue as may not be require for they from the report of the secretary of the treasury it will be see that after the present year such a reduction may be make to a considerable extent and the subject be earnestly recommend to the consideration of congress in the hope that the combined wisdom of the representative of the people will devise such means of effect that salutary object as may remove those burthen which shall be find to fall unequally upon any and as may promote all the great interest of the community long and patient reflection have strengthen the opinion i have heretofore express to congress on this subject and i deem it my duty on the present occasion again to urge they upon the attention of the legislature the soundest maxim of public policy and the principle upon which we republican institution be found recommend a proper adaptation of the revenue to the expenditure and they also require that the expenditure shall be limit to what by a economical administration shall be consistent with the simplicity of the government and necessary to a efficient public service in effect this adjustment it be due in justice to the interest of the different state and even to the preservation of the union itself that the protection afford by exist law to any branch of the national industry should not exceed what may be necessary to counteract the regulation of foreign nation and to secure a supply of those article of manufacture essential to the national independence and safety in time of war if upon investigation it shall be find as it be believe it will be that the legislative protection grant to any particular interest be greater than be indispensably requisite for these object i recommend that it be gradually diminish and that as far as may be consistent with these object the whole scheme of duty be reduce to the revenue standard as soon as a just regard to the faith of the government and to the preservation of the large capital invest in establishment of domestic industry will permit that manufacture adequate to the supply of we domestic consumption would in the abstract be beneficial to we country there be no reason to doubt and to effect they establishment there be perhaps no american citizen who would not for awhile be willing to pay a higher price for they but for this purpose it be presume that a tariff of high duty design for perpetual protection have enter into the mind of but few of we statesman the most they have anticipate be a temporary and generally incidental protection which they maintain have the effect to reduce the price by domestic competition below that of the foreign article experience however we best guide on this as on other subject make it doubtful whether the advantage of this system be not counterbalance by many evil and whether it do not tend to beget in the mind of a large portion of we countryman a spirit of discontent and jealousy dangerous to the stability of the union what then shall be do large interest have grow up under the imply pledge of we national legislation which it would seem a violation of public faith suddenly to abandon nothing could justify it but the public safety which be the supreme law but those who have vest they capital in manufacture establishment can not expect that the people will continue permanently to pay high tax for they benefit when the money be not require for any legitimate purpose in the administration of the government be it not enough that the high duty have be pay as long as the money arise from they could be apply to the common benefit in the extinguishment of the public debt those who take a enlarged view of the condition of we country must be satisfy that the policy of protection must be ultimately limit to those article of domestic manufacture which be indispensable to we safety in time of war within this scope on a reasonable scale it be recommend by every consideration of patriotism and duty which will doubtless always secure to it a liberal and efficient support but beyond this object we have already see the operation of the system productive of discontent in some section of the republic its influence be deprecate as tend to concentrate wealth into a few hand and as create those germ of dependence and vice which in other country have characterize the existence of monopoly and prove so destructive of liberty and the general good a large portion of the people in one section of the republic declare it not only inexpedient on these grounds but as disturb the equal relation of property by legislation and therefore unconstitutional and unjust doubtless these effect be in a great degree exaggerate and may be ascribe to a mistaken view of the consideration which lead to the adoption of the tariff system but they be nevertheless important in enable we to review the subject with a more thorough knowledge of all its bearing upon the great interest of the republic and with a determination to dispose of it so that none can with justice complain it be my painful duty to state that in one quarter of the united state opposition to the revenue law have arise to a height which threaten to thwart they execution if not to endanger the integrity of the union whatever obstruction may be throw in the way of the judicial authority of the general government it be hope they will be able peaceably to overcome they by the prudence of they own officer and the patriotism of the people but should this reasonable reliance on the moderation and good sense of all portion of we fellow-citizen be disappoint it be believe that the law themselves be fully adequate to the suppression of such attempt as may be immediately make should the exigency arise render the execution of the exist law impracticable from any cause whatever prompt notice of it will be give to congress with a suggestion of such view and measure as may be deem necessary to meet it in conformity with principle heretofore explain and with the hope of reduce the general government to that simple machine which the constitution create and of withdraw from the state all other influence than that of its universal beneficence in preserve peace afford a uniform currency maintain the inviolability of contract diffuse intelligence and discharge unfelt its other superintend function i recommend that provision be make to dispose of all stock now hold by it in corporation whether create by the general or state government and place the proceeds in the treasury as a source of profit these stock be of little or no value as a means of influence among the state they be adverse to the purity of we institution the whole principle on which they be base be deem by many unconstitutional and to persist in the policy which they indicate be consider wholly inexpedient it be my duty to acquaint you with a arrangement make by the bank of the united state with a portion of the holder of the 3 per cent stock by which the government will be deprive of the use of the public fund longer than be anticipate by this arrangement which will be particularly explain by the secretary of the treasury a surrender of the certificate of this stock may be postpone until October 1833 and thus the liability of the government after its ability to discharge the debt may be continue by the failure of the bank to perform its duty such measure as be within the reach of the secretary of the treasury have be take to enable he to judge whether the public deposit in that institution may be regard as entirely safe but as he limited power may prove inadequate to this object i recommend the subject to the attention of congress under the firm belief that it be worthy of they serious investigation a inquiry into the transaction of the institution embrace the branch as well as the principal bank seem call for by the credit which be give throughout the country to many serious charge impeach its character and which if true may justly excite the apprehension that it be no longer a safe depository of the money of the people among the interest which merit the consideration of congress after the payment of the public debt one of the most important in my view be that of the public land previous to the formation of we present constitution it be recommend by congress that a portion of the waste land own by the state should be cede to the united state for the purpose of general harmony and as a fund to meet the expense of the war the recommendation be adopt and at different period of time the state of massachusett new york virginium north and south carolina and georgium grant they vacant soil for the use for which they have be ask as the land may now be consider as relieve from this pledge the object for which they be cede have be accomplish it be in the discretion of congress to dispose of they in such way as best to conduce to the quiet harmony and general interest of the american people in examine this question all local and sectional feeling should be discard and the whole united state regard as one people interested alike in the prosperity of they common country it can not be doubt that the speedy settlement of these land constitute the true interest of the republic the wealth and strength of a country be its population and the best part of that population be the cultivator of the soil independent farmer be everywhere the basis of society and true friend of liberty in addition to these consideration question have already arise and may be expect hereafter to grow out of the public land which involve the rights of the new state and the power of the general government and unless a liberal policy be now adopt there be danger that these question may speedily assume a importance not now generally anticipate the influence of a great sectional interest when bring into full action will be find more dangerous to the harmony and union of the state than any other cause of discontent and it be the part of wisdom and sound policy to foresee its approach and endeavor if possible to counteract they of the various scheme which have be hitherto propose in regard to the disposal of the public land none have yet receive the entire approbation of the national legislature deeply impressed with the importance of a speedy and satisfactory arrangement of the subject i deem it my duty on this occasion to urge it upon you consideration and to the proposition which have be heretofore suggest by other to contribute those reflection which have occur to I in the hope that they may assist you in you future deliberation it seem to I to be we true policy that the public land shall cease as soon as practicable to be a source of revenue and that they be sell to settler in limited parcel at a price barely sufficient to reimburse to the united state the expense of the present system and the cost arise under we indian compact the advantage of accurate survey and undoubted title now secure to purchaser seem to forbid the abolition of the present system because none can be substitute which will more perfectly accomplish these important end it be desirable however that in convenient time this machinery be withdraw from the state and that the right of soil and the future disposition of it be surrender to the state respectively in which it lie the adventurous and hardy population of the west besides contribute they equal share of taxation under we impost system have in the progress of we government for the land they occupy pay into the treasury a large proportion of $ 40000000 and of the revenue receive therefrom but a small part have be expend amongst they when to the disadvantage of they situation in this respect we add the consideration that it be they labor alone which give real value to the land and that the proceeds arise from they sale be distribute chiefly among state which have not originally any claim to they and which have enjoy the undivided emolument arise from the sale of they own land it can not be expect that the new state will remain longer contented with the present policy after the payment of the public debt to avert the consequence which may be apprehend from this cause to put a end forever to all partial and interested legislation on the subject and to afford to every american citizen of enterprise the opportunity of secure a independent freehold it seem to I therefore best to abandon the idea of raise a future revenue out of the public land in former message i have express my conviction that the constitution do not warrant the application of the fund of the general government to object of internal improvement which be not national in they character and both as a means of do justice to all interest and put a end to a course of legislation calculate to destroy the purity of the government have urge the necessity of reduce the whole subject to some fix and certain rule as there never will occur a period perhaps more propitious than the present to the accomplishment of this object i beg leave to press the subject again upon you attention without some general and well-defined principle ascertain those object of internal improvement to which the means of the nation may be constitutionally apply it be obvious that the exercise of the power can never be satisfactory besides the danger to which it expose congress of make hasty appropriation to work of the character of which they may be frequently ignorant it promote a mischievous and corrupting influence upon election by hold out to the people the fallacious hope that the success of a certain candidate will make navigable they neighboring creek or river bring commerce to they door and increase the value of they property it thus favor combination to squander the treasure of the country upon a multitude of local object as fatal to just legislation as to the purity of public man if a system compatible with the constitution can not be devise which be free from such tendency we should recollect that that instrument provide within itself the mode of its amendment and that there be therefore no excuse for the assumption of doubtful power by the general government if those which be clearly grant shall be find incompetent to the end of its creation it can at any time apply for they enlargement and there be no probability that such a application if found on the public interest will ever be refuse if the propriety of the propose grant be not sufficiently apparent to command the assent of three-fourth of the state the best possible reason why the power should not be assume on doubtful authority be afford for if more than one-fourth of the state be unwilling to make the grant its exercise will be productive of discontent which will far overbalance any advantage that could be derive from it all must admit that there be nothing so worthy of the constant solicitude of this government as the harmony and union of the people be solemnly impressed with the conviction that the extension of the power to make internal improvement beyond the limit i have suggest even if it be deem constitutional be subversive of the best interest of we country i earnestly recommend to congress to refrain from its exercise in doubtful case except in relation to improvement already begin unless they shall first procure from the state such a amendment of the constitution as will define its character and prescribe its bound if the state feel themselves competent to these object why should this government wish to assume the power if they do not then they will not hesitate to make the grant both government be the government of the people improvement must be make with the money of the people and if the money can be collect and apply by those more simple and economical political machine the state government it will unquestionably be safer and better for the people than to add to the splendor the patronage and the power of the general government but if the people of the several state think otherwise they will amend the constitution and in they decision all ought cheerfully to acquiesce for a detailed and highly satisfactory view of the operation of the war department i refer you to the accompany report of the secretary of war the hostile incursion of the sac and fox indian necessarily lead to the interposition of the government a portion of the troops under general scott and atkinson and of the militia of the state of illinoi be call into the field after a harassing warfare prolong by the nature of the country and by the difficulty of procure subsistence the indian be entirely defeat and the disaffected band disperse or destroy the result have be creditable to the troops engage in the service severe as be the lesson to the indian it be render necessary by they unprovoked aggression and it be to be hope that its impression will be permanent and salutary this campaign have evince the efficient organization of the army and its capacity for prompt and active service its several department have perform they function with energy and dispatch and the general movement be satisfactory we fellow-citizen upon the frontier be ready as they always be in the tender of they service in the hour of danger but a more efficient organization of we militia system be essential to that security which be one of the principal object of all government neither we situation nor we institution require or permit the maintenance of a large regular force history offer too many lesson of the fatal result of such a measure not to warn we against its adoption here the expense which attend it the obvious tendency to employ it because it exist and thus to engage in unnecessary war and its ultimate danger to public liberty will lead we i trust to place we principal dependence for protection upon the great body of the citizen of the republic if in assert rights or in repel wrong war should come upon we we regular force should be increase to a extent proportion to the emergency and we present small army be a nucleus around which such force could be form and embody but for the purpose of defense under ordinary circumstance we must rely upon the elector of the country those by whom and for whom the government be institute and be support will constitute its protection in the hour of danger as they do its check in the hour of safety but it be obvious that the militia system be imperfect much time be lose much unnecessary expense incur and much public property waste under the present arrangement little useful knowledge be gain by the muster and drill as now establish and the whole subject evidently require a thorough examination whether a plan of classification remedy these defect and provide for a system of instruction might not be adopt be submit to the consideration of congress the constitution have vest in the general government a independent authority upon the subject of the militia which render its action essential to the establishment or improvement of the system and i recommend the matter to you consideration in the conviction that the state of this important arm of the public defense require you attention i be happy to inform you that the wise and humane policy of transfer from the eastern to the western side of the mississippus the remnant of we aboriginal tribe with they own consent and upon just term have be steadily pursue and be approach i trust its consummation by reference to the report of the secretary of war and to the document submit with it you will see the progress which have be make since you last session in the arrangement of the various matter connect with we indian relation with one exception every subject involve any question of conflict jurisdiction or of peculiar difficulty have be happily dispose of and the conviction evidently gain ground among the indian that they removal to the country assign by the united state for they permanent residence furnish the only hope of they ultimate prosperity with that portion of the cherokee however live within the state of georgium it have be find impracticable as yet to make a satisfactory adjustment such be my anxiety to remove all the grounds of complaint and to bring to a termination the difficulty in which they be involve that i direct the very liberal proposition to be make to they which accompany the document herewith submit they can not but have see in these offer the evidence of the strongest disposition on the part of the government to deal justly and liberally with they a ample indemnity be offer for they present possession a liberal provision for they future support and improvement and full security for they private and political rights whatever difference of opinion may have prevail respect the just claim of these people there will probably be none respect the liberality of the proposition and very little respect the expediency of they immediate acceptance they be however reject and thus the position of these indian remain unchanged as do the view communicate in my message to the senate of February 22 1831 i refer you to the annual report of the secretary of the navy which accompany this message for a detail of the operation of that branch of the service during the present year besides the general remark on some of the transaction of we navy present in the view which have be take of we foreign relation i seize this occasion to invite to you notice the increase protection which it have afford to we commerce and citizen on distant sea without any augmentation of the force in commission in the gradual improvement of its pecuniary concern in the constant progress in the collection of material suitable for use during future emergency and in the construction of vessel and the building necessary to they preservation and repair the present state of this branch of the service exhibit the fruit of that vigilance and care which be so indispensable to its efficiency various new suggestion contain in the annex report as well as other heretofore submit to congress be worthy of you attention but none more so than that urge the renewal for another term of six year of the general appropriation for the gradual improvement of the navy from the accompany report of the postmaster-general you will also perceive that that department continue to extend its usefulness without impair its resource or lessen the accommodation which it afford in the secure and rapid transportation of the mail i beg leave to call the attention of congress to the view heretofore express in relation to the mode of choose the president and vice-president of the united state and to those respect the tenure of office generally still impressed with the justness of those view and with the belief that the modification suggest on those subject if adopt will contribute to the prosperity and harmony of the country i earnestly recommend they to you consideration at this time i have heretofore point out defect in the law for punish official fraud especially within the district of columbium it have be find almost impossible to bring notorious culprit to punishment and accord to a decision of the court for this district a prosecution be bar by a lapse of two year after the fraud have be commit it may happen again as it have already happen that during the whole two year all the evidence of the fraud may be in the possession of the culprit himself however proper the limitation may be in relation to private citizen it would seem that it ought not to commence run in favor of public officer until they go out of office the judiciary system of the united state remain imperfect of the nine western and southwestern state three only enjoy the benefit of a circuit court ohio kentucky and tennessee be embrace in the general system but indiana illinoi missourus alabama mississippus and louisiana have only district court if the exist system be a good one why should it not be extend if it be a bad one why be it suffer to exist the new state be promise equal rights and privilege when they come into the union and such be the guaranty of the constitution nothing can be more obvious than the obligation of the general government to place all the state on the same footing in relation to the administration of justice and i trust this duty will be neglect no longer on many of the subject to which you attention be invite in this communication it be a source of gratification to reflect that the step to be now adopt be uninfluenced by the embarrassment entail upon the country by the war through which it have pass in regard to most of we great interest we may consider ourselves as just start in we career and after a salutary experience about to fix upon a permanent basis the policy best calculate to promote the happiness of the people and facilitate they progress toward the most complete enjoyment of civil liberty on a occasion so interesting and important in we history and of such anxious concern to the friend of freedom throughout the world it be we imperious duty to lay aside all selfish and local consideration and be guide by a lofty spirit of devotion to the great principle on which we institution be found that this government may be so administer as to preserve its efficiency in promote and secure these general object should be the only aim of we ambition and we can not therefore too carefully examine its structure in order that we may not mistake its power or assume those which the people have reserve to themselves or have prefer to assign to other agent we should bear constantly in mind the fact that the consideration which induce the framer of the constitution to withhold from the general government the power to regulate the great mass of the business and concern of the people have be fully justify by experience and that it can not now be doubt that the genius of all we institution prescribe simplicity and economy as the characteristic of the reform which be yet to be effect in the present and future execution of the function bestow upon we by the constitution limit to a general superintend power to maintain peace at home and abroad and to prescribe law on a few subject of general interest not calculate to restrict human liberty but to enforce human rights this government will find its strength and its glory in the faithful discharge of these plain and simple duty relieve by its protect shield from the fear of war and the apprehension of oppression the free enterprise of we citizen aid by the state sovereignty will work out improvement and amelioration which can not fail to demonstrate that the great truth that the people can govern themselves be not only realize in we example but that it be do by a machinery in government so simple and economical as scarcely to be feel that the almighty ruler of the universe may so direct we deliberation and overrule we act as to make we instrumental in secure a result so

although i then express my reliance that it might be overcome by the prudence of the officer of the united state and the patriotism of the people i state that should the emergency arise render the execution of the exist law impracticable from any cause whatever prompt notice should be give to congress with the suggestion of such view and measure as might be necessary to meet it event which have occur in the quarter then allude to or which have come to my knowledge subsequently present this emergency since the date of my last annual message i have have officially transmit to I by the governor of south carolina which i now communicate to congress a copy of the ordinance pass by the convention which assemble at columbium in the state of south carolina in November last declare certain act of congress therein mention within the limit of that state to be absolutely null and void and make it the duty of the legislature to pass such law as would be necessary to carry the same into effect from and after the 1st February next the consequence to which this extraordinary defiance of the just authority of the government might too surely lead be clearly foresee and it be impossible for I to hesitate as to my own duty in such a emergency the ordinance have be pass however without any certain knowledge of the recommendation which from a view of the interest of the nation at large the executive have determine to submit to congress and a hope be indulge that by frankly explain he sentiment and the nature of those duty which the crisis would devolve upon he the authority of south carolina might be induce to retrace they step in this hope i determine to issue my proclamation of the 10th of December last a copy of which i now lay before congress i regret to inform you that these reasonable expectation have not be realize and that the several act of the legislature of south carolina which i now lay before you and which have all and each of they finally pass after a knowledge of the desire of the administration to modify the law complain of be too well calculate both in they positive enactment and in the spirit of opposition which they obviously encourage wholly to obstruct the collection of the revenue within the limit of that state up to this period neither the recommendation of the executive in regard to we financial policy and impost system nor the disposition manifest by congress promptly to act upon that subject nor the unequivocal expression of the public will in all part of the union appear to have produce any relaxation in the measure of opposition adopt by the state of south carolina nor be there any reason to hope that the ordinance and law will be abandon i have no knowledge that a attempt have be make or that it be in contemplation to reassemble either the convention or the legislature and it will be perceive that the interval before the 1st of February be too short to admit of the preliminary step necessary for that purpose it appear moreover that the state authority be actively organize they military resource and provide the means and give the most solemn assurance of protection and support to all who shall enlist in opposition to the revenue law a recent proclamation of the present governor of south carolina have openly defy the authority of the executive of the union and general order from the headquarters of the state announce he determination to accept the service of volunteer and he belief that should they country need they service they will be find at the post of honor and duty ready to lay down they life in she defense under these order the force refer to be direct to hold themselves in readiness to take the field at a moment 's warning and in the city of charleston within a collection district and a port of entry a rendezvous have be open for the purpose of enlist man for the magazine and municipal guard thus south carolina present herself in the attitude of hostile preparation and ready even for military violence if need be to enforce she law for prevent the collection of the duty within she limit proceedings thus announce and mature must be distinguish from menace of unlawful resistance by irregular body of people who act under temporary delusion may be restrain by reflection and the influence of public opinion from the commission of actual outrage in the present instance aggression may be regard as commit when it be officially authorize and the means of enforce it fully provide under these circumstance there can be no doubt that it be the determination of the authority of south carolina fully to carry into effect they ordinance and law after the 1st of February it therefore become my duty to bring the subject to the serious consideration of congress in order that such measure as they in they wisdom may deem fit shall be seasonably provide and that it may be thereby understand that while the government be dispose to remove all just cause of complaint as far as may be practicable consistently with a proper regard to the interest of the community at large it be nevertheless determine that the supremacy of the law shall be maintain in make this communication it appear to I to be proper not only that i should lay before you the act and proceedings of south carolina but that i should also fully acquaint you with those step which i have already cause to be take for the due collection of the revenue and with my view of the subject generally that the suggestion which the constitution require I to make in regard to you future legislation may be better understand this subject have early attract the anxious attention of the executive as soon as it be probable that the authority of south carolina seriously meditate resistance to the faithful execution of the revenue law it be deem advisable that the secretary of the treasury should particularly instruct the officer of the united state in that part of the union as to the nature of the duty prescribe by the exist law instruction be accordingly issue on the 6th of November to the collector in that state point out they respective duty and enjoin upon each a firm and vigilant but discreet performance of they in the emergency then apprehend i herewith transmit copy of these instruction and of the letter address to the district attorney request he cooperation these instruction be dictate in the hope that as the opposition to the law by the anomalous proceeding of nullification be represent to be of a pacific nature to be pursue substantially accord to the form of the constitution and without resort in any event to force or violence the measure of its advocate would be take in conformity with that profession and on such supposition the means afford by the exist law would have be adequate to meet any emergency likely to arise it be however not possible altogether to suppress apprehension of the excess to which the excitement prevail in that quarter might lead but it certainly be not foresee that the meditate obstruction to the law would so soon openly assume its present character subsequently to the date of those instruction however the ordinance of the convention be pass which if comply with by the people of the state must effectually render inoperative the present revenue law within she limit that ordinance declare and ordain -- that the several act and part of act of the congress of the united state purport to be law for the impose of duty and impost on the importation of foreign commodity and now have operation

provision for enforce the ordinance but i have not yet be able to procure they i transmit however a copy of governor hamilton 's message to the legislature of south carolina of governor hayne 's inaugural address to the same body as also of he proclamation and a general order of the governor and commander in chief date the 20th of December give public notice that the service of volunteer will be accept under the act already refer to if these measure can not be defeat and overcome by the power confer by the constitution on the federal government the constitution must be consider as incompetent to its own defense the supremacy of the law be at a end and the rights and liberty of the citizen can no longer receive protection from the government of the union they not only abrogate the act of congress commonly call the tariff act of 1828 and 1832 but they prostrate and sweep away at once and without exception every act and every part of every act impose any amount whatever of duty on any foreign merchandise and virtually every exist act which have ever be pass authorize the collection of the revenue include the act of 1816 and also the collection law of 1799 the constitutionality of which have never be question it be not only those duty which be charge to have be impose for the protection of manufacture that be thereby repeal but all other though lay for the purpose of revenue merely and upon article in no degree suspect of be object of protection the whole revenue system of the united state in south carolina be obstruct and overthrow and the government be absolutely prohibit from collect any part of the public revenue within the limit of that state henceforth not only the citizen of south carolina and of the united state but the subject of foreign state may import any description or quantity of merchandise into the port of south carolina without the payment of any duty whatsoever that state be thus relieve from the payment of any part of the public burthen and duty and impost be not only render not uniform throughout the united state but a direct and ruinous preference be give to the port of that state over those of all the other state of the union in manifest violation of the positive provision of the constitution in point of duration also those aggression upon the authority of congress which by the ordinance be make part of the fundamental law of south carolina be absolute indefinite and without limitation they neither prescribe the period when they shall cease nor indicate any condition upon which those who have thus undertake to arrest the operation of the law be to retrace they step and rescind they measure they offer to the united state no alternative but unconditional submission if the scope of the ordinance be to be receive as the scale of concession they demand can be satisfy only by a repeal of the whole system of revenue law and by abstain from the collection of any duty and impost whatsoever it be true that in the address to the people of the united state by the convention of south carolina after announce the fix and final determination of the state in relation to the protect system they say that it remain for we to submit a plan of taxation in which we would be willing to acquiesce in a liberal spirit of concession provide we be meet in due time and in a become spirit by the state interested in manufacture in the opinion of the convention a equitable plan would be that the whole list of protected article should be import free of all duty and that the revenue derive from import duty should be raise exclusively from the unprotected article or that whenever a duty be impose upon protected article import a excise duty of the same rate shall be impose upon all similar article manufacture in the united state the address proceed to state however that they be willing to make a large offering to preserve the union and with a distinct declaration that it be a concession on we part we will consent that the same rate of duty may be impose upon the protected article that shall be impose upon the unprotected provide that no more revenue be raise than be necessary to meet the demand of the government for constitutional purpose and provide also that a duty substantially uniform be impose upon all foreign import it be also true that in he message to the legislature when urge the necessity of provide means of secure they safety by ample resource for repel force by force the governor of south carolina observe that he can not but think that on a calm and dispassionate review by congress and the functionary of the general government of the true merit of this controversy the arbitration by a call of a convention of all the state which we sincerely and anxiously seek and desire will be accord to we from the diversity of term indicate in these two important document take in connection with the progress of recent event in that quarter there be too much reason to apprehend without in any manner doubt the intention of those public functionary that neither the term propose in the address of the convention nor those allude to in the message of the governor would appease the excitement which have lead to the present excess it be obvious however that should the latter be insist on they present a alternative which the general government of itself can by no possibility grant since by a express provision of the constitution congress can call a convention for the purpose of propose amendment only on the application of the legislature of two-third of the state and it be not perceive that the term present in the address be more practicable than those refer to in the message it will not escape attention that the condition on which it be say in the address of the convention they would be willing to acquiesce form no part of the ordinance while this ordinance bear all the solemnity of a fundamental law be to be authoritative upon all within the limit of south carolina and be absolute and unconditional in its term the address convey only the sentiment of the convention in no binding or practical form one be the act of the state the other only the expression of the opinion of the member of the convention to limit the effect of that solemn act by any term or condition whatever they should have be embody in it and make of import no less authoritative than the act itself by the positive enactment of the ordinance the execution of the law of the union be absolutely prohibit and the address offer no other prospect of they be again restore even in the modified form propose than what depend upon the improbable contingency that amid change event and increase excitement the sentiment of the present member of the convention and of they successor will remain the same it be to be regret however that these condition even if they have be offer in the same binding form be so undefined depend upon so many contingency and be so directly oppose to the known opinion and interest of the great body of the american people as to be almost hopeless of attainment the majority of the state and of the people will certainly not consent that the protect duty shall be wholly abrogate never to be reenact at any future time or in any possible contingency as little practicable be it to provide that the same rate of duty shall be impose upon the protected article that shall be impose upon the unprotected which moreover would be severely oppressive to the poor and in time of war would add greatly to its rigor and though there can be no objection to the principle properly understand that no more revenue shall be raise than be necessary for the constitutional purpose of the government which principle have be already recommend by the executive as the true basis of taxation yet it be very certain that south carolina alone can not be permit to decide what these constitutional purpose be the period which constitute the due time in which the term propose in the address be to be accept would seem to present scarcely less difficulty than the term themselves though the revenue law be already declare to be void in south carolina as well as the bond take under they and the judicial proceedings for carry they into effect yet as the full action and operation of the ordinance be to be suspend until the 1st of February the interval may be assume as the time within which it be expect that the most complicated portion of the national legislation a system of long standing and affect great interest in the community be to be rescind and abolish if this be require it be clear that a compliance be impossible in the uncertainty then that exist as to the duration of the ordinance and of the enactment for enforce it it become imperiously the duty of the executive of the united state act with a proper regard to all the great interest commit to he care to treat those act as absolute and unlimited they be so as far as he agency be concern he can not either embrace or lead to the performance of the condition he have already discharge the only part in he power by the recommendation in he annual message the rest be with congress and the people and until they have act he duty will require he to look to the exist state of thing and act under they accord to he high obligation by these various proceedings therefore the state of south carolina have force the general government unavoidably to decide the new and dangerous alternative of permit a state to obstruct the execution of the law within its limit or see it attempt to execute a threat of withdraw from the union that portion of the people at present exercise the authority of the state solemnly assert they right to do either and as solemnly announce they determination to do one or the other in my opinion both purpose be to be regard as revolutionary in they character and tendency and subversive of the supremacy of the law and of the integrity of the union the result of each be the same since a state in which by a usurpation of power the constitutional authority of the federal government be openly defy and set aside want only the form to be independent of the union the right of the people of a single state to absolve themselves at will and without the consent of the other state from they most solemn obligation and hazard the liberty and happiness of the million compose this union can not be acknowledge such authority be believe to be utterly repugnant both to the principle upon which the general government be constitute and to the object which it be expressly form to attain against all act which may be allege to transcend the constitutional power of the government or which may be inconvenient or oppressive in they operation the constitution itself have prescribe the mode of redress it be the acknowledged attribute of free institution that under they the empire of reason and law be substitute for the power of the sword to no other source can appeal for suppose wrong be make consistently with the obligation of south carolina to no other can such appeal be make with safety at any time and to they decision when constitutionally pronounce it become the duty no less of the public authority than of the people in every case to yield a patriotic submission that a state or any other great portion of the people suffer under long and intolerable oppression and have try all constitutional remedy without the hope of redress may have a natural right when they happiness can be no otherwise secure and when they can do so without greater injury to other to absolve themselves from they obligation to the government and appeal to the last resort need not on the present occasion be deny the existence of this right however must depend upon the cause which may justify its exercise it be the _ ultima ratio _ which presuppose that the proper appeal to all other means of redress have be make in good faith and which can never be rightfully resort to unless it be unavoidable it be not the right of the state but of the individual and of all the individual in the state it be the right of mankind generally to secure by all means in they power the blessing of liberty and happiness but when for these purpose any body of man have voluntarily associate themselves under a particular form of government no portion of they can dissolve the association without acknowledge the correlative right in the remainder to decide whether that dissolution can be permit consistently with the general happiness in this view it be a right dependent upon the power to enforce it such a right though it may be admit to preexist and can not be wholly surrender be necessarily subject to limitation in all free government and in compact of all kind freely and voluntarily enter into and in which the interest and welfare of the individual become identify with those of the community of which he be a member in compact between individual however deeply they may affect they relation these principle be acknowledge to create a sacred obligation and in compact of civil government involve the liberty and happiness of million of mankind the obligation can not be less without advert to the particular theory to which the federal compact have give rise both as to its formation and the party to it and without inquire whether it be merely federal or social or national it be sufficient that it must be admit to be a compact and to possess the obligation incident to a compact to be a compact by which power be create on the one hand and obedience exact on the other a compact freely voluntarily and solemnly enter into by the several state and ratify by the people thereof respectively a compact by which the several state and the people thereof respectively have bind themselves to each other and to the federal government and by which the federal government be bind to the several state and to every citizen of the united state to this compact in whatever mode it may have be do the people of south carolina have freely and voluntarily give they assent and to the whole and every part of it they be upon every principle of good faith inviolably bind under this obligation they be bind and should be require to contribute they portion of the public expense and to submit to all law make by the common consent in pursuance of the constitution for the common defense and general welfare until they can be change in the mode which the compact have provide for the attainment of those great end of the government and of the union nothing less than cause which would justify revolutionary remedy can absolve the people from this obligation and for nothing less can the government permit it to be do without violate its own obligation by which under the compact it be bind to the other state and to every citizen of the united state these deduction plainly flow from the nature of the federal compact which be one of limitation not only upon the power originally possess by the party thereto but also upon those confer on the government and every department thereof it will be freely concede that by the principle of we system all power be vest in the people but to be exercise in the mode and subject to the check which the people themselves have prescribe these check be undoubtedly only different modification of the same great popular principle which lie at the foundation of the whole but be not on that account to be less regard or less obligatory upon the power of congress the veto of the executive and the authority of the judiciary which be to extend to all case in law and equity arise under the constitution and law of the united state make in pursuance thereof be the obvious check and the sound action of public opinion with the ultimate power of amendment be the salutary and only limitation upon the power of the whole however it may be allege that a violation of the compact by the measure of the government can affect the obligation of the party it can not even be pretend that such violation can be predicate of those measure until all the constitutional remedy shall have be fully try if the federal government exercise power not warrant by the constitution and immediately affect individual it will scarcely be deny that the proper remedy be a recourse to the judiciary such undoubtedly be the remedy for those who deem the act of congress lay duty and impost and provide for they collection to be unconstitutional the whole operation of such law be upon the individual import the merchandise a state be absolutely prohibit from lay impost or duty on import or export without the consent of congress and can not become a party under these law without import in she own name or wrongfully interpose she authority against they by thus interpose however she can not rightfully obstruct the operation of the law upon individual for they disobedience to or violation of the law the ordinary remedy through the judicial tribunal would remain and in a case where a individual should be prosecute for any offense against the law he could not set up in justification of he act a law of the state which be unconstitutional would therefore be regard as null and void the law of a state can not authorize the commission of a crime against the united state or any other act which accord to the supreme law of the union would be otherwise unlawful and it be equally clear that if there be any case in which a state as such be affect by the law beyond the scope of judicial power the remedy consist in appeal to the people either to effect a change in the representation or to procure relief by a amendment of the constitution but the measure of the government be to be recognize as valid and consequently supreme until these remedy shall have be effectually try and any attempt to subvert those measure or to render the law subordinate to state authority and afterwards to resort to constitutional redress be worse than evasive it would not be a proper resistance to _ a government of unlimited power _ as have be sometimes pretend but unlawful opposition to the very limitation on which the harmonious action of the government and all its part absolutely depend south carolina have appeal to none of these remedy but in effect have defy they all while threaten to separate from the union if any attempt be make to enforce the revenue law otherwise than through the civil tribunal of the country she have not only not appeal in she own name to those tribunal which the constitution have provide for all case in law or equity arise under the constitution and law of the united state but have endeavor to frustrate they proper action on she citizen by draw the cognizance of case under the revenue law to she own tribunal specially prepare and fit for the purpose of enforce the act pass by the state to obstruct those law and both the judge and juror of which will be bind by the import of oath previously take to treat the constitution and law of the united state in this respect as a nullity nor have the state make the proper appeal to public opinion and to the remedy of amendment for without wait to learn whether the other state will consent to a convention or if they do will construe or amend the constitution to suit she view she have of she own authority alter the import of that instrument and give immediate effect to the change in fine she have set she own will and authority above the law have make herself arbiter in she own cause and have pass at once over all intermediate step to measure of avowed resistance which unless they be submit to can be enforce only by the sword in decide upon the course which a high sense of duty to all the people of the united state impose upon the authority of the union in this emergency it can not be overlook that there be no sufficient cause for the act of south carolina or for she thus place in jeopardy the happiness of so many million of people misrule and oppression to warrant the disruption of the free institution of the union of these state should be great and lasting defy all other remedy for cause of minor character the government could not submit to such a catastrophe without a violation of its most sacred obligation to the other state of the union who have submit they destiny to its hand there be in the present instance no such cause either in the degree of misrule or oppression complain of or in the hopelessness of redress by constitutional mean the long sanction they have receive from the proper authority and from the people not less than the unexampled growth and increase prosperity of so many million of freeman attest that no such oppression as would justify or even palliate such a resort can be justly imputed either to the present policy or past measure of the federal government the same mode of collect duty and for the same general object which begin with the foundation of the government and which have conduct the country through its subsequent step to its present enviable condition of happiness and renown have not be change taxation and representation the great principle of the american revolution have continually go hand in hand and at all time and in every instance no tax of any kind have be impose without they participation and in some instance which have be complain of with the express assent of a part of the representative of south carolina in the council of the government up to the present period no revenue have be raise beyond the necessary want of the country and the authorize expenditure of the government and as soon as the burthen of the public debt be remove those charge with the administration have promptly recommend a corresponding reduction of revenue that this system thus pursue have result in no such oppression upon south carolina need no other proof than the solemn and official declaration of the late chief magistrate of that state in he address to the legislature in that he say that -- the occurrence of the past year in connection with we domestic concern be to be review with a sentiment of fervent gratitude to the great disposer of human event that tribute of grateful acknowledgment be due for the various and multiply blessing he have be please to bestow on we people that abundant harvest in every quarter of the state have crown the exertion of agricultural labor that health almost beyond former precedent have bless we home and that there be not less reason for thankfulness in survey we social condition it would indeed be difficult to imagine oppression where in the social condition of a people there be equal cause of thankfulness as for abundant harvest and vary and multiply blessing with which a kind providence have favor they independently of these consideration it will not escape observation that south carolina still claim to be a component part of the union to participate in the national council and to share in the public benefit without contribute to the public burden thus assert the dangerous anomaly of continue in a association without acknowledge any other obligation to its law than what depend upon she own will in this posture of affair the duty of the government seem to be plain it inculcate a recognition of that state as a member of the union and subject to its authority a vindication of the just power of the constitution the preservation of the integrity of the union and the execution of the law by all constitutional mean the constitution which he oath of office oblige he to support declare that the executive _ shall take care that the law be faithfully execute _ and in provide that he shall from time to time give to congress information of the state of the union and recommend to they consideration such measure as he shall judge necessary and expedient impose the additional obligation of recommend to congress such more efficient provision for execute the law as may from time to time be find requisite the same instrument confer on congress the power not merely to lay and collect tax duty impost and excise to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare but to make all law which shall be necessary and proper for carry into effect the foregoing power and all other power vest by the constitution in the government of the united state or in any department or officer thereof and also to provide for call forth the militia for execute the law of the union in all case similar to the present the duty of the government become the measure of its power and whenever it fail to exercise a power necessary and proper to the discharge of the duty prescribe by the constitution it violate the public trust not less than it would in transcend its proper limit to refrain therefore from the high and solemn duty thus enjoin however painful the performance may be and thereby tacitly permit the rightful authority of the government to be contemn and its law obstruct by a single state would neither comport with its own safety nor the rights of the great body of the american people it be thus show to be the duty of the executive to execute the law by all constitutional mean it remain to consider the extent of those already at he disposal and what it may be proper further to provide in the instruction of the secretary of the treasury to the collector in south carolina the provision and regulation make by the act of 1799 and also the fine penalty and forfeiture for they enforcement be particularly detailed and explain it may be well apprehend however that these provision may prove inadequate to meet such a open powerful organize opposition as be to be commence after the 1st of February next subsequently to the date of these instruction and to the passage of the ordinance information have be receive from source entitle to be rely on that owe to the popular excitement in the state and the effect of the ordinance declare the execution of the revenue law unlawful a sufficient number of person in whom confidence might be place could not be induce to accept the office of inspector to oppose with any probability of success the force which will no doubt be use when a attempt be make to remove vessel and they cargo from the custody of the officer of the custom and indeed that it would be impracticable for the collector with the aid of any number of inspector whom he may be authorize to employ to preserve the custody against such a attempt the removal of the custom-house from charleston to castle pinckney be deem a measure of necessary precaution and though the authority to give that direction be not question it be nevertheless apparent that a similar precaution can not be observe in regard to the port of georgetown and beaufort each of which under the present law remain a port of entry and expose to the obstruction meditate in that quarter in consider the best means of avoid or of prevent the apprehend obstruction to the collection of the revenue and the consequence which may ensue it would appear to be proper and necessary to enable the officer of the custom to preserve the custody of vessel and they cargo which by the exist law they be require to take until the duty to which they be liable shall be pay or secure the mode by which it be contemplate to deprive they of that custody be the process of replevin and that of _ capia in withernam _ in the nature of a distress from the state tribunal organize by the ordinance against the proceeding in the nature of a distress it be not perceive that the collector can interpose any resistance whatever and against the process of replevin authorize by the law of the state he have no common-law power can only oppose such inspector as he be by statute authorize and may find it practicable to employ and these from the information already advert to be show to be wholly inadequate the respect which that process deserve must therefore be consider if the authority of south carolina have not obstruct the legitimate action of the court of the united state or if they have permit the state tribunal to administer the law accord to they oath under the constitution and the regulation of the law of the union the general government might have be content to look to they for maintain the custody and to encounter the other inconvenience arise out of the recent proceedings even in that case however the process of replevin from the court of the state would be irregular and unauthorized it have be decide by the supreme court of the united state that the court of the united state have exclusive jurisdiction of all seizure make on land or water for a breach of the law of the united state and any intervention of a state authority which by take the thing seize out of the hand of the united state officer might obstruct the exercise of this jurisdiction be unlawful that in such case the court of the united state have cognizance of the seizure may enforce a redelivery of the thing by attachment or other summary process that the question under such a seizure whether a forfeiture have be actually incur belong exclusively to the court of the united state and it depend on the final decree whether the seizure be to be deem rightful or tortuous and that not until the seizure be finally judge wrongful and without probable cause by the court of the united state can the party proceed at common law for damages in the state court but by make it unlawful for any of the constitute authority whether of the united state or of the state to enforce the law for the payment of duty and declare that all judicial proceedings which shall be hereafter have in affirmance of the contract make with purpose to secure the duty impose by the say act be and shall be hold utterly null and void she have in effect abrogate the judicial tribunal within she limit in this respect have virtually deny the united state access to the court establish by they own law and declare it unlawful for the judge to discharge those duty which they be swear to perform in lieu of these she have substitute those state tribunal already advert to the judge whereof be not merely forbid to allow a appeal or permit a copy of they record but be previously swear to disregard the law of the union and enforce those only of south carolina and thus deprive of the function essential to the judicial character of inquire into the validity of the law and the right of the matter become merely ministerial instrument in aid of the concerted obstruction of the law of the union neither the process nor authority of these tribunal thus constitute can be respect consistently with the supremacy of the law or the rights and security of the citizen if they be submit to the protection due from the government to its officer and citizen be withhold and there be at once a end not only to the law but to the union itself against such a force as the sheriff may and which by the replevin law of south carolina it be he duty to exercise it can not be expect that a collector can retain he custody with the aid of the inspector in such case it be true it would be competent to institute suit in the united state court against those engage in the unlawful proceeding or the property might be seize for a violation of the revenue law and be libel in the proper court a order might be make for its redelivery which would be commit to the marshal for execution but in that case the fourth section of the act in broad and unqualified term make it the duty of the sheriff to prevent such recapture or seizure or to redeliver the goods as the case may be even under any process order or decree or other pretext contrary to the true intent and meaning of the ordinance aforesaid it be thus make the duty of the sheriff to oppose the process of the court of the united state and for that purpose if need be to employ the whole power of the county and the act expressly reserve to he all power which independently of its provision he could have use in this reservation it obviously contemplate a resort to other means than those particularly mention it be not to be disguise that the power which it be thus enjoin upon the sheriff to employ be nothing less than the _ posse comitatus _ in all the rigor of the ancient common law this power though it may be use against unlawful resistance to judicial process be in its character forcible and analogous to that confer upon the marshal by the act of 1795 it be in fact the embodying of the whole mass of the population under the command of a single individual to accomplish by they forcible aid what could not be effect peaceably and by the ordinary mean it may properly be say to be a relic of those age in which the law could be defend rather by physical than moral force and in its origin be confer upon the sheriff of england to enable they to defend they county against any of the king 's enemy when they come into the land as well as for the purpose of execute process in early and less civilized time it be intend to include the aid and attendance of all knight and other who be bind to have harness it include the right of go with arm and military equipment and embrace larger class and greater mass of population than can be compel by the law of most of the state to perform militia duty if the principle of the common law be recognize in south carolina -lrb- and from this act it would seem they be -rrb- the power of summon the _ posse comitatus _ will compel under the penalty of fine and imprisonment every man over the age of 15 and able to travel to turn out at the call of the sheriff and with such weapon as may be necessary and it may justify beating and even kill such as may resist the use of the _ posse comitatus _ be therefore a direct application of force and can not be otherwise regard than as the employment of the whole militia force of the county and in a equally efficient form under a different name no proceeding which resort to this power to the extent contemplate by the act can be properly denominate peaceable the act of south carolina however do not rely altogether upon this forcible remedy for even attempt to resist or disobey though by the aid only of the ordinary officer of the custom the process of replevin the collector and all concern be subject to a further proceeding in the nature of a distress of they personal effect and be moreover make guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to be punish by a fine of not less than $ 1000 nor more than $ 5000 and to imprisonment not exceed two year and not less than six month and for even attempt to execute the order of the court for retake the property the marshal and all assist would be guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to a fine of not less than $ 3000 nor more than $ 10000 and to imprisonment not exceed two year nor less than one : and in case the goods should be retake under such process it be make the absolute duty of the sheriff to retake they it be not to be suppose that in the face of these penalty aid by the powerful force of the county which would doubtless be bring to sustain the state officer either that the collector would retain the custody in the first instance or that the marshal could summon sufficient aid to retake the property pursuant to the order or other process of the court it be moreover obvious that in this conflict between the power of the officer of the united state and of the state -lrb- unless the latter be passively submit to -rrb- the destruction to which the property of the officer of the custom would be expose the commission of actual violence and the loss of life would be scarcely avoidable under these circumstance and the provision of the act of south carolina the execution of the law be render impracticable even through the ordinary judicial tribunal of the united state there would certainly be fewer difficulty and less opportunity of actual collision between the officer of the united state and of the state and the collection of the revenue would be more effectually secure -- if indeed it can be do in any other way -- by place the custom-house beyond the immediate power of the county for this purpose it might be proper to provide that whenever by any unlawful combination or obstruction in any state or in any port it should become impracticable faithfully to collect the duty the president of the united state should be authorize to alter and abolish such of the district and port of entry as should be necessary and to establish the custom-house at some secure place within some port or harbor of such state and in such case it should be the duty of the collector to reside at such place and to detain all vessel and cargo until the duty impose by law should be properly secure or pay in cash deduct interest that in such case it should be unlawful to take the vessel and cargo from the custody of the proper officer of the custom unless by process from the ordinary judicial tribunal of the united state and that in case of a attempt otherwise to take the property by a force too great to be overcome by the officer of the custom it should be lawful to protect the possession of the officer by the employment of the land and naval force and militia under provision similar to those authorize by the eleventh section of the act of the 9th of January 1809 this provision however would not shield the officer and citizen of the united state act under the law from suit and prosecution in the tribunal of the state which might thereafter be bring against they nor would it protect they property from the proceeding by distress and it may well be apprehend that it would be insufficient to insure a proper respect to the process of the constitutional tribunal in prosecution for offens against the united state and to protect the authority of the united state whether judicial or ministerial in the performance of they duty it would moreover be inadequate to extend the protection due from the government to that portion of the people of south carolina against outrage and oppression of any kind who may manifest they attachment and yield obedience to the law of the union it may therefore be desirable to revive with some modification better adapt to the occasion the sixth section of the act of the 3d march 1815 which expire on the 4th march 1817 by the limitation of that of 27th April 1816 and to provide that in any case where suit shall be bring against any individual in the court of the state for any act do under the law of the united state he should be authorize to remove the say cause by petition into the circuit court of the united state without any copy of the record and that the court should proceed to hear and determine the same as if it have be originally institute therein and that in all case of injury to the person or property of individual for disobedience to the ordinance and law of south carolina in pursuance thereof redress may be seek in the court of the united state it may be expedient also by modify the resolution of the 3d march 1791 to authorize the marshal to make the necessary provision for the safe-keeping of prisoner commit under the authority of the united state provision less than these consist as they do for the most part rather of a revival of the policy of former act call for by the exist emergency than of the introduction of any unusual or rigorous enactment would not cause the law of the union to be properly respect or enforce it be believe these would prove adequate unless the military force of the state of south carolina authorize by the late act of the legislature should be actually embody and call out in aid of they proceedings and of the provision of the ordinance generally even in that case however it be believe that no more will be necessary than a few modification of its term to adapt the act of 1795 to the present emergency as by that act the provision of the law of 1792 be accommodate to the crisis then exist and by confer authority upon the president to give it operation during the session of congress and without the ceremony of a proclamation whenever it shall be officially make know to he by the authority of any state or by the court of the united state that within the limit of such state the law of the united state will be openly oppose and they execution obstruct by the actual employment of military force or by any unlawful means whatsoever too great to be otherwise overcome in close this communication i should do injustice to my own feeling not to express my confident reliance upon the disposition of each department of the government to perform its duty and to cooperate in all measure necessary in the present emergency the crisis undoubtedly invoke the fidelity of the patriot and the sagacity of the statesman not more in remove such portion of the public burden as may be necessary than in preserve the good order of society and in the maintenance of well-regulated liberty while a forbearing spirit may and i trust will be exercise toward the error of we brethren in a particular quarter duty to the rest of the union demand that open and organized resistance to the law should not be execute with impunity the rich inheritance bequeath by we father have devolve upon we the sacred obligation of preserve it by the same virtue which conduct they through the eventful scene of the revolution and ultimately crown they struggle with the noblest model of civil institution they bequeath to we a government of law and a federal union found upon the great principle of popular representation after a successful experiment of forty-four year at a moment when the government and the union be the object of the hope of the friend of civil liberty throughout the world and in the midst of public and individual prosperity unexampled in history we be call to decide whether these law possess any force and that union the means of self-preservation the decision of this question by a enlighten and patriotic people can not be doubtful for myself fellow-citizen devoutly rely upon that kind providence which have hitherto watch over we destiny and actuate by a profound reverence for those institution i have

_ to the senate of the united state _ : i avail myself of this early opportunity to return to the senate in which it originate the bill entitle a act provide for the final settlement of the claim of state for interest on advance to the united state make during the last war with the reason which induce I to withhold my approbation in consequence of which it have fail to become a law this bill be present to I for my signature on the last day of you session and when i be compel to consider a variety of other bill of greater urgency to the public service it obviously embrace a principle in the allowance of interest different from that which have be sanction by the practice of the accounting officer or by the previous legislation of congress in regard to the advance by the state and without any apparent grounds for the change previously to give my sanction to so great a extension of the practice of allow interest upon account with the government and which in its consequence and from analogy might not only call for large payment from the treasury but disturb the great mass of individual account long since finally settle i deem it my duty to make a more thorough investigation of the subject than it be possible for I to do previously to the close of you last session i adopt this course the more readily from the consideration that as the bill contain no appropriation the state which would have be entitle to claim its benefit could not have receive they without the fuller legislation of congress the principle which this bill authorize vary not only from the practice uniformly adopt by many of the accounting officer in the case of individual account and in those of the state finally settle and close previously to you last session but also from that pursue under the act of you last session for the adjustment and settlement of the claim of the state of south carolina this last act prescribe no particular mode for the allowance of interest which therefore in conformity with the direction of congress in previous case and with the uniform practice of the auditor by whom the account be settle be compute on the sum expend by the state of south carolina for the use and benefit of the united state and which have be repay to the state and the payment make by the united state be deduct from the principal sum exclusive of the interest thereby stop future interest on so much of the principal as have be reimburse by the payment i deem it proper moreover to observe that both under the act of the 5th of August 1790 and that of the 12th of February 1793 authorize the settlement of the account between the united state and the individual state arise out of the war of the revolution the interest on those account be compute in conformity with the practice already advert to and from which the bill now return be a departure with these reason and consideration i return the bill to the senate andrew jackson _ December 6 1832 _ _ to the house of representative _ : in addition to the general view i have heretofore express to congress on the subject of internal improvement it be my duty to advert to it again in state my objection to the bill entitle a act for the improvement of certain harbor and the navigation of certain river which be not receive a sufficient time before the close of the last session to enable I to examine it before the adjournment have maturely consider that bill within the time allow I by the constitution and be convince that some of its provision conflict with the rule adopt for my guide on this subject of legislation i have be compel to withhold from it my signature and it have therefore fail to become a law to facilitate as far as i can the intelligent action of congress upon the subject embrace in this bill i transmit herewith a report from the engineer department distinguish as far as the information within its possession would enable it between those appropriation which do and those which do not conflict with the rule by which my conduct in this respect have hitherto be govern by that report it will be see that there be a class of appropriation in the bill for the improvement of stream that be not navigable that be not channel of commerce and that do not pertain to the harbor or port of entry designate by law or have any ascertain connection with the usual establishment for the security of commerce external or internal it be obvious that such appropriation involve the sanction of a principle that concede to the general government a unlimited power over the subject of internal improvement and that i could not therefore approve a bill contain they without recede from the position take in my veto of the maysville road bill and afterwards in my annual message of December 6 1830 it be to be regret that the rule by which the classification of the improvement in this bill have be make by the engineer department be not more definite and certain and that embarrassment may not always be avoid by the observance of they but as neither my own reflection nor the light derive from other source have furnish I with a better guide i shall continue to apply my best exertion to they application and enforcement in thus employ my best faculty to exercise the power with which i be invest to avoid evil and to effect the greatest attainable good for we common country i feel that i may trust to you cordial cooperation and the experience of the past leaf I no room to doubt the liberal indulgence and favorable consideration of those for whom we act the grounds upon which i have give my assent to appropriation for the construction of light-houses beacon buoy public pier and the removal of sand bar sawyer and other temporary or partial impediment in we navigable river and harbor and with which many of the provision of this bill correspond have be so fully state that i trust a repetition of they be unnecessary have there be incorporate in the bill no provision for work of a different description depend on principle which extend the power of make appropriation to every object which the discretion of the government may select and lose sight of the distinction between national and local character which i have state would be my future guide on the subject i should have cheerfully sign the bill andrew jackson proclamation by andrew jackson president of the united state whereas a convention assemble in the state of south carolina have pass a ordinance by which they declare that the several act and part of act of the congress of the united state purport to be law for the impose of duty and impost on the importation of foreign commodity and now have actual operation and effect within the united state and more especially two act for the same purpose pass on the 29th of may 1828 and on the 14th of July 1832 be unauthorized by the constitution of the united state and violate the true meaning and intent thereof and be null and void and no law nor binding on the citizen of that state or its officer and by the say ordinance it be further declare to be unlawful for any of the constitute authority of the state or of the united state to enforce the payment of the duty impose by the say act within the same state and that it be the duty of the legislature to pass such law as may be necessary to give full effect to the say ordinance and whereas by the say ordinance it be further ordain that in no case of law or equity decide in the court of say state wherein shall be draw in question the validity of the say ordinance or of the act of the legislature that may be pass to give it effect or of the say law of the united state no appeal shall be allow to the supreme court of the united state nor shall any copy of the record be permit or allow for that purpose and that any person attempt to take such appeal shall be punish as for contempt of court and finally the say ordinance declare that the people of south carolina will maintain the say ordinance at every hazard and that they will consider the passage of any act by congress abolish or close the port of the say state or otherwise obstruct the free ingress or egress of vessel to and from the say port or any other act of the federal government to coerce the state shut up she port destroy or harass she commerce or to enforce the say act otherwise than through the civil tribunal of the country as inconsistent with the longer continuance of south carolina in the union and that the people of the say state will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all further obligation to maintain or preserve they political connection with the people of the other state and will forthwith proceed to organize a separate government and do all other act and thing which sovereign and independent state may of right do and whereas the say ordinance prescribe to the people of south carolina a course of conduct in direct violation of they duty as citizen of the united state contrary to the law of they country subversive of its constitution and have for its object the destruction of the union -- that union which coeval with we political existence lead we father without any other tie to unite they than those of patriotism and a common cause through a sanguinary struggle to a glorious independence that sacred union hitherto inviolate which perfect by we happy constitution have bring we by the favor of heaven to a state of prosperity at home and high consideration abroad rarely if ever equal in the history of nation : to preserve this bond of we political existence from destruction to maintain inviolate this state of national honor and prosperity and to justify the confidence my fellow-citizen have repose in I i andrew jackson president of the united state have think proper to issue this my proclamation state my view of the constitution and law applicable to the measure adopt by the convention of south carolina and to the reason they have put forth to sustain they declare the course which duty will require I to pursue and appeal to the understanding and patriotism of the people warn they of the consequence that must inevitably result from a observance of the dictate of the convention strict duty would require of I nothing more than the exercise of those power with which i be now or may hereafter be invest for preserve the peace of the union and for the execution of the law but the impose aspect which opposition have assume in this case by clothing itself with state authority and the deep interest which the people of the united state must all feel in prevent a resort to stronger measure while there be a hope that anything will be yield to reasoning and remonstrance perhaps demand and will certainly justify a full exposition to south carolina and the nation of the view i entertain of this important question as well as a distinct enunciation of the course which my sense of duty will require I to pursue the ordinance be found not on the indefeasible right of resist act which be plainly unconstitutional and too oppressive to be endure but on the strange position that any one state may not only declare a act of congress void but prohibit its execution that they may do this consistently with the constitution that the true construction of that instrument permit a state to retain its place in the union and yet be bind by no other of its law than those it may choose to consider as constitutional it be true they add that to justify this abrogation of a law it must be palpably contrary to the constitution but it be evident that to give the right of resist law of that description couple with the uncontrolled right to decide what law deserve that character be to give the power of resist all law for as by the theory there be no appeal the reason allege by the state good or bad must prevail if it should be say that public opinion be a sufficient check against the abuse of this power it may be ask why it be not deem a sufficient guard against the passage of a unconstitutional act by congress there be however a restraint in this last case which make the assumed power of a state more indefensible and which do not exist in the other there be two appeal from a unconstitutional act pass by congress -- one to the judiciary the other to the people and the state there be no appeal from the state decision in theory and the practical illustration show that the court be close against a application to review it both judge and juror be swear to decide in its favor but reasoning on this subject be superfluous when we social compact in express term declare that the law of the united state its constitution and treaty make under it be the supreme law of the land and for greater caution add that the judge in every state shall be bind thereby anything in the constitution or law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding and it may be assert without fear of refutation that no federative government could exist without a similar provision look for a moment to the consequence if south carolina consider the revenue law unconstitutional and have a right to prevent they execution in the port of charleston there would be a clear constitutional objection to they collection in every other port and no revenue could be collect anywhere for all impost must be equal it be no answer to repeat that a unconstitutional law be no law so long as the question of its legality be to be decide by the state itself for every law operating injuriously upon any local interest will be perhaps think and certainly represent as unconstitutional and as have be show there be no appeal if this doctrine have be establish at a earlier day the union would have be dissolve in its infancy the excise law in pennsylvanium the embargo and nonintercourse law in the eastern state the carriage tax in virginium be all deem unconstitutional and be more unequal in they operation than any of the law now complain of but fortunately none of those state discover that they have the right now claim by south carolina the war into which we be force to support the dignity of the nation and the rights of we citizen might have end in defeat and disgrace instead of victory and honor if the state who suppose it a ruinous and unconstitutional measure have think they possess the right of nullify the act by which it be declare and deny supplies for its prosecution hardly and unequally as those measure bear upon several member of the union to the legislature of none do this efficient and peaceable remedy as it be call suggest itself the discovery of this important feature in we constitution be reserve to the present day to the statesman of south carolina belong the invention and upon the citizen of that state will unfortunately fall the evil of reduce it to practice if the doctrine of a state veto upon the law of the union carry with it internal evidence of its impracticable absurdity we constitutional history will also afford abundant proof that it would have be repudiate with indignation have it be propose to form a feature in we government in we colonial state although dependent on another power we very early consider ourselves as connect by common interest with each other league be form for common defense and before the declaration of independence we be know in we aggregate character as _ the unite colony of america _ that decisive and important step be take jointly we declare ourselves a nation by a joint not by several act and when the term of we confederation be reduce to form it be in that of a solemn league of several state by which they agree that they would collectively form one nation for the purpose of conduct some certain domestic concern and all foreign relation in the instrument form that union be find a article which declare that every state shall abide by the determination of congress on all question which by that confederation should be submit to they under the confederation then no state could legally annul a decision of the congress or refuse to submit to its execution but no provision be make to enforce these decision congress make requisition but they be not comply with the government could not operate on individual they have no judiciary no means of collect revenue but the defect of the confederation need not be detail under its operation we could scarcely be call a nation we have neither prosperity at home nor consideration abroad this state of thing could not be endure and we present happy constitution be form but form in vain if this fatal doctrine prevail it be form for important object that be announce in the preamble make in the name and by the authority of the people of the united state whose delegate frame and whose convention approve it the most important among these object -- that which be place first in rank on which all the other rest -- be _ to form a more perfect union _ now be it possible that even if there be no express provision give supremacy to the constitution and law of the united state over those of the state can it be conceive that a instrument make for the purpose of _ form a more perfect union _ than that of the confederation could be so construct by the assemble wisdom of we country as to substitute for that confederation a form of government dependent for its existence on the local interest the party spirit of a state or of a prevail faction in a state every man of plain unsophisticated understanding who hear the question will give such a answer as will preserve the union metaphysical subtlety in pursuit of a impracticable theory could alone have devise one that be calculate to destroy it i consider then the power to annul a law of the united state assume by one state _ incompatible with the existence of the union contradict expressly by the letter of the constitution unauthorised by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it be found and destructive of the great object for which it be form _ after this general view of the lead principle we must examine the particular application of it which be make in the ordinance the preamble rest its justification on these grounds : it assume as a fact that the obnoxious law although they purport to be law for raise revenue be in reality intend for the protection of manufacture which purpose it assert to be unconstitutional that the operation of these law be unequal that the amount raise by they be greater than be require by the want of the government and finally that the proceeds be to be apply to object unauthorized by the constitution these be the only cause allege to justify a open opposition to the law of the country and a threat of secede from the union if any attempt should be make to enforce they the first virtually acknowledge that the law in question be pass under a power expressly give by the constitution to lay and collect impost but its constitutionality be draw in question from the _ motive _ of those who pass it however apparent this purpose may be in the present case nothing can be more dangerous than to admit the position that a unconstitutional purpose entertain by the member who assent to a law enact under a constitutional power shall make that law void for how be that purpose to be ascertain who be to make the scrutiny how often may bad purpose be falsely imputed in how many case be they conceal by false profession in how many be no declaration of motive make admit this doctrine and you give to the state a uncontrolled right to decide and every law may be annul under this pretext if therefore the absurd and dangerous doctrine should be admit that a state may annul a unconstitutional law or one that it deem such it will not apply to the present case the next objection be that the law in question operate unequally this objection may be make with truth to every law that have be or can be pass the wisdom of man never yet contrived a system of taxation that would operate with perfect equality if the unequal operation of a law make it unconstitutional and if all law of that description may be abrogate by any state for that cause then indeed be the federal constitution unworthy of the slightest effort for its preservation we have hitherto rely on it as the perpetual bond of we union we have receive it as the work of the assemble wisdom of the nation we have trust to it as to the sheet anchor of we safety in the stormy time of conflict with a foreign or domestic foe we have look to it with sacred awe as the palladium of we liberty and with all the solemnity of religion have pledge to each other we life and fortune here and we hope of happiness hereafter in its defense and support be we mistaken my countryman in attach this importance to the constitution of we country be we devotion pay to the wretched inefficient clumsy contrivance which this new doctrine would make it do we pledge ourselves to the support of a airy nothing -- a bubble that must be blow away by the first breath of disaffection be this self-destroying visionary theory the work of the profound statesman the exalted patriot to whom the task of constitutional reform be intrust do the name of washington sanction do the state deliberately ratify such a anomaly in the history of fundamental legislation no we be not mistake the letter of this great instrument be free from this radical fault its language directly contradict the imputation its spirit its evident intent contradict it no we do not err we constitution do not contain the absurdity of give power to make law and another to resist they the sage whose memory will always be reverence have give we a practical and as they hope a permanent constitutional compact the father of he country do not affix he revered name to so palpable a absurdity nor do the state when they severally ratify it do so under the impression that a veto on the law of the united state be reserve to they or that they could exercise it by implication search the debate in all they convention examine the speech of the most zealous opposer of federal authority look at the amendment that be propose they be all silent -- not a syllable utter not a vote give not a motion make to correct the explicit supremacy give to the law of the union over those of the state or to show that implication as be now contend could defeat it no we have not err the constitution be still the object of we reverence the bond of we union we defense in danger the source of we prosperity in peace it shall descend as we have receive it uncorrupted by sophistical construction to we posterity and the sacrifice of local interest of state prejudice of personal animosity that be make to bring it into existence will again be patriotically offer for its support the two remain objection make by the ordinance to these law be that the sum intend to be raise by they be greater than be require and that the proceeds will be unconstitutionally employ the constitution have give expressly to congress the right of raise revenue and of determine the sum the public exigency will require the state have no control over the exercise of this right other than that which result from the power of change the representative who abuse it and thus procure redress congress may undoubtedly abuse this discretionary power but the same may be say of other with which they be vested yet the discretion must exist somewhere the constitution have give it to the representative of all the people check by the representative of the state and by the executive power the south carolina construction give it to the legislature or the convention of a single state where neither the people of the different state nor the state in they separate capacity nor the chief magistrate elect by the people have any representation which be the most discreet disposition of the power i do not ask you fellow-citizen which be the constitutional disposition that instrument speak a language not to be misunderstand but if you be assemble in general convention which would you think the safest depository of this discretionary power in the last resort would you add a clause give it to each of the state or would you sanction the wise provision already make by you constitution if this should be the result of you deliberation when provide for the future be you can you be ready to risk all that we hold dear to establish for a temporary and a local purpose that which you must acknowledge to be destructive and even absurd as a general provision carry out the consequence of this right vest in the different state and you must perceive that the crisis you conduct present at this day would recur whenever any law of the united state displeased any of the state and that we should soon cease to be a nation the ordinance with the same knowledge of the future that characterize a former objection tell you that the proceeds of the tax will be unconstitutionally apply if this could be ascertain with certainty the objection would with more propriety be reserve for the law so apply the proceeds but surely can not be urge against the law levy the duty these be the allegation contain in the ordinance examine they seriously my fellow-citizen judge for yourselve i appeal to you to determine whether they be so clear so convincing as to leave no doubt of they correctness and even if you should come to this conclusion how far they justify the reckless destructive course which you be direct to pursue review these objection and the conclusion draw from they once more what be they every law then for raise revenue accord to the south carolina ordinance may be rightfully annul unless it be so frame as no law ever will or can be frame congress have a right to pass law for raise revenue and each state have a right to oppose they execution -- two rights directly oppose to each other and yet be this absurdity suppose to be contain in a instrument draw for the express purpose of avoid collision between the state and the general government by a assembly of the most enlighten statesman and purest patriot ever embody for a similar purpose in vain have these sage declare that congress shall have power to lay and collect tax duty impost and excise in vain have they provide that they shall have power to pass law which shall be necessary and proper to carry those power into execution that those law and that constitution shall be the supreme law of the land and that the judge in every state shall be bind thereby anything in the constitution or law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding in vain have the people of the several state solemnly sanction these provision make they they paramount law and individually swear to support they whenever they be call on to execute any office vain provision ineffectual restriction vile profanation of oath miserable mockery of legislation if a bare majority of the voter in any one state may on a real or suppose knowledge of the intent with which a law have be pass declare themselves free from its operation say here it give too little there too much and operate unequally here it suffer article to be free that ought to be tax there it tax those that ought to be free in this case the proceeds be intend to be apply to purpose which we do not approve in that the amount raise be more than be wanted congress it be true be invest by the constitution with the right of decide these question accord to they sound discretion congress be compose of the representative of all the state and of all the people of all the state but _ we _ part of the people of one state to whom the constitution have give no power on the subject from whom it have expressly take it away _ we _ who have solemnly agree that this constitution shall be we law _ we _ most of whom have swear to support it -- _ we _ now abrogate this law and swear and force other to swear that it shall not be obey and we do this not because congress have no right to pass such law -- this we do not allege -- but because they have pass they with improper view they be unconstitutional from the motive of those who pass they which we can never with certainty know from they unequal operation although it be impossible from the nature of thing that they should be equal and from the disposition which we presume may be make of they proceeds although that disposition have not be declare this be the plain meaning of the ordinance in relation to law which it abrogate for allege unconstitutionality but it do not stop there it repeal in express term a important part of the constitution itself and of law pass to give it effect which have never be allege to be unconstitutional the constitution declare that the judicial power of the united state extend to case arise under the law of the united state and that such law the constitution and treaty shall be paramount to the state constitution and law the judiciary act prescribe the mode by which the case may be bring before a court of the united state by appeal when a state tribunal shall decide against this provision of the constitution the ordinance declare there shall be no appeal -- make the state law paramount to the constitution and law of the united state force judge and juror to swear that they will disregard they provision and even make it penal in a suitor to attempt relief by appeal it further declare that it shall not be lawful for the authority of the united state or of that state to enforce the payment of duty impose by the revenue law within its limit here be a law of the united state not even pretend to be unconstitutional repeal by the authority of a small majority of the voter of a single state here be a provision of the constitution which be solemnly abrogate by the same authority on such exposition and reasoning the ordinance grounds not only a assertion of the right to annul the law of which it complain but to enforce it by a threat of secede from the union if any attempt be make to execute they this right to secede be deduce from the nature of the constitution which they say be a compact between sovereign state who have preserve they whole sovereignty and therefore be subject to no superior that because they make the compact they can break it when in they opinion it have be depart from by the other state fallacious as this course of reasoning be it enlist state pride and find advocate in the honest prejudice of those who have not study the nature of we government sufficiently to see the radical error on which it rest the people of the united state form the constitution act through the state legislature in make the compact to meet and discuss its provision and act in separate convention when they ratify those provision but the term use in its construction show it to be a government in which the people of all the state collectively be represent we be _ one people _ in the choice of president and vice-president here the state have no other agency than to direct the mode in which the vote shall be give the candidate have the majority of all the vote be choose the elector of a majority of state may have give they vote for one candidate and yet another may be choose the people then and not the state be represent in the executive branch in the house of representative there be this difference that the people of one state do not as in the case of president and vice-president all vote for the same officer the people of all the state do not vote for all the member each state elect only its own representative but this create no material distinction when choose they be all representative of the united state not representative of the particular state from which they come they be pay by the united state not by the state nor be they accountable to it for any act do in the performance of they legislative function and however they may in practice as it be they duty to do consult and prefer the interest of they particular constituent when they come in conflict with any other partial or local interest yet it be they first and highest duty as representative of the united state to promote the general good the constitution of the united state then form a _ government _ not a league and whether it be form by compact between the state or in any other manner its character be the same it be a government in which all the people be represent which operate directly on the people individually not upon the state they retain all the power they do not grant but each state have expressly part with so many power as to constitute jointly with the other state a single nation can not from that period possess any right to secede because such secession do not break a league but destroy the unity of a nation and any injury to that unity be not only a breach which would result from the contravention of a compact but it be a offense against the whole union to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union be to say that the united state be not a nation because it would be a solecism to contend that any part of a nation might dissolve its connection with the other part to they injury or ruin without commit any offense secession like any other revolutionary act may be morally justify by the extremity of oppression but to call it a constitutional right be confound the meaning of term and can only be do through gross error or to deceive those who be willing to assert a right but would pause before they make a revolution or incur the penalty consequent on a failure because the union be form by a compact it be say the party to that compact may when they feel themselves aggrieved depart from it but it be precisely because it be a compact that they can not a compact be a agreement or binding obligation it may by its term have a sanction or penalty for its breach or it may not if it contain no sanction it may be break with no other consequence than moral guilt if it have a sanction then the breach incur the designate or imply penalty a league between independent nation generally have no sanction other than a moral one or if it should contain a penalty as there be no common superior it can not be enforce a government on the contrary always have a sanction express or imply and in we case it be both necessarily imply and expressly give a attempt by force of arm to destroy a government be a offense by whatever mean the constitutional compact may have be form and such government have the right by the law of self-defense to pass act for punish the offender unless that right be modify restrained or resume by the constitutional act in we system although it be modify in the case of treason yet authority be expressly give to pass all law necessary to carry its power into effect and under this grant provision have be make for punish act which obstruct the due administration of the law it would seem superfluous to add anything to show the nature of that union which connect we but as erroneous opinion on this subject be the foundation of doctrine the most destructive to we peace i must give some further development to my view on this subject no one fellow-citizen have a higher reverence for the reserved rights of the state than the magistrate who now address you no one would make greater personal sacrifice or official exertion to defend they from violation but equal care must be take to prevent on they part a improper interference with or resumption of the rights they have vest in the nation the line have not be so distinctly draw as to avoid doubt in some case of the exercise of power man of the best intention and soundest view may differ in they construction of some part of the constitution but there be other on which dispassionate reflection can leave no doubt of this nature appear to be the assume right of secession it rest as we have see on the alleged undivided sovereignty of the state and on they have form in this sovereign capacity a compact which be call the constitution from which because they make it they have the right to secede both of these position be erroneous and some of the argument to prove they so have be anticipate the state severally have not retain they entire sovereignty it have be show that in become part of a nation not member of a league they surrender many of they essential part of sovereignty the right to make treaty declare war levy tax exercise exclusive judicial and legislative power be all of they function of sovereign power the state then for all these important purpose be no longer sovereign the allegiance of they citizen be transfer in the first instance to the government of the united state they become american citizen and owe obedience to the constitution of the united state and to law make in conformity with the power it vest in congress this last position have not be and can not be deny how then can that state be say to be sovereign and independent whose citizen owe obedience to law not make by it and whose magistrate be swear to disregard those law when they come in conflict with those pass by another what show conclusively that the state can not be say to have reserve a undivided sovereignty be that they expressly cede the right to punish treason -- not treason against they separate power but treason against the united state treason be a offense against _ sovereignty _ and sovereignty must reside with the power to punish it but the reserved rights of the state be not less sacred because they have for they common interest make the general government the depository of these power the unity of we political character -lrb- as have be show for another purpose -rrb- commence with its very existence under the royal government we have no separate character we opposition to its oppression begin as _ unite colony _ we be the _ unite state _ under the confederation and the name be perpetuate and the union render more perfect by the federal constitution in none of these stage do we consider ourselves in any other light than as form one nation treaty and alliance be make in the name of all troops be raise for the joint defense how then with all these proof that under all change of we position we have for designate purpose and with define power create national government how be it that the most perfect of those several mode of union should now be consider as a mere league that may be dissolve at pleasure it be from a abuse of term compact be use as synonymous with league although the true term be not employ because it would at once show the fallacy of the reasoning it would not do to say that we constitution be only a league but it be labor to prove it a compact -lrb- which in one sense it be -rrb- and then to argue that as a league be a compact every compact between nation must of course be a league and that from such a engagement every sovereign power have a right to recede but it have be show that in this sense the state be not sovereign and that even if they be and the national constitution have be form by compact there would be no right in any one state to exonerate itself from its obligation so obvious be the reason which forbid this secession that it be necessary only to allude to they the union be form for the benefit of all it be produce by mutual sacrifice of interest and opinion can those sacrifice be recall can the state who magnanimously surrender they title to the territory of the west recall the grant will the inhabitant of the inland state agree to pay the duty that may be impose without they assent by those on the atlantic or the gulf for they own benefit shall there be a free port in one state and onerous duty in another no one believe that any right exist in a single state to involve all the other in these and countless other evil contrary to engagement solemnly make everyone must see that the other state in self-defense must oppose it at all hazard these be the alternative that be present by the convention -- a repeal of all the act for raise revenue leave the government without the means of support or a acquiescence in the dissolution of we union by the secession of one of its member when the first be propose it be know that it could not be listen to for a moment it be know if force be apply to oppose the execution of the law that it must be repel by force that congress could not without involve itself in disgrace and the country in ruin accede to the proposition and yet if this be not do in a give day or if any attempt be make to execute the law the state be by the ordinance declare to be out of the union the majority of a convention assemble for the purpose have dictate these term or rather this rejection of all term in the name of the people of south carolina it be true that the governor of the state speak of the submission of they grievance to a convention of all the state which he say they sincerely and anxiously seek and desire yet this obvious and constitutional mode of obtain the sense of the other state on the construction of the federal compact and amend it if necessary have never be attempt by those who have urge the state on to this destructive measure the state might have propose the call for a general convention to the other state and congress if a sufficient number of they concur must have call it but the first magistrate of south carolina when he express a hope that on a review by congress and the functionary of the general government of the merit of the controversy such a convention will be accord to they must have know that neither congress nor any functionary of the general government have authority to call such a convention unless it be demand by two-third of the state this suggestion then be another instance of the reckless inattention to the provision of the constitution with which this crisis have be madly hurry on or of the attempt to persuade the people that a constitutional remedy have be seek and refuse if the legislature of south carolina anxiously desire a general convention to consider they complaint why have they not make application for it in the way the constitution point out the assertion that they earnestly seek it be completely negative by the omission this then be the position in which we stand : a small majority of the citizen of one state in the union have elect delegate to a state convention that convention have ordain that all the revenue law of the united state must be repeal or that they be no longer a member of the union the governor of that state have recommend to the legislature the raising of a army to carry the secession into effect and that he may be empower to give clearance to vessel in the name of the state no act of violent opposition to the law have yet be commit but such a state of thing be hourly apprehend and it be the intent of this instrument to _ proclaim _ not only that the duty impose on I by the constitution to take care that the law be faithfully execute shall be perform to the extent of the power already vest in I by law or of such other as the wisdom of congress shall devise and intrust to I for that purpose but to warn the citizen of south carolina who have be delude into a opposition to the law of the danger they will incur by obedience to the illegal and disorganizing ordinance of the convention to exhort those who have refuse to support it to persevere in they determination to uphold the constitution and law of they country and to point out to all the perilous situation into which the good people of that state have be lead and that the course they be urge to pursue be one of ruin and disgrace to the very state whose rights they affect to support fellow-citizen of _ my _ native state let I not only admonish you as the first magistrate of we common country not to incur the penalty of its law but use the influence that a father would over he child whom he see rush to certain ruin in that paternal language with that paternal feeling let I tell you my countryman that you be delude by man who be either deceive themselves or wish to deceive you mark under what pretens you have be lead on to the brink of insurrection and treason on which you stand first a diminution of the value of you staple commodity lower by overproduction in other quarter and the consequent diminution in the value of you land be the sole effect of the tariff law the effect of those law be confessedly injurious but the evil be greatly exaggerate by the unfounded theory you be teach to believe -- that its burthen be in proportion to you export not to you consumption of import article you pride be rouse by the assertion that a submission to those law be a state of vassalage and that resistance to they be equal in patriotic merit to the opposition we father offer to the oppressive law of great britain you be tell that this opposition might be peaceably might be constitutionally make that you might enjoy all the advantage of the union and bear none of its burthen eloquent appeal to you passion to you state pride to you native courage to you sense of real injury be use to prepare you for the period when the mask which conceal the hideous feature of _ disunion _ should be take off it fall and you be make to look with complacency on object which not long since you would have regard with horror look back to the art which have bring you to this state look forward to the consequence to which it must inevitably lead look back to what be first tell you as a inducement to enter into this dangerous course the great political truth be repeat to you that you have the revolutionary right of resist all law that be palpably unconstitutional and intolerably oppressive it be add that the right to nullify a law rest on the same principle but that it be a peaceable remedy this character which be give to it make you receive with too much confidence the assertion that be make of the unconstitutionally of the law and its oppressive effect mark my fellow-citizen that by the admission of you leader the unconstitutionality must be _ palpable _ or it will not justify either resistance or nullification what be the meaning of the word _ palpable _ in the sense in which it be here use that which be apparent to everyone that which no man of ordinary intellect will fail to perceive be the unconstitutionality of these law of that description let those among you leader who once approve and advocate the principle of protective duty answer the question and let they choose whether they will be consider as incapable then of perceive that which must have be apparent to every man of common understanding or as impose upon you confidence and endeavor to mislead you now in either case they be unsafe guide in the perilous path they urge you to tread ponder well on this circumstance and you will know how to appreciate the exaggerated language they address to you they be not champion of liberty emulate the fame of we revolutionary father nor be you a oppressed people contend as they repeat to you against worse than colonial vassalage you be free member of a flourish and happy union there be no settled design to oppress you you have indeed feel the unequal operation of law which may have be unwisely not unconstitutionally pass but that inequality must necessarily be remove at the very moment when you be madly urge on to the unfortunate course you have begin a change in public opinion have commence the nearly approach payment of the public debt and the consequent necessity of a diminution of duty have already produce a considerable reduction and that too on some article of general consumption in you state the importance of this change be underrated and you be authoritatively tell that no further alleviation of you burthen be to be expect at the very time when the condition of the country imperiously demand such a modification of the duty as should reduce they to a just and equitable scale but as if apprehensive of the effect of this change in allay you discontent you be precipitate into the fearful state in which you now find yourselve i have urge you to look back to the means that be use to hurry you on to the position you have now assume and forward to the consequence it will produce something more be necessary contemplate the condition of that country of which you still form a important part consider its government unite in one bond of common interest and general protection so many different state give to all they inhabitant the proud title of _ american citizen _ protect they commerce secure they literature and they art facilitate they intercommunication defend they frontier and make they name respect in the remotest part of the earth consider the extent of its territory its increase and happy population its advance in art which render life agreeable and the science which elevate the mind see education spread the light of religion morality and general information into every cottage in this wide extent of we territory and state behold it as the asylum where the wretched and the oppressed find a refuge and support look on this picture of happiness and honor and say _ we too be citizen of america _ carolina be one of these proud state she arm have defend she best blood have cement this happy union and then add if you can without horror and remorse this happy union we will dissolve this picture of peace and prosperity we will deface this free intercourse we will interrupt these fertile field we will deluge with blood the protection of that glorious flag we renounce the very name of american we discard and for what mistake man for what do you throw away these inestimable blessing for what would you exchange you share in the advantage and honor of the union for the dream of a separate independence -- a dream interrupt by bloody conflict with you neighbor and a vile dependence on a foreign power if you leader could succeed in establish a separation what would be you situation be you unite at home be you free from the apprehension of civil discord with all its fearful consequence do we neighboring republic every day suffer some new revolution or contend with some new insurrection do they excite you envy but the dictate of a high duty oblige I solemnly to announce that you can not succeed the law of the united state must be execute i have no discretionary power on the subject my duty be emphatically pronounce in the constitution those who tell you that you might peaceably prevent they execution deceive you they could not have be deceive themselves they know that a forcible opposition could alone prevent the execution of the law and they know that such opposition must be repel they object be disunion but be not deceive by name disunion by armed force be _ treason _ be you really ready to incur its guilt if you be on the head of the instigator of the act be the dreadful consequence on they head be the dishonor but on yours may fall the punishment on you unhappy state will inevitably fall all the evil of the conflict you force upon the government of you country it can not accede to the mad project of disunion of which you would be the first victim its first magistrate can not if he would avoid the performance of he duty the consequence must be fearful for you distressing to you fellow-citizen here and to the friend of good government throughout the world its enemy have behold we prosperity with a vexation they could not conceal it be a standing refutation of they slavish doctrine and they will point to we discord with the triumph of malignant joy it be yet in you power to disappoint they there be yet time to show that the descendant of the pinckney the sumpter the rutledge and of the thousand other name which adorn the page of you revolutionary history will not abandon that union to support which so many of they fight and bleed and die i adjure you as you honor they memory as you love the cause of freedom to which they dedicate they life as you prize the peace of you country the life of its best citizen and you own fair fame to retrace you step snatch from the archive of you state the disorganize edict of its convention bid its member to reassemble and promulgate the decide expression of you will to remain in the path which alone can conduct you to safety prosperity and honor tell they that compare to disunion all other evil be light because that bring with it a accumulation of all declare that you will never take the field unless the star-spangled banner of you country shall float over you that you will not be stigmatize when dead and dishonored and scorn while you live as the author of the first attack on the constitution of you country its destroyer you can not be you may disturb its peace you may interrupt the course of its prosperity you may cloud its reputation for stability but its tranquillity will be restore its prosperity will return and the stain upon its national character will be transfer and remain a eternal blot on the memory of those who cause the disorder fellow-citizen of the united state the threat of unhallowed disunion the name of those once respect by whom it be utter the array of military force to support it denote the approach of a crisis in we affair on which the continuance of we unexampled prosperity we political existence and perhaps that of all free government may depend the conjuncture demand a free a full and explicit enunciation not only of my intention but of my principle of action and as the claim be assert of a right by a state to annul the law of the union and even to secede from it at pleasure a frank exposition of my opinion in relation to the origin and form of we government and the construction i give to the instrument by which it be create seem to be proper have the fullest confidence in the justness of the legal and constitutional opinion of my duty which have be express i rely with equal confidence on you undivided support in my determination to execute the law to preserve the union by all constitutional means to arrest if possible by moderate and firm measure the necessity of a recourse to force and if it be the will of heaven that the recurrence of its primeval curse on man for the shed of a brother 's blood should fall upon we land that it be not call down by any offensive act on the part of the united state fellow-citizen the momentous case be before you on you undivided support of you government depend the decision of the great question it involve -- whether you sacred union will be preserve and the blessing it secure to we as one people shall be perpetuate no one can doubt that the unanimity with which that decision will be express will be such as to inspire new confidence in republican institution and that the prudence the wisdom and the courage which it will bring to they defense will transmit they unimpaired and invigorated to we child may the great ruler of nation grant that the signal blessing with which he have favor ours may not by the madness of party or personal ambition be disregard and lose and may he wise providence bring those who have produce this crisis to see the folly before they feel the misery of civil strife and inspire a return
