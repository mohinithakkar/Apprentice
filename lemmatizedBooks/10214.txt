produce by jake jaqua introduction to the philosophy and writings of plato by thoma taylor philosophy say hierocle be the purification and perfection of human life it be the purification indeed from material irrationality and the mortal body but the perfection in consequence of be the resumption of we proper felicity and a reascent to the divine likeness to effect these two be the province of virtue and truth the former exterminate the immoderation of the passion and the latter introduce the divine form to those who be naturally adapt to its reception of philosophy thus define which may be compare to a luminous pyramid terminate in deity and have for its basis the rational soul of man and its spontaneous unperverted conception -- of this philosophy August magnificent and divine plato may be justly call the primary leader and hierophant through whom like the mystic light in the inmost recess of some sacred temple it first shine forth with occult and venerable splendor -lrb- 1 -rrb- it may indeed be truly say of the whole of this philosophy that it be the greatest good which man can participate : for if it purify we from the defilement of the passion and assimilate we to divinity it confer on we the proper felicity of we nature hence it be easy to collect its pre-eminence to all other philosophy to show that where they oppose it they be erroneous that so far as they contain any thing scientific they be ally to it and that at best they be but rivulet derive from this vast ocean of truth ------------------ -lrb- 1 -rrb- in the mystery a light of this kind shone forth from the adytum of the temple in which they be exhibit ------------------ to evince that the philosophy of plato possess this preeminence that its dignity and sublimity be unrivaled that it be the parent of all that ennoble man and that it be found on principle which neither time can obliterate nor sophistry subvert be the principal design of this introduction to effect this design i shall in the first place present the reader with the outline of the principal dogma of plato 's philosophy the undertaking be indeed no less novel than arduous since the author of it have to tread in path which have be untrodden for upward of a thousand year and to bring to light truth which for that extended period have be conceal in greek let not the reader therefore be surprise at the solitariness of the path through which i shall attempt to conduct he or at the novelty of the object which will present themselves in the journey : for perhaps he may fortunately recollect that he have travel the same road before that the scene be once familiar to he and that the country through which he be pass be he native land at least if he sight should be dim and he memory oblivious -lrb- for the object which he will meet with can only be see by the most piercing eye -rrb- and he absence from they have be lamentably long let he implore the power of wisdom from mortal mist to purify he eye that god and man he may distinctly see let we also implore the assistance of the same illuminating power begin the solitary journey of all the dogma of plato that concern the first principle of thing as far transcend in sublimity the doctrine of other philosopher of a different sect on this subject as this supreme cause of all transcend other cause for accord to plato the highest god whom in the republic he call the good and in the parmenide the one be not only above soul and intellect but be even superior to be itself hence since every thing which can in any respect be know or of which any thing can be assert must be connect with the universality of thing but the first cause be above all thing it be very properly say by plato to be perfectly ineffable the first hypothesis therefore of he parmenide in which all thing be deny of this immense principle conclude as follow : the one therefore be in no respect so it seem hence it be not in such a manner as to be one for thus it would be be and participate of essence but as it appear the one neither be one nor be if it be proper to believe in reasoning of this kind it appear so but can any thing either belong to or be affirm of that which be not how can it neither therefore do any name belong to it nor discourse nor any science nor sense nor opinion it do not appear that there can hence it can neither be name nor speak of nor conceive by opinion nor be know nor perceive by any be so it seem and here it must be observe that this conclusion respect the highest principle of thing that he be perfectly ineffable and inconceivable be the result of a most scientific series of negation in which not only all sensible and intellectual being be deny of he but even nature the most transcendently ally to he he first and most divine progeny for that which so eminently distinguish the philosophy of plato from other be this that every part of it be stamp with the character of science the vulgar indeed proclaim the deity to be ineffable but as they have no scientific knowledge that he be so this be nothing more than a confused and indistinct perception of the most sublime of all truth like that of a thing see between sleep and wake like phaeacium to ulyss when sail to he native land that lay before he indistinct and vast like a broad shield amid the watr ' y waste in short a unscientific perception of the ineffable nature of the divinity resemble that of a man who on survey the heaven should assert of the altitude of its highest part that it surpass that of the loftiest tree and be therefore immeasurable but to see this scientifically be like a survey of this highest part of the heaven by the astronomer for he by know the height of the media between we and it know also scientifically that it transcend in altitude not only the loftiest tree but the summit of air and aether the moon and even the sun itself let we therefore investigate what be the ascent to the ineffably and after what manner it be accomplish accord to plato from the last of thing follow the profound and most inquisitive damascius as we leader in this arduous investigation let we discourse also be common to other principle and to thing proceed from they to that which be last and let we begin from that which be perfectly effable and know to sense ascend too the ineffable and establish in silence as in a port the parturition of truth concern it let we then assume the follow axiom in which as in a secure vehicle we may safely pass from hence thither i say therefore that the unindigent be naturally prior to the indigent for that which be in want of another be naturally adapt from necessity to be subservient to that of which it be indigent but if they be mutually in want of each other each be indigent of the other in a different respect neither of they will be the principle for the unindigent be most adapt to that which be truly the principle and if it be in want of any thing accord to this it will not be the principle it be however necessary that the principle should be this very thing the principle alone the unindigent therefore pertain to this nor must it by any means be acknowledge that there be any thing prior to it this however would be acknowledge if it have any connection with the indigent let we then consider body -lrb- that be a triply extend substance -rrb- endue with quality for this be the first thing effable by we and be sensible be this then the principle of thing but it be two thing body and quality which be in body as a subject which of these therefore be by nature prior for both be indigent of they proper part and that also which be in a subject be indigent of the subject shall we say then that body itself be the principle of the first essence but this be impossible for in the first place the principle will not receive any thing from that which be posterior to itself but body we say be the recipient of quality hence quality and a subsistence in conjunction with it be not derive from body since quality be present with body as something different and in the second place body be every way divisible its several part be indigent of each other and the whole be indigent of all the part as it be indigent therefore and receive its completion from thing which be indigent it will not be entirely unindigent further still if it be not one but unite it will require as plato say the connect one it be likewise something common and formless be as it be a certain matter it require therefore ornament and the possession of form that it may not be merely body but a body with a certain particular quality as for instance a fiery or earthly body and in short body adorn and invest with a particular quality hence the thing which accede to it finish and adorn it be then that which accede the principle but this be impossible for it do not abide in itself nor do it subsist alone but be in a subject of which also it be indigent if however some one should assert that body be not a subject but one of the element in each as for instance animal in horse and man thus also each will be indigent of the other viz this subject and that which be in the subject or rather the common element animal and the peculiarity as the rational and irrational will be indigent for element be always indigent of each other and that which be compose from element be indigent of the element in short this sensible nature and which be so manifest to we be neither body for this do not of itself move the sens nor quality for this do not possess a interval commensurate with sense hence that which be the object of sight be neither body nor color but color body or color corporalize be that which be motive of the sight and universally that which its sensible which be body with a particular quality be motive of sense from hence it be evident that the thing which excite the sense be something incorporeal for if it be body it would not yet be the object of sense body therefore require that which be incorporeal and that which be incorporeal body for a incorporeal nature be not of itself sensible it be however different from body because these two possess prerogative different from each other and neither of these subsist prior to the other but be element of one sensible thing they be present with each other the one impart interval to that which be void of interval but the other introduce to that which be formless sensible variety invest with form in the third place neither be both these together the principle since they be not unindigent for they stand in need of they proper element and of that which conduct they to the generation of one form for body can not effect this since it be of itself impotent nor quality since it be not able to subsist separate from the body in which it be or together with which it have its be the composite therefore either produce itself which be impossible for it do not converge to itself but the whole of it be multifariously disperse or it be not produce by itself and there be some other principle prior to it let it then be suppose to be that which be call nature be a principle of motion and rest in that which be move and at rest essentially and not accord to accident for this be something more simple and be fabricative of composite form if however it be in the thing fabricate and do not subsist separate from nor prior to they but stand in need of they for its be it will not be unindigent though its possess something transcendent with respect to they viz the power of fashion and fabricate they for it have its be together with they and have in they a inseparable subsistence so that when they be it be and be not when they be not and this in consequence of perfectly verge to they and not be able to sustain that which be appropriate for the power of increase nourishing and generate similar and the one prior to these three viz nature be not wholly incorporeal but be nearly a certain quality of body from which it alone differ in that it impart to the composite to be inwardly move and at rest for the quality of that which be sensible impart that which be apparent in matter and that which fall on sense but body impart interval every way extend and nature a inwardly proceed natural energy whether accord to place only or accord to nourishing increase and generate thing similar nature however be inseparable from a subject and be indigent so that it will not be in short the principle since it be indigent of that which be subordinate for it will not be wonderful if be a certain principle it be indigent of the principle above it but it would be wonderful if it be indigent of thing posterior to itself and of which it be suppose to be the principle by the like argument we may show that the principle can not be irrational soul whether sensitive or orectic for if it appear that it have something separate together with impulsive and gnostic enemy yet at the same time it be bind in body and have something inseparable from it since it be notable to convert itself to itself but its enemy be mingle with its subject for it be evident that its essence be something of this kind since if it be liberate and in itself free it would also evince a certain independent enemy and would not always be convert to body but sometimes it would be convert to itself or though it be always convert to body yet it would judge and explore itself the energy therefore of the multitude of mankind -lrb- though they be conversant with externals -rrb- yet at the same time they exhibit that which be separate about they for they consult how they should engage in they and observe that deliberation be necessary in order to effect or be passive to apparent good or to decline something of the contrary but the impulse of other animal be uniform and spontaneous be move together with the sensible organ and require the sens alone that they may obtain from sensible the pleasurable and avoid the painful if therefore the body communicate in pleasure and pain and be affect in a certain respect by they it be evident that the psychical energy -lrb- ie energy belong to the soul -rrb- be exert mingled with body and be not purely psychical but be also corporeal for perception be of the animated body or of the soul corporalize though in such perception the psychical idiom predominate over the corporeal just as in body the corporeal idiom have dominion accord to interval and subsistence as the irrational soul therefore have its be in something different from itself so far it be indigent of the subordinate : but a thing of this kind will not be the principle prior they to this essence we see a certain form separate from a subject and convert to itself such as be the rational nature we soul therefore preside over its proper energy and correct itself this however would not be the case unless it be convert to itself and it would not be convert to itself unless it have a separate essence it be not therefore indigent of the subordinate shall we then say that it be the most perfect principle but it do not at once exert all its energy but be always indigent of the greater part the principle however wish to have nothing indigent : but the rational nature be a essence in want of its own energy some one however may say that it be a eternal essence and have never-failing essential energy always concur with its essence accord to the self-moved and ever vital and that it be therefore unindigent but the principle be perfectly unindigent soul therefore and which exert mutable energy will not be the most proper principle hence it be necessary that there should be something prior to this which be in every respect immutable accord to nature life and knowledge and accord to all power and enemy such as we assert a eternal and immutable essence to be and such as be much honor intellect to which aristotle have ascend think he have discover the first principle for what can be want to that which perfectly comprehend in itself its own plenitude -lrb- oleroma -rrb- and of which neither addition nor ablation change any thing belong to it or be not this also one and many whole and part contain in itself thing first middle and last the subordinate plenitude also stand in need of the more excellent and the more excellent of the subordinate and the whole of the part for the thing relate be indigent of each other and what be first of what be last through the same cause for it be not of itself that which be first besides the one here be indigent of the many because it have its subsistence in the many or it may be say that this one be collective of the many and this not by itself but in conjunction with they hence there be much of the indigent in this principle for since intellect generate in itself its proper plenitude from which the whole at once receive its completion it will be itself indigent of itself not only that which be generate of that which generate but also that which generate of that which be generate in order to the whole completion of that which wholly generate itself further still intellect understand and be understand be intellective of and intelligible to itself and both these hence the intellectual be indigent of the intelligible as of its proper object of desire and the intelligible be in want of the intellectual because it wish to be the intelligible of it both also be indigent of either since the possession be always accompany with indigence in the same manner as the world be always present with matter hence a certain indigence be naturally coessentiallize with intellect so that it can not be the most proper principle shall we therefore in the next place direct we attention to the most simple of being which plato call the one being -lrb- greek : en on -rrb- for as there be no separation there throughout the whole nor any multitude or order or duplicity or conversion to itself what indigence will there appear to I in the perfectly unite and especially what indigence will there be of that which be subordinate hence the great parmenide ascend to this most safe principle as that which be most unindigent be it not however here necessary to attend to the conception of plato that the unite be not the one itself but that which be passive -lrb- 2 -rrb- to it and this be the case it be evident that it rank after the one for it be suppose to be the unite and not the one itself if also be be compose from the element bind and infinity as appear from the philebus of plato where he call it that which be mixt it will be indigent of its element besides if the conception of be be different from that of be unite and that which be a whole be both unite and be these will be indigent of each other and the whole which be call one be be indigent of the two and though the one in this be better than be yet this be indigent of be in order to the subsistence of one be but if be here supervene the one as it be form in that which be mixt and unite just as the idiom of man in that which be collectively rational-mortal-animal thus also the one will be indigent of be if however to speak more properly the one be two-fold this be the cause of the mixture and subsist prior to be but that confer rectitude on be -- if this be the case neither will the indigent perfectly desert this nature after all these it may be say that the one will be perfectly unindigent for neither be it indigent of that which be posterior to itself for its subsistence since the truly one be by itself separate from all thing nor be it indigent of that which be inferior or more excellent in itself for there be nothing in it besides itself nor be it in want of itself but it be one because neither have it any duplicity with respect to itself for not even the relation of itself to itself must be assert of the truly one since it be perfectly simple this therefore be the most unindigent of all thing hence this be the principle and the cause of all and this be at once the first of all thing if these quality however be present with it it will not be the one or may we not say that all thing subsist in the one accord to the one and that both these subsist in it and such other thing as we predicate of it as for instance the most simple the most excellent the most powerful the preserver of all thing and the good itself if these thing however be thus true of the one it will thus also be indigent of thing posterior to itself accord to those very thing which we add to it for the principle be and be say to be the principle of thing proceed from it and the cause be the cause of thing cause and the first be the first of thing arrange posterior to it -lrb- 3 -rrb- ------------------ -lrb- 2 -rrb- see the sophista of plato where this be assert -lrb- 3 -rrb- for a thing can not be say to be a principle or cause without the subsistence of the thing of which it be the principle or cause hence so far as it be a principle or cause it will be indigent of the subsistence of these ------------------ further still the simple subsist accord to a transcendency of other thing the most powerful accord to power with relation to the subject of it and the good the desirable and the preserving be so call with reference to thing benefit preserved and desire and if it should be say to be all thing accord to the preassumption of all thing in itself it will indeed be say to be so accord to the one alone and will at the same time be the one cause of all thing prior to all and will be thus and no other accord to the one so far therefore as it be the one alone it will be unindigent but so far as unindigent it will be the first principle and stable root of all principle so far however as it be the principle and the first cause of all thing and be pre-established as the object of desire to all thing so far it appear to be in a certain respect indigent of the thing to which it be related it have therefore if it be lawful so to speak a ultimate vestige of indigence just as on the contrary matter have a ultimate echo of the unindigent or a most obscure and debile impression of the one and language indeed appear to be here subvert for so far as it be the one it be also unindigent since the principle have appear to subsist accord to the most unindigent and the one at the same time however so far as it be the one it be also the principle and so far as it be the one it be unindigent but so far as the principle indigent hence so far as it be unindigent it be also indigent though not accord to the same but with respect to be that which it be it be undigent but as produce and comprehend other thing in itself it be indigent this however be the peculiarity of the one so that it be both unindigent and indigent accord to the one not indeed than it be each of these in such a manner as we divide it in speaking of it but it be one alone and accord to this be both other thing and that which be indigent for how be it possible it should not be indigent also so far as it be the one just as it be all other thing which proceed from it for the indigent also be something belong to all thing something else therefore must be investigate which in no respect have any kind of indigence but of a thing of this kind it can not with truth be assert that it be the principle nor can it even be say of it that it be most unindigent though this appear to be the most venerable of all assertion -lrb- 4 -rrb- --------------- -lrb- 4 -rrb- see the extract from damascius in the additional note to the third volume which contain a inestimable treasury of the most profound conception concern the ineffable ------------------ for this signify transcendency and a exemption from the indigent we do not however think it proper to call this even the perfectly exempt but that which be in every respect incapable of be apprehend and about which we must be perfectly silent will be the most just axiom of we conception in the present investigation nor yet this as utter any thing but as rejoice in not utter and by this venerate that immense unknown this then be the mode of ascent to that which be call the first or rather to that which be beyond every thing which can be conceive or become the subject of hypothesis there be also another mode which do not place the unindigent before the indigent but consider that which be indigent of a more excellent nature as subsist secondary to that which be more excellent every where then that which be in capacity be secondary to that which be in energy for that it may proceed into energy and that it may not remain in capacity in vain it require that which be in energy for the more excellent never blossom from the subordinate nature let this then be define by we accord to common unperverted conception matter therefore have prior to itself material form because all matter be form in capacity whether it be the first matter which be perfectly formless or the second which subsist accord to body void of quality or in other word mere triple extension to which it be likely those direct they attention who first investigate sensible and which at first appear to be the only thing that have a subsistence for the existence of that which be common in the different element persuade they that there be a certain body void of quality but since among body of this kind some possess the govern principle inwardly and other externally such as thing artificial it be necessary besides quality to direct we attention to nature as be something better than quality and which be prearrange in the order of cause as art be of thing artificial of thing however which be inwardly govern some appear to possess be alone but other to be nourish and increase and to generate thing similar to themselves there be therefore another certain cause prior to the above-mentioned nature viz a vegetable power itself but it be evident that all such thing as be ingenerate in body as in a subject be of themselves incorporeal though they become corporeal by the participation of that in which they subsist so that they be say to be and be material in consequence of what they suffer from matter quality therefore and still more nature and in a still greater degree the vegetable life preserve the incorporeal in themselves since however sense exhibit another more conspicuous life pertain to being which be move accord to impulse and place this must be establish prior to that as be a more proper principle and as the supplier of a certain better form that of a self-moved animal and which naturally precede plant root in the earth the animal however be not accurately self-moved for the whole be not such throughout they whole but a part move and a part be move this therefore be the apparent self-moved hence prior to this it be necessary there should be that which be truly self-moved and which accord to the whole of itself move and be move that the apparently self-moved may be the image of this and indeed the soul which move the body must be consider as a more proper self-moved essence this however be twofold the one rational the other irrational for that there be a rational soul be evident : or have not every one a cosensation of himself more clear or more obscure when convert to himself in the attention to and investigation of himself and in the vital and gnostic animadversion of himself for the essence which be capable of this and which can collect universal by reasoning will very justly be rational the irrational soul also though it do not appear to investigate these thing and to reason with itself yet at the same time it move body from place to place be itself previously move from itself for at different time it exert a different impulse do it therefore move itself from one impulse to another or it be move by something else as for instance by the whole rational soul in the universe but it would be absurd to say that the energy of every irrational soul be not the energy of that soul but of one more divine since they be infinite and mingled with much of the base and imperfect for this would be just the same as to say that the irrational enemy be the energy of the rational soul i omit to mention the absurdity of suppose that the whole essence be not generative of its proper energy for if the irrational soul be a certain essence it will have peculiar energy of its own not impart from something else but proceed from itself this irrational soul therefore will also move itself at different time to different impulse but if it move itself it will be convert to itself if however this be the case it will have a separate subsistence and will not be in a subject it be therefore rational if it look to itself : for in be convert to it survey itself for when extend to thing external it look to externals or rather it look to color body but do not see itself because sight itself be neither body nor that which be color hence it do not revert to itself neither therefore be this the case with any other irrational nature for neither do the phantasy project a type of itself but of that which be sensible as for instance of color body nor do irrational appetite desire itself but aspire after a certain object of desire such as honor or pleasure or riches it do not therefore move itself but if some one on see that brute exert rational energy should apprehend that these also participate of the first self-moved and on this account possess a soul convert to itself it may perhaps be grant to he that these also be rational nature except that they be not so essentially but accord to participation and this most obscure just as the rational soul may be say to be intellectual accord to participation as always project common conception without distortion it must however be observe that the extreme be that which be capable of be perfectly separated such as the rational form and that which be perfectly inseparable such as corporeal quality and that in the middle of these nature subsist which verge to the inseparable have a small representation of the separable and the irrational soul which verge to the separable or it appear in a certain respect to subsist by itself separate from a subject so that it become doubtful whether it be self-motive or alter-motive for it contain a abundant vestige of self-motion but not that which be true and convert to itself and on this account perfectly separate from a subject and the vegetable soul have in a certain respect a middle subsistence on this account to some of the ancient it appear to be a certain soul but to other nature again therefore that we may return to the propose object of investigation how can a self-motive nature of this kind which be mingle with the alter-motive be the first principle of thing for it neither subsist from itself nor do it in reality perfect itself but it require a certain other nature both for its subsistence and perfection : and prior to it be that which be truly self-moved be therefore that which be properly self-move the principle and be it indigent of no form more excellent than itself or be not that which move always naturally prior to that which be move and in short do not every form which be pure from its contrary subsist by itself prior to that which be mingle with it and be not the pure the cause of the commingle for that which be coessentialize with another have also a energy mingle with that other so that a self-moved nature will indeed make itself but thus subsist it will be at the same time move and move but will not be make a move nature only for neither be it this alone every form however be always alone accord to its first subsistence so that there will be that which move only without be move and indeed it would be absurd that there should be that which be move only such as body but that prior both to that which be self-moved and that which be move only there should not be that which move only for it be evident that there must be since this will be a more excellent nature and that which be self-moved so far as it move itself be more excellent than so far as it be move it be necessary therefore that the essence which move unmoved should be first as that which be move not be motive be the third in the middle of which be the self-moved which we say require that which move in order to its become motive in short if it be move it will not abide so far as it be move and if it move it be necessary it should remain move so far as it move whence then do it derive the power of abide for from itself it derive the power either of be move only or of at the same time abide and be move wholly accord to the same whence then do it simply obtain the power of abide certainly from that which simply abide but this be a immovable cause we must therefore admit that the immovable be prior to the self move let we consider then if the immovable be the most proper principle but how be this possible for the immovable contain as numerous a multitude immovably as the self-moved self-moveably besides a immovable separation must necessarily subsist prior to a self-moveable separation the unmoved therefore be at the same time one and many and be at the same time unite and separate and a nature of this kind be denominate intellect but it be evident that the unite in this be naturally prior to and more honorable than the separate for separation be always indigent of union but not on the contrary union of separation intellect however have not the unite pure from its opposite for intellectual form be coessentialize with the separate through the whole of itself hence that which be in a certain respect unite require that which be simply unite and that which subsist with another be indigent of that which subsist by itself and that which subsist accord to participation of that which subsist accord to essence for intellect be self-subsistent produce itself as unite and at the same time separated hence it subsist accord to both these it be produce therefore from that which be simply unite and alone unite prior therefore to that which be formal be the uncircumscribed and undistributed into form and this be that which we call the unite and which the wise man of antiquity denominate be possess in one contraction multitude subsist prior to the many have therefore arrive thus far let we here rest for a while and consider with ourselves whether be be the investigate principle of all thing for what will there be which do not participate of be may we not say that this if it be the unite will be secondary to the one and that by participate of the one it become the united but in short if we conceive the one to be something different from be if be be prior to the one it will not participate of the one it will therefore be many only and these will be infinitely infinite but if the one be with be and be with the one and they be either coordinate or divide from each other there will be two principle and the above-mentioned absurdity will happen or they will mutually participate of each other and there will be two element or they be part of something else consist from both and if this be the case what will that be which lead they to union with each other for if the one unite be to itself -lrb- for this may be say -rrb- the one also will energize prior to be that it may call forth and convert be to itself the one therefore will subsist from itself self-perfect prior to be further still the more simple be always prior to the more composite if therefore they be similarly simple there will either be two principle or one from the two and this will be a composite hence the simple and perfectly incomposite be prior to this which must be either one or not one and if not one it must either be many or nothing but with respect to nothing if it signify that which be perfectly void it will signify something vain but if it signify the arcane this will not even be that which be simple in short we can not conceive any principle more simple than the one the one therefore be in every respect prior to be hence this be the principle of all thing and plato recur to this do not require any other principle in he reasoning for the arcane in which this we ascent terminate be not the principle of reasoning nor of knowledge nor of animal nor of being nor of unity but simply of all thing be arrange above every conception and suspicion that we can frame hence plato indicate nothing concern it but make he negation of all other thing except the one from the one for that the one be he deny in the last place but he do not make a negation of the one he also besides this even deny this negation but not the one he deny too name and conception and all knowledge and what can be say more whole itself and every be but let there be the unite and the unical and if you will the two principle bind and the infinite plato however never in any respect make a negation of the one which be beyond all these hence in the sophista he consider it as the one prior to be and in the republic as the good beyond every essence but at the same time the one alone be leave whether however be it known and effable or unknown and ineffable or be it in a certain respect these and in a certain respect not for by a negation of this it may be say the ineffable be affirm and again by the simplicity of knowledge it will be know or suspect but by composition perfectly unknown hence neither will it be apprehend by negation and in short so far as it be admit to be one so far it will be coarrange with other thing which be the subject of position for it be the summit of thing which subsist accord to position at the same time there be much in it of the ineffable and unknown the uncoordinated and that which be deprive of position but these be accompany with a representation of the contrary : and the former be more excellent than the latter but every where thing pure subsist prior to they contrary and such as be unmingled to the commingle for either thing more excellent subsist in the one essentially and in a certain respect the contrary of these also will be there at the same time or they subsist accord to participation and be derive from that which be first a thing of this kind prior to the one therefore be that which be simply and perfectly ineffable without position uncoordinated and incapable of be apprehend to which also the ascent of the present discourse hasten through the clearest indication omit none of those nature between the first and the last of thing such then be the ascent to the highest god accord to the theology of plato venerably preserve he ineffable exemption from all thing and he transcendency which can not be circumscribe by any gnostic energy and at the same time unfold the path which lead upward to he and enkindle that luminous summit of the soul by which she be conjoin with the incomprehensible one from this truly ineffable principle exempt from all essence power and energy a multitude of divine nature accord to plato immediately proceed that this must necessarily be the case will be admit by the reader who understand what have be already discuss and be fully demonstrate by plato in the parmenide as will be evident to the intelligent from the note on that dialogue in addition therefore to what i have staid on this subject i shall further observe at present that this doctrine which be found in the sublimest and most scientific conception of the human mind may be clearly show to be a legitimate dogma of plato from what be assert by he in the sixth book of he republic for he there affirm in the most clear and unequivocal term that the good or the ineffable principle of thing be superessential and show by the analogy of the sun to the good that what light and sight be in the visible that truth and intelligence be in the intelligible world as light therefore immediately proceed from the sun and wholly subsist accord to a solar idiom or property so truth or the immediate progeny of the good must subsist accord to a superessential idiom and as the good accord to plato be the same with the one as be evident from the parmenide the immediate progeny of the one will be the same as that of the good but the immediate offspring of the one can not be any thing else than unity and hence we necessarily infer that accord to plato the immediate offspring of the ineffable principle of thing be superessential unity they differ however from they immense principle in this that he be superessential and ineffable without any addition but this divine multitude be participate by the several order of be which be suspend from and produce by it hence in consequence of be connect with multitude through this participation they be necessarily subordinate to the one no less admirably therefore than platonically do simplicius in he commentary of epictetus observe on this subject as follow : the fountain and principle of all thing be the good : for that which all thing desire and to which all thing be extend be the principle and the end of all thing the good also produce from itself all thing first middle and last but it produce such as be first and proximate to itself similar to itself one goodness many goodness one simplicity and unity which transcend all other many unity and one principle many principle for the one the principle the good and deity be the same : for deity be the first and the cause of all thing but it be necessary that the first should also be most simple since whatever be a composite and have multitude be posterior to the one and multitude and thing which be not good desire the good as be above they : and in short that which be not itself the principle be from the principle but it be also necessary that the principle of all thing should possess the highest and all power for the amplitude of power consist in produce all thing from itself and in give subsistence to similar prior to thing which be dissimilar hence the one principle produce many principle many simplicity and many goodness proximately from itself for since all thing differ from each other and be multiply with they proper difference each of these multitude be suspend from its one proper principle thus for instance all beautiful thing whatever and wherever they may be whether in soul or in body be suspend from one fountain of beauty thus too whatever possess symmetry and whatever be true and all principle be in a certain respect connate with the first principle so far as they be principle and fountain and goodness with a appropriate subjection and analogy for what the one principle be to all being that each of the other principle be to the multitude comprehend under the idiom of its principle for it be impossible since each multitude be characterize by a certain difference that it should not be extend to its proper principle which illuminate one and the same form to all the individual of that multitude for the one be the leader of every multitude and every peculiarity or idiom in the many be derive to the many from the one all partial principle therefore be establish in that principle which rank as a whole and be comprehend in it not with interval and multitude but as part in the whole as multitude in the one and number in the monad for this first principle be all thing prior to all : and many principle be multiply about the one principle and in the one goodness many goodness be establish this too be not a certain principle like each of the rest : for of these one be the principle of beauty another of symmetry another of truth and another of something else but it be simply principle nor be it simply the principle of being but it be the principle of principle for it be necessary that the idiom of principle after the same manner as other thing should not begin from multitude but should be collect into one monad as a summit and which be the principle of principle such thing therefore as be first produce by the first good in consequence of be connascent with it do not recede from essential goodness since they be immovable and unchanged and be eternally establish in the same blessedness they be likewise not indigent of the good because they be goodness themselves all other nature however be produce by the one good and many goodness since they fall off from essential goodness and be not immovably establish in the hyparxi of divine goodness on this account they possess the good accord to participation from this sublime theory the meaning of that ancient egyptian dogma that god be all thing be at once apparent for the first principle -lrb- 6 -rrb- as simplicius in the above passage justly observe be all thing prior to all ie he comprehend all thing causally this be the most transcendent mode of comprehension as all thing therefore consider as subsist causally in deity be transcendently more excellent than they be when consider as effect precede from he hence that mighty and all-comprehending whole the first principle be say to be all thing prior to all priority here denote exempt transcendency as the monad and the center of a circle be image from they simplicity of this greatest of principle so likewise do they perspicuously shadow forth to we its causal comprehension of all thing for all number may be consider as subsist occultly in the monad and the circle in the center this occult be the same in each with causal subsistence ----------------- -lrb- 6 -rrb- by the first principle here the one be to be understand for that arcane nature which be beyond the one since all language be subvert about it can only as we have already observe be conceive and venerate in the most profound silence ----------------- that this conception of causal subsistence be not a hypothesis devise by the latter platonist but a genuine dogma of plato be evident from what he say in the philebus : for in that dialogue he expressly assert that in jupiter a royal intellect and a royal soul subsist accord to cause pherecyde syrus too in he hymn to jupiter as cite by kercher -lrb- in oedip egyptiac -rrb- have the follow line : -lrb- greek : o theo esti kuklos tetragonos ede trigonos keinos de gramme kentron kai panta pro panton -rrb- ie jove be a circle triangle and square center and line and all thing before all from which testimony the antiquity of this sublime doctrine be sufficiently apparent and here it be necessary to observe that nearly all philosopher : prior to jamblichus -lrb- as we be inform by damascius -rrb- assert indeed that there be one superessential god but that the other god have a essential subsistence and be deify by illuminations from the one they likewise say that there be a multitude of super-essential unity who be not self-perfect subsistence but illuminate union with deity impart to essence by the highest god that this hypothesis however be not conformable to the doctrine of plato be evident from he parmenide in which he show that the one do not subsist in itself -lrb- see vol iii p 133 -rrb- for as we have observe from proclus in the note on that dialogue every thing which be the cause of itself and be self-subsistent be say to be in itself hence as produce power always comprehend accord to cause that which it produce it be necessary that whatever produce itself should comprehend itself so far as it be a cause and should be comprehend by itself so far as it be cause and that it should be at once both cause and the thing cause that which comprehend and that which be comprehend if therefore a subsistence in another signify accord to plato the be produce by another more excellent cause -lrb- as we have show in the note to p 133 vol iii -rrb- a subsistence in itself must signify that which be self - begotten and produce by itself if the one therefore be not self-sub - sistent as even transcend this mode of subsistence and if it be necessary that there should be something self-subsistent it follow that this must be the characteristic property of that which immediately proceed from the ineffable but that there must be something self - subsistent be evident since unless this be admit there will not be a true sufficiency in any thing besides as damascius well observe if that which be subordinate by nature be self-perfect such as the human soul much more will this be the case with a divine soul but if with soul this also will be true of intellect and if it be true of intellect it will also be true of life : if of life of be likewise and if of be of the unity above be for the self-perfect the self-sufficient and that which be establish in itself will much more subsist in superior than in subordinate nature if therefore these be in the latter they will also be in the former i mean the subsistence of a thing by itself and essentialize in itself and such be essence and life intellect soul and body for body though it do not subsist from yet subsist by itself and through this belong to the genus of substance and be contra-distinguish from accident which can not exist independent of a subject self-subsistent superessential nature therefore be the immediate progeny of the one if it be lawful thus to denominate thing which ought rather to be call ineffable unfolding into light from the ineffable for progeny imply a produce cause and the one must be conceive as something even more excellent than this from this divine self-perfect and self-producing multitude a series of self-perfect nature viz of being live intellect and soul proceed accord to plato in the last link of which luminous series he also class the human soul proximately suspend from the daemoniacal order : for this order as he clearly assert in the banquet stand in the middle rank between the divine and human fill up the vacant space and link together all intelligent nature and here to the reader who have not penetrate the depths of plato 's philosophy it will doubtless appear paradoxical in the extreme that any be should be say to produce itself and yet at the same time proceed from a superior cause the solution of this difficulty be as follow : -- essential production or that energy through which any nature produce something else by its very be be the most perfect mode of production because vestige of it be see in the last of thing thus fire impart heat by its very essence and snow coldness and in short this be a producing of that kind in which the effect be that secondarily which the cause be primarily as this mode of production therefore from its be the most perfect of all other originate from the highest nature it will consequently first belong to those self-subsistent power who immediately proceed from the ineffable and will from they be derive to all the follow order of being but this energy as be characterize by the essential will necessarily be different in different produce cause hence from that which subsist at the summit of self subsistent nature a series of self subsist being will indeed proceed but then this series will be secondarily that which its cause be primarily and the energy by which it produce itself will be secondary to that by which it be produce by its cause thus for instance the rational soul both produce itself -lrb- in consequence of be a self-motive nature -rrb- and be produce by intellect but it be produce by intellect immutably and by itself transitively for all its energy subsist in time and be accompany with motion so far therefore as soul contain intellect by participation so far it be produce by intellect but so far as it be self-motive it be produce by itself in short with respect to every thing self-subsistent the summit of its nature be produce by a superior cause but the evolution of that summit be its own spontaneous energy and through this it become self-subsistent and self-perfect that the rational soul indeed so far as it be rational produce itself may be clearly demonstrate as follow : -- that which be able to impart any thing superior and more excellent in any genus of thing can easily impart that which be subordinate and less excellent in the same genus but well be confessedly rank higher and be more excellent than mere be the rational soul impart well be to itself when it cultivate and perfect itself and recall and withdraw itself from the contagion of the body it will therefore also impart be to itself and this with great propriety for all divine nature and such thing as possess the ability of impart any thing primarily to other necessarily begin this energy from themselves of this mighty truth the sun himself be a illustrious example for he illuminate all thing with he light and be himself light and the fountain and origin of all splendor hence since the soul impart life and motion to other thing on which account aristotle call a animal antokincton self - move it will much more and by a much greater priority impart life and motion to itself from this magnificent sublime and most scientific doctrine of plato respect the arcane principle of thing and he immediate progeny it follow that this ineffable cause be not the immediate maker of the universe and this as i have observe in the introduction to the timaeus not through any defect but on the contrary through transcendency of power all thing indeed be ineffably unfold from he at once into light but divine media be necessary to the fabrication of the world for if the universe be immediately produce from the ineffable it would agreeably to what we have above observe be ineffable also in a secondary degree but as this be by no mean the case it principally derive its immediate subsistence from a deity of a fabricative characteristic whom plato call jupiter conformably to the theology of orpheus the intelligent reader will readily admit that this dogma be so far from be derogatory to the dignity of the supreme that on the contrary it exalt that dignity and preserve in a become manner the exempt transcendency of the ineffable if therefore we presume to celebrate he for as we have already observe it be more become to establish in silence those parturition of the soul which dare anxiously to explore he we should celebrate he as the principle of principle and the fountain of deity or in the reverential language of the egyptian as a darkness thrice unknown -lrb- 7 -rrb- highly laudable indeed and worthy the imitation of all posterity be the veneration which the great ancient pay to this immense principle this i have already notice in the introduction to the parmenide and i shall only observe at present in addition that in consequence of this profound and most pious reverence of the first god they do not even venture to give a name to the summit of that highest order of divinity which be denominate intelligible hence say proclus in he mss scholium on the cratylus not every genus of the god have a appellation for with respect to the first deity who be beyond all thing parmenide teach we that he be ineffable and the first genus of the intelligible god who be unite to the one and be call occult have much of the unknown and ineffable for that which be perfectly effable can not be conjoin with the perfectly ineffable but it be necessary that the progression of intelligible should terminate in this order in which the first effable subsist and that which be call by proper name for there the first intelligible form and the intellectual nature of intelligible be unfold into light but the nature prior to this be silent and occult be only know by intelligence hence the whole of the telestic science energize theurgically ascend as far as to this order orpheus also say that this be first call by a name by the other god for the light proceeding from it be know to and denominate by the intellectual god ----------------- -lrb- 7 -rrb- psalm xviii :11 xcvii :2 ----------------- with no less magnificence therefore than piety do proclus thus speak concern the ineffable principle of thing let we now if ever remove from ourselves multiform knowledge exterminate all the variety of life and in perfect quiet approach near to the cause of all thing for this purpose let not only opinion and phantasy be at rest nor the passion alone which impede we anagogic impulse to the first be at peace but let the air and the universe itself be still and let all thing extend we with a tranquil power to communion with the ineffable let we also stand there have transcend the intelligible -lrb- if we contain any thing of this kind -rrb- and with nearly close eye adoring as it be the rise sun since it be not lawful for any be whatever intently to behold he -- let we survey the sun whence the light of the intelligible god proceed emerge as the poet say from the bosom of the ocean and again from this divine tranquillity descend into intellect and from intellect employ the reasoning of the soul let we relate to ourselves what the nature be from which in this progression we shall consider the first god as exempt and let we as it be celebrate he not as establish the earth and the heaven nor as give subsistence to soul and the generation of all animal for he produce these indeed but among the last of thing but prior to these let we celebrate he as unfold into light the whole intelligible and intellectual genus of god together with all the supermundane and mundane divinity as the god of all god the unity of all unity and beyond the first adyta -- as more ineffable than all silence and more unknown than all essence -- as holy among the holy and conceal in the intelligible god such be the piety such the sublimity and magnificence of conception with which the platonic philosopher speak of that which be in reality in every respect ineffable when they presume to speak about it extend the ineffable parturition of the soul to the ineffable cosensation of the incomprehensible one from this sublime veneration of this most awful nature which as be notice in the extract from damascius induce the most ancient theologist philosopher and poet to be entirely silent concern it arise the great reverence which the ancient pay to the divinity even of a mundane characteristic or from whom body be suspend consider they also as partaking of the nature of the ineffable and as so many link of the truly golden chain of deity hence we find in the odyssey when ulyss and telemachus be remove the arm from the wall of the palace of ithaca and minerva go before they with she golden lamp fill all the place with a divine light -lrb- greek : paroithe de pallas athene chryseon lychnon echrusa phar perikalle epoieus -rrb- before thee palla athene bear a golden cresset and cast a most lovely light telemachus have observe that certainly some one of the celestial god be present -lrb- greek : emalum ti deo endon of ouranon euryn echousus -rrb- verily some god be within of those that hold the wide heaven ulyss say in reply be silent restrain you intellect -lrb- ie even cease to energize intellectually -rrb- and speak not -lrb- greek : siga kai kata son noon ischana med ' ereeine -rrb- hold thy peace and keep all this in thine heart and ask not hereof -- book 19 odyssey lastly from all that have be say it must i think be immediately obvious to every one whose mental eye be not entirely blind that there can be no such thing as a trinity in the theology of plato in any respect analogous to the christian trinity for the highest god accord to plato as we have largely show from irresistible evidence be so far from be a part of a consubsistent triad that he be not to be connumerate with any thing but be so perfectly exempt from all multitude that he be even beyond be and he so ineffably transcend all relation and habitude that language be in reality subvert about he and knowledge refund into ignorance what that trinity however be in the theology of plato which doubtless give birth to the christian will be evident to the intelligent from the note on the parmenide and the extract from damascius and thus much for the doctrine of plato concern the principle of thing and he immediate offspring the great importance of which will i doubt not be a sufficient apology for the length of this discussion in the next place follow proclus and olympiodorus as we guide let we consider the mode accord to which plato teach we mystic conception of divine nature : for he appear not to have pursue every where the same mode of doctrine about these but sometimes accord to a divinely inspire energy and at other time dialectically he evolve the truth concern they and sometimes he symbolically announce they ineffable idiom but at other time he recur to they from image and discover in they the primary cause of whole for in the phaedrus be evidently inspire and have exchange human intelligence for a better possession divine mania he unfold many arcane dogma concern the intellectual liberated and mundane god but in the sophista dialectically contend about be and the subsistence of the one above being and doubt against philosopher more ancient than himself he show how all being be suspend from they cause and the first be but that be itself participate of that unity which be exempt from all thing that it be a passive -lrb- 8 -rrb- one but not the one itself be subject to and unite to the one but not be that which be primarily one in a similar manner too in the parmenide he unfold dialectically the progression of be from the one through the first hypothesis of that dialogue and this as he there assert accord to the most perfect division of this method and again in the gorgia he relate the fable concern the three fabricator and they demiurgic allotment but in the banquet he speak concern the union of love and in the protagora about the distribution of mortal animal from the god in a symbolical manner conceal the truth concern divine nature and as far as to mere indication unfold he mind to the most genuine of he reader ----------------- -lrb- 8 -rrb- it be necessary to observe that accord to plato whatever participate of any thing be say to be passive to that which it participate and the participation themselves be call by he passion ----------------- again if it be necessary to mention the doctrine deliver through the mathematical discipline and the discussion of divine concern from ethical or physical discourse of which many may be contemplate in the timaeus many in the dialogue call politicus and many may be see scatter in other dialogue here likewise to those who be desirous of know divine concern through image the method will be apparent thus for instance the politicus shadow forth the fabrication in the heaven but the figure of the five element deliver in geometrical proportion in the timaeus represent in image the idiom of the god who preside over the part of the universe and the division of the essence of the soul in that dialogue shadow forth the total order of the god to this we may also add that plato compose politics assimilate they to divine nature and adorn they from the whole world and the power which it contain all these therefore through the similitude of mortal to divine concern exhibit to we in image the progression order and fabrication of the latter and such be the mode of theologic doctrine employ by plato but those say proclus who treat of divine concern in a indicative manner either speak symbolically and fabulously or through image and of those who openly announce they conception some frame they discourse accord to science but other accord to inspiration from the god and he who desire to signify divine concern through symbol be orphic and in short accord with those who write fable respect the god but he who do this through image be pythagoric for the mathematical discipline be invent by the pythagorean in order to a reminiscence of divine concern to which through these as image they endeavor to ascend for they refer both number and figure to the god accord to the testimony of they historian but the enthusiastic character or he who be divinely inspire unfold the truth itself concern the god essentially perspicuously rank among the highest initiator for these do not think proper to unfold the divine order or they idiom to they familiar through veil but announce they power and they number in consequence of be move by the god themselves but the tradition of divine concern accord to science be the illustrious prerogative of the platonic philosophy for plato alone as it appear to I of all those who be know to we have attempt methodically to divide and reduce into order the regular progression of the divine genus they mutual difference the common idiom of the total order and the distribute idiom in each again since plato employ fable let we in the first place consider whence the ancient be induce to devise fable and in the second place what the difference be between the fable of philosopher and those of poet in answer to the first question then it be necessary to know that the ancient employ fable look to two thing viz nature and we soul they employ they by look to nature and the fabrication of thing as follow thing unapparent be believe from thing apparent and incorporeal nature from body for see the orderly arrangement of body we understand that a certain incorporeal power preside over they as with respect to the celestial body they have a certain preside motive power as we therefore see that we body be move but be no longer so after death we conceive that it be a certain incorporeal power which move it hence perceive that we believe thing incorporeal and unapparent from thing apparent and corporeal fable come to be adopt that we might come from thing apparent to certain unapparent nature as for instance that on hear the adultery bond and laceration of the god castration of heaven and the like we may not rest satisfied with the apparent meaning of such like particulars but may proceed to the unapparent and investigate the true signification after this manner therefore look to the nature of thing be fable employ but from look to we soul they originate as follow : while we be child we live accord to the phantasy but the phantastic part be conversant with figure and type and thing of this kind that the phantastic part in we therefore may be preserve we employ fable in consequence of this part rejoice in fable it may also be say that a fable be nothing else than a false discourse shadow forth the truth : for a fable be the image of truth but the soul be the image of the nature prior to herself and hence the soul very properly rejoice in fable as a image in a image as we be therefore from we childhood nourish in fable it be necessary that they should be introduce and thus much for the first problem concern the origin of fable in the next place let we consider what the difference be between the fable of philosopher and poet each therefore have something in which it abound more than and something in which it be deficient from the other thus for instance the poetic fable abound in this that we must not rest satisfied with the apparent meaning but pass on to the occult truth for who endue with intellect would believe that jupiter be desirous of have connection with juno and on the ground without wait to go into the bed-chamber so that the poetic fable abound in consequence of assert such thing as do not suffer we to stop at the apparent but lead we to explore the occult truth but it be defective in this that it deceive those of a juvenile age plato therefore neglect fable of this kind and banish homer from he republic because youth on hear such fable will not be able to distinguish what be allegorical from what be not philosophical fable on the contrary do not injure those that go no further than the apparent meaning thus for instance they assert that there be punishment and river under the earth : and if we adhere to the literal meaning of these we shall not be injure but they be deficient in this that as they apparent signification do not injure we often content ourselves with this and do not explore the latent truth we may also say that philosophic fable look to the enemy of the soul for if we be entirely intellect alone and have no connection with phantasy we should not require fable in consequence of always associate with intellectual nature if again we be entirely irrational and live accord to the phantasy and have no other energy than this it would be requisite that the whole of we life should be fabulous since however we possess intellect opinion and phantasy demonstration be give with a view to intellect and hence plato say that if you be willing to energize accord to intellect you will have demonstration bind with adamantine chain if accord to opinion you will have the testimony of renowned person and if accord to the phantasy you have fable by which it be excite so that from all these you will derive advantage plato therefore reject the more tragical mode of mythologizing of the ancient poet who think proper to establish a arcane theology respect the god and on this account devise wanderings castration battle and laceration of the god and many other such symbol of the truth about divine nature which this theology conceal -- this mode he reject and assert that it be in every respect most foreign from erudition but he consider those mythological discourse about the god as more persuasive and more adapt to truth which assert that a divine nature be the cause of all good but of no evil and that it be void of all mutation comprehend in itself the fountain of truth but never become the cause of any deception to other for such type of theology socrate deliver in the republic all the fable therefore of plato guard the truth in concealment have not even they externally apparent apparatus discordant with we undisciplined and unperverted anticipation of divinity but they bring with they a image of the mundane composition in which both the apparent beauty be worthy of divinity and a beauty more divine than this be establish in the unapparent life and power of its cause in the next place that the reader may see whence and from what dialogue principally the theological dogma of plato may be collect i shall present he with the follow translation of what proclus have admirably write on this subject the truth -lrb- say he -rrb- concern the god pervade as i may say through all the platonic dialogue and in all of they conception of the first philosophy venerable clear and supernatural be disseminate in some more obscurely but in other more conspicuously -- conception which excite those that be in any respect able to partake of they to the immaterial and separate essence of the god and as in each part of the universe and in nature itself the demiurgus of all which the world contain established resemblance of the unknown essence of the god that all thing might be convert to divinity through they alliance with it in like manner i be of opinion that the divine intellect of plato weave conception about the god with all its progeny and leave nothing deprive of the mention of divinity that from the whole of its offspring a reminiscence of total nature may be obtain and impart to the genuine lover of divine concern but if it be requisite to lay before the reader those dialogue out of many which principally unfold to we the mystic discipline about the god i shall not err in ranking among this number the phaedo and phaedrus the banquet and the philebus and together with these the sophista and politicus the cratylus and the timaeus for all these be full through the whole of themselves as i may say of the divine science of plato but i should place in the second rank after these the fable in the gorgia and that in the protagoras likewise the assertion about the providence of the god in the law and such thing as be deliver about the fate or the mother of the fate or the circulation of the universe in the tenth book of the republic again you may if you please place in the third rank those epistle through which we may be able to arrive at the science about divine nature for in these mention be make of the three king and many other divine dogma worthy the platonic theory be deliver it be necessary therefore regard these to explore in they each order of the god thus from the philebus we may receive the science respect the one good and the two first principle of thing -lrb- bind and infinity -rrb- together with the triad subsist from these for you will find all these distinctly deliver to we by plato in that dialogue but from the timaeus you may obtain the theory about intelligible a divine narration about the demiurgic monad and the most full truth about the mundane god from the phaedrus you may learn all the intelligible and intellectual genus and the liberated order of the god which be proximately establish above the celestial circulation from the politicus you may obtain the theory of the fabrication in the heaven of the period of the universe and of the intellectual cause of those period but from the sophista you may learn the whole sublunary generation and the idiom of the god who be allot the sublunary region and preside over its generation and corruption and with respect to each of the god we may obtain many sacred conception from the banquet many from the cratylus and many from the phaedo for in each of these dialogue more or less mention be make of divine name from which it be easy for those who be exorcise in divine concern to discover by a reasoning process the idiom of each it be necessary however to evince that each of the dogma accord with platonic principle and the mystic tradition of theologist for all the grecian theology be the progeny of the mystic doctrine of orpheus pythagora first of all learn from aglaophemus the origin of the god but plato in the second place receive a all-perfect science of the divinity from the pythagoric and orphic writings for in the philebus refer the theory about the two form of principle -lrb- bind and infinity -rrb- to the pythagorean he call they man dwelling with the god and truly bless philolaus therefore the pythagorean have leave for we in write admirable conception about these principle celebrate they common progression into being and they separate fabrication again in the timaeus endeavor to teach we about the sublunary god and they order plato fly to theologist call they the son of the god and make they the father of the truth about these divinity and lastly he deliver the order of the sublunary god proceed from whole accord to the progression deliver by theologist of the intellectual king further still in the cratylus he follow the tradition of theologist respect the order of the divine procession but in the gorgia he adopt the homeric dogma respect the triadic hypostase of the demiurgus and in short he every where discourse concern the god agreeably to the principle of theologist reject indeed the tragical part of mythological fiction but establish first hypothesis in common with the author of fable perhaps however some one may here object to we that we do not in a proper manner exhibit the every where dispersed theology of plato and that we endeavor to heap together different particulars from different dialogue as if we be studious of collect many thing into one mixture instead of derive they all from one and the same fountain for if this be we intention we might indeed refer different dogma to different treatise of plato but we shall by no means have a precedaneous doctrine concern the god nor will there be any dialogue which present we with a all-perfect and entire procession of the divine genus and they coordination with each other but we shall be similar to those who endeavor to obtain a whole from part through the want of a whole prior -lrb- 9 -rrb- to part and to weave together the perfect from thing imperfect when on the contrary the imperfect ought to have the first cause of its generation in the perfect for the timaeus for instance will teach we the theory of the intelligible genus and the phaedrus appear to present we with a regular account of the first intellectual order but where will be the coordination of intellectual to intelligible and what will be the generation of second from first nature in short after what manner the progression of the divine order take place from the one principle of all thing and how in the generation of the god the order between the one and all-perfect number be fill up we shall be unable to evince -----------------_NN -lrb- 9 -rrb- a whole prior to part be that which causally contain part in itself such part too when they proceed from they occult causal subsistence and have a distinct being of they own be nevertheless comprehend though in a different manner in they produce whole ----------------- further still it may be say where will be the venerableness of you boast science about divine nature for it be absurd to call these dogma which be collect from many place platonic and which as you acknowledge be reduce from foreign name to the philosophy of plato nor be you able to evince the whole entire truth about divine nature perhaps indeed they will say that certain person junior to plato have deliver in they writings and leave to they disciple one perfect form of philosophy you therefore be able to produce one entire theory about nature from the timaeus but from the republic or law the most beautiful dogma about moral and which tend to one form of philosophy alone therefore neglect the treatise of plato which contain all the good of the first philosophy and which may be call the summit of the whole theory you will be deprive of the most perfect knowledge of being unless you be so much infatuate as to boast on account of fabulous fiction though a analysis of thing of this kind abound with much of the probable but not of the demonstrative besides thing of this kind be only deliver adventitiously in the platonic dialogue as the fable in the protagora which be insert for the sake of the political science and the demonstration respect it in like manner the fable in the republic be insert for the sake of justice and in the gorgia for the sake of temperance for plato combine fabulous narration with investigation of ethical dogma not for the sake of the fable but for the sake of the lead design that we may not only exercise the intellectual part of the soul through contend reason but that the divine part of the soul may more perfectly receive the knowledge of being through its sympathy with more mystic concern for from other discourse we resemble those who be compel to the reception of truth but from fable we be affect in a ineffable manner and call forth we unperverted conception venerate the mystic information which they contain hence as it appear to I timaeus with great propriety think it fit that we should produce the divine genus follow the inventor of fable as son of the god and subscribe to they always generate secondary nature from such as be first though they should speak without demonstration for this kind of discourse be not demonstrative but entheastic or the progeny of divine inspiration and be invent by the ancient not through necessity but for the sake of persuasion not regard naked discipline but sympathy with thing themselves but if you be willing to speculate not only the cause of fable but of other theological dogma you will find that some of they be scatter in the platonic dialogue for the sake of ethical and other for the sake of physical consideration for in the philebus plato discourse concern bind and infinity for the sake of pleasure and a life accord to intellect for i think the latter be species of the former in the timaeus the discourse about the intelligible god be assume for the sake of the propose physiology on which account it be every where necessary that image should be know from paradigm but that the paradigm of material thing should be immaterial of sensible intelligible and of physical form separate from nature but in the phaedrus plato celebrate the supercelestial place the subcelestial profundity and every genus under this for the sake of amatory mania the manner in which the reminiscence of soul take place and the passage to these from hence every where however the lead end as i may say be either physical or political while the conception about divine nature be introduce either for the sake of invention or perfection how therefore can such a theory as yours be any longer venerable and supernatural and worthy to be study beyond every thing when it be neither able to evince the whole in itself nor the perfect nor that which be precedaneous in the writings of plato but be destitute of all these be violent and not spontaneous and do not possess a genuine but a adventitious order as in a drama and such be the particulars which may be urge against we design to this objection i shall make a just and perspicuous reply i say then that plato every where discourse about the god agreeably to ancient opinion and the nature of thing and sometimes indeed for the sake of the cause of the thing propose he reduce they to the principle of the dogma and thence as from a exalted place of survey contemplate the nature of the thing propose but some time he establish the theological science as the lead end for in the phaedrus he subject respects intelligible beauty and the participation of beauty pervade thence through all thing and in the banquet it respect the amatory order but if it be necessary to consider in one platonic dialogue the all-perfect whole and connected extend as far as to the complete number of theology i shall perhaps assert a paradox and which will alone be apparent to we familiar we ought however to dare since we have begin the assertion and affirm against we opponent that the parmenide and the mystic conception of this dialogue will accomplish all you desire for in this dialogue all the divine genus proceed in order from the first cause and evince they mutual suspension from each other and those indeed which be highest connate with the one and of a primary nature be allot a form of subsistence characterize by unity occult and simple but such as be last be multiply be distribute into many part and excel in number but be inferior in power to such as be of a higher order and such as be middle accord to a convenient proportion be more composite than they cause but more simple than they proper progeny and in short all the axiom of the theological science appear in perfection in this dialogue and all the divine order be exhibit subsist in connection so that this be nothing else than the celebrated generation of the god and the procession of every kind of be from the ineffable and unknown cause of whole -lrb- 10 -rrb- the parmenide therefore enkindle in the lover of plato the whole and perfect light of the theological science but after this the aforementioned dialogue distribute part of the mystic discipline about the god and all of they as i may say participate of divine wisdom and excite we spontaneous conception respect a divine nature ------------------ -lrb- 10 -rrb- the principle of all thing be celebrate by platonic philosophy as the cause of whole because through transcendency of power he first produce those power in the universe which rank as whole and afterward those which rank as part through these agreeably to this jupiter the artificer of the universe be almost always call -lrb- greek : demiourgo ton olon -rrb- the demiurgus of whole see the timaeus and the introduction to it ------------------ and it be necessary to refer all the part of this mystic discipline to these dialogue and these again to the one and all perfect theory of the parmenide for thus as it appear to I we shall suspend the more imperfect from the perfect and part from whole and shall exhibit reason assimilate to thing of which accord to the platonic timaeus they be interpreter such then be we answer to the objection which may be urge against we and thus we refer the platonic theory to the parmenide just as the timaeus be acknowledge by all who have the least degree of intelligence to contain the whole science about nature all that be here assert by proclus will be immediately admit by the reader who understand the outline which we have here give of the theology of plato and who be besides this a complete master of the mystic meaning of the parmenide which i trust he will find sufficiently unfold through the assistance of proclus in the introduction and note to that dialogue the next important platonic dogma in order be that doctrine concern idea about which the reader will find so much say in the note on the parmenide that but little remains to be add here that little however be as follow : the divine pythagora and all those who have legitimately receive he doctrine among whom plato hold the most distinguished rank assert that there be many order of being viz intelligible intellectual dianoetic physical or in short vital and corporeal essence for the progression of thing the subjection which naturally subsist together with such progression and the power of diversity in coordinate genus give subsistence to all the multitude of corporeal and incorporeal nature they say therefore that there be three order in the whole extent of being viz the intelligible the dianoetic and the sensible and that in each of these idea subsist characterize by the respective essential property of the nature by which they be contain and with respect to intelligible idea these they place among divine nature together with the produce paradigmatic and final cause of thing in a consequent order for if these three cause sometimes concur and be unite among themselves -lrb- which aristotle say be the case -rrb- without doubt this will not happen in the lowest work of nature but in the first and most excellent cause of all thing which on account of they exuberant fecundity have a power generative of all thing and from they converting and render similar to themselves the nature which they have generate be the paradigm or exemplar of all thing but as these divine cause act for they own sake and on account of they own goodness do they not exhibit the final cause since therefore intelligible form be of this kind and be the leader of so much good to whole they give completion to the divine order though they largely subsist about the intelligible order contain in the artificer of the universe but dianoetic form or idea imitate the intellectual which have a prior subsistence render the order of soul similar to the intellectual order and comprehend all thing in a secondary degree these form behold in divine nature possess a fabricative power but with we they be only gnostic and no longer demiurgic through the defluxion of we wing or degradation of we intellectual power for as plato say in the phaedrus when the winged power of the soul be perfect and plumed for flight she dwell on high and in conjunction with divine nature govern the world in the timaeus he manifestly assert that the demiurgus implant these dianoetic form in soul in geometric arithmetic and harmonic proportion : but in he republic -lrb- in the section of a line in the 6th book -rrb- he call they image of intelligible and on this account do not for the most part disdain to denominate they intellectual as be the exemplar of sensible nature in the phaedo he say that these be the cause to we of reminiscence because discipline be nothing else than reminiscence of middle dianoetic form from which the productive power of nature be derive and inspire give birth to all the mundane phenomenon plato however do not consider thing definable or in modern language abstract idea as the only universal but prior to these he establish those principle productive of science which essentially reside in the soul as be evident from he phaedrus and phaedo in the 10th book of the republic too he venerate those separate form which subsist in a divine intellect in the phaedrus he assert that soul elevate to the supercelestial place behold justice herself temperance herself and science herself and lastly in the phaedo he evince the immortality of the soul from the hypothesis of separate form syrianus -lrb- 11 -rrb- in he commentary on the 13th book of aristotle 's metaphysics show in defense of socrate plato the parmenidean and pythagorean that idea be not introduce by these divine man accord to the usual meaning of name as be the opinion of chrysippus archedemus and many of the junior stoic for idea be distinguish by many difference from thing which be denominate from custom nor do they subsist say he together with intellect in the same manner as those slender conception which be denominate universal abstracted from sensible accord to the hypothesis of longinus : -lrb- 12 -rrb- for if that which subsist be unsubstantial it can not be consubsistent with intellect ----------------- -lrb- 11 -rrb- see my translation of aristotle 's metaphysics p 347 if the reader conjoin what be say concern idea in the note on that work with the introduction and note to the parmenide in this he will be in possession of nearly all that be to be find in the writings of the ancient on this subject -lrb- 12 -rrb- it appear from this passage of syrianus that longinus be the original inventor of the theory of abstract idea and that mr locke be merely the restorer of it ----------------- nor be idea accord to these man notion as cleanthe afterwards assert they to be nor be idea definite reason nor material form for these subsist in composition and division and verge to matter but idea be perfect simple immaterial and impartible nature and what wonder be there say syrianus if we should separate thing which be so much distant from each other since neither do we imitate in this particular plutarch atticus and democritus who because universal reason perpetually subsist in the essence of the soul be of opinion that these reason be idea : for though they separate they from the universal in sensible nature yet it be not proper to conjoin in one and the same the reason of soul and a intellect such as ours with paradigmatic and immaterial form and demiurgic intellection but as the divine plato say it be the province of we soul to collect thing into one by a reasoning process and to possess a reminiscence of those transcendent spectacles which we once behold when govern the universe in conjunction with divinity boethus -lrb- 13 -rrb- the peripatetic too with whom it be proper to join cornutus think that idea be the same with universal in sensible nature however whether these universal be prior to particulars they be not prior in such a manner as to be denudate from the habitude which they possess with respect to they nor do they subsist as the cause of particulars both which be the prerogative of idea or whether they be posterior to particulars as many be accustom to call they how can thing of posterior origin which have no essential subsistence but be nothing more than slender conception sustain the dignity of fabricative idea ------------------- -lrb- 13 -rrb- this be a greek philosopher who be often cite by simplicius in he commentary on the predicament and must not therefore be confound with boetius the roman senator and philosopher ------------------- in what manner then say syrianus do idea subsist accord to the contemplative lover of truth we reply intelligibly and tetradically -lrb- -lrb- greek : noero kai tetradikos -rrb- -rrb- in animal itself -lrb- -lrb- greek : en to antozoo -rrb- -rrb- or the extremity of the intelligible order but intellectually and decadically -lrb- -lrb- greek : noero kai dekadikos -rrb- -rrb- in the intellect of the artificer of the universe for accord to the pythagoric hymn divine number proceeds from the retreat of the undecaying monad till it arrive at the divine tetrad which produce the mother of all thing the universal recipient venerable circularly invest all thing with bind immovable and unwearied and which be denominate the sacred decad both by the immortal god and earth-born man -lrb- greek : proeisus gar o theio arithmo os phesin o pythagoreio eis auton umnos monados ek keuthmonos akeralou esti'an iketai tetrada epi zatheen he de teke metera panton pandechea presbeiran oron perus pasi titheiran atropon akamatou dekada kleiousus min agnen athanatous to theoi kai gegeneeis anthropous -rrb- and such be the mode of they subsistence accord to orpheus pythagora and plato or if it be requisite to speak in more familiar language a intellect sufficient to itself and which be a most perfect cause preside over the whole of the universe and through these govern all its part but at the same time that it fabricate all mundane nature and benefit they by its providential energy it preserve its own most divine and immaculate purity and while it illuminate all thing be not mingle with the nature which it illuminate this intellect therefore comprehend in the depths of its essence a ideal world replete with all various form exclude privation of cause and casual subsistence from its energy but as it impart every good and all possible beauty to its fabrication it convert the universe to itself and render it similar to its own omniform nature its energy too be such as its intellection but it understand all thing since it be most perfect hence there be not any thing which rank among true being that be not comprehend in the essence of intellect but it always establish in itself idea which be not different from itself and its essence but give completion to it and introduce to the whole of thing a cause which be at the same time productive paradigmatic and final for it energize as intellect and the idea which it contain be paradigmatic as be form and they energize from themselves and accord to they own exuberant goodness and such be the platonic dogma concern idea which sophistry and ignorance may indeed oppose but will never be able to confute from this intelligible world replete with omniform idea this sensible world accord to plato perpetually flow depend on its artificer intellect in the same manner as shadow on its form substance for as a deity of a intellectual characteristic be its fabricator and both the essence and energy of intellect be establish in eternity the sensible universe which be the effect or production of such a energy must be consubsistent with its cause or in other word must be a perpetual emanation from it this will be evident from consider that every thing which be generate be either generate by art or by nature or accord to power it be necessary therefore that every thing operate accord to nature or art should be prior to the thing produce but that thing operate accord to power should have they production coexistent with themselves just as the sun produce light coexistent with itself fire heat and snow coldness if therefore the artificer of the universe produce it by art he would not cause it simply to be but to be in some particular manner for all art produce form whence therefore do the world derive its be if he produce it from nature since that which make by nature impart something of itself to its production and the maker of the world be incorporeal it would be necessary that the world the offspring of such a energy should be incorporeal it remain therefore that the demiurgus produce the universe by power alone but every thing generate by power subsist together with the cause contain this power : and hence production of this kind can not be destroy unless the produce cause be deprive of power the divine intellect therefore that produce the sensible universe cause it to be coexistent with himself this world thus depend on its divine artificer who be himself a intelligible world replete with the archetypal idea of all thing consider accord to its corporeal nature be perpetually flow and perpetually advance to be -lrb- en to gignesthaus -rrb- and compare with its paradigm have no stability or reality of be however consider as animated by a divine soul and as receive the illuminations of all the supermundane god and be itself the receptacle of divinity from whom body be suspend it be say by plato in the timaeus to be a bless god the great body of this world too which subsist in a perpetual dispersion of temporal extension may be properly call a whole with a total subsistence on account of the perpetuity of its duration though this be nothing more than a flow eternity and hence plato call it a whole of whole by the other whole which be comprehend in its mean the celestial sphere the sphere of fire the whole of air consider as one great orb the whole earth and the whole sea these sphere which be call by platonic writer part with a total subsistence be consider by plato as aggoregately perpetual for if the body of this world be perpetual this also must be the case with its larger part on account of they exquisite alliance to it and in order that whole with a partial subsistence such as all individual may rank in the last gradation of thing as the world too consider as one great comprehend whole be call by plato a divine animal so likewise every whole which it contain be a world possess in the first place a self-perfect unity proceeding from the ineffable by which it become a god in the second place a divine intellect in the third place a divine soul and in the last place a deified body hence each of these whole be the produce cause of all the multitude which it contain and on this account be say to be a whole prior to part because consider as possess a eternal form which hold all its part together and give to the whole perpetuity of subsistence it be not indigent of such part to the perfection of its be that these whole which rank thus high in the universe be animated must follow by a geometrical necessity for as theophrastus well observe whole would possess less authority than part and thing eternal than such as be corruptible if deprive of the possession of soul and now have with venturous yet unpresuming wing ascend to the ineffable principle of thing and stand with every eye close in the vestibule of the adytum find that we could announce nothing concern he but only indicate we doubt and disappointment and have thence descend to he occult and most venerable progeny and pass through the luminous world of idea hold fast by the golden chain of deity terminate we downward flight in the material universe and its undecaying whole let we stop awhile and contemplate the sublimity and magnificence of the scene which this journey present to we view here then we see the vast empire of deity a empire terminate upward by a principle so ineffable that all language be subvert about it and downward by the vast body of the world immediately subsist after this immense unknown we in the next place behold a mighty all - comprehend one which as be next to that which be in every respect incomprehensible possess much of the ineffable and unknown from this principle of principle in which all thing casually subsist absorb in superessential light and involve in unfathomable depths we view a beauteous progeny of principle all largely partaking of the ineffable all stamp with the occult character of deity all possess a over-flowing fullness of good from these dazzling summit these ineffable blossom these divine propagation we next see be life intellect soul nature and body depend monad suspend from unity deify nature proceed from deity each of these monad too be the leader of a series which extend from itself to the last of thing and which while it proceed from at the same time abide in and return to its leader and all these principle and all they progeny be finally centre and root by they summit in the first great all - comprehend one thus all being proceed from and be comprehend in the first be all intellect emanate from one first intellect all soul from one first soul all nature blossom from one first nature and all body proceed from the vital and luminous body of the world and lastly all these great monad be comprehend in the first one from which both they and all they depend series be unfold into light hence this first one be truly the unity of unity the monad of monad the principle of principle the god of god one and all thing and yet one prior to all such accord to plato be the flight of the true philosopher such the August and magnificent scene which present itself to he view by ascend these luminous height the spontaneous tendency of the soul to deity alone find the adequate object of they desire investigation here alone finally repose doubt expire in certainty and knowledge lose itself in the ineffable and here perhaps some grave objector whose little soul be indeed acute but see nothing with a vision healthy and sound will say that all this be very magnificent but that it be soar too high for man that it be merely the effect of spiritual pride that no truth either in morality or theology be of any importance which be not adapt to the level of the meanest capacity and that all that it be necessary for man to know concern either god or himself be so plain that he that run may read in answer to such like cant for it be nothing more -- a cant produce by the most profound ignorance and frequently attend with the most deplorable envy i ask be then the delphic precept know thyself a trivial mandate can this be accomplish by every man or can any one properly know himself without know the rank he hold in the scale of be and can this be effect without know what be the nature which he surpass and what those be by which he be surpass and can he know this without know as much of those nature as it be possible for he to know and will the objector be hardy enough to say that every man be equal to this arduous task that he who rush from the forge or the mine with a soul distorted crushed and bruise by base mechanical art and madly presume to teach theology to a deluded audience be master of this sublime this most important science for my own part i know of no truth which be thus obvious thus accessible to every man but axiom those self-evident principle of science which be conspicuous by they own light which be the spontaneous unperverted conception of the soul and to which he who do not assent deserve as aristotle justly remark either pity or correction in short if this be to be the criterion of all moral and theological knowledge that it must be immediately obvious to every man that it be to be apprehend by the most careless inspection what occasion be there for seminary of learn education be ridiculous the toil of investigation be idle let we at once confine wisdom in the dungeon of folly recall ignorance from she barbarous wild and close the gate of science with everlasting bar have thus take a general survey of the great world and descend from the intelligible to the sensible universe let we still adhering to that golden chain which be bind round the summit of olympus and from which all thing be suspend descend to the microcosm man for man comprehend in himself partially everything which the world contain divinely and totally hence accord to pluto he be endue with a intellect subsist in energy and a rational soul proceed from the same father and vivific goddess as be the cause of the intellect and soul of the universe he have likewise a ethereal vehicle analogous to the heaven and a terrestrial body compose from the four element and with which also it be coordinate with respect to he rational part for in this the essence of man consist we have already show that it be of a self-motive nature and that it subsist between intellect which be immovable both in essence and energy and nature which both move and be move in consequence of this middle subsistence the mundane soul from which all partial soul be derive be say by plato in the timaeus to be a medium between that which be indivisible and that which be divisible about body ie the mundane soul be a medium between the mundane intellect and the whole of that corporeal life which the world participate in like manner the human soul be a medium between a daemoniacal intellect proximately establish above we essence which it also elevate and perfect and that corporeal life which be distribute about we body and which be the cause of its generation nutrition and increase this daemoniacal intellect be call by plato in the phaedrus theoretic and the governor of the soul the highest part therefore of the human soul be the summit of the dianoetic power -lrb- -lrb- greek : to akrotaton te dianoia -rrb- -rrb- or that power which reason scientifically and this summit be we intellect as however we very essence be characterize by reason this we summit be rational and though it subsist in energy yet it have a remitted union with thing themselves though too it energize from itself and contain intelligible in its essence yet from its alliance to the discursive nature of soul and its inclination to that which be divisible it fall short of the perfection of a intellectual essence and energy profoundly indivisible and united and the intelligible which it contain degenerate from the transcendently fulged and self-luminous nature of first intelligible hence in obtain a perfectly indivisible knowledge it require to be perfect by a intellect whose energy be ever vigilant and unremitted and it be intelligible that they may become perfect be indigent of the light which proceed from separate intelligible aristotle therefore very properly compare the intelligible of we intellect to color because these require the splendor of the sun and denominate a intellect of this kind intellect in capacity both on account of its subordination to a essential intellect and because it be from a separate intellect that it receive the full perfection of its nature the middle part of the rational soul be call by plato dianoium and be that power which as we have already say reason scientifically derive the principle of its reasoning which be axiom from intellect and the extremity of the rational soul be opinion which in he sophista he define to be that power which know the conclusion of dianoium this power also know the universal in sensible particulars as that every man be a biped but it know only the otus or that a thing be but be ignorant of the diotus or why it be : knowledge of the latter kind be the province of the dianoetic power and such be plato 's division of the rational part of we nature which he very justly consider as the true man the essence of every thing consist in its most excellent part after this follow the irrational nature the summit of which be the phantasy or that power which perceive every thing accompany with figure and interval and on this account it may be call a figure intelligence -lrb- -lrb- greek : morphotike noesis -rrb- -rrb- this power as jamblichus beautifully observe group upon as it be and fashion all the power of the soul exciting in opinion the illuminations from the sens and fix in that life which be extend with body the impression which descend from intellect hence slay proclus it fold itself about the indivisibility of true intellect conform itself to all formless species and become perfectly every thing from which the dianoetic power and we indivisible reason consist hence too it be all thing passively which intellect be impassively and on this account aristotle call it passive intellect under this subsist anger and desire the former resemble a rage lion and the latter a many-headed beast and the whole be bound by sense which be nothing more than a passive perception of thing and on this account be justly say by plato to be rather passion than knowledge since the former of these be characterize by alertness and the latter by energy further still in order that the union of the soul with this gross terrestrial body may be effect in a become manner two vehicle accord to plato be necessary as media one of which be ethereal and the other aerial and of these the ethereal vehicle be simple and immaterial but the aerial simple and material and this dense earthly body be composite and material the soul thus subsist as a medium between nature impartible and such as be divide about body it produce and constitute the latter of these but establish in itself the prior cause from which it proceed hence it previously receive after the manner of a exemplar the nature to which it be prior as they cause but it possess through participation and as the blossom of first nature the cause of its subsistence hence it contain in its essence immaterial form of thing material incorporeal of such as be corporeal and extend of such as be distinguish by interval but it contain intelligible after the manner of a image and receive partibly they impartible form such as be uniform variously and such as be immovable accord to a self-motive condition soul therefore be all thing and be elegantly say by olympiodorus to be a omniform statue -lrb- -lrb- greek : pammorphon agalma -rrb- -rrb- : for it contain such thing as be first through participation but such as be posterior to its nature after the manner of a exemplar as too it be always move and this always be not eternal but temporal for that which be properly eternal and such be intellect be perfectly stable and have no transitive energy hence it be necessary that its motion should be periodic for motion be a certain mutation from some thing into other and being be terminate by multitude and magnitude these therefore be terminate there can neither be a infinite mutation accord to a right line nor can that which be always move proceed accord to a finish progression hence that which be always move will proceed from the same to the same and will thus form a periodic motion hence too the human and this also be true of every mundane soul use period and restitution of its proper life for in consequence of be measure by time it energize transitively and possess a proper motion but every thing which be move perpetually and participate of time revolve periodically and proceed from the same to the same and hence the soul from possess motion and energize accord to time will both possess period of motion and restitution to its pristine state again as the human soul accord to plato rank among the number of those soul that sometimes follow the mundane divinity in consequence of subsist immediately after daemon and hero the perpetual attendant of the god hence it possess a power of descend infinitely into generation or the sublunary region and of ascend from generation to real be for since it do not reside with divinity through a infinite time neither will it be conversant with body through the whole succeed time for that which have no temporal beginning both accord to plato and aristotle can not have a end and that which have no end be necessarily without a begin it remain therefore that every soul must perform period both of ascension from generation and of descension into generation and that this will never fail through a infinite time from all this it follow that the soul while a inhabitant of earth be in a fall condition a apostate from deity a exile from the orb of light hence plato in the 7th book of he republic consider we life with reference to erudition and the want of it assimilate we to man in a subterranean cavern who have be there confine from they childhood and so fetter by chain as to be only able to look before they to the entrance of the cave which expand to the light but incapable through the chain of turn themselves round he suppose too that they have the light of a fire burning far above and behind they and that between the fire and the fettered man there be a road above along which a low wall be build on this wall be see man bear utensil of every kind and statue in wood and stone of man and other animal and of these man some be speak and other silent with respect to the fettered man in this cave they see nothing of themselves or another or of what be carry along but the shadow form by the fire fall on the opposite part of tho cave he suppose too that the opposite part of this prison have a echo and that in consequence of this the fetter man when they hear any one speak will imagine that it be nothing else than the pass shadow here in the first place as we have observe in the note on that book the road above between the fire and the fettered man indicate that there be a certain ascent in the cave itself from a more abject to a more elevated life by this ascent therefore plato signify the contemplation of dianoetic object in the mathematical discipline for as the shadow in the cave correspond to the shadow of visible object and visible object be the immediate image of dianoetic form or those idea which the soul essentially participate it be evident that the object from which these shadow be form must correspond to such as be dianoetic it be requisite therefore that the dianoetic power exercise itself in these should draw forth the principle of these from they latent retreat and should contemplate they not in image but as subsist in herself in impartible involution in the next place he say that the man who be to be lead from the cave will more easily see what the heaven contain and the heaven themselves by look in the night to the light of the star and the moon than by day look on the sun and the light of the sun by this he signify the contemplation of intelligible : for the star and they light be imitation of intelligible so far as all of they partake of the form of the sun in the same manner as intelligible be characterize by the nature of the good after the contemplation of these and after the eye be accustom through these to the light as it be requisite in the visible region to see the sun himself in the last place in like manner accord to plato the idea of the good must be see the last in the intelligible region he likewise divinely add that it be scarcely to be see for we can only be conjoin with it through the intelligible in the vestibule of which it be behold by the ascend soul in short the cold accord to plato can only be restore while on earth to the divine likeness which she abandon by she descent and be able after death to reascend to the intelligible world by the exercise of the cathartic and theoretic virtue the former purify she from the defilement of a mortal nature and the latter elevate she to the vision of true being : for thus as plato say in the timaeus the soul become sane and entire will arrive at the form of she pristine habit the cathartic however must necessarily precede the theoretic virtue since it be impossible to survey truth while subject to the perturbation and tumult of the passion for the rational soul subsist as a medium between intellect and the irrational nature can then only without revulsion associate with the intellect prior to herself when she become pure from copassivity with inferior nature by the cathartic virtue therefore we become sane in consequence of be liberate from the passion as disease but we become entire by the reassumption of intellect and science as of we proper part and this be effect by contemplative truth plato also clearly teach we that we apostacy from better nature be only to be heal by a flight from hence when he define in he theaetetus philosophy to be a flight from terrestrial evil : for he evince by this that passion be connascent with mortal alone he likewise say in the same dialogue that neither can evil be abolish nor yet do they subsist with the god but that they necessarily revolve about this terrene abode and a mortal nature for those who be obnoxious to generation and corruption can also be affect in a manner contrary to nature which be the beginning of evil but in the same dialogue he subjoin the mode by which we flight from evil be to be accomplish it be necessary say he to fly from hence thither : but the flight be a similitude to divinity as far as be possible to man and this similitude consist in become just and holy in conjunction with intellectual prudence for it be necessary that he who wish to run from evil should in the first place turn away from a mortal nature since it be not possible for those who be mingle with it to avoid be fill with its attendant evil as therefore through we flight from divinity and the defluction of those wing which elevate we on high we fall into this mortal abode and thus become connect with evil so by abandon passivity with a mortal nature and by the germination of the virtue as of certain wing we return to the abode of pure and true good and to the possession of divine felicity for the essence of many subsist as a medium between daemoniacal nature who always have a intellectual knowledge of divinity and those being who be never adapt by nature to understand he it ascend to the former and descend to the latter through the possession and desertion of intellect for it become familiar both with the divine and brutal likeness through the amphibious condition of its nature when the soul therefore have recover she pristine perfection in as great a degree as be possible while she be a inhabitant of earth by the exercise of the cathartic and theoretic virtue she return after death as he say in the timaeus to she kindred star from which she fall and enjoy a bless life then too as he say in the phaedrus be wing she govern the world in conjunction with the god and this indeed be the most beautiful end of she labor this be what he call in the phaedo a great contest and a mighty hope this be the most perfect fruit of philosophy to familiarize and lead she back to thing truly beautiful to liberate she from this terrene abode as from a certain subterranean cavern of material life elevate she to ethereal splendor and place she in the island of the bless from this account of the human soul that most important platonic dogma necessarily follow that we soul essentially contain all knowledge and that whatever knowledge she acquire in the present life be in reality nothing more than a recovery of what a he once possess this recovery be very properly call by plato reminiscence not as be attend with actual recollection in the present life but as be a actual repossession of what the soul have lose through she oblivious union with the body allude to this essential knowledge of the soul which discipline evocate from its dormant retreat plato say in the sophista that we know all thing as in a dream and be again ignorant of they accord to vigilant perception hence too as proclus well observe it be evident that the soul do not collect she knowledge from sensible nor from thing partial and divisible discover the whole and the one for it be not proper to think that thing which have in no respect a real subsistence should be the lead cause of knowledge to the soul and that thing which oppose each other and be ambiguous should precede science which have a sameness of subsistence nor that thing which be variously mutable should be generative of reason which be establish in unity nor that thing indefinite should be the cause of definite intelligence it be not fit therefore that the truth of thing eternal should be receive from the many nor the discrimination of universal from sensible nor a judgment respect what be good from irrational nature but it be requisite that the soul enter within herself should investigate herself the true and the good and the eternal reason of thing we have say that discipline awaken the dormant knowledge of the soul and plato consider this as particularly effect by the mathematical discipline hence he assert of theoretic arithmetic that it impart no small aid to we ascent to real be and that it liberate we from the wander and ignorance about a sensible nature geometry too be consider by he as most instrumental to the knowledge of the good when it be not pursue for the sake of practical purpose but as the means of ascent to a intelligible essence astronomy also be useful for the purpose of investigate the fabricator of all thing and contemplate as in most splendid image the ideal world and its ineffable cause and lastly music when properly study be subservient to we ascent viz when from sensible we betake ourselves to the contemplation of ideal and divine harmony unless however we thus employ the mathematical discipline the study of they be justly consider by plato as imperfect and useless and of no worth for as the true end of man accord to he philosophy be a assimilation to divinity in the greatest perfection of which human nature be capable whatever contribute to this be to be ardently pursue but whatever have a different tendency however necessary it may be to the want and convenience of the mere animal life be comparatively little and vile hence it necessary to pass rapidly from thing visible and audible to those which be alone see by the eye of intellect for the mathematical science when properly study move the inherent knowledge of the soul awaken its intelligence purify its dianoetic power call forth its essential form from they dormant retreat remove that oblivion and ignorance which be congenial with we birth and dissolve the bond arise from we union with a irrational nature it be therefore beautifully say by plato in the 7th book of he republic that the soul through these discipline have a organ purify and enlighten which be blind and bury by study of a different kind a organ better worth saving than ten thousand eye since truth become visible through this alone dialectic however or the vertex of the mathematical science as it be call by plato in he republic be that master discipline which particularly lead we up to a intelligible essence of this first of science which be essentially different from vulgar logic and be the same with what aristotle call the first philosophy and wisdom i have largely speak in the introduction and note to the parmenide suffice it therefore to observe in this place that dialectic differ from mathematical science in this that the latter flow from and the former be void of hypothesis that dialectic have a power of know universal that it ascend to good and the supreme cause of all and that it consider good as the end of its elevation but that the mathematical science which previously fabricate for itself definite principle from which it evince thing consequent to such principle do not tend to the principle but to the conclusion hence plato do not expel mathematical knowledge from the number of the science but assert it to be the next in rank to that one science which be the summit of all nor do he accuse it as ignorant of its own principle but consider it as receive these from the master science dialectic and that possess they without any demonstration it demonstrate from these its consequent proposition hence socrate in the republic speaking of the power of dialectic say that it surround all discipline like a defensive enclosure and elevate those that use it to the good itself and the first unity that it purify the eye of the soul establish itself in true being and the one principle of all thing and end at last in that which be no longer hypothetical the power of dialectic therefore be thus great and the end of this path so mighty it must by no means be confound with argument which be alone conversant with opinion : for the former be the guardian of science and the passage to it be through these but the latter be perfectly destitute of disciplinative science to which we may add that the method of reasoning which be found in opinion regard only that which be apparent but the dialectic method endeavor to arrive at the one itself always employ for this purpose step of ascent and at last beautifully end in the nature of the good very different therefore be it from the merely logical method which preside over the demonstrative phantasy be of a secondary nature and be alone please with contentious discussion for the dialectic of plato for the most part employ division and analysis as primary science and as imitate the progression of being from the one and they conversion to it again it likewise sometimes use definition and demonstration and prior to these the definitive method and the divisive prior to this on the contrary the merely logical method which be solely conversant with opinion be deprive of the incontrovertible reasoning of demonstration the follow be a specimen of the analytical method of plato 's dialectic of analysis there be three species for one be a ascent from sensible to the first intelligible a second be a ascent through thing demonstrate and subdemonstrate to undemonstrated and immediate proposition and a third proceeds from hypothesis to unhypothetical principle of the first of these species plato have give a most admirable specimen in the speech of diotima in the banquet for there he ascend from the beauty about body to the beauty in soul from this to the beauty in right discipline from this again to the beauty in law from the beauty in law to the ample sea of beauty -lrb- greek : to polu pelago tou kalou -rrb- and thus proceed he at length arrive at the beautiful itself the second species of analysis be as follow : it be necessary to make the thing investigate the subject of hypothesis to survey such thing as be prior to it and to demonstrate these from thing posterior ascend to such as be prior till we arrive at the first thing and to which we give we assent but begin from this we descend synthetically to the thing investigate of this species the following be a example from the phaedrus of plato it be inquire if the soul be immortal and this be hypothetically admit it be inquire in the next place if it be always move this be demonstrate the next inquiry be if that which be always move be self-moved and this again be demonstrate it be consider whether that which be self-moved be the principle of motion and afterwards if the principle be unbegotten this then be admit as a thing acknowledge and likewise that what be begotten be incorruptible the demonstration of the thing propose be thus collect if there be a principle it be unbegotten and incorruptible that which be self-moved be the principle of motion soul be self-moved soul therefore -lrb- ie the rational soul -rrb- be incorruptible unbegotten and immortal of the third species of analysis which proceed from the hypothetical to that which be unhypothetical plato have give a most beautiful specimen in the first hypothesis of he parmenide for here take for he hypothesis that the one be he proceed through a orderly series of negation which be not privative of they subject but generative of thing which be as it be they opposite till he at length take away the hypothesis that the one be for he deny of it all discourse and every appellation and thus evidently deny of it not only that it be but even negation for all thing be posterior to the one viz thing know knowledge and the instrument of knowledge and thus begin from the hypothetical he end in that which be unhypothetical and truly ineffable have take a general survey both of the great world and the microcosm man i shall close this account of the principal dogma of plato with the outline of he doctrine concern providence and fate as it be a subject of the greatest importance and the difficulty in which it be involve be happily remove by that prince of philosopher in the first place therefore providence accord to common conception be the cause of good to the subject of its care and fate be the cause of a certain connection to generate nature this be admit let we consider what the thing be which be connect of being therefore some have they essence in eternity and other in time but by being whose essence be in eternity i mean those whose energy as well as they essence be eternal and by being essentially temporal those whose essence be always in generation or become to be though this should take place in a infinite time the media between these two extreme be nature which in a certain respect have a essence permanent and better than generation or a flow subsistence but whose energy be measure by time for it be necessary that every procession from thing first to last should be effect through media the medium therefore between these two extreme must either be that which have a eternal essence but any energy indigent of time or on the contrary that which have a temporal essence but a eternal energy it be impossible however for the latter of these to have any subsistence for if this be admit energy would be prior to essence the medium therefore must be that whose essence be eternal but energy temporal and the three order which compose this first middle and last be the intellectual psychical -lrb- or that pertain to soul -rrb- and corporeal for from what have be already say by we concern the gradation of being it be evident that the intellectual order be establish in eternity both in essence and energy that the corporeal order be always in generation or advance to be and this either in a infinite time or in a part of time and that the psychical be indeed eternal in essence but temporal in energy where then shall we rank thing which be distribute either in place or time have a certain coordination and sympathy with each other through connection it be evident that they must be rank among altermotive and corporeal nature for of thing which subsist beyond the order of body some be better both than place and time and other though they energize accord to time appear to be entirely pure from any connection with place hence thing which be govern and connect by fate be entirely altermotive and corporeal if this then be demonstrate it be manifest that admit fate to be a cause of connection we must assert that it preside over altermotive and corporeal nature if therefore we look to that which be the proximate cause of body and thorough which also altermotive being be move breathe and be hold together we shall find that this be nature the energy of which be to generate nourish and increase if therefore this power not only subsist in we and all other animal and plant but prior to partial body there be by a much greater necessity one nature of the world which comprehend and be motive of all body it follow that nature must be the cause of thing connect and that in this we must investigate fate hence fate be nature or that incorporeal power which be the one life of the world preside over body move all thing accord to time and connect the motion of thing that by place and time be distant from each other it be likewise the cause of the mutual sympathy of mortal nature and of they conjunction with such as be eternal for the nature which be in we bind and connect all the part of we body of which also it be a certain fate and as in we body some part have a principal subsistence and other be less principal and the latter be consequent to the former so in the universe the generation of the less principal part be consequent to the motion of the more principal viz the sublunary generation to the period of the celestial body and the circle of the former be the image of the latter hence it be not difficult to see that providence be deity itself the fountain of all good for whence can good be impart to all thing but from divinity so that no other cause of good but deity be as plato say to be assign and in the next place as this cause be superior to all intelligible and sensible nature it be consequently superior to fate whatever too be subject to fate be also under the dominion of providence have its connection indeed from fate but derive the good which it possess from providence but again not all thing that be under the dominion of providence be indigent of fate for intelligible be exempt from its sway fate therefore be profoundly conversant with corporeal nature since connection introduce time and corporeal motion hence plato look to this say in the timaeus that the world be mingle from intellect and necessity the former ruling over the latter for by necessity here he mean the motive cause of body which in other place he call fate and this with great propriety since every body be compel to do whatever it do and to suffer whatever it suffer to heat or to be heat to impart or to receive cold but the elective power be unknown to a corporeal nature so that the necessary and the nonelective may be say to be the peculiarity of body as there be two genus of thing therefore the intelligible and the sensible so likewise there be two kingdom of these that of providence upward which reign over intelligible and sensible and that of fate downward which reign over sensible only providence likewise differ from fate in the same manner as deity from that which be divine indeed but participation and not primarily for in other thing we see that which have a primary subsistence and that which subsist accord to participation thus the light which subsist in the orb of the sun be primary light and that which be in the air accord to participation the latter be derive from the former and life be primarily in the soul but secondarily in the body thus also accord to plato providence be deity but fate be something divine and not a god : for it depend upon providence of which it be as it be the image as providence too be to intelligible so be fate to sensible and alternately as providence be to fate so be intelligible to sensible but intelligible be the first of being and from these other derive they subsistence and hence the order of fate depend on the dominion of providence in the second place let we look to the rational nature itself when correct the inaccuracy of sensible information as when it accuse the sight of deception in see the orb of the sun as not larger than a foot in diameter when it repress the ebullition of anger and exclaim with ulyss endure my heart or when it restrain the wanton tendency of desire to corporeal delight for in all such operation it manifestly subdue the irrational motion both gnostic and appetitive and absolve itself from they as from thing foreign to its nature but it be necessary to investigate the essence of every thing not from its perversion but from its energy accord to nature if therefore reason when it energize in we as reason restrain the shadowy impression of the delight of licentious desire punish the precipitate motion of fury and reprove the sens as full of deception assert that we nothing accurate or see or hear : and if it say this look to its internal reason none of which it know through the body or through corporeal cognition it be evident that accord to this energy it remove itself far from the sens contrary to the decision of which it become separated from those sorrow and delight after this let we direct we attention to another and a better motion of we rational soul when during the tranquillity of the inferior part by a self-convertive energy it see its own essence the power which it contain the harmonic reason from which it consist and the many life of which it be the middle boundary and thus find itself to be a rational world the image of the prior nature from which it proceed but the paradigm of such as be posterior to itself to this energy of the soul theoretic arithmetic and geometry greatly contribute for these remove it from the sens purify the intellect from the irrational form of life with which it be surround and lead it to the incorporeal perception of idea for if these science receive the soul replete with image and know nothing subtile and unattended with material garrulity and if they elucidate reason possess a irrefragable necessity of demonstration and form full of all certainty and immateriality and which by no means call to they aid the inaccuracy of sensible do they not evidently purify we intellectual life from thing which fill we with a privation of intellect and which impede we perception of true be after both these operation of the rational soul let we now survey she highest intelligence through which she see she sister soul in the universe who be allot a residence in the heaven and in the whole of a visible nature accord to the will of the fabricator of the world but above all soul she see intellectual essence and order for a deiform intellect reside above every soul and which also impart to the soul a intellectual habit prior to these however she see those divine monad from which all intellectual multitude receive they union for above all thing unite there must necessarily be unific cause above thing vivify vivify cause above intellectual nature those that impart intellect and above all participant imparticipable nature from all these elevate mode of intelligence it must be obvious to such as be not perfectly blind how the soul leave sense and body behind survey through the project energy of intellect those being that be entirely exempt from all connection with a corporeal nature the rational and intellectual soul therefore in whatever manner it may be move accord to nature be beyond body and sense and hence it must necessarily have a essence separate from both but from this again it become manifest that when it energize accord to its nature it be superior to fate and beyond the reach of its attractive power but that when fall into sense and thing irrational and corporalize it follow downward nature and live with they as with inebriated neighbor then together with they it become subject to the dominion of fate for again it be necessary that there should be a order of being of such a kind as to subsist accord to essence above fate but to be sometimes rank under it accord to habitude for if there be being and such be all intellectual nature which be eternally establish above the law of fate and also which accord to the whole of they life be distribute under the period of fate it be necessary that the medium between these should be that nature which be sometimes above and sometimes under the dominion of fate for the procession of incorporeal nature be much more without a vacuum than that of body the free will therefore of man accord to plato be a rational elective power desiderative of true and apparent good and lead the soul to both through which it ascend and descend err and act with rectitude and hence the elective will be the same with that which characterize we essence accord to this power we differ from divine and mortal nature : for each of these be void of that two-fold inclination the one on account of its excellence be alone establish in true good but the other in apparent good on account of its defect intellect too characterize the one but sense the other and the former as plotinus say be we king but the latter we messenger we therefore be establish in the elective power as a medium and have the ability of tend both to true and apparent good when we tend to the former we follow the guidance of intellect when to the latter that of sense the power therefore which be in we be not capable of all thing for the power which be omnipotent be characterize by unity and on this account be all-powerful because it be one and possess the form of good but the elective power be two-fold and on this account be not able to effect all thing because by it be inclination to true and apparent good it fall short of that nature which be prior to all thing it would however be all-powerful if it have not a elective impulse and be will alone for a life subsist accord to will alone subsist accord to good because the will naturally tend to good and such a life make that which be characteristic in we most powerful and deiform and hence through this the soul accord to plato become divine and in another life in conjunction with deity govern the world and thus much of the outline of the lead dogma of the philosophy of plato in the beginning of this introduction i observe that in draw these outline i should conduct the reader through novel and solitary path solitary indeed they must be since they have be unfrequented from the reign of the emperor justinian to the present time and novel they will doubtless appear to reader of every description and particularly to those who have be nurse as it be in the bosom of matter the pupil of experiment the darling of sense and the legitimate descendant of the earth-born race that war on the olympian god to such as these who have gaze on the dark and deform face of they nurse till they be incapable of behold the light of truth and who be become so drowsy from drink immoderately of the cup of oblivion that they whole life be nothing more than a transmigration from sleep to sleep and from dream to dream like man pass from one bed to another -- to such as these the road through which we have be travel will appear to be a delusive passage and the object which we have survey to be nothing more than fantastic vision see only by the eye of imagination and when see idle and vain as the dream of a shadow the follow argument however may perhaps awaken some few of these who be less lethargic than the rest from the sleep of sense and enable they to elevate they mental eye from the dark mire in which they be plunge and gain a glimpse of this most weighty truth that there be another world of which this be nothing more than a most obscure resemblance and another life of which this be but the fly mockery my present discourse therefore be address to those who consider experiment as the only solid criterion of truth in the first place then these man appear to be ignorant of the invariable law of demonstration properly so call and that the necessary requisite of all demonstrative proposition be these : that they exist as cause be primary more excellent peculiar true and known than the conclusion for every demonstration not only consist of principle prior to other but of such as be eminently first since if the assume proposition may be demonstrate by other assumption such proposition may indeed appear prior to the conclusion but be by no means entitle to the appellation of first other on the contrary which require no demonstration but be of themselves manifest be deservedly esteem the first the truest and the best such indemonstrable truth be call by the ancient axiom from they majesty and authority as the assumption which constitute demonstrative syllogism derive all they force and efficacy from these in the next place they seem not to be sufficiently aware that universal be better than partial demonstration for that demonstration be the more excellent which be derive from the better cause but a universal be more extended and excellent than a partial cause since the arduous investigation of the why in any subject be only stop by the arrival at universal thus if we desire to know why the outward angle of a triangle be equal to four right angle and it be answer because the triangle be isosceles we again ask but why because isosceles and if it be reply because it be a triangle we may again inquire but why because a triangle to which we finally answer because a triangle be a right-lined figure and here we inquiry rest at that universal idea which embrace every precede particular one and be contain in no other more general and comprehensive than itself add too that the demonstration of particulars be almost the demonstration of infinite of universal the demonstration of finite and of infinite there can be no science that demonstration likewise be the best which furnish the mind with the most ample knowledge and this be alone the province of universal we may also add that he who know universal know particulars likewise in capacity but we can not infer that he who have the best knowledge of particulars know any thing of universal and lastly that which be universal be the object of intellect and reason but particulars be coordinate to the perception of sense but here perhaps the experimentalist will say admit all this to be true yet we no otherwise obtain a perception of these universal than by a induction of particulars and abstraction from sensible to this i answer that the universal which be the proper object of science be not by any mean the offspring of abstraction and induction be no otherwise subservient to its existence than a exciting cause for if scientific conclusion be indubitable if the truth of demonstration be necessary and eternal this universal be truly all and not like that gain by abstraction limit to a certain number of particulars thus the proposition that the angle of every triangle be equal to two right if it be indubitably true that be if the term every in it really include all triangle can not be the result of any abstraction for this however extend it may be be limited and fall far short of universal comprehension whence be it then that the dianoetic power conclude thus confidently that the proposition be true of all triangle for if it be say that the mind after have abstract triangle from a certain number of particulars add from itself what be want to complete the all in the first place no man i believe will say that any such operation as this take place in he mind when he first learn this proposition and in the next place if this should be grant it would follow that such proposition be a mere fiction since it be uncertain whether that which be add to complete the all be truly add and thus the conclusion will no longer be indubitably necessary in short if the word all and every with which every page of theoretic mathematics be full mean what they be conceive by all man to mean and if the universal which they signify be the proper object of science such universal must subsist in the soul prior to the energy of sense hence it will follow that induction be no otherwise subservient to science than as it produce credibility in axiom and petition and this by exciting the universal conception of these latent in the soul the particulars therefore of which a induction be make in order to produce science must be so simple that they may be immediately apprehend and that the universal may be predicate of they without hesitation the particulars of the experimentalist be not of this kind and therefore never can be source of science truly so call of this however the man of experiment appear to be totally ignorant and in consequence of this he be likewise ignorant that part can only be truly know through whole and that this be particularly the case with part when they belong to a whole which as we have already observe from comprehend in itself the part which it produce be call a whole prior to part as he therefore would by no means merit the appellation of a physician who should attempt to cure any part of the human body without a previous knowledge of the whole so neither can he know any thing truly of the vegetable life of plant who have not a previous knowledge of that vegetable life which subsist in the earth as a whole prior to because the principle and cause of all partial vegetable life and who still prior to this have not a knowledge of that greater whole of this kind which subsist in nature herself nor as hippocrate justly observe can he know any thing truly of the nature of the human body who be ignorant what nature be consider as a great comprehend whole and if this be true and it be so most indubitably with all physiological inquiry how much more must it be the case with respect to a knowledge of those incorporeal form to which we ascend in the first part of this introduction and which in consequence of proceed from whole entirely exempt from body be participate by it with much greater obscurity and imperfection here then be the great difference and a mighty one it be between the knowledge gain by the most elaborate experiment and that acquire by scientific reasoning found on the spontaneous unperverted and self-luminous conception of the soul the former do not even lead its votary up to that one nature of the earth from which the nature of all the animal and plant on its surface and of all the mineral and metal in its interior part blossom as from a perennial root the latter conduct its votary through all the several mundane whole up to that great whole the world itself and thence lead he through the luminous order of incorporeal whole to that vast whole of whole in which all other whole be centre and root and which be no other than the principle of all principle and the fountain of deity itself no less remarkable likewise be the difference between the tendency of the two pursuit for the one elevate the soul to the most luminous height and to that great ineffable which be beyond all altitude but the other be the cause of a mighty calamity to the soul since accord to the elegant expression of plutarch it extinguish she principal and brightest eye the knowledge of divinity in short the one lead to all that be grand sublime and splendid in the universe the other to all that be little groveling -lrb- 14 -rrb- and dark the one be the parent of the most pure and ardent piety the genuine progeny of the other be impiety and atheism and in fine the one confer on its votary the most sincere permanent and exalted delight the other continual disappointment and unceasing molestation ----------------- -lrb- 14 -rrb- that this must be the tendency of experiment when prosecute as the criterion of truth be evident from what bacon the prince of modern philosophy say in the 104th aphorism of he novum organum that baseless fabric of a vision for he there sagely observe that wing be not to be add to the human intellect but rather lead and weight that all its leap and flight may be restrain that this be not yet do but that when it be we may entertain better hope respect the science itaque hominum intellectuus non plumae addendae sed plumbum potius et pondera ut cohibeant omnem saltum et volatum atque hoc adhuc factum non est quum vero factum fuerit melius de scientii sperare licebit a considerable portion of lead must certainly have be add to the intellect of bacon when he write this aphorism ----------------- if such then be the consequence such the tendency of experimental inquiry when prosecute as the criterion of truth and daily experience -lrb- 15 -rrb- unhappily show that they be there can be no other remedy for this enormous evil than the intellectual philosophy of plato so obviously excellent indeed be the tendency of this philosophy that its author for a period of more than two thousand year have be universally celebrate by the epithet of divine such too be its preeminence that it may be show without much difficulty that the greatest man of antiquity from the time in which its salutary light first bless the human race have be more or less imbue with its sacred principle have be more or less the votary of its divine truth thus to mention a few from among a countless multitude in the catalogue of those endue with sovereign power it have for its votary dion of siracusian julian the roman and chosro the persian emperor among the leader of army it have chabria and phocion those brave general of the athenian among mathematician those lead star of science eudoxus archimede -lrb- 16 -rrb- and euclid among biographer the inimitable plutarch among physician the admirable galen among rhetorician those unrivaled orator demosthene and cicero among critic that prince of philologist longinus and among poet the most learn and majestic virgil instance though not equally illustrious yet approximate to these in splendor may doubtless be adduce after the fall of the roman empire but then they have be form on these great ancient as model and be consequently only rivulet from platonic stream and instance of excellence in philosophic attainment similar to those among the greek might have be enumerate among the modern if the hand of barbaric despotism have not compel philosophy to retire into the deepest solitude by demolish she school and involve the human intellect in cimmerian darkness in we own country however though no one appear to have wholly devoted himself to the study of this philosophy and he who do not will never penetrate its depths yet we have a few bright example of no common proficiency in its more accessible part ----------------- -lrb- 15 -rrb- i never yet know a man who make experiment the test of truth and i have know many such that be not atheistically inclined -lrb- 16 -rrb- i have rank archimede among the platonist because he cultivate the mathematical science platonically as be evident from the testimony of plutarch in he life of marcellus p 307 for he there inform we that archimede consider the be busy about mechanic and in short every art which be connect with the common purpose of life as ignoble and illiberal and that those thing alone be object of he ambition with which the beautiful and the excellent be present unmingled with the necessary the great accuracy and elegance in the demonstration of euclid and archimede which have not be equal by any of we greatest modern mathematician be derive from a deep conviction of this important truth on the other hand modern mathematician through a profound ignorance of this divine truth and look to nothing but the want and convenience of the animal life of man as if the gratification of he sens be he only end have corrupt pure geometry by mingle with it algebraical calculation and through eagerness to reduce it as much as possible to practical purpose have more anxiously seek after conciseness than accuracy facility than elegance of geometrical demonstration ----------------- the instance i allude to be shaftesbury akenside harri petwin and sydenham so splendid be the specimen of philosophic ability display by these writer like the fair dawn of same unclouded morning that we have only deeply to regret that the sun of they genius sit before we be gladden with its effulgence have it shine with its full strength the writer of this introduction would not have attempt either to translate the work or elucidate the doctrine of plato but though it rise with vigor it disperse not the cloud in which its light be gradually involve and the eye in vain anxiously wait for it be meridian beam in short the principle of the philosophy of plato be of all other the most friendly to true piety pure morality solid learning and sound government for as it be scientific in all its part and in these part comprehend all that can be know by man in theology and ethic and all that be necessary for he to know in physics it must consequently contain in itself the source of all that be great and good both to individual and community must necessarily exalt while it benefit and deify while it exalt we have say that this philosophy at first shone forth through plato with a occult and venerable splendor and it be owe to the hidden manner in which it be deliver by he that its depth be not fathom till many age after it be promulgation and when fathom be treat by superficial reader with ridicule and contempt plato indeed be not singular in deliver he philosophy occultly : for this be the custom of all the great ancient a custom not originate from a wish to become tyrant in knowledge and keep the multitude in ignorance but from a profound conviction that the sublimest truth be profane when clearly unfold to the vulgar this indeed must necessarily follow since as socrate in plato justly observe it be not lawful for the pure to be touch by the impure and the multitude be neither purify from the defilement of vice nor the darkness of twofold ignorance hence while they be thus doubly impure it be as impossible for they to perceive the splendor of truth as for a eye bury in mire to survey the light of day the depth of this philosophy then do not appear to have be perfectly penetrate except by the immediate disciple of plato for more than five hundred year after its first propagation for though crantor atticus albinus galen and plutarch be man of great genius and make no common proficiency in philosophic attainment yet they appear not to have develop the profundity of plato 's conception they withdraw not the veil which cover he secret meaning like the curtain which guard the adytum of temple from the profane eye and they see not that all behind the veil be luminous and that there divine spectacles -lrb- 17 -rrb- every where present themselves to the view this task be reserve for man who be bear indeed in a baser age but who be allot a nature similar to they leader be the true interpreter of he mystic speculation the most conspicuous of these be the great plotinus the most learn porphyry the divine jamblichus the most acute syrianus proclus the consummation of philosophic excellence the magnificent hierocle the concisely elegant sallust and the most inquisitive damascius by these man who be truly link of the golden chain of deity all that be sublime all that be mystic in the doctrine of plato -lrb- and they be replete with both these in a transcendent degree -rrb- be free from its obscurity and unfold into the most please and admirable light they labor however have be ungratefully receive the beautiful light which they benevolently disclose have hitherto unnoticed illumined philosophy in she desolate retreat like a lamp shine on some venerable statue amidst dark and solitary ruin the prediction of the master have be unhappily fulfil in these he most excellent disciple for a attempt of this kind say he -lrb- 18 -rrb- will only be beneficial to a few who from small vestige previously demonstrate be themselves able to discover these abstruse particulars but with respect to the rest of mankind some it will fill with a contempt by no means elegant and other with a lofty and arrogant hope that they shall now learn certain excellent thing thus with respect to these admirable man the last and the most legitimate of the follower of plato some from be entirely ignorant of the abstruse dogma of plato and find these interpreter full of conception which be by no means obvious to every one in the writings of that philosopher have immediately conclude that such conception be mere jargon and revery that they be not truly platonic and that they be nothing more than stream which though originally derive from a pure fountain have become polluted by distance from they source other who pay attention to nothing but the most exquisite purity of language look down with contempt upon every writer who live after the fall of the macedonian empire as if dignity and weight of sentiment be inseparable from splendid and accurate diction or as if it be impossible for elegant writer to exist in a degenerate age so far be this from be the case that though the style of plotinus -lrb- 19 -rrb- and jamblichus -lrb- 20 -rrb- be by no means to be compare with that of plato yet this inferiority be lose in the depth and sublimity of they conception and be as little regard by the intelligent reader as mote in a sunbeam by the eye that gladly turn itself to the solar light -------------- -lrb- 17 -rrb- see my dissertation on the mystery -lrb- 18 -rrb- see the 7th epistle of plato -lrb- 19 -rrb- it would seem that those intemperate critic who have think proper to revile plotinus the leader of the latter platonist have pay no attention to the testimony of longinus concern this most wonderful man as preserve by porphyry in he life of he for longinus there say that though he do not entirely accede to many of he hypothesis yet he exceedingly admire and love the form of he write the density of he conception and the philosophic manner in which he question be disposed and in another place he say plotinus as it seem have explain the pythagoric and platonic principle more clearly than those that be prior to he for neither be the writings of numenius cronius moderatus and thrasyllus to be compare with those of plotinus on this subject after such a testimony as this from such a consummate critic as longinus the writings of plotinus have nothing to fear from the imbecile censure of modern critic i shall only further observe that longinus in the above testimony do not give the least hint of he have find any polluted stream or corruption of the doctrine of plato in the work of plotinus there be not indeed the least vestige of he entertaining any such opinion in any part of what he have say about this most extraordinary man this discovery be reserve for the more acute critic of modern time who by a happiness of conjecture unknown to the ancient and the assistance of a good index can in a few day penetrate the meaning of the profoundest writer of antiquity and bid defiance even to the decision of longinus -lrb- 20 -rrb- of this most divine man who be justly say by the emperor julian to have be posterior indeed in time but not in genius even to plato himself see the life which i have give in the history of the restoration of the platonic theology in the second vol of my proclus on euclid ---------------------- as to the style of porphyry when we consider that he be the disciple of longinus whom eunapius elegantly call a certain living library and walk museum it be but reasonable to suppose that he imbibe some portion of he master 's excellence in write that he do so be abundantly evident from the testimony of eunapius who particularly commend he style for its clearness purity and grace hence he say porphyry be let down to man like a mercurial chain through he various erudition unfold every thing into perspicuity and purity and in another place he speak of he as abound with all the grace of diction and as the only one that exhibit and proclaim the praise of he master with respect to the style of proclus it be pure clear and elegant like that of dionysius halicarnassus but be much more copious and magnificent that of hierocle be venerable and majestic and nearly equal the style of the greatest ancient that of sallust possess a accuracy and a pregnant brevity which can not easily be distinguish from the composition of the stagirite and lastly that of damascius be clear and accurate and highly worthy a most investigate mind other again have fill themselves with a vain confidence from reading of commentary of these admirable interpreter and have in a short time consider themselves superior to they master this be the case with ficinus picus dr henry moore and other pseudo platonist they contemporary who in order to combine christianity with the doctrine of plato reject some of he most important tenet and perverted other and thus corrupt one of these system and afford no real benefit to the other but who be the man by whom these latter interpreter of plato be revile when and whence do this defamation originate be it when the fierce champion for the trinity flee from galilee to the grove of academus and invoke but in vain the assistance of philosophy when the tremble grove confess its fright the wood-nymph start at the sight ilissus backward urg would he course and rush would indignant to he source be it because that mitred sophist warburton think fit to talk of the polluted stream of the alexandrian school without know any thing of the source whence those stream be derive or be it because some heavy german critic who know nothing beyond a verb in mi presume to grunt at these venerable hero whatever be its source and whenever it originate for i have not be able to discover either this however be certain that it owe its be to the most profound ignorance or the most artful sophistry and that its origin be no less contemptible than obscure for let we but for a moment consider the advantage which these latter platonist possess beyond any of they modern reviler in the first place they have the felicity of have the greek for they native language and must therefore as they be confessedly learn man have understand that language incomparably better than any man since the time in which the ancient greek be a living tongue in the next place they have book to consult write by the immediate disciple of plato which have be lose for upward of a thousand year besides many pythagoric writings from which plato himself derive most of he more sublime dogma hence we find the work of parmenide empedocle the electic zeno speusippus xenocrate and many other illustrious philosopher of the highest antiquity who be either genuine platonist or the source of platonism be continually cite by these most excellent interpreter and in the third place they unite the greatest purity of life to the most piercing vigor of intellect now when it be consider that the philosophy to the study of which these great man devote they life be professedly deliver by its author in obscurity that aristotle himself study it for twenty year and that it be no uncommon thing as plato inform we in one of he epistle to find student unable to comprehend its sublimest tenet even in a longer period than this -- when all these circumstance be consider what must we think of the arrogance not to say impudence of man in the seventeenth eighteenth and nineteenth century who have dare to calumniate these great master of wisdom of man with whom the greek be no native language who have no such book to consult as those have whom they revile who have never think even in a dream of make the acquisition of wisdom the great object of they life and who in short have commit that most baneful error of mistake philology for philosophy and word for thing when such as these dare to defame man who may be justly rank among the greatest and wisest of the ancient what else can be say than that they be the legitimate descendant of the suitor of penelope whom in the animated language of ulyss law or divine or human fail would to move or shame of man or dread of god above : heedless alike of infamy or praise or fame 's eternal voice in future day -lrb- 21 -rrb- ----------------- -lrb- 21 -rrb- pope 's odyssey book xxii v 47 & c ----------------- but it be now time to present the reader with a general view of the work of plato and also to speak of the preamble digression and style of they author and of the follow translation in accomplish the first of these i shall avail myself of the synopsis of mr sydenham take the liberty at the same time of correct it where it appear to be erroneous and of make addition to it where it appear to be deficient the dialogue of plato be of various kind not only with regard to those different matter which be the subject of they but in respect of the manner also in which they be compose or frame and of the form under which they make they appearance to the reader it will therefore as i imagine be not improper in pursuance of the admonition give we by plato himself in he dialogue name phaedrus -lrb- 22 -rrb- and in imitation of the example set we by the ancient platonist to distinguish the several kind by divide they first into the most general and then subdivide into the subordinate till we come to those lower species that particularly and precisely denote the nature of the several dialogue and from which they ought to take they respective denomination ---------------- -lrb- 22 -rrb- whoever be unable to divide and distinguish thing into they several sort or species and on the other hand refer every particular to its proper species to comprehend they all in one general idea will never understand any writings of which those thing be the subject like a true critic upon those high principle of art to which the human understanding reach we have think proper here to paraphrase this passage for the sake of give to every part of so important a sentence its full force agreeably to the tenor of plato 's doctrine and in order to initiate we reader into a way of think that probably many of they be as yet unacquainted with ---------------- the most general division of the writings of plato be into those of the sceptical kind and those of they dogmatical in the former sort nothing be expressly either prove or assert some philosophical question only be consider and examine and the reader be leave to himself to draw such conclusion and discover such truth as the philosopher mean to insinuate this be do either in the way of inquiry or in the way of controversy and dispute in the way of controversy be carry on all such dialogue as tend to eradicate false opinion and that either indirectly by involve they in difficulty and embarrass the maintainer of they or directly by confute they in the way of inquiry proceed those whose tendency be to raise in the mind right opinion and that either by exciting to the pursuit of some part of wisdom and show in what manner to investigate it or by lead the way and help the mind forward in the search and this be effect by a process through oppose argument -lrb- 23 -rrb- ------------------ -lrb- 23 -rrb- it be necessary to observe that plato in the parmenide call all that part of he dialectic which proceed through opposite argument a exercise and wander ------------------ the dialogue of the other kind the dogmatical or didactic teach explicitly some point of doctrine and this they do either by lay it down in the authoritative way or by prove it in the way of reason and argument in the authoritative way the doctrine be deliver sometimes by the speaker himself magisterially at other time as derive to he by tradition from wise man the argumentative or demonstrative method of teaching use by plato proceeds in all the dialectic way divide define demonstrate and analyze and the object of it consist in explore truth alone accord to this division be frame the follow scheme or table : dialogue -lrb- 24 -rrb- sceptical disputative embarrassing confute inquisitive exciting assist dogmatical demonstrative analytical inductional authoritative magisterial traditional -----------------_NN -lrb- 24 -rrb- we have give we by diogene laertius another division of the character as he call they of plato 's writings different from that exhibit in the scheme above this we have think proper to subjoin on account of its antiquity and general reception dialogue diadectic speculative physical logical practical ethical political inquisitive gymnastic maieutic peirastic agonistic endeietic anatreptic the learn reader will observe the latter half of the dialogue accord to this scheme to be describe by metaphor take from the gymnastic art : the dialogue here term gymnastic be imagine to bear a similitude to that exercise the agonistic to the combat in the lowest subdivision indeed the word maieutic be a metaphor of another kind fully explain in plato 's theaetetus : the maieutic dialogue however be suppose to resemble give the rudiment of the art as the peirastic be to represent a skirmish or trial of proficiency the endeietic be it seem liken to the exhibit a specimen of skill and the anatreptic to present the spectacle of a thorough defeat or sound drubbing the principal reason why we contented not ourselves with this account of the difference between the dialogue of plato be the capital error there commit in the first subdivision of course extend itself through the latter this error consist in divide the didactic dialogue with regard to they subject-matter while those of the inquisitive sort be divide with respect to the manner of they composition so that the subdivision fall not with any propriety under one and the same general head besides a novice in the work of plato might hence be lead naturally to suppose that the dogmatical or didactic dialogue be all of they write in the same manner and that the other those of the inquisitive kind by we term sceptical have no particular subject at all or if they have that they subject be different from those of the didactic dialogue and be consequently unphilosophical now every one of the supposition here mention be far from be true ---------------- the philosopher in thus vary he manner and diversify he writings into these several kind mean not merely to entertain with they variety not to teach on different occasion with more or less plainness and perspicuity not yet to insinuate different degree of certainty in the doctrine themselves : but he take this method as a consummate master of the art of composition in the dialogue-way of write from the different character of the speaker as from different element in the frame of these dramatic dialogue or different ingredient in they mixture produce some peculiar genius and turn of temper as it be in each socrate indeed be in almost all of they the principal speaker : but when he fall into the company of some arrogant sophist when the modest wisdom and clear science of the one be contrast with the confident ignorance and blind opinionativeness of the other dispute and controversy must of course arise : where the false pretender can not fail of be either puzzle or confute to puzzle he only be sufficient if there be no other person present because such a man can never be confute in he own opinion : but when there be a audience round they in danger of be mislead by sophistry into error then be the true philosopher to exert he utmost and the vain sophist to be convict and expose in some dialogue plato represent he great master mix in conversation with young man of the best family in the commonwealth when these happen to have docile disposition and fair mind then be occasion give to the philosopher to call forth -lrb- 25 -rrb- the latent seed of wisdom and to cultivate the noble plant with true doctrine in the affable and familiar way of joint inquiry to this be owe the inquisitive genius of such dialogue : where by a seeming equality in the conversation the curiosity or zeal of the mere stranger be excite that of the disciple be encouraged and by proper question the mind be aid and forward in the search of truth ----------------- -lrb- 25 -rrb- we require exhortation that we may be lead to true good dissuasion that we may be turn from thing truly evil obstetrication that we may draw forth we unperverted conception and confutation that we may be purify from two-fold ignorance ----------------- at other time the philosophic hero of these dialogue be introduce in a higher character engage in discourse with man of more improved understanding and enlighten mind at such season he have a opportunity of teaching in a more explicit manner and of discover the reason of thing : for to such a audience truth be due and all demonstration -lrb- 26 -rrb- possible in the teaching it hence in the dialogue compose of these person naturally arise the justly argumentative or demonstrative genius and this as we have before observe accord to all the dialectic method ----------------- -lrb- 26 -rrb- the platonist rightly observe that socrate in these case make use of demonstrative and just reasoning -lrb- -lrb- greek : apodeiktikou -rrb- -rrb- whereas to the novice he be contented with argument only probable -lrb- -lrb- greek : pithanoi -rrb- -rrb- and against the litigious sophist often employ such as be -lrb- greek : eristikous -rrb- puzzling and contentious ----------------- but when the doctrine to be teach admit not of demonstration of which kind be the doctrine of antiquity be only traditional and a matter of belief and the doctrine of law be injunctional and the matter of obedience the air of authority be then assume : in the former case the doctrine be traditionally hand down to other from the authority of ancient sage in the latter be magisterially pronounce with the authority of a legislator -lrb- 27 -rrb- ----------------- -lrb- 27 -rrb- it be necessary to observe that in those dialogue in which socrate be indeed introduce but sustain a inferior part he be present to we view as a learner and not as a teacher and this be the case in the parmenide and timaeus for by the former of these philosopher he be instruct in the most abtruse theological dogma and by the latter in the whole of physiology ----------------- thus much for the manner in which the dialogue of plato be severally compose and the cast of genius give they in they composition the form under which they appear or the external character that mark they be of three sort : either purely dramatic like the dialogue of tragedy or comedy or purely narrative where a former conversation be suppose to be commit to write and communicate to some absent friend or of the mixed kind like a narration in dramatic poem where be recite to some person present the story of thing past have thus divide the dialogue of plato in respect of that inward form or composition which create they genius and again with reference to that outward form which mark they like flower and other vegetable with a certain character we be further to make a division of they with regard to they subject and they design begin with they design or end because for the sake of this be all the subject choose the end of all the writings of plato be that which be the end of all true philosophy or wisdom the perfection and the happiness of man man therefore be the general subject and the first business of philosophy must be to inquire what be that be call man who be to be make happy and what be he nature in the perfection of which be place he happiness as however in the precede part of this introduction we have endeavor to give the outline of plato 's doctrine concern man it be unnecessary in this place to say any thing further on that subject the dialogue of plato therefore with respect to they subject may be divide into the speculative the practical and such as be of a mixed nature the subject of these last be either general comprehend both the other or differential distinguish they the general subject be either fundamental or final : those of the fundamental kind be philosophy human nature the soul of man of the final kind be love beauty good the differential regard knowledge as it stand related to practice in which be consider two question : one of which be whether virtue be to he teach the other be whether error in the will depend on error in the judgment the subject of the speculative dialogue relate either to word or to thing of the former sort be etymology sophistry rhetoric poetry of the latter sort be science true be the principle of mind outward nature the practical subject relate either to private conduct and the government of the mind over the whole man or to he duty towards other in he several relation or to the government of a civil state and the public conduct of a whole people under these three head rank in order the particular subject practical virtue in general sanctity temperance fortitude justice friendship patriotism piety the ruling mind in a civil government the frame and order of a state law in general and lastly those rule of government and of public conduct the civil law thus for the sake of give the reader a scientific that be a comprehensive and at the same time a distinct view of plato 's writings we have attempt to exhibit to he they just and natural distinction whether he choose to consider they with regard to they inward form or essence they outward form or appearance they matter or they end : that be in those more familiar term we have use in this synopsis they genius they character they subject and they design and here it be requisite to observe that as it be the characteristic of the highest good to be universally beneficial though some thing be benefit by it more and other less in consequence of they greater or less aptitude to receive it in like manner the dialogue of plato be so largely stamped with the character of sovereign good that they be calculate to benefit in a certain degree even those who be incapable of penetrate they profundity they can tame a savage sophist like thrasymachus in the republic humble the arrogance even of those who be ignorant of they ignorance make those to become proficient in political who will never arrive at theoretic virtue and in short like the illuminations of deity wherever there be any portion of aptitude in they recipient they purify irradiate and exalt after this general view of the dialogue of plato let we in the next place consider they preamble the digression with which they abound and the character of the style in which they be write with respect to the first of these the preamble however superfluous they may at first sight appear they will be find on a closer inspection necessary to the design of the dialogue which they accompany thus the prefatory part of the timaeus unfold in image agreeably to the pythagoric custom the theory of the world and the first part of the parmenide or the discussion of idea be in fact merely a preamble to the second part or the speculation of the one to which however it be essentially preparatory hence as plutarch say when he speak of plato 's dialogue on the atlantic island : these preamble be superb gate and magnificent court with which he purposely embellish he great edifice that nothing may be want to they beauty and that all may be equally splendid he act as dacier well observe like a great prince who when he build a sumptuous palace adorn -lrb- in the language of pindar -rrb- the vestibule with golden pillar for it be fit that what be first see should be splendid and magnificent and should as it be perspicuously announce all that grandeur which afterwards present itself to the view with respect to the frequent digression in he dialogue these also when accurately examine will be find to be no less subservient to the lead design of the dialogue in which they be introduce at the same time that they afford a please relaxation to the mind from the labor of severe investigation hence plato by the most happy and enchanting art contrive to lead the reader to the temple of truth through the delightful grove and valley of the grace in short this circuitous course when attentively consider will be find to be the shortest road by which he could conduct the reader to the desire end : for in accomplish this it be necessary to regard not that road which be most straight in the nature of thing or abstractedly consider but that which be most direct in the progression of human understanding with respect to the style of plato though it form in reality the most inconsiderable part of the merit of he writings style in all philosophical work be the last thing that should be attend to yet even in this plato may contend for the palm of excellence with the most renowned master of diction hence we find that he style be the admiration of the finest writer of antiquity accord to ammianus jupiter himself would not speak otherwise if he be to converse in the attic tongue aristotle consider he style as a medium between poetry and prose cicero no less praise he for the excellence of he diction than the profundity of he conception and longinus call he with respect to he language the rival of homer hence he be consider by this prince of critic as derive into himself abundant stream from the homeric fountain and be compare by he in he rivalship of homer to a new antagonist who enter the list against one that be already the object of universal admiration notwithstanding this praise however plato have be accuse as longinus inform we of be frequently hurry away as by a certain bacchic fury of word to immoderate and unpleasant metaphor and a allegoric magnificence of diction longinus excuse this by say that whatever naturally excel in magnitude possess very little of purity for that say he which be in every respect accurate be in danger of littleness he add and may not this also be necessary that those of a abject and moderate genius because they never encounter danger nor aspire after the summit of excellence be for the most part without error and remain in security but that great thing become insecure through they magnitude indeed it appear to I that whenever this exuberance this bacchic fury occur in the diction of plato it be owe to the magnitude of the inspiring influence of deity with which he be then replete for that he sometimes write from divine inspiration be evident from he own confession in the phaedrus a great part of which be not so much like a orderly discourse as a dithyrambic poem such a style therefore as it be the progeny of divine mania which as plato justly observe be better than all human prudence spontaneously adapt itself to its produce cause imitate a supernatural power as far as this can be effect by word and thus necessarily become magnificent vehement and exuberant for such be the characteristic of its source all judge of composition however both ancient and modern be agree that he style be in general graceful and pure and that it be sublime without be impetuous and rapid it be indeed no less harmonious than elevated no less accurate -lrb- 27 -rrb- than magnificent it combine the force of the greatest orator with the grace of the first of poet and in short be a river to which those justly celebrated line of denham may be most pertinently apply : tho ' deep yet clear tho ' gentle yet not dull strong without rage without o'erfow full ----------------- -lrb- 27 -rrb- the reader will see from the note on plato 's dialogue and particularly from the note on the parmenide and timaeus that the style of that philosopher possess a accuracy which be not to be find in any modern writer a accuracy of such a wonderful nature that the word be exactly commensurate with the sense hence the reader who have happily penetrate he profundity find with astonishment that another word could not have be add without be superfluous nor one word take away without injure the sense the same observation may also be apply to the style of aristotle ----------------- have thus consider the philosophy of plato give a general view of he writings and make some observation on he style it only now remain to speak of the follow arrangement of he dialogue and translation of he work and then with a few appropriate observation to close this introduction as no accurate and scientific arrangement then of these dialogue have be transmit to we from the ancient i be under the necessity of adopt a arrangement of my own which i trust be not unscientific however inferior it may be to that which be doubtless make though unfortunately lose by the latter interpreter of plato in my arrangement therefore i have imitate the order of the universe in which as i have already observe whole precede part and universal particulars hence i have place those dialogue first which rank as whole or have the relation of a system and afterwards those in which these system be branch out into particulars thus after the first alcibiade which may be call and appear to have be generally consider by the ancient a introduction to the whole of plato 's philosophy i have place the republic and the law which may be say to comprehend systematically the moral and politics of plato after these i have rank the timaeus which contain the whole of he physiology and together with it the critia because of its connection with the timaeus the next in order be the parmenide which contain a system of he theology thus far this arrangement be conformable to the natural progress of the human mind in the acquisition of the sublimest knowledge the subsequent arrangement principally regard the order of thing after the parmenide then the sophista phaedrus greater hippia and banquet follow which may be consider as so many lesser whole subordinate to and comprehend in the parmenide which like the universe itself be a whole of whole for in the sophista be itself be investigate in the banquet love itself and in the phaedrus beauty itself all which be intelligible form and be consequently contain in the parmenide in which the whole extent of the intelligible be unfold the greater hippia be class with the phaedrus because in the latter the whole series of the beautiful be discuss and in the former that which subsist in soul after these follow the theaetetus in which science consider as subsist in soul be investigate science itself accord to its first subsistence have be previously celebrate by socrate in one part of the phaedrus the politicus and mino which follow next may be consider as ramification from the law and in short all the follow dialogue either consider more particularly the dogma which be systematically comprehend in those already enumerate or naturally flow from they as they original source as it do not however appear possible to arrange these dialogue which rank as part in the same accurate order as those which we consider as whole it be think better to class they either accord to they agreement in one particular circumstance as the phaedo apology and crito all which relate to the death of socrate and as the meno and protagora which relate to the question whether virtue can be teach or accord to they agreement in character as the lesser hippia and euthydemus which be anatreptic and the theage lach and lysis which be maieutic dialogue the cratylus be rank in the last place not so much because the subject of it be etymology as because a great part of it be deeply theological for by this arrangement after have ascend to all the divine order and they ineffable principle in the parmenide and thence descend in a regular series to the human soul in the subsequent dialogue the reader be again lead back to deity in this dialogue and thus imitate the order which all being observe that of incessantly return to the principle whence they fly after the dialogue -lrb- 28 -rrb- follow the epistle of plato which be in every respect worthy that prince of all true philosopher they be not only write with great elegance and occasionally with magnificence of diction but with all the become dignity of a mind conscious of its superior endowment and all the authority of a master in philosophy they be likewise replete with many admirable political observation and contain some of he most abstruse dogma which though deliver enigmatically yet the manner in which they be deliver elucidate at the same time that it be elucidate by what be say of these dogma in he more theological dialogue ----------------- -lrb- 28 -rrb- as i profess to give the reader a translation of the genuine work of plato only i have not translate the axiochus demodoeus sisyphus & c as these be evidently spurious dialogue ----------------- with respect to the follow translation it be necessary to observe in the first place than the number of legitimate dialogue of plato be fifty-five for though the republic form but one treatise and the law another yet the former consist of ten and the latter of twelve book and each of these book be a dialogue hence as there be thirty-three dialogue besides the law and the republic fifty-five will as we have say be the amount of the whole of these fifty-five the nine follow have be translate by mr sydenham viz the first and second alcibiade the greater and lesser hippia the banquet -lrb- except the speech of alcibiade -rrb- the philebus the meno the io and the rival -lrb- 29 -rrb- i have already observe and with deep regret that this excellent though unfortunate scholar die before he have make that proficiency in the philosophy of plato which might have be reasonably expect from so fair a beginning i personally know he only in the decline of life when he mental power be not only considerably impaired by age but greatly injure by calamity he life have be very stormy he circumstance for many year precede he death be indigent he patron be by no means liberal and he real friend be neither numerous nor affluent he begin the study of plato as he himself inform I when he have considerably pass the meridian of life and with most unfortunate prejudice against he best disciple which i attempt to remove during my acquaintance with he and partly succeed in the attempt but infirmity and death prevent its completion under such circumstance it be not to be expect that he would fathom the profundity of plato 's conception and arrive at the summit of philosophic attainment i see however that he talent and he natural disposition be such as might have rank he among the best of plato 's interpreter if he have not yield to the pressure of calamity if he have not nourished such baneful prejudice and if he have not neglect philosophy in the early part of life have this happen my labor would have be considerably lessen or perhaps render entirely unnecessary and he name would have be transmit to posterity with undecaying renown as this unfortunately do not happen i have be under the necessity of diligently examine and compare with the original all those part of the dialogue which he translate that be more deeply philosophical or that contain any thing of the theology of plato in these as might be expect i find he greatly deficient i find he sometimes mistake the meaning through ignorance of plato 's more sublime tenet and at other time pervert it in order to favor some opinion of he own he translation however of other part which be not so abstruse be excellent in these he not only present the reader faithfully with the matter but likewise with the genuine manner of plato the note too which accompany the translation of these part generally exhibit just criticism and extensive learn a elegant taste and a genius naturally philosophic of these note i have preserve as much as be consistent with the limit and design of the follow work ----------------- -lrb- 29 -rrb- in the note on the above-mentioned nine dialogue those write by mr sydenham be sign s and those by myself t ----------------- of the translation of the republic by dr spen it be necessary to observe that a considerable part of it be very faithfully execute but that in the more abstruse part it be inaccurate and that it every where abound with scotticism which offend a english ear and vulgarism which be no less disgraceful to the translator than disgust to the reader suffice it therefore to say of this version that i have adopt it wherever i find it could with propriety be adopt and give my own translation where it be otherwise of the ten dialogue translate by dacier i can say nothing with accuracy because i have no knowledge whatever of the french language but if any judgment may be form of this work from a translation of it into english i will be bold to say that it be by no means literal and that he very frequently mistake the sense of the original from this translation therefore i could derive but little assistance some however i have derive and that little i willingly acknowledge in translate the rest of plato 's work and this as the reader may easily see form by far the greatest part of they i have have no assistance from any translation except that of ficinus the general excellency of which be well know to every student of plato arise not only from he possess a knowledge of platonism superior to that of any translator that have follow he but likewise from he have make this translation from a very valuable manuscript in the medicean library which be now no longer to be find i have however avail myself of the learn labor of the editor of various dialogue of plato such as the edition of the rival euthyphro apology crito and phaedo by forster of the first and second alcibiade and hipparchus by etwall of the meno first alcibiade phaedo and phaedrus print at vienna 1784 of the cratylus and theaetetus by fischer of the republic by massey and of the euthydemus and gorgia by dr routh president of magdalen college oxford this last editor have enrich he edition of these two dialogue with very valuable and copious philological and critical note in which he have display no less learning than judgment no less acuteness than taste he appear indeed to I to be one of the best and most modest of philologist and it be to be hope that he will be imitate in what he have do by succeed editor of plato 's text if my translation have be make with a eye to the judgment of the many it would have be necessary to apologize for its literal exactness have i be anxious to gratify false taste with respect to composition i should doubtless have attend less to the precise meaning of the original have omit almost all connective particle have divide long period into a number of short one and branch out the strong and deep river of plato 's language into smooth-gliding shallow and feeble stream but as the present work be compose with the hope indeed of benefit all but with a eye to the criticism solely of man of elevated soul i have endeavor not to lose a word of the original and yet at the same time have attempt to give the translation as much elegance as such verbal accuracy can be suppose capable of admit i have also endeavor to preserve the manner as well as the matter of my author be fully persuade that no translation deserve applause in which both these be not as much as possible preserved my principal object in this arduous undertaking have be to unfold all the abstruse and sublime dogma of plato as they be find disperse in he work minutely to unravel the art which he employ in the composition of all he dialogue and to do full justice to he meaning in every particular must be the task of some one who have more leisure and who be able to give the work of plato to the public on a more extensive plan in accomplish this great object i have present the reader in my note with nearly the substance in english of all the follow manuscript greek commentary and scholium on plato viz of the commentary of proclus on the parmenide and first alcibiade and of he scholium on the cratylus of the scholium of olympiodorus on the phaedo gorgia and philebus and of hermea on the phoedrus to these be add very copious extract from the manuscript of damascius -lrb- 30 -rrb- perus archon and from the publish work of proclus on the timeus republic and theology of plato of the four first of these manuscript three of which be folio volume i have complete copy take with my own hand and of the copious extract from the other those from olympiodorus on the gorgia be take by I from the copy preserve in the british museum those from the same philosopher on the philebus and those from hermea on the phaedrus and damascius perus archon from the copy in the bodleian library ----------------- -lrb- 30 -rrb- patricius be one of the very few in modern time who have be sensible of the great merit of these writings as be evident from the extract from the preface to he translation of proclus 's theological element -lrb- ferrar 4to 1583 -rrb- patricius prior to this enumerate the writings of proclus and they be include in he wish that all the manuscript greek commentary on plato be make public ----------------- and here gratitude demand that i should publicly acknowledge the very handsome and liberal manner in which i be receive by the university of oxford and by the principal librarian and sub-librarian of the bodleian library during the time that i make the above mention extract in the first place i have to acknowledge the very polite attention which be pay to I by dr jackson -lrb- 31 -rrb- dean of christ-church in the second place the liberty of attendance at the bodleian library and the accommodation which be there afford I by the librarian of that excellent collection demand from I no small tribute of praise and above all the very liberal manner in which i be receive by the fellow of new college with whom i reside for three week and from whom i experience even grecian hospitality will i trust be as difficult a task for time to obliterate from my memory as it would be for I to express it as it deserve ----------------- -lrb- 31 -rrb- i be much pleased to find that this very respectable prelate be a great admirer of aristotle and that extract from the commentary of simplicius and ammonius on the category of that philosopher be read by he order in the college of which he be the head ----------------- with respect to the fault which i may have commit in this translation -lrb- for i be not vain enough to suppose it be without fault -rrb- i might plead as a excuse that the whole of it have be execute amidst severe endurance from bodily infirmity and indigent circumstance and that a very considerable part of it be accomplish amidst other ill of no common magnitude and other labor inimical to such a undertaking but whatever may be my error i will not fly to calamity for a apology let it be my excuse that the mistake i may have commit in lesser particulars have arise from my eagerness to seize and promulgate those great truth in the philosophy and theology of plato which though they have be conceal for age in oblivion have a subsistence coeval with the universe and will again be restore and flourish for very extend period through all the infinite revolution of time in the next place it be necessary to speak concern the qualification requisite in a legitimate student of the philosophy of plato previous to which i shall just notice the absurdity of suppose that a mere knowledge of the greek tongue however great that knowledge may be be alone sufficient to the understand the sublime doctrine of plato for a man might as well think that he can understand archimede without a knowledge of the element of geometry merely because he can read he in the original those who entertain such a idle opinion would do well to meditate on the profound observation of heraclitus that polymathy do not teach intellect -lrb- -lrb- greek : polymathic noon ou didaskeus -rrb- -rrb- by a legitimate student then of the platonic philosophy i mean one who both from nature and education be properly qualify for such a arduous undertaking that be one who possess a naturally good disposition be sagacious and acute and be inflamed with a ardent desire for the acquisition of wisdom and truth who from he childhood have be well instruct in the mathematical discipline who besides this have spend whole day and frequently the greater part of the night in profound meditation and like one triumphantly sailing over a rage sea or skillfully pierce through a army of foe have successfully encounter a hostile multitude of doubt -- in short who have never consider wisdom as a thing of trifling estimation and easy access but as that which can not be obtain without the most generous and severe endurance and the intrinsic worth of which surpass all corporeal good far more than the ocean the fleeting bubble which float on its surface to such as be destitute of these requisite who make the study of word they sole employment and the pursuit of wisdom but at best a secondary thing who expect to be wise by desultory application for a hour or two in a day after the fatigue of business after mix with the base multitude of mankind laughing with the gay affect air of gravity with the serious tacitly assent to every man 's opinion however absurd and wink at folly however shameful and base -- to such as these -- and alas the world be full of such -- the sublimest truth must appear to be nothing more than jargon and reverie the dream of a distempered imagination or the ebullition of fanatical faith but all this be by no means wonderful if we consider that two-fold ignorance be the disease of the many for they be not only ignorant with respect to the sublimest knowledge but they be even ignorant of they ignorance hence they never suspect they want of understanding but immediately reject a doctrine which appear at first sight absurd because it be too splendid for they bat-like eye to behold or if they even yield they assent to its truth they very assent be the result of the same most dreadful disease of the soul for they will fancy say plato that they understand the highest truth when the very contrary be really the case i earnestly therefore entreat man of this description not to meddle with any of the profound speculation of the platonic philosophy for it be more dangerous to urge they to such a employment than to advise they to follow they sordid avocation with unwearied assiduity and toil for wealth with increase alacrity and vigor as they will by this mean give free scope to the base habit of they soul and sooner suffer that punishment which in such as these must always precede mental illumination and be the inevitable consequence of guilt it be well say indeed by lysis the pythagorean that to inculcate liberal speculation and discourse to those whose moral be turbid and confused be just as absurd as to pour pure and transparent water into a deep well full of mire and clay for he who do this will only disturb the mud and cause the pure water to become defile the wood of such as the same author beautifully observe -lrb- that be the irrational or corporeal life -rrb- in which these dire passion be nourished must first be purify with fire and sword and every kind of instrument -lrb- that be through preparatory discipline and the political virtue -rrb- and reason must be free from its slavery to the affection before any thing useful can be plant in these savage haunt let not such then presume to explore the region of platonic philosophy the land be too pure to admit the sordid and the base the road which conduct to it be too intricate to be discover by the unskillful and stupid and the journey be too long and laborious to be accomplish by the effeminate and the timid by the slave of passion and the dupe of opinion by the lover of sense and the despiser of truth the danger and difficulty in the undertaking be such as can be sustain by none but the most hardy and accomplished adventurer and he who begin the journey without the strength of hercule or the wisdom and patience of ulyss must be destroy by the wild beast of the forest or perish in the storm of the ocean must suffer transmutation into a beast through the magic power of circe or be exile for life by the detain charm of calypso and in short must descend into hade and wander in its darkness without emerge from thence to the bright region of the morning or be ruin by the deadly melody of the syren 's song to the most skillful traveler who pursue the right road with a ardor which no toil can abate with a vigilance which no weariness can surprise into negligence and with virtue which no temptation can seduce it exhibit for many year the appearance of the ithaca of ulyss or the fly italy of aenea for we no sooner gain a glimpse of the pleasing land which be to be the end of we journey than it be suddenly ravish from we view and we still find ourselves at a distance from the beloved coast expose to the fury of a stormy sea of doubt abandon then ye grovel soul the fruitless design pursue with avidity the beaten road which lead to popular honor and sordid gain but relinquish all thought of a voyage for which you be totally unprepared do you not perceive what a length of sea separate you from the royal coast a sea huge horrid vast where scarce in safety sail the best build ship though jove inspire the gale and may we not very justly ask you similar to the interrogation of calypso what ship have you what sailor to convey what oar to cut the long laborious way i shall only observe further that the life of plato by olympiodorus be prefix to this translation in preference to that by diogene laertius because the former be the production of a most eminent platonist and the latter of a mere historian who indiscriminately give to the public whatever anecdote he find in other author if the reader combine this short sketch of the life of plato with what that philosopher say of himself in he 7th epistle he will be in possession of the most important particulars about he that can be obtain at present explanation of certain platonic term as some apology may be think necessary for have introduce certain unusual word of greek origin i shall only observe that as all art and science have certain appropriate term peculiar to themselves philosophy which be the art of art and science of science as be the mistress of both have certainly a prior and a far superior claim to this privilege i have not however introduce i believe any of these term without at the same time sufficiently explain they but lest the contrary should have take place the follow explanation of all such term as i have be able to recollect and also of common word use by platonist in a peculiar sense be subjoin for the information of the reader anagogic -lrb- greek : anagogiko -rrb- lead on high demiurgus -lrb- greek : demiourgo -rrb- jupiter the artificer of the universe dianoetium this word be derive from -lrb- greek : dianoium -rrb- or that power of the soul which reason scientifically derive the principle of its reasoning from intellect plato be so uncommonly accurate in he diction that this word be very seldom use by he in any other than its primary sense the divine -lrb- greek : to theion -rrb- be be subsist in conjunction with the one for all thing except the one viz essence life and intellect be consider by plato as suspend from and secondary to the god for the god do not subsist in but prior to these which they also produce and connect but be not characterize by these in many place however plato call the participant of the god by the name of the god for not only the athenian guest in the law but also socrate in the phaedrus call a divine soul a god for say he all the horse and charioteer of the god be good & c and afterwards still more clearly he add and this be the life of the god and not only this but he also denominate those nature god that be always unite to the god and which in conjunction with they give completion to one series he also frequently call daemon god though accord to essence they be secondary to and subsist about the god for in the phaedrus timaeus and other dialogue he extend the appellation of god as far as the daemon and what be still more paradoxical than all this he do not refuse to call some man god as for instance the elean guest in the sophista from all this therefore we must infer that with respect to the word god one thing which be thus denominate be simply deity another be so accord to union a third accord to participation a fourth accord to contact and a fifth accord to similitude thus every superessential nature be primarily a god but every intellectual nature be so accord to union and again every divine soul be a god accord to participation but divine daemon be god accord to contact with the god and the soul of man obtain this appellation through similitude each of these however except the first be as we have say rather divine than a god for the athenian guest in the law call intellect itself divine but that which be divine be secondary to the first deity in the same manner as the unite be to the one that which be intellectual to intellect and that which be animated to soul indeed thing more uniform and simple always precede and the series of being end in the one itself doxastic this word be derive from doxa opinion and signify that which be apprehend by opinion or that power which be the extremity of the rational soul this power know the universal in particulars as that every man be a rational animal but it know not the diotus or why a thing be but only the otus or that it be the eternal -lrb- greek : to aionion -rrb- that which have a never-ending subsistence without any connection with time or as plotinus profoundly define it infinite life at once total and full that which be generate -lrb- greek : to geneton -rrb- that which have not the whole of its essence or energy subsisting at once without temporal dispersion generation -lrb- greek : genesis -rrb- a essence composite and multiform and conjoin with time this be the proper signification of the word but it be use symbolically by plato and also by theologist more ancient than plato for the sake of indication for as proclus beautifully observe -lrb- in m comment in parmenidem -rrb- fable call the ineffable unfold into light through cause generation hence he add in the orphic writings the first cause be denominate time for where there be generation accord to its proper signification there also there be time a guest -lrb- greek : xeno -rrb- this word in its more ample signification in the greek denote a stranger but properly imply one who receive another or be himself receive at a entertainment in the follow dialogue therefore wherever one of the speaker be introduce as a xeno i have translate this word guest as be more conformable to the genius of plato 's dialogue which may be justly call rich mental banquet and consequently the speaker in they may be consider as so many guest hence in the timaeus the person of that dialogue be expressly speak of as guest hyparxi -lrb- greek : uparxi -rrb- the first principle or foundation as it be of the essence of a thing hence also it be the summit of essence idiom -lrb- greek : idioma -rrb- the characteristic peculiarity of a thing the immortal -lrb- greek : to athanaton -rrb- accord to plato there be many order of immortality pervade from on high to the last of thing and the ultimate echo as it be of immorality be see in the perpetuity of the mundane whole which accord to the doctrine of the elean guest in the politicus they participate from the father of the universe for both the be and the life of every body depend on another cause since body be not itself naturally adapt to connect or adorn or preserve itself but the immortality of partial soul such as ours be more manifest and more perfect than this of the perpetual body in the universe as be evident from the many demonstration which be give of it in the phaedo and in the 10th book of the republic for the immortality of partial soul have a more principal subsistence as possess in itself the cause of eternal permanency but prior to both these be the immortality of daemon for these neither verge to mortality nor be they fill with the nature of thing which be generate and corrupt more venerable however than these and essentially transcend they be the immortality of divine soul which be primarily self-motive and contain the fountain and principle of the life which be attribute about body and through which body participate of renew immortality and prior to all these be the immortality of the god : for diotima in the banquet do not ascribe a immortality of this kind to demon hence such a immortality as this be separate and exempt from whole for together with the immortality of the god eternity subsist which be the fountain of all immortality and life as well that life which be perpetual as that which be dissipate into nonentity in short therefore the divine immortal be that which be generative and connective of perpetual life for it be not immortal as participate of life but as supply divine life and deify life itself imparticipable -lrb- greek : to amethekton -rrb- that which be not consubsistent with a inferior nature thus imparticipable intellect be a intellect which be not consubsistent with soul intellectual projection -lrb- greek : noera epibole -rrb- as the perception of intellect be immediate be a dart forth as it be directly to its proper object this direct intuition be express by the term projection the intelligible -lrb- greek : to noeton -rrb- this word in plato and platonic writer have a various signification : for in the first place whatever be exempt from sensible and have its essence separate from they be say to be intelligible and in this sense soul be intelligible in the second place intellect which be prior to soul be intelligible in the third place that which be more ancient than intellect which replenish intelligence and be essentially perfective of it be call intelligible and this be the intelligible which timaeus in plato place in the order of a paradigm prior to the demiurgic intellect and intellectual energy but beyond these be the divine intelligible which be define accord to divine union and hyparxi for this be intelligible as the object of desire to intellect as give perfection to and contain it and as the completion of be the highest intelligible therefore be that which be the hyparxi of the god the second that which be true be and the first essence the third intellect and all intellectual life and the fourth the order belong to soul logismo reasoning when apply to divinity as by plato in the timaeus signify a distributive cause of thing on account of which with reference to which through which accord to which from which or in which viz -lrb- greek : di o uph ' ou di ou kath ' o ex ou -rrb- by the first of these term plato be accustom to denominate the final cause by the second the paradigmatic by the third the demiurgic by the fourth the instrumental by the fifth form and by the sixth matter orectic this word be derive from -lrb- greek : orexi -rrb- appetite paradigm -lrb- greek : paradeigma -rrb- a pattern or that with reference to which a thing be make the perpetual -lrb- greek : to aidion -rrb- that which subsist forever but through a connection with time a politician -lrb- greek : politiko -rrb- this word as mr sydenham justly observe in he note in the rival be of a very large and extensive import as use by plato and the other ancient writer on politics : for it include all those statesman or politician in aristocracy and democracy who be either for life or for a certain time invest with the whole or a part of kingly authority and the power thereto belong see the politicus prudence -lrb- greek : phronesis -rrb- this word frequently mean in plato and platonic writer the habit of discerning what be good in all moral action and frequently signify intelligence or intellectual perception the follow admirable explanation of this word be give by jamblichus prudence have a precedaneous subsistence receive its generation from a pure and perfect intellect hence it look to intellect itself be perfect by it and have this as the measure and most beautiful paradigm of all its energy if also we have any communion with the god it be especially effect by this virtue and through this we be in the highest degree assimilate to they the knowledge too of such thing as be good profitable and beautiful and of the contrary to these be obtain by this virtue and the judgment and correction of work proper to be do be by this direct and in short it be a certain govern leader of man and of the whole arrangement of they nature and refer city and house and the particular life of every one to a divine paradigm it form they accord to the best similitude obliterate some thing and purify other so that prudence render its possessor similar to divinity jamblic apud stob p 141 psychical -lrb- greek : psychiko -rrb- pertain to soul science this word be sometimes define by plato to be that which assign the cause of thing sometimes to be that the subject of which have a perfectly stable essence and together with this he conjoin the assignation of cause from reasoning sometimes again he define it to be that the principle of which be not hypothesis and accord to this definition he assert that there be one science which ascend as far as to the principle of thing for this science consider that which be truly the principle as unhypothetic have for its subject true being and produce its reasoning from cause accord to the second definition he call dianoetic knowledge science but accord to the first alone he assign to physiology the appellation of science the telestic art the art pertain to mystic ceremony theurgic this word be derive from -lrb- greek : theourgium -rrb- or that religious operation which deify he by whom it be perform as much as be possible to man truth -lrb- greek : aletheium -rrb- plato follow ancient theologist consider truth multifariously hence accord to he doctrine the highest truth be characterize by unity and be the light proceeding from the good which impart purity as he say in the philebus and union as he say in the republic to intelligible the truth which be next to this in dignity be that which proceed from intelligible and illuminate the intellectual order and which a essence unfigured uncolored and without contact first receive where also the plain of truth be situate as it be write in the phaedrus the third kind of truth be that which be connascent with soul and which through intelligence come into contact with true be for the psychical light be the third from the intelligible intellectual derive its plenitude from intelligible light and the psychical from the intellectual and the last kind of truth be that which be full of error and inaccuracy through sense and the instability of its object for a material nature be perpetually flow and be not naturally adapt to abide even for a moment the follow beautiful description of the third kind of truth or that which subsist in soul be give by jamblichus : truth as the name imply makest a conversion about the god and they incorporeal energy but doxastic imitation which as plato say be fabricative of image wander about that which be deprive of divinity and be dark and the former indeed receive its perfection in intelligible and divine form and real being which have a perpetual sameness of subsistence but the latter look to that which be formless and non-being and which have a various subsistence and about this it be visive power be blunt the former contemplate that which be but the latter assume such a form as appear to the many hence the former associate with intellect and increase the intellectual nature which we contain but the latter from look to that which always seem to be hunt after folly and deceive jamblic apud stob p 136 the unical -lrb- greek : to niaion -rrb- that which be characterize by unity end of the project gutenberg ebook of introduction to the philosophy
