other commentary : of caius julius caesar first publish in this edition 1915 reprint 1923 1929 introduction by thomas de quincey the character of the first caesar have perhaps never be worse appreciate than by he who in one sense describe it best that be with most force and eloquence wherever he really _ do _ comprehend it this be lucan who have nowhere exhibit more brilliant rhetoric nor wander more from the truth than in the contrast portrait of caesar and pompey the famous line _ nil actum reputan si quid superesset agendum _ be a fine feature of the real character finely express but if it have be lucan 's purpose -lrb- as possibly with a view to pompey 's benefit in some respects it be -rrb- utterly and extravagantly to falsify the character of the great dictator by no single trait could he more effectually have fulfil that purpose nor in fewer word than by this expressive passage _ gaudensque viam fecisse ruina _ such a trait would be almost extravagant apply even to marius who -lrb- though in many respects a perfect model of roman grandeur massy columnar imperturbable and more perhaps than any one man record in history capable of justify the bold illustration of that character in horace _ si fractus illabatur orbi impavidum ferient ruina _ -rrb- have however a ferocity in he character and a touch of the devil in he very rarely unite with the same tranquil intrepidity but for caesar the all-accomplished statesman the splendid orator the man of elegant habit and polished taste the patron of the fine art in a degree transcend all example of he own or the previous age and as a man of general literature so much beyond he contemporary except cicero that he look down even upon the brilliant syllum as a illiterate person -- to class such a man with the race of furious destroyer exult in the desolation they spread be to err not by a individual trait but by the whole genus the attila and the tamerlane who rejoice in avow themselves the scourge of god and the special instrument of he wrath have no one feature of affinity to the polished and humane caesar and would as little have comprehend he character as he could have respect theirs even cato the unworthy hero of lucan might have suggest to he a little more truth in this instance by a celebrated remark which he make on the characteristic distinction of caesar in comparison with other revolutionary disturber for say he whereas other have attempt the overthrow of the state in a continued paroxysm of fury and in a state of mind resemble the lunacy of intoxication caesar on the contrary among that whole class of civil disturber be the only one who have come to the task in a temper of sobriety and moderation _ -lrb- unum accessisse sobrium ad rempublicam delendam -rrb- _ great as caesar be by the benefit of he original nature there can be no doubt that he like other owe something to circumstance and perhaps amongst those which be most favourable to the premature development of great self-dependence we must reckon the early death of he father it be or it be not accord to the nature of man a advantage to be orphan at as early age perhaps utter orphanage be rarely or never such : but to lose a father betime may under appropriate circumstance profit a strong mind greatly to caesar it be a prodigious benefit that he lose he father when not much more than fifteen perhaps it be a advantage also to he father that he die thus early have he stay a year longer he might have see himself despise baffle and make ridiculous for where let we ask in any age be the father capable of adequately sustain that relation to the unique caius julius -- to he in the appropriate language of shakespeare the foremost man of all this world and in this fine and caesarean line this world be to be understand not of the order of co-existence merely ` but also of the order of succession he be the foremost man not only of he contemporary but also within he own intellectual class of man generally -- of all that ever should come after he or should sit on throne under the denomination of czar kesar or caesar of the bosphorus and the danube of all in every age that should inherit he supremacy of mind or should subject to themselves the generation of ordinary man by quality analogous to he of this infinite superiority some part must be ascribe to he early emancipation from paternal control there be very many case in which simply from consideration of sex a female can not stand forward as the head of a family or as its suitable representative if they be even lady paramount and in situation of command they be also woman the staff of authority do not annihilate they sex and scruple of female delicacy interfere for ever to unnerve and emasculate in they hand the sceptre however otherwise potent hence we see in noble family the merest boy put forward to represent the family dignity as fitter supporter of that burden than they mature mother and of caesar 's mother though little be record and that little incidentally this much at least we learn -- that if she look down upon he with maternal pride and delight she look up to he with female ambition as the re-edifier of she husband 's honor -- look with reverence as to a column of the roman grandeur and with fear and feminine anxiety as to one whose aspiring spirit carry he but too prematurely into the field of adventurous strife one slight and evanescent sketch of the relation which subsist between caesar and he mother catch from the wreck of time be preserve both by plutarch and suetonius we see in the early dawn the young patrician standing upon the step of he patrimonial portico he mother with she arm wreathe about he neck look up to he noble countenance sometimes draw augury of hope from feature so fit for command sometimes bode a early blight to promise so dangerously magnificent that she have something of she son 's aspiring character or that he presume so much in a mother of he we learn from the few word which survive of they conversation he address to she no language that could tranquillise she fear on the contrary to any but a roman mother he valedictory word take in connexion with the known determination of he character be of a nature to consummate she depression as they tend to confirm the very worst of she fear he be then go to stand he chance in a popular electioneering contest for a office of the highest dignity and to launch himself upon the storm of the campus martius at that period besides other and more ordinary danger the band of gladiator keep in the pay of the more ambitious or turbulent amongst the roman noble give a popular tone of ferocity and of personal risk to the course of such contest and either to forestall the victory of a antagonist or to avenge they own defeat it be not at all impossible that a body of incensed competitor might intercept he final triumph by assassination for this danger however he have no leisure in he thought of consolation the sole danger which _ he _ contemplated or suppose he mother to contemplate be the danger of defeat and for that he reserve he consolation he bid she fear nothing for that he determination be to return with victory and with the ensign of the dignity he seek or to return a corpse early indeed do caesar 's trial commence and it be probable that have not the death of he father by throw he prematurely upon he own resource prematurely develop the masculine feature of he character force he whilst yet a boy under the discipline of civil conflict and the yoke of practical life even _ he _ energy might have be insufficient to sustain they he age be not exactly ascertain but it be past a doubt that he have not reach he twentieth year when he have the hardihood to engage in a struggle with syllum then dictator and exercise the immoderate power of that office with the licence and the severity which history have make so memorable he have neither any distinct grounds of hope nor any eminent example at that time to countenance he in this struggle -- which yet he push on in the most uncompromising style and to the utmost verge of defiance the subject of the contest give it a further interest it be the youthful wife of the youthful caesar who stand under the shadow of the great dictator 's displeasure not personally but politically on account of she connexion : and she it be cornelia the daughter of a man who have be four time consul that caesar be require to divorce : but he spurn the haughty mandate and carry he determination to a triumphant issue notwithstanding he life be at stake and at one time save only by shift he place of concealment every night and this young lady it be who afterwards become the mother of he only daughter both mother and daughter it be remarkable perish prematurely and at critical period of caesar 's life for it be probable enough that these irreparable wound to caesar 's domestic affection throw he with more exclusiveness of devotion upon the fascination of glory and ambition than might have happen under a happier condition of he private life that caesar should have escape destruction in this unequal contest with a enemy then wield the whole thunder of the state be somewhat surprising and historian have seek they solution of the mystery in the powerful intercession of the vestal virgin and several other of high rank amongst the connexion of he great house these may have do something but it be due to syllum who have a sympathy with everything truly noble to suppose he strike with powerful admiration for the audacity of the young patrician stand out in such severe solitude among so many example of timid concession and that to this magnanimous feeling in the dictator much of the indulgence which he show may have be really due in fact accord to some account it be not syllum but the creature of syllum -lrb- _ adjutore _ -rrb- who pursue caesar we know at all event that sylla form a right estimate of caesar 's character and that from the complexion of he conduct in this one instance he draw that famous prophecy of he future destiny bidding he friend beware of that slipshod boy for that in he lay couchant many a marius a grander testimony to the awe which caesar inspire or from one who know better the quality of that cyclopean man by whose scale he measure the patrician boy can not be imagine it be not we intention or consistent with we plan to pursue this great man through the whole circumstance of he romantic career though it be certain that many part of he life require investigation much keener than have ever be apply to they and that many might be place in a new light indeed the whole of this most momentous section of ancient history ought to be recompose with the critical scepticism of a niebuhr and the same comprehensive collation rest if possible on the felicitous interpretation of authority in reality it be the hinge upon which turn the future destiny of the whole earth and have therefore a common relation to all modern nation whatsoever should naturally have be cultivate with the zeal which belong to a personal concern in general the anecdote which express most vividly the grandeur of character in the first caesar be those which illustrate he defiance of danger in extremity : the prodigious energy and rapidity of he decision and motion in the field -lrb- look to which it be that cicero call he -lrb- greek : tera -rrb- or portentous revelation -rrb- the skill with which he penetrate the design of he enemy and the electric speed with which he meet disaster with remedy and reparation or where that be impossible with relief the extraordinary presence of mind which he show in turn adverse omen to he own advantage as when upon stumble in come on shore -lrb- which be esteem a capital omen of evil -rrb- he transfigure as it be in one instant its whole meaning by exclaim thus and by this contact with the earth do i take possession of thee o africa in that way give to a accident the semblance of a symbolic purpose equally conspicuous be the grandeur of fortitude with which he face the whole extent of a calamity when palliation could do no good non negando minuendove sed insuper amplificando _ ementiendoque _ as when upon find he soldiery alarm at the approach of juba with force really great but exaggerated by they terror he address they in a military harangue to the following effect : -- know that within a few day the king will come up with we bring with he sixty thousand legionary thirty thousand cavalry one hundred thousand light troops besides three hundred elephant such be the case let I hear no more of conjecture and opinion for you have now my warrant for the fact whose information be past doubt therefore be satisfied otherwise i will put every man of you on board some crazy old fleet and whistle you down the tide -- no matter under what wind no matter towards what shore finally we might seek for _ characteristic _ anecdote of caesar in he unexampled liberality and contempt of money upon this last topic it be the just remark of casaubon that some instance of caesar 's munificence have be think apocryphal or to rest upon false reading simply from ignorance of the heroic scale upon which the roman splendor of that age proceed a forum which caesar build out of the product of he last campaign by way of a present to the roman people cost he -- for the ground merely on which it stand -- nearly eight hundred thousand pound to the citizen of rome he present in one _ congiary _ about two guinea and a half a head to he army in one _ donation _ upon the termination of the civil war he give a sum which allow about two hundred pound a man to the infantry and four hundred to the cavalry it be true that the legionary troops be then much reduce by the sword of the enemy and by the tremendous hardship of they last campaign in this however he do perhaps no more than repay a debt for it be a instance of military attachment beyond all that wallenstein or any commander the most beloved amongst he troops have ever experience that on the break out of the civil war not only do the centurion of every legion severally maintain a horse soldier but even the private volunteer to serve without pay and -lrb- what might seem impossible -rrb- without they daily ration this be accomplish by subscription amongst themselves the more opulent undertaking for the maintenance of the needy they disinterested love for caesar appear in another and more difficult illustration : it be a traditionary anecdote in rome that the majority of those amongst caesar 's troops who have the misfortune to fall into the enemy 's hand refuse to accept they life under the condition of serve against _ he _ in connexion with this subject of he extraordinary munificence there be one aspect of caesar 's life which have suffer much from the misrepresentation of historian and that be -- the vast pecuniary embarrassment under which he labor until the profit of war have turn the scale even more prodigiously in he favor at one time of he life when appoint to a foreign office so numerous and so clamorous be he creditor that he could not have leave rome on he public duty have not crassus come forward with assistance in money or by guarantee to the amount of nearly two hundred thousand pound and at another he be accustom to amuse himself with compute how much money it would require to make he worth exactly nothing -lrb- _ ie _ simply to clear he of debt -rrb- this by one account amount to upward of two million sterling now the error of historian have be to represent these debt as the original ground of he ambition and he revolutionary project as though the desperate condition of he private affair have suggest a civil war to he calculation as the best or only mode of redress it such a policy would have resemble the last desperate resource of a unprincipled gambler who on see he final game at chess and the accumulate stake depend upon it all on the brink of irretrievable sacrifice dexterously upset the chess-board or extinguish the light but julius the one sole patriot of rome could find no advantage to he plan in darkness or in confusion honestly support he would have crush the oligarchy of rome by crush in its lair that venal and hunger-bitten democracy which make oligarchy and its machinery resistless caesar 's debt far from be stimulant and exciting cause of he political ambition stand in a inverse relation to the ambition they be its result and represent its natural cost be contract from first to last in the service of he political intrigue for raise and maintain a powerful body of partisan both in rome and elsewhere whosoever indeed will take the trouble to investigate the progress of caesar 's ambition from such material as even yet remain may satisfy himself that the scheme of revolutionize the republic and place himself at its head be no growth of accident or circumstance above all that it do not arise upon any so petty and indirect a suggestion as that of he debt but that he debt be in they very first origin purely ministerial to he wise indispensable and patriotic ambition and that he revolutionary plan be at all period of he life a direct and foremost object but in no case bottom upon casual impulse in this there be not only patriotism but in fact the one sole mode of patriotism which could have prosper or could have find a field of action chatter not sublime reader commonplace of scoundrel moralist against ambition in some case ambition be a hopeful virtue in other -lrb- as in the rome of we resplendent julius -rrb- ambition be the virtue by which any other could flourish it have become evident to everybody that rome under its present constitution must fall and the sole question be -- by whom even pompey not by nature of a aspiring turn and prompt to he ambitious course undoubtedly by circumstance and the friend who besiege he be in the habit of say syllum potuit : ego non potero _ syllum find it possible : shall i find it not so _ possible to do what to overthrow the political system of the republic this have silently collapse into a order of thing so vicious grow also so hopelessly worse that all honest patriot invoke a purify revolution even though buy at the heavy price of a tyranny rather than face the chaos of murderous distraction to which the tide of feud and frenzy be violently tend such a revolution at such a price be not less pompey 's object than caesar 's in a case therefore where no benefit of choice be allow to rome as respect the thing but only as respect the person caesar have the same right to enter the arena in the character of combatant as could belong to any one of he rival and that he _ do _ enter that arena constructively and by secret design from he very earliest manhood may be gather from this -- that he suffer no opening towards a revolution provide they have any hope in they to escape he participation it be familiarly know that he be engage pretty deeply in the conspiracy of catiline and that he incur considerable risk on that occasion but it be less know that he be a party to at least two other conspiracy there be even a fourth meditate by crassus which caesar so far encourage as to undertake a journey to rome from a very distant quarter merely with a view to such chance as it might offer to he but as it do not upon examination seem to he a very promising scheme he judge it best to look coldly upon it or not to embark in it by any personal co-operation upon these and other fact we build we inference -- that the scheme of a revolution be the one great purpose of caesar from he first entrance upon public life nor do it appear that he care much by whom it be undertake provide only there seem to be any sufficient resource for carry it through and for sustain the first collision with the regular force of the exist oligarchy take or _ not _ take the shape of triumvirate he rely it seem on he own personal superiority for raise he to the head of affair eventually let who would take the nominal lead at first to the same result it will be find tend the vast stream of caesar 's liberality from the senator downward to the lowest _ faex romulus _ he have a hire body of dependent both in and out of rome equal in number to a nation in the province and in distant kingdom he pursue the same scheme everywhere he have a body of mercenary partisan king even be know to have take he pay and it be remarkable that even in he character of commander-in-chief where the number of legion allow to he for the accomplishment of he gaulish mission raise he for a number of year above all fear of coercion or control he persevere steadily in the same plan of provide for the distant day when he might need assistance not _ from _ the state but _ against _ the state for amongst the private anecdote which come to light under the research make into he history after he death be this -- that soon after he first entrance upon he government in gaul he have raise equipped discipline and maintain from he own private fund a legion amounting possibly to six or seven thousand man who be bind to no sacrament of military obedience to the state nor owe fealty to any auspices except those of caesar this legion from the fashion of they crested helmet which resemble the head of a small aspiring bird receive the popular name of the _ alauda _ -lrb- or lark -rrb- legion and very singular it be that cato or marcellus or some amongst those enemy of caesar who watch he conduct during the period of he gaulish command with the vigilance of rancorous malice should not have come to the knowledge of this fact in which case we may be sure that it would have be denounce to the senate such then for its purpose and its uniform motive be the sagacious munificence of caesar apart from this motive and consider in and for itself and simply with a reference to the splendid form which it often assume this munificence would furnish the material for a volume the public entertainment of caesar he spectacles and show he naumachia and the pomp of he unrivalled triumph -lrb- the closing triumph of the republic -rrb- be severally the finest of they kind which have then be bring forward sea-fight be exhibit upon the grandest scale accord to every known variety of nautical equipment and mode of conflict upon a vast lake form artificially for that express purpose mimic land-fight be conduct in which all the circumstance of real war be so faithfully rehearse that even elephant indorse with tower twenty on each side take part in the combat drama be represent in every known language -lrb- _ per omnium linguarum histrione _ -rrb- and hence -lrb- that be from the conciliatory feeling thus express towards the various tribe of foreigner resident in rome -rrb- some have derive a explanation of what be else a mysterious circumstance amongst the ceremonial observance at caesar 's funeral -- that all people of foreign nation then reside at rome distinguish themselves by the conspicuous share which they take in the public mourning and that beyond all other foreigner the jew for night after night keep watch and ward about the emperor 's grave never before accord to tradition which last through several generation in rome have there be so vast a conflux of the human race congregate to any one center on any one attraction of business or of pleasure as to rome on occasion of these triumphal spectacles exhibit by caesar in we day the greatest occasional gathering of the human race be in indium especially at the great fair of the _ hurdwar _ on the gange in northern hindustan : a confluence of some million be sometimes see at that spot bring together under the mixed influence of devotion and commercial business but very soon disperse as rapidly as they have be convoke some such spectacle of nation crowd upon nation and some such babylonian confusion of dress complexion language and jargon be then witness at rome accommodation within door and under roof of house or roof of temple be altogether impossible myriad encamp along the street and along the high-roads field or garden myriad lay stretch on the ground without even the slight protection of tent in a vast circuit about the city multitude of man even senator and other of the highest rank be trample to death in the crowd and the whole family of man might seem at that time to be converge at the bidding of the dead dictator but these or any other theme connect with the public life of caesar we notice only in those circumstance which have be overlook or partially represent by historian let we now in conclusion bring forward from the obscurity in which they have hitherto lurk the anecdote which describe the habit of he private life he taste and personal peculiarity in person he be tall fair gracile and of limb distinguish for they elegant proportion he eye be black and pierce these circumstance continue to be long remembered and no doubt be constantly recall to the eye of all person in the imperial palace by picture bust and statue for we find the same description of he personal appearance three century afterwards in a work of the emperor julian 's he be a most accomplished horseman and a master -lrb- _ peritissimus _ -rrb- in the use of arm but notwithstanding he skill and horsemanship it seem that when he accompany he army on march he walk oftener than he ride no doubt with a view to the benefit of he example and to express that sympathy with he soldier which gain he they heart so entirely on other occasion when travel apart from he army he seem more frequently to have ride in a carriage than on horseback he purpose in this preference must have be with a view to the transport of luggage the carriage which he generally use be a _ rheda _ a sort of gig or rather curricle for it be a _ four _ - wheel carriage and adapt -lrb- as we find from the imperial regulation for the public carriage etc -rrb- to the conveyance of about half a ton the mere personal baggage which caesar carry with he be probably considerable for he be a man of elegant habit and in all part of he life sedulously attentive to elegance of personal appearance the length of journey which he accomplish within a give time appear even to we at this day and might well therefore appear to he contemporary truly astonishing a distance of one hundred mile be no extraordinary day 's journey for he in a _ rheda _ such as we have describe it so refined be he habit and so constant he demand for the luxurious accommodation of polished life as it then exist in rome that he be say to have carry with he as indispensable part of he personal baggage the little ivory lozenge square and circle or oval with other costly material want for the tessellated flooring of he tent habit such as these will easily account for he travel in a carriage rather than on horseback the courtesy and oblige disposition of caesar be notorious and both be illustrate in some anecdote which survive for generation in rome dining on one occasion as a invite guest at a table where the servant have inadvertently for salad-oil furnish some sort of coarse lamp-oil caesar would not allow the rest of the company to point out the mistake to they host for fear of shocking he too much by expose what might have be construe into inhospitality at another time whilst halt at a little _ cabaret _ when one of he retinue be suddenly take ill caesar resign to he use the sole bed which the house afford incident as trifling as these express the urbanity of caesar 's nature and hence one be the more surprised to find the alienation of the senate charge in no trifling degree upon a gross and most culpable failure in point of courtesy caesar it be allege -- but might we presume to call upon antiquity for its authority -- neglect to rise from he seat on they approach he with a address of congratulation it be say and we can believe it that he give deeper offence by this one defect in a matter of ceremonial observance than by all he substantial attack upon they privilege what we find it difficult to believe be not that result from that offence -- this be no more than we should all anticipate -- not _ that _ but the possibility of the offence itself from one so little arrogant as caesar and so entirely a man of the world he be tell of the disgust which he have give and we be bind to believe he apology in which he charge it upon sickness that would not at the moment allow he to maintain a standing attitude certainly the whole tenor of he life be not courteous only but kind and to he enemy merciful in a degree which imply so much more magnanimity than man in general could understand that by many it be put down to the account of weakness weakness however there be none in caius caesar and that there might be none it be fortunate that conspiracy should have cut he off in the full vigor of he faculty in the very meridian of he glory and on the brink of complete a series of gigantic achievement amongst these be number : -- a digest of the entire body of law even then become unwieldy and oppressive the establishment of vast and comprehensive public library greek as well as latin the chastisement of dacium -lrb- that need a cow-hiding for insolence as much as affghanistan from we in 1840 -rrb- the conquest of parthium and the cut a ship canal through the isthmus of corinth the reformation of the calendar he have already accomplish and of all he project it may be say that they be equally patriotic in they purpose and colossal in they proportion as a orator caesar 's merit be so eminent that accord to the general belief have he find time to cultivate this department of civil exertion the receive supremacy of cicero would have be make questionable or the honor would have be divide cicero himself be of that opinion and on different occasion apply the epithet _ splendidus _ to caesar as though in some exclusive sense or with some peculiar emphasis due to he he taste be much simpler chaster and less inclined to the _ florid _ and asiatic than that of cicero so far he would in that condition of the roman culture and feeling have be less acceptable to the public but on the other hand he would have compensate this disadvantage by much more of natural and demosthenic fervor in literature the merit of caesar be familiar to most reader under the modest title of _ commentary _ he mean to offer the record of he gallic and british campaign simply as note or memorandum afterwards to be work up by regular historian but as cicero observe they merit be such in the eye of the discerning that all judicious writer shrink from the attempt to alter they in another instance of he literary labor he show a very just sense of true dignity rightly conceive that everything patriotic be dignified and that to illustrate or polish he native language be a service of real and paramount patriotism he compose a work on the grammar and orthoepy of the latin language cicero and himself be the only roman of distinction in that age who apply themselves with true patriotism to the task of purify and ennoble they mother tongue both be aware of a transcendent value in the grecian literature as it then stand but that splendor do not depress they hope of raise they own to something of the same level as respect the natural wealth of the two language it be the private opinion of cicero that the latin have the advantage and if caesar do not accompany he to that length -- which perhaps under some limitation he ought to have do -- he yet feel that it be but the more necessary to draw forth any special or exceptional advantage which it really have be caesar upon the whole the greatest of man we restrict the question of course to the class of man great in _ action _ : great by the extent of they influence over they social

the setting of the sun and the north star ii -- among the helvetii orgetorix be by far the most distinguished and wealthy he when marcus messalum and marcus piso be consul incite by lust of sovereignty form a conspiracy among the nobility and persuade the people to go forth from they territory with all they possession -lrb- say -rrb- that it would be very easy since they excel all in valor to acquire the supremacy of the whole of gaul to this he the more easily persuade they because the helvetius be confine on every side by the nature of they situation on one side by the rhine a very broad and deep river which separate the helvetian territory from the german on a second side by the jura a very high mountain which be -lrb- situate -rrb- between the sequanus and the helvetius on a third by the lake of geneva and by the river rhone which separate we province from the helvetius from these circumstance it result that they could range less widely and could less easily make war upon they neighbor for which reason man fond of war -lrb- as they be -rrb- be affect with great regret they think that consider the extent of they population and they renown for warfare and bravery they have but narrow limit although they extend in length 240 and in breadth 180 -lrb- roman -rrb- mile iii -- induce by these consideration and influence by the authority of orgetorix they determine to provide such thing as be necessary for they expedition -- to buy up as great a number as possible of beast of burden and waggon -- to make they sowing as large as possible so that on they march plenty of corn might be in store -- and to establish peace and friendship with the neighbouring state they reckon that a term of two year would be sufficient for they to execute they design they fix by decree they departure for the third year orgetorix be choose to complete these arrangement he take upon himself the office of ambassador to the state : on this journey he persuade casticus the son of catamantalede -lrb- one of the sequani whose father have possess the sovereignty among the people for many year and have be style _ friend _ by the senate of the roman people -rrb- to seize upon the sovereignty in he own state which he father have hold before he and he likewise persuade dumnorix a aeduan the brother of divitiacus who at that time possess the chief authority in the state and be exceedingly beloved by the people to attempt the same and give he he daughter in marriage he prove to they that to accomplish they attempt be a thing very easy to be do because he himself would obtain the government of he own state that there be no doubt that the helvetius be the most powerful of the whole of gaul he assure they that he will with he own force and he own army acquire the sovereignty for they incite by this speech they give a pledge and oath to one another and hope that when they have seize the sovereignty they will by means of the three most powerful and valiant nation be enable to obtain possession of the whole of gaul iv -- when this scheme be disclose to the helvetius by informer they accord to they custom compel orgetorix to plead he cause in chain it be the law that the penalty of be burn by fire should await he if condemn on the day appoint for the plead of he cause orgetorix draw together from all quarter to the court all he vassal to the number of ten thousand person and lead together to the same place and all he dependant and debtor-bondsman of whom he have a great number by means of these he rescue himself from -lrb- the necessity of -rrb- plead he cause while the state incense at this act be endeavor to assert its right by arm and the magistrate be muster a large body of man from the country orgetorix die and there be not want a suspicion as the helvetii think of he have commit suicide v -- after he death the helvetius nevertheless attempt to do that which they have resolve on namely to go forth from they territory when they think that they be at length prepare for this undertaking they set fire to all they town in number about twelve -- to they village about four hundred -- and to the private dwelling that remain they burn up all the corn except what they intend to carry with they that after destroy the hope of a return home they might be the more ready for undergo all danger they order every one to carry forth from home for himself provision for three month ready ground they persuade the rauracus and the tulingus and the latobrigus they neighbor to adopt the same plan and after burn down they town and village to set out with they : and they admit to they party and unite to themselves as confederate the boius who have dwell on the other side of the rhine and have cross over into the norican territory and assault noreia vi -- there be in all two route by which they could go forth from they country -- one through the sequani narrow and difficult between mount jura and the river rhone -lrb- by which scarcely one waggon at a time could be lead there be moreover a very high mountain overhang so that a very few might easily intercept they -rrb- the other through we province much easier and freer from obstacle because the rhone flow between the boundary of the helvetius and those of the allobroge who have lately be subdue and be in some place cross by a ford the furthest town of the allobroge and the nearest to the territory of the helvetius be geneva from this town a bridge extend to the helvetius they think that they should either persuade the allobroge because they do not seem as yet well-affected towards the roman people or compel they by force to allow they to pass through they territory have provide everything for the expedition they appoint a day on which they should all meet on the bank of the rhone this day be the fifth before the kalends of April -lrb- _ ie _ the 28th of march -rrb- in the consulship of lucius piso and aulus gabinius -lrb- bc 58 -rrb- vii -- when it be report to caesar that they be attempt to make they route through we province he hasten to set out from the city and by as great march as he can proceeds to further gaul and arrive at geneva he order the whole province -lrb- to furnish -rrb- as great a number of soldier as possible as there be in all only one legion in further gaul : he order the bridge at geneva to be break down when the helvetius be apprise of he arrival they send to he as ambassador the most illustrious man of they state -lrb- in which embassy numeius and verudoctius hold the chief place -rrb- to say that it be they intention to march through the province without do any harm because they have -lrb- accord to they own representation -rrb- no other route : -- that they request they might be allow to do so with he consent caesar inasmuch as he keep in remembrance that lucius cassius the consul have be slay and he army route and make to pass under the yoke by the helvetius do not think that -lrb- they request -rrb- ought to be grant nor be he of opinion that man of hostile disposition if a opportunity of march through the province be give they would abstain from outrage and mischief yet in order that a period might intervene until the soldier whom he have order -lrb- to be furnish -rrb- should assemble he reply to the ambassador that he would take time to deliberate if they want anything they might return on the day before the ides of April -lrb- on April 12th -rrb- viii -- meanwhile with the legion which he have with he and the soldier who have assemble from the province he carry along for nineteen -lrb- roman not quite eighteen english -rrb- mile a wall to the height of sixteen foot and a trench from the lake of geneva which flow into the river rhone to mount jura which separate the territory of the sequanus from those of the helvetius when that work be finish he distribute garrison and closely fortify redoubt in order that he may the more easily intercept they if they should attempt to cross over against he will when the day which he have appoint with the ambassador come and they return to he he say that he can not consistently with the custom and precedent of the roman people grant any one a passage through the province and he give they to understand that if they should attempt to use violence he would oppose they the helvetii disappointed in this hope try if they could force a passage -lrb- some by means of a bridge of boat and numerous raft construct for the purpose other by the ford of the rhone where the depth of the river be least sometimes by day but more frequently by night -rrb- but be keep at bay by the strength of we work and by the concourse of the soldier and by the missile they desist from this attempt ix -- there be leave one way -lrb- namely -rrb- through the sequanus by which on account of its narrowness they could not pass without the consent of the sequanus as they could not of themselves prevail on they they send ambassador to dumnorix the aeduan that through he intercession they might obtain they request from the sequani dumnorix by he popularity and liberality have great influence among the sequanus and be friendly to the helvetius because out of that state he have marry the daughter of orgetorix and incite by lust of sovereignty be anxious for a revolution and wish to have as many state as possible attach to he by he kindness towards they he therefore undertake the affair and prevail upon the sequanus to allow the helvetius to march through they territory and arrange that they should give hostage to each other -- the sequanus not to obstruct the helvetius in they march -- the helvetius to pass without mischief and outrage x -- it-is again tell caesar that the helvetii intend to march through the country of the sequanus and the aeduus into the territory of the santone which be not far distant from those boundary of the tolosate which -lrb- viz tolosa toulouse -rrb- be a state in the province if this take place he see that it would be attend with great danger to the province to have warlike man enemy of the roman people border upon a open and very fertile tract of country for these reason he appoint titus labienus he lieutenant to the command of the fortification which he have make he himself proceed to italy by force march and there levy two legion and lead out from winter-quarter three which be winter around aquileium and with these five legion march rapidly by the nearest route across the alp into further gaul here the centrone and the graiocelus and the caturige have take possession of the higher part attempt to obstruct the army in they march after have route these in several battle he arrive in the territory of the vocontius in the further province on the seventh day from ocelum which be the most remote town of the hither province thence he lead he army into the country of the allobroge and from the allobroge to the segusianus these people be the first beyond the province on the opposite side of the rhone xi -- the helvetius have by this time lead they force over through the narrow defile and the territory of the sequanus and have arrive at the territory of the aeduus and be ravage they land the aeduus as they could not defend themselves and they possession against they send ambassador to caesar to ask assistance -lrb- plead -rrb- that they have at all time so well deserve of the roman people that they field ought not to have be lay waste -- they child carry off into slavery -- they town storm almost within sight of we army at the same time the ambarrus the friend and kinsman of the aeduus apprise caesar that it be not easy for they now that they field have be devastate to ward off the violence of the enemy from they town : the allobroge likewise who have village and possession on the other side of the rhone betake themselves in flight to caesar and assure he that they have nothing remain except the soil of they land caesar induce by these circumstance decide that he ought not to wait until the helvetius after destroy all the property of he ally should arrive among the santone xii -- there be a river -lrb- call -rrb- the saone which flow through the territory of the aeduus and sequanus into the rhone with such incredible slowness that it can not be determine by the eye in which direction it flow this the helvetius be cross by raft and boat join together when caesar be inform by spy that the helvetius have already convey three part of they force across that river but that the fourth part be leave behind on this side of the saone he set out from the camp with three legion during the third watch and come up with that division which have not yet cross the river attack they encumber with baggage and not expect he he cut to piece a great part of they the rest betook themselves to flight and conceal themselves in the nearest wood that canton -lrb- which be cut down -rrb- be call the tigurine for the whole helvetian state be divide into four canton this single canton have leave they country within the recollection of we father have slay lucius cassius the consul and have make he army pass under the yoke -lrb- bc 107 -rrb- thus whether by chance or by the design of the immortal god that part of the helvetian state which have bring a signal calamity upon the roman people be the first to pay the penalty in this caesar avenge not only the public but also he own personal wrong because the tigurinus have slay lucius piso the lieutenant -lrb- of cassius -rrb- the grandfather of lucius calpurnius piso he -lrb- caesar 's -rrb- father-in-law in the same battle as cassius himself xiii -- this battle end that he might be able to come up with the remain force of the helvetius he procure a bridge to be make across the saone and thus lead he army over the helvetii confuse by he sudden arrival when they find that he have effect in one day what they themselves have with the utmost difficulty accomplish in twenty namely the cross of the river send ambassador to he at the head of which embassy be divico who have be commander of the helvetius in the war against cassius he thus treat with caesar : -- that if the roman people would make peace with the helvetius they would go to that part and there remain where caesar might appoint and desire they to be but if he should persist in persecute they with war that he ought to remember both the ancient disgrace of the roman people and the characteristic valor of the helvetius as to he have attack one canton by surprise -lrb- at a time -rrb- when those who have cross the river could not bring assistance to they friend that he ought not on that account to ascribe very much to he own valor or despise they that they have so learn from they sire and ancestor as to rely more on valor than on artifice or stratagem wherefore let he not bring it to pass that the place where they be stand should acquire a name from the disaster of the roman people and the destruction of they army or transmit the remembrance -lrb- of such a event to posterity -rrb- xiv -- to these word caesar thus reply : -- that on that very account he feel less hesitation because he keep in remembrance those circumstance which the helvetian ambassador have mention and that he feel the more indignant at they in proportion as they have happen undeservedly to the roman people : for if they have be conscious of have do any wrong it would not have be difficult to be on they guard but for that very reason have they be deceive because neither be they aware that any offence have be give by they on account of which they should be afraid nor do they think that they ought to be afraid without cause but even if he be willing to forget they former outrage could he also lay aside the remembrance of the late wrong in that they have against he will attempt a route through the province by force in that they have molest the aeduus the ambarrus and the allobroge that as to they so insolently boast of they victory and as to they be astonish that they have so long commit they outrage with impunity -lrb- both these thing -rrb- tend to the same point for the immortal god be wont to allow those person whom they wish to punish for they guilt sometimes a greater prosperity and longer impunity in order that they may suffer the more severely from a reverse of circumstance although these thing be so yet if hostage be to be give he by they in order that he may be assure they will do what they promise and provide they will give satisfaction to the aeduus for the outrage which they have commit against they and they ally and likewise to the allobroge he -lrb- caesar -rrb- will make peace with they divico reply that the helvetius have be so train by they ancestor that they be accustom to receive not to give hostage of that fact the roman people be witness have give this reply he withdraw xv -- on the follow day they move they camp from that place caesar do the same and send forward all he cavalry to the number of four thousand -lrb- which he have draw together from all part of the province and from the aeduus and they ally -rrb- to observe towards what part the enemy be direct they march these have too eagerly pursue the enemy 's rear come to a battle with the cavalry of the helvetius in a disadvantageous place and a few of we man fall the helvetii elated with this battle because they have with five hundred horse repulse so large a body of horse begin to face we more boldly sometimes too from they rear to provoke we man by a attack caesar -lrb- however -rrb- restrain he man from battle deem it sufficient for the present to prevent the enemy from rapine forage and depredation they march for about fifteen day in such a manner that there be not more than five or six mile between the enemy 's rear and we van xvi -- meanwhile caesar keep daily importune the aeduus for the corn which they have promise in the name of they state for in consequence of the coldness -lrb- gaul being as before say situate towards the north -rrb- not only be the corn in the field not ripe but there be not in store a sufficiently large quantity even of fodder : besides he be unable to use the corn which he have convey in ship up the river saone because the helvetius from whom he be unwilling to retire have divert they march from the saone the aeduus keep defer from day to day and say that it be be collect -- bring in -- on the road when he see that he be put off too long and that the day be close at hand on which he ought to serve out the corn to he soldier -- have call together they chief of whom he have a great number in he camp among they divitiacus and liscus who be invest with the chief magistracy -lrb- whom the aedui style the vergobretus and who be elect annually and have power of life and death over he countryman -rrb- he severely reprimand they because he be not assist by they on so urgent a occasion when the enemy be so close at hand and when -lrb- corn -rrb- could neither be buy nor take from the field particularly as in a great measure urge by they prayer he have undertake the war much more bitterly therefore do he complain of he be forsake xvii -- then at length liscus move by caesar 's speech disclose what he have hitherto keep secret : -- that there be some whose influence with the people be very great who though private man have more power than the magistrate themselves : that these by seditious and violent language be deter the populace from contribute the corn which they ought to supply -lrb- by tell they -rrb- that if they can not any longer retain the supremacy of gaul it be better to submit to the government of gaul than of roman nor ought they to doubt that if the roman should overpower the helvetius they would wrest they freedom from the aeduus together with the remainder of gaul by these very man -lrb- say he -rrb- be we plan and whatever be do in the camp disclose to the enemy that they could not be restrain by _ he _ : nay more he be well aware that though compel by necessity he have disclose the matter to caesar at how great a risk he have do it and for that reason he have be silent as long as he could xviii -- caesar perceive that by this speech of liscus dumnorix the brother of divitiacus be indicate but as he be unwilling that these matter should be discuss while so many be present he speedily dismiss the council but detain liscus : he inquire from he when alone about those thing which he have say in the meeting he -lrb- liscus -rrb- speak more unreservedly and boldly he -lrb- caesar -rrb- make inquiry on the same point privately of other and discover that it be all true that dumnorix be the person a man of the highest daring in great favor with the people on account of he liberality a man eager for a revolution : that for a great many year he have be in the habit of contracting for the custom and all the other tax of the aeduus at a small cost because when _ he _ bid no one dare to bid against he by these means he have both increase he own private property and amass great means for give largess that he maintain constantly at he own expense and keep about he own person a great number of cavalry and that not only at home but even among the neighbouring state he have great influence and for the sake of strengthen this influence have give he mother in marriage among the biturige to a man the most noble and most influential there that he have himself take a wife from among the helvetius and have give he sister by the mother 's side and he female relation in marriage into other state that he favor and wish well to the helvetius on account of this connection and that he hate caesar and the roman on he own account because by they arrival he power be weaken and he brother divitiacus restore to he former position of influence and dignity : that if anything should happen to the roman he entertain the highest hope of gain the sovereignty by means of the helvetius but that under the government of the roman people he despair not only of royalty but even of that influence which he already have caesar discover too on inquire into the unsuccessful cavalry engagement which have take place a few day before that the commencement of that flight have be make by dumnorix and he cavalry -lrb- for dumnorix be in command of the cavalry which the aeduus have send for aid to caesar -rrb- that by they flight the rest of the cavalry be dismayed xix -- after learn these circumstance since to these suspicion the most unequivocal fact be add viz that he have lead the helvetius through the territory of the sequanus that he have provide that hostage should be mutually give that he have do all these thing not only without any order of he -lrb- caesar 's -rrb- and of he own state 's but even without they -lrb- the aeduus -rrb- know anything of it themselves that he -lrb- dumnorix -rrb- be reprimand by the -lrb- chief -rrb- magistrate of the aeduus he -lrb- caesar -rrb- consider that there be sufficient reason why he should either punish he himself or order the state to do so one thing -lrb- however -rrb- stand in the way of all this -- that he have learn by experience he brother divitiacus 's very high regard for the roman people he great affection towards he he distinguished faithfulness justice and moderation for he be afraid lest by the punishment of this man he should hurt the feeling of divitiacus therefore before he attempt anything he order divitiacus to be summon to he and when the ordinary interpreter have be withdraw converse with he through caius valerius procillus chief of the province of gaul a intimate friend of he in whom he repose the highest confidence in everything at the same time he remind he of what be say about dumnorix in the council of the gaul when he himself be present and show what each have say of he privately in he -lrb- caesar 's -rrb- own presence he beg and exhort he that without offence to he feeling he may either himself pass judgment on he -lrb- dumnorix -rrb- after try the case or else order the -lrb- aeduan -rrb- state to do so xx-divitiacus embrace caesar begin to implore he with many tear that he would not pass any very severe sentence upon he brother say that he know that those -lrb- charge -rrb- be true and that nobody suffer more pain on that account than he himself do for when he himself could effect a very great deal by he influence at home and in the rest of gaul and he -lrb- dumnorix -rrb- very little on account of he youth the latter have become powerful through he means which power and strength he use not only to the lessen of he -lrb- divitiacus -rrb- popularity but almost to he ruin that he however be influence both by fraternal affection and by public opinion but if anything very severe from caesar should befall he -lrb- dumnorix -rrb- no one would think that it have be do without he consent since he himself hold such a place in caesar 's friendship from which circumstance it would arise that the affection of the whole of gaul would be estrange from he as he be with tear beg these thing of caesar in many word caesar take he right hand and comforting he beg he to make a end of entreat and assure he that he regard for he be so great that he forgive both the injury of the republic and he private wrong at he desire and prayer he summons dumnorix to he he bring in he brother he point out what he censure in he he lay before he what he of himself perceive and what the state complain of he warn he for the future to avoid all grounds of suspicion he say that he pardon the past for the sake of he brother divitiacus he set spy over dumnorix that he may be able to know what he do and with whom he communicate xxi -- be on the same day inform by he scout that the enemy have encamp at the foot of a mountain eight mile from he own camp he send person to ascertain what the nature of the mountain be and of what kind the ascent on every side word be bring back that it be easy during the third watch he order titus labienus he lieutenant with praetorian power to ascend to the highest ridge of the mountain with two legion and with those as guide who have examine the road he explain what he plan be he himself during the fourth watch hasten to they by the same route by which the enemy have go and send on all the cavalry before he publius considius who be repute to be very experience in military affair and have be in the army of lucius sullum and afterwards in that of marcus crassus be send forward with the scout xxii -- at day-break when the summit of the mountain be in the possession of titus labienus and he himself be not further off than a mile and half from the enemy 's camp nor as he afterwards ascertain from the captive have either he arrival or that of labienus be discover considius with he horse at full gallop come up to he -- say that the mountain which he -lrb- caesar -rrb- wish should be seize by labienus be in possession of the enemy that he have discover this by the gallic arm and ensign caesar lead off he force to the next hill : -lrb- and -rrb- draw they up in battle-order labienus as he have be order by caesar not to come to a engagement unless -lrb- caesar 's -rrb- own force be see near the enemy 's camp that the attack upon the enemy might be make on every side at the same time be after have take possession of the mountain wait for we man and refrain from battle when at length the day be far advance caesar learn through spy that the mountain be in possession of he own man and that the helvetius have move they camp and that considius strike with fear have report to he as see that which he have not see on that day he follow the enemy at he usual distance and pitch he camp three mile from theirs xxiii -- the next day -lrb- as there remain in all only two day ' space -lrb- to the time -rrb- when he must serve out the corn to he army and as he be not more than eighteen mile from bibracte by far the largest and best-stored town of the aeduus -rrb- he think that he ought to provide for a supply of corn and divert he march from the helvetius and advance rapidly to bibracte this circumstance be report to the enemy by some deserter from lucius aemilius a captain of the gallic horse the helvetius either because they think that the roman strike with terror be retreat from they the more so as the day before though they have seize on the higher grounds they have not join battle or because they flatter themselves that they might be cut off from the provision alter they plan and change they route begin to pursue and to annoy we man in the rear xxiv -- caesar when he observe this draw off he force to the next hill and send the cavalry to sustain the attack of the enemy he himself meanwhile draw up on the middle of the hill a triple line of he four veteran legion in such a manner that he place above he on the very summit the two legion which he have lately levy in hither gaul and all the auxiliary and he order that the whole mountain should be cover with man and that meanwhile the baggage should be bring together into one place and the position be protect by those who be post in the upper line the helvetii have follow with all they waggon collect they baggage into one place : they themselves after have repulse we cavalry and form a phalanx advance up to we front line in very close order xxv -- caesar have remove out of sight first he own horse then those of all that he might make the danger of all equal and do away with the hope of flight after encourage he man join battle he soldier hurl they javelin from the higher ground easily break the enemy 's phalanx that be disperse they make a charge on they with draw sword it be a great hindrance to the gaul in fight that when several of they buckler have be by one stroke of the -lrb- roman -rrb- javelin pierce through and pin fast together as the point of the iron have bent itself they could neither pluck it out nor with they left hand entangled fight with sufficient ease so that many after have long toss they arm about choose rather to cast away the buckler from they hand and to fight with they person unprotected at length wear out with wound they begin to give way and as there be in the neighborhood a mountain about a mile off to betake themselves thither when the mountain have be gain and we man be advance up the boius and tulingus who with about 15000 man close the enemy 's line of march and serve as a guard to they rear have assail we man on the expose flank as they advance -lrb- prepared -rrb- to surround they upon see which the helvetius who have betake themselves to the mountain begin to press on again and renew the battle the roman have face about advance to the attack in two division the first and second line to withstand those who have be defeat and drive off the field the third to receive those who be just arrive xxvi -- thus be the contest long and vigorously carry on with doubtful success when they could no longer withstand the attack of we man the one division as they have begin to do betake themselves to the mountain the other repair to they baggage and waggon for during the whole of this battle although the fight last from the seventh hour -lrb- _ ie _ 12 -lrb- noon -rrb- -- 1 pm -rrb- to eventide no one could see a enemy with he back turn the fight be carry on also at the baggage till late in the night for they have set waggon in the way as a rampart and from the higher ground keep throw weapon upon we man as they come on and some from between the waggon and the wheel keep dart they lance and javelin from beneath and wound we man after the fight have last some time we man gain possession of they baggage and camp there the daughter and one of the son of orgetorix be take after that battle about 130000 man -lrb- of the enemy -rrb- remain alive who march incessantly during the whole of that night and after a march discontinue for no part of the night arrive in the territory of the lingone on the fourth day whilst we man have stop for three day both on account of the wound of the soldier and the burial of the slay have not be able to follow they caesar send letter and messenger to the lingone -lrb- with order -rrb- that they should not assist they with corn or with anything else for that if they should assist they he would regard they in the same light as the helvetius after the three day ' interval he begin to follow they himself with all he force xxvii -- the helvetii compel by the want of everything send ambassador to he about a surrender when these have meet he in the way and have throw themselves at he foot and speak in suppliant tone have with tear sue for peace and -lrb- when -rrb- he have order they to await he arrival in the place where they then be they obey he command when caesar arrive at that place he demand hostage they arm and the slave who have desert to they whilst those thing be be seek for and get together after a night 's interval about 6000 man of that canton which be call the verbigene whether terrify by fear lest after deliver up they arm they should suffer punishment or else induce by the hope of safety because they suppose that amid so vast a multitude of those who have surrender themselves _ they _ flight might either be conceal or entirely overlook have at night-fall depart out of the camp of the helvetii hasten to the rhine and the territory of the german xxviii -- but when caesar discover this he command those through whose territory they have go to seek they out and to bring they back again if they mean to be acquit before he and consider they when bring back in the light of enemy he admit all the rest to a surrender upon they deliver up the hostage arm and deserter he order the helvetius the tulingus and the latobrigus to return to they territory from which they have come and as there be at home nothing whereby they might support they hunger all the production of the earth have be destroy he command the allobroge to let they have a plentiful supply of corn and order they to rebuild the town and village which they have burn this he do chiefly on this account because he be unwilling that the country from which the helvetius have depart should be untenanted lest the german who dwell on the other side of the rhine should on account of the excellence of the land cross over from they own territory into those of the helvetius and become borderer upon the province of gaul and the allobroge he grant the petition of the aeduus that they might settle the boius in they own -lrb- _ ie _ in the aeduan -rrb- territory as these be know to be of distinguished valor to whom they give land and whom they afterwards admit to the same state of rights and freedom as themselves xxix -- in the camp of the helvetius list be find draw up in greek character and be bring to caesar in which a estimate have be draw up name by name of the number which have go forth from they country of those who be able to bear arm and likewise the boy the old man and the woman separately of all which item the total be : - of the _ helvetius _ -lrb- light of the head of the helvetius -rrb- 263000 of the _ tulingus _ 36000 of the _ latobrigus _ 14000 of the _ rauracus _ 23000 of the _ boii _ 32000 ------- the sum of all amount to 368000 out of these such as could bear arm -lrb- amount -rrb- to about 92000 when the _ census _ of those who return home be take as caesar have command the number be find to be 110000 xxx -- when the war with the helvetius be conclude ambassador from almost all part of gaul the chief of state assemble to congratulate caesar -lrb- say -rrb- that they be well aware that although he have take vengeance on the helvetius in war for the old wrong do by they to the roman people yet that circumstance have happen no less to the benefit of the land of gaul than of the roman people because the helvetius while they affair be most flourishing have quit they country with the design of make war upon the whole of gaul and seize the government of it and select out of a great abundance that spot for a abode which they should judge to be the most convenient and most productive of all gaul and hold the rest of the state as tributary they request that they might be allow to proclaim a assembly of the whole of gaul for a particular day and to do that with caesar 's permission -lrb- state -rrb- that they have some thing which with the general consent they wish to ask of he this request have be grant they appoint a day for the assembly and ordain by a oath with each other that no one should disclose -lrb- they deliberation -rrb- except those to whom this -lrb- office -rrb- should be assign by the general assembly xxxi -- when that assembly be dismiss the same chief of state who have before be to caesar return and ask that they might be allow to treat with he privately -lrb- in secret -rrb- concern the safety of themselves and of all that request have be obtain they all throw themselves in tear at caesar 's foot -lrb- say -rrb- that they no less begged and earnestly desire that what they might say should not be disclose than that they might obtain those thing which they wish for inasmuch as they see that if a disclosure be make they should be put to the greatest torture for these divitiacus the aeduan speak and tell he : -- that there be two party in the whole of gaul : that the aeduus stand at the head of one of these the arvernus of the other after these have be violently struggle with one another for the superiority for many year it come to pass that the german be call in for hire by the arvernus and the sequanus that about 15000 of they -lrb- _ ie _ of the german -rrb- have at first cross the rhine : but after that these wild and savage man have become enamoured of the land and the refinement and the abundance of the gaul more be bring over that there be now as many as 120000 of they in gaul : that with these the aeduus and they dependant have repeatedly struggle in arm that they have be route and have sustain a great calamity -- have lose all they nobility all they senate all they cavalry and that break by such engagement and calamity although they have formerly be very powerful in gaul both from they own valor and from the roman people 's hospitality and friendship they be now compel to give the chief noble of they state as hostage to the sequanus and to bind they state by a oath that they would neither demand hostage in return nor supplicate aid from the roman people nor refuse to be for ever under they sway and empire that he be the only one out of all the state of the aeduus who could not be prevail upon to take the oath or to give he child as hostage on that account he have flee from he state and have go to the senate at rome to beseech aid as he alone be bind neither by oath nor hostage but a worse thing have befall the victorious sequanus than the vanquish aeduus for ariovistus the king of the german have settle in they territory and have seize upon a third of they land which be the best in the whole of gaul and be now order they to depart from another third part because a few month previously 24000 man of the harude have come to he for whom room and settlement must be provide the consequence would be that in a few year they would all be drive from the territory of gaul and all the german would cross the rhine for neither must the land of gaul be compare with the land of the german nor must the habit of living of the latter be put on a level with that of the former moreover -lrb- as for -rrb- ariovistus no sooner do he defeat the force of the gaul in a battle which take place at magetobrium than -lrb- he begin -rrb- to lord it haughtily and cruelly to demand as hostage the child of all the principal noble and wreak on they every kind of cruelty if everything be not do at he nod or pleasure that he be a savage passionate and reckless man and that he command could no longer be bear unless there be some aid in caesar and the roman people the gaul must all do the same thing that the helvetius have do -lrb- viz -rrb- emigrate from they country and seek another dwelling place other settlement remote from the german and try whatever fortune may fall to they lot if these thing be to be disclose to ariovistus -lrb- divitiacus add -rrb- that he doubt not that he would inflict the most severe punishment on all the hostage who be in he possession -lrb- and say -rrb- that caesar could either by he own influence and by that of he army or by he late victory or by name of the roman people intimidate he so as to prevent a greater number of german be bring over the rhine and could protect all gaul from the outrage of ariovistus xxxii -- when this speech have be deliver by divitiacus all who be present begin with loud lamentation to entreat assistance of caesar caesar notice that the sequanus be the only people of all who do none of those thing which the other do but with they head bow down gaze on the earth in sadness wonder what be the reason of this conduct he inquire of themselves no reply do the sequanus make but silently continue in the same sadness when he have repeatedly inquire of they and could not elicit any answer at all the same divitiacus the aeduan answer that -- the lot of the sequanus be more wretched and grievous than that of the rest on this account because they alone dare not even in secret complain or supplicate aid and shudder at the cruelty of ariovistus -lrb- even when -rrb- absent just as if he be present for to the rest despite of everything there be a opportunity of flight give but all torture must be endure by the sequanus who have admit ariovistus within they territory and whose town be all in he power xxxiii -- caesar on be inform of these thing cheer the mind of the gaul with he word and promise that this affair should be a object of he concern -lrb- say -rrb- that he have great hope that ariovistus induce both by he kindness and he power would put a end to he oppression after deliver this speech he dismiss the assembly and besides those statement many circumstance induce he to think that this affair ought to be consider and take up by he especially as he see that the aeduus style -lrb- as they have be -rrb- repeatedly by the senate brethren and kinsman be hold in the thraldom and dominion of the german and understand that they hostage be with ariovistus and the sequanus which in so mighty a empire -lrb- as that -rrb- of the roman people he consider very disgraceful to himself and the republic that moreover the german should by degree become accustomed to cross the rhine and that a great body of they should come into gaul he see -lrb- would be -rrb- dangerous to the roman people and judge that wild and savage man would not be likely to restrain themselves after they have possess themselves of all gaul from go forth into the province and thence march into italy -lrb- as the cimbrus and teutone have do before they -rrb- particularly as the rhone -lrb- be the sole barrier that -rrb- separate the sequanus from we province against which event he think he ought to provide as speedily as possible moreover ariovistus for he part have assume to himself such pride and arrogance that he be feel to be quite insufferable xxxiv -- he therefore determine to send ambassador to ariovistus to demand of he to name some intermediate spot for a conference between the two -lrb- say -rrb- that he wish to treat with he on state-business and matter of the highest importance to both of they to this embassy ariovistus reply that if he himself have have need of anything from caesar he would have go to he and that if caesar want anything from he he ought to come to he that besides neither dare he go without a army into those part of gaul which caesar have possession of nor could he without great expense and trouble draw he army together to one place that to he moreover it appear strange what business either caesar or the roman people at all have in he own gaul which he have conquer in war xxxv -- when these answer be report to caesar he send ambassador to he a second time with this message since after have be treat with so much kindness by himself and the roman people -lrb- as he have in he consulship -lrb- bc 59 -rrb- be style ` king and friend ' by the senate -rrb- he make this recompense to -lrb- caesar -rrb- himself and the roman people -lrb- viz -rrb- that when invite to a conference he demur and do not think that it concern he to advise and inform himself about a object of mutual interest these be the thing which he require of he first that he do not any more bring over any body of man across the rhine into gaul in the next place that he restore the hostage which he have from the aeduus and grant the sequani permission to restore to they with he consent those hostage which they have and that he neither provoke the aeduus by outrage nor make war upon they or they ally if he would accordingly do this -lrb- caesar say -rrb- that he himself and the roman people will entertain a perpetual feeling of favor and friendship towards he but that if he -lrb- caesar -rrb- do not obtain -lrb- he desire -rrb- that he -lrb- forasmuch as in the consulship of marcus messalum and marcus piso -lrb- bc 61 -rrb- the senate have decree that whoever should have the administration of the province of gaul should as far as he could do so consistently with the interest of the republic protect the aeduus and the other friend of the roman people -rrb- will not overlook the wrong of the aeduus xxxvi -- to this ariovistus reply that the right of war be that they who have conquer should govern those whom they have conquer in what manner they please that in that way the roman people be wont to govern the nation which they have conquer not accord to the dictation of any other but accord to they own discretion if he for he part do not dictate to the roman people as to the manner in which they be to exercise they right he ought not to be obstruct by the roman people in he right that the aeduus inasmuch as they have try the fortune of war and have engage in arm and be conquer have become tributary to he that caesar be do a great injustice in that by he arrival he be make he revenue less valuable to he that he should not restore they hostage to the aeduus but should not make war wrongfully either upon they or they ally if they abide by that which have be agree on and pay they tribute annually : if they do _ not _ continue to do that the roman people 's name of ` brother ' would avail they nought as to caesar 's threaten he that be would not overlook the wrong of the aeduus -lrb- he say -rrb- that no one have ever enter into a contest with _ he _ -lrb- ariovistus -rrb- without utter ruin to himself that caesar might enter the list when he choose he would feel what the invincible german well-trained -lrb- as they be -rrb- beyond all other to arm who for fourteen year have not be beneath a roof could achieve by they valor xxxvii -- at the same time that this message be deliver to caesar ambassador come from the aeduus and the trevirus from the aeduus to complain that the harude who have lately be bring over into gaul be ravage they territory that they have not be able to purchase peace from ariovistus even by give hostage : and from the trevirus -lrb- to state -rrb- that a hundred canton of the suevus have encamp on the bank of the rhine and be attempt to cross it that the brother nasua and cimberius head they be greatly alarm at these thing caesar think that he ought to use all despatch lest if thus new band of suevus should unite with the old troops of ariovistus he -lrb- ariovistus -rrb- might be less easily withstand have therefore as quickly as he could provide a supply of corn he hasten to ariovistus by forced march xxxviii -- when he have proceed three day ' journey word be bring to he that ariovistus be hasten with all he force to seize on vesontio which be the largest town of the sequanus and have advance three day ' journey from he territory caesar think that he ought to take the greatest precaution lest this should happen for there be in that town a most ample supply of everything which be serviceable for war and so fortify be it by the nature of the ground as to afford a great facility for protract the war inasmuch as the river doub almost surround the whole town as though it be trace round it with a pair of compass a mountain of great height shut in the remain space which be not more than 600 foot where the river leave a gap in such a manner that the root of that mountain extend to the river 's bank on either side a wall throw around it make a citadel of this -lrb- mountain -rrb- and connect it with the town hither caesar hasten by force march by night and day and after have seize the town station a garrison there xxxix -- whilst he be tarry a few day at vesontio on account of corn and provision from the inquiry of we man and the report of the gaul and trader -lrb- who assert that the german be man of huge stature of incredible valor and practice in arm that ofttime they on encounter they could not bear even they countenance and the fierceness of they eye -rrb- -- so great a panic on a sudden seize the whole army as to discompose the mind and spirit of all in no slight degree this first arise from the tribune of the soldier the prefect and the rest who have follow caesar from the city -lrb- rome -rrb- from motive of friendship have no great experience in military affair and allege some of they one reason some another which they say make it necessary for they to depart they request that by he consent they might be allow to withdraw some influence by shame stay behind in order that they might avoid the suspicion of cowardice these could neither compose they countenance nor even sometimes check they tear : but hide in they tent either bewail they fate or deplore with they comrade the general danger will be seal universally throughout the whole camp by the expression and cowardice of these man even those who possess great experience in the camp both soldier and centurion and those -lrb- the decurion -rrb- who be in command of the cavalry be gradually disconcert such of they as wish to be consider less alarmed say that they do not dread the enemy but fear the narrowness of the road and the vastness of the forest which lay between they and ariovistus or else that the supplies could not be bring up readily enough some even declare to caesar that when he give order for the camp to be move and the troops to advance the soldier would not be obedient to the command nor advance in consequence of they fear xl -- when caesar observe these thing have call a council and summon to it the centurion of all the company he severely reprimand they particularly for suppose that it belong to they to inquire or conjecture either in what direction they be march or with what object that ariovistus during he -lrb- caesar 's -rrb- consulship have most anxiously seek after the friendship of the roman people why should any one judge that he would so rashly depart from he duty he for he part be persuade that when he demand be know and the fairness of the term consider he would reject neither he nor the roman people 's favor but even if drive on by rage and madness he should make war upon they what after all be they afraid of -- or why should they despair either of they own valor or of he zeal of that enemy a trial have be make within we father ' recollection when on the defeat of the cimbrus and teutone by caius marius the army be regard as have deserve no less praise than they commander himself it have be make lately too in italy during the rebellion of the slave whom however the experience and training which they have receive from we assist in some respect from which a judgment might be form of the advantage which resolution carry with it -- inasmuch as those whom for some time they have groundlessly dread when unarmed they have afterwards vanquish when well arm and flush with success in short that these be the same man whom the helvetius in frequent encounter not only in they own territory but also in theirs -lrb- the german -rrb- have generally vanquish and yet can not have be a match for we army if the unsuccessful battle and flight of the gaul disquiet any these if they make inquiry might discover that when the gaul have be tire out by the long duration of the war ariovistus after he have many month keep himself in he camp and in the marsh and have give no opportunity for a engagement fall suddenly upon they by this time despairing of a battle and scatter in all direction and be victorious more through stratagem and cunning than valor but though there have be room for such stratagem against savage and unskilled man not even -lrb- ariovistus -rrb- himself expect that thereby we army could be entrap that those who ascribe they fear to a pretence about the -lrb- deficiency of -rrb- supplies and the narrowness of the road act presumptuously as they seem either to distrust they general 's discharge of he duty or to dictate to he that these thing be he concern that the sequanus the leucus and the lingone be to furnish the corn and that it be already ripe in the field that as to the road they would soon be able to judge for themselves as to its be report that the soldier would not be obedient to command or advance he be not at all disturb at that for he know that in the case of all those whose army have not be obedient to command either upon some mismanagement of a affair fortune have desert they or that upon some crime be discover covetousness have be clearly prove -lrb- against they -rrb- he integrity have be see throughout he whole life he good fortune in the war with the helvetius that he would therefore instantly set about what he have intend to put off till a more distant day and would break up he camp the next night in the fourth watch that he might ascertain as soon as possible whether a sense of honor and duty or whether fear have more influence with they but that if no one else should follow yet he would go with only the tenth legion of which he have no misgiving and it should be he praetorian cohort -- this legion caesar have both greatly favor and in it on account of its valor place the greatest confidence xli-upon the delivery of this speech the mind of all be change in a surprising manner and the highest ardor and eagerness for prosecute the war be engender and the tenth legion be the first to return thanks to he through they military tribune for he have express this most favourable opinion of they and assure he that they be quite ready to prosecute the war then the other legion endeavor through they military tribune and the centurion of the principal company to excuse themselves to caesar -lrb- say -rrb- that they have never either doubt or fear or suppose that the determination of the conduct of the war be theirs and not they general 's have accept they excuse and have have the road carefully reconnoitr by divitiacus because in he of all other he have the greatest faith -lrb- he find -rrb- that by a circuitous route of more than fifty mile he might lead he army through open part he then set out in the fourth watch as he have say -lrb- he would -rrb- on the seventh day as he do not discontinue he march he be inform by scout that the force of ariovistus be only four and twenty mile distant from ours xlii -- upon be apprise of caesar 's arrival ariovistus send ambassador to he -lrb- say -rrb- that what he have before request as to a conference might now as far as he permission go take place since he -lrb- caesar -rrb- have approach nearer and he consider that he might now do it without danger caesar do not reject the proposal and begin to think that he be now return to a rational state of mind as he spontaneously proffer that which he have previously refuse to he when request it and be in great hope that in consideration of he own and the roman people 's great favor towards he the issue would be that he would desist from he obstinacy upon he demand be make know the fifth day after that be appoint as the day of conference meanwhile as ambassador be be often send to and fro between they ariovistus demand that caesar should not bring any foot-soldier with he to the conference -lrb- say -rrb- that he be afraid of be ensnare by he through treachery that both should come accompany by cavalry that he would not come on any other condition caesar as he neither wish that the conference should by a excuse throw in the way be set aside nor dare trust he life to the cavalry of the gaul decide that it would be most expedient to take away from the gallic cavalry all they horse and thereon to mount the legionary soldier of the tenth legion in which he place the greatest confidence in order that he might have a body-guard as trustworthy as possible should there be any need for action and when this be do one of the soldier of the tenth legion say not without a touch of humor that caesar do more for they than he have promise he have promise to have the tenth legion in place of he praetorian cohort but he now convert they into horse xliii -- there be a large plain and in it a mound of earth of considerable size this spot be at nearly a equal distance from both camp thither as have be appoint they come for the conference caesar station the legion which he have bring -lrb- with he -rrb- on horseback 200 pace from this mound the cavalry of ariovistus also take they stand at a equal distance ariovistus then demand that they should confer on horseback and that besides themselves they should bring with they ten man each to the conference when they be come to the place caesar in the opening of he speech detail he own and the senate 's favor towards he -lrb- ariovistus -rrb- in that he have be style king in that -lrb- he have be style -rrb- friend by the senate -- in that very considerable present have be send he which circumstance he inform he have both fall to the lot of few and have usually be bestow in consideration of important personal service that he although he have neither a introduction nor a just ground for the request have obtain these honor through the kindness and munificence of himself -lrb- caesar -rrb- and the senate he inform he too how old and how just be the grounds of connexion that exist between themselves -lrb- the roman -rrb- and the aeduus what decree of the senate have be pass in they favor and how frequent and how honorable how from time immemorial the aeduus have hold the supremacy of the whole of gaul even -lrb- say caesar -rrb- before they have seek we friendship that it be the custom of the roman people to desire not only that its ally and friend should lose none of they property but be advance in influence dignity and honor : who then could endure that what they have bring with they to the friendship of the roman people should be tear from they he then make the same demand which he have commission the ambassador to make that -lrb- ariovistus -rrb- should not make war either upon the aeduus or they ally that he should restore the hostage that if he could not send back to they country any part of the german he should at all event suffer none of they any more to cross the rhine xliv -- ariovistus reply briefly to the demand of caesar but expatiate largely on he own virtue that he have cross the rhine not of he own accord but on be invite and send for by the gaul that he have not leave home and kindred without great expectation and great reward that he have settlement in gaul grant by the gaul themselves that the hostage have be give by they own good-will that he take by right of war the tribute which conqueror be accustom to impose on the conquer that he have not make war upon the gaul but the gaul upon he that all the state of gaul come to attack he and have encamp against he that all they force have be route and beat by he in a single battle that if they choose to make a second trial he be ready to encounter they again but if they choose to enjoy peace it be unfair to refuse the tribute which of they own free-will they have pay up to that time that the friendship of the roman people ought to prove to he a ornament and a safeguard not a detriment and that he seek it with that expectation but if through the roman people the tribute be to be discontinue and those who surrender to be seduce from he he would renounce the friendship of the roman people no less heartily than he have seek it as to he lead over a host of german into gaul that he be do this with a view of secure himself not of assault gaul : that there be evidence of this in that he do not come without be invite and in that he do not make war but merely ward it off that he have come into gaul before the roman people that never before this time do a roman army go beyond the frontier of the province of gaul what -lrb- say he -rrb- do -lrb- caesar -rrb- desire -- why come into he -lrb- ariovistus 's -rrb- domain -- that this be he province of gaul just as that be ours as it ought not to be pardon in he if he be to make a attack upon we territory so likewise that we be unjust to obstruct he in he prerogative as for caesar 's say that the aeduus have be style ` brethren ' by the senate he be not so uncivilized nor so ignorant of affair as not to know that the aeduus in the very last war with the allobroge have neither render assistance to the roman nor receive any from the roman people in the struggle which the aeduus have be maintain with he and with the sequanus he must feel suspicious that caesar though feign friendship as the reason for he keep a army in gaul be keep it with the view of crush he and that unless he depart and withdraw he army from these part he shall regard he not as a friend but as a foe and that even if he should put he to death he should do what would please many of the noble and lead man of the roman people he have assurance of that from themselves through they messenger and could purchase the favor and the friendship of they all by he -lrb- caesar 's -rrb- death but if he would depart and resign to he the free possession of gaul he would recompense he with a great reward and would bring to a close whatever war he wish to be carry on without any trouble or risk to he xlv -- many thing be state by caesar to the effect -lrb- to show -rrb- : why he could not waive the business and that neither he nor the roman people 's practice would suffer he to abandon most meritorious ally nor do he deem that gaul belong to ariovistus rather than to the roman people that the arvernus and the rutenus have be subdue in war by quintus fabius maximus and that the roman people have pardon they and have not reduce they into a province or impose a tribute upon they and if the most ancient period be to be regard -- then be the sovereignty of the roman people in gaul most just : if the decree of the senate be to be observe then ought gaul to be free which they -lrb- the roman -rrb- have conquer in war and have permit to enjoy its own law xlvi -- while these thing be be transact in the conference it be announce to caesar that the cavalry of ariovistus be approach nearer the mound and be ride up to we man and cast stone and weapon at they caesar make a end of he speech and betook himself to he man and command they that they should by no means return a weapon upon the enemy for though he see that a engagement with the cavalry would be without any danger to he choose legion yet he do not think proper to engage lest after the enemy be route it might be say that they have be ensnare by he under the sanction of a conference when it be spread abroad among the common soldiery with what haughtiness ariovistus have behave at the conference and how he have order the roman to quit gaul and how he cavalry have make a attack upon we man and how this have break off the conference a much greater alacrity and eagerness for battle be infuse into we army xlvii -- two day after ariovistus send ambassador to caesar to state that he wish to treat with he about those thing which have be begin to be treat of between they but have not be conclude -lrb- and to beg -rrb- that he would either again appoint a day for a conference or if he be not willing to do that that he would send one of he -lrb- officer -rrb- as a ambassador to he there do not appear to caesar any good reason for hold a conference and the more so as the day before the german could not be restrain from cast weapon at we man he think he should not without great danger send to he as ambassador one of he -lrb- roman -rrb- officer and should expose he to savage man it seem -lrb- therefore -rrb- most proper to send to he c valerius procillus the son of c valerius caburus a young man of the highest courage and accomplishment -lrb- whose father have be present with the freedom of the city by c valerius flaccus -rrb- both on account of he fidelity and on account of he knowledge of the gallic language which ariovistus by long practice now speak fluently and because in he case the german would have no motive for commit violence and -lrb- as he colleague -rrb- m mettius who have share the hospitality of ariovistus he commission they to learn what ariovistus have to say and to report to he but when ariovistus see they before he in he camp he cry out in the presence of he army why be they come to he be it for the purpose of act as spy he stop they when attempt to speak and cast they into chain xlviii -- the same day he move he camp forward and pitch under a hill six mile from caesar 's camp the day follow he lead he force past caesar 's camp and encamp two mile beyond he with this design -- that he might cut off caesar from the corn and provision which might be convey to he from the sequanus and the aeduus for five successive day from that day caesar draw out he force before the camp and put they in battle order that if ariovistus should be willing to engage in battle a opportunity might not be want to he ariovistus all this time keep he army in camp : but engage daily in cavalry skirmish the method of battle in which the german have practice themselves be this there be 6000 horse and as many very active and courageous foot one of whom each of the horse select out of the whole army for he own protection by these -lrb- foot -rrb- they be constantly accompany in they engagement to these the horse retire these on any emergency rush forward if any one upon receive a very severe wound have fall from he horse they stand around he : if it be necessary to advance farther : than usual or to retreat more rapidly so great from practice be they swiftness that support by the mane of the horse they could keep pace with they speed xlix -- perceive that ariovistus keep himself in camp caesar that he might not any longer be cut off from provision choose a convenient position for a camp beyond that place in which the german have encamp at about 600 pace from they and have draw up he army in three line march to that place he order the first and second line to be under arm the third to fortify the camp this place be distant from the enemy about 600 pace as have be state thither ariovistus send light troops about 16000 man in number with all he cavalry which force be to intimidate we man and hinder they in they fortification caesar nevertheless as he have before arrange order two line to drive off the enemy : the third to execute the work the camp be fortify he leave there two legion and a portion of the auxiliary and lead back the other four legion into the larger camp l -- the next day accord to he custom caesar lead out he force from both camp and have advance a little from the larger one draw up he line of battle and give the enemy a opportunity of fight when he find that they do not even then come out -lrb- from they entrenchment -rrb- he lead back he army into camp about noon then at last ariovistus send part of he force to attack the lesser camp the battle be vigorously maintain on both side till the evening at sunset after many wound have be inflict and receive ariovistus lead back he force into camp when caesar inquire of he prisoner wherefore ariovistus do not come to a engagement he discover this to be the reason -- that among the german it be the custom for they matron to pronounce from lot and divination whether it be expedient that the battle should be engage in or not that they have say that it be not the will of heaven that the german should conquer if they engage in battle before the new moon li -- the day follow caesar leave what seem sufficient as a guard for both camp -lrb- and then -rrb- draw up all the auxiliary in sight of the enemy before the lesser camp because he be not very powerful in the number of legionary soldier consider the number of the enemy that -lrb- thereby -rrb- he might make use of he auxiliary for appearance he himself have draw up he army in three line advance to the camp of the enemy then at last of necessity the german draw they force out of camp and dispose they canton by canton at equal distance the harude marcomannus triboccus vangione nemete sedusius suevus and surround they whole army with they chariot and waggon that no hope might be leave in flight on these they place they woman who with dishevelled hair and in tear entreat the soldier as they go forward to battle not to deliver they into slavery to the roman lii -- caesar appoint over each legion a lieutenant and a questor that every one might have they as witness of he valor he himself begin the battle at the head of the right wing because he have observe that part of the enemy to be the least strong accordingly we man upon the signal be give vigorously make a attack upon the enemy and the enemy so suddenly and rapidly rush forward that there be no time for cast the javelin at they throw aside -lrb- therefore -rrb- they javelin they fight with sword hand to hand but the german accord to they custom rapidly form a phalanx sustain the attack of we sword there be find very many of we soldier who leap upon the phalanx and with they hand tear away the shield and wound the enemy from above although the army of the enemy be route on the left wing and put to flight they -lrb- still -rrb- press heavily on we man from the right wing by the great number of they troops on observe which p crassus a young man who command the cavalry -- as he be more disengaged than those who be employ in the fight -- send the third line as a relief to we man who be in distress liii -- thereupon the engagement be renew and all the enemy turn they back nor do they cease to flee until they arrive at the river rhine about fifty mile from that place there some few either rely on they strength endeavor to swim over or find boat procure they safety among the latter be ariovistus who meet with a small vessel tie to the bank escape in it : we horse pursued and slew all the rest of they ariovistus have two wife one a suevan by nation whom he have bring with he from home the other a norican the sister of king vocion whom he have marry in gaul she have be send -lrb- thither for that purpose -rrb- by she brother both perish in that flight of they two daughter one be slay the other capture c valerius procillus as he be be drag by he guard in the flight bind with a triple chain fall into the hand of caesar himself as he be pursue the enemy with he cavalry this circumstance indeed afford caesar no less pleasure than the victory itself because he see a man of the first rank in the province of gaul he intimate acquaintance and friend rescue from the hand of the enemy and restore to he and that fortune have not diminish aught of the joy and exultation -lrb- of that day -rrb- by he destruction he -lrb- procillus -rrb- say that in he own presence the lot have be thrice consult respect he whether he should immediately be put to death by fire or be reserve for another time : that by the favor of the lot he be uninjured m mettius also be find and bring back to he -lrb- caesar -rrb- liv -- this battle have be report beyond the rhine the suevus who have come to the bank of that river begin to return home when the ubius who dwell nearest to the rhine pursue they while much alarmed slew a great number of they caesar have conclude two very important war in one campaign conduct he army into winter quarter among the sequanus a little earlier than the season of the year require he appoint labienus over the winter quarter and set out in person for hither gaul to hold the assizes book ii i -- while caesar be in winter quarter in hither gaul as we have show above frequent report be bring to he and he be also inform by letter from labienus that all the belga who we have say be a third part of gaul be enter into a confederacy against the roman people and give hostage to one another that the reason of the confederacy be these -- first because they fear that after all -lrb- celtic -rrb- gaul be subdue we army would be lead against they secondly because they be instigate by several of the gaul some of whom as -lrb- on the one hand -rrb- they have be unwilling that the german should remain any longer in gaul so -lrb- on the other -rrb- they be dissatisfy that the army of the roman people should pass the winter in it and settle there and other of they from a natural instability and fickleness of disposition be anxious for a revolution -lrb- the belga be instigate -rrb- by several also because the government in gaul be generally seize upon by the more powerful person and by those who have the means of hire troops and they could less easily effect this object under we dominion ii -- alarm by these tiding and letter caesar levy two new legion in hither gaul and at the beginning of summer send q pedius he lieutenant to conduct they further into gaul he himself as soon as there begin to be plenty of forage come to the army he give a commission to the senone and the other gaul who be neighbor of the belgae to learn what be go on amongst they -lrb- _ ie _ the belga -rrb- and inform he of these matter these all uniformly report that troops be be raise and that a army be be collect in one place then indeed he think that he ought not to hesitate about proceed towards they and have provide supplies move he camp and in about fifteen day arrive at the territory of the belgae iii -- as he arrive there unexpectedly and sooner than any one anticipate the remus who be the nearest of the belgae to -lrb- celtic -rrb- gaul send to he iccius and antebrogius -lrb- two of -rrb- the principal person of the state as they ambassador : to tell hum that they surrender themselves and all they possession to the protection and disposal of the roman people : and that they have neither combine with the rest of the belgae nor enter into any confederacy against the roman people : and be prepare to give hostage to obey he command to receive he into they town and to aid he with corn and other thing that all the rest of the belgae be in arm and that the german who dwell on this side the rhine have join themselves to they and that so great be the infatuation of they all that they could not restrain even the suessione they own brethren and kinsman who enjoy the same rights and the same law and who have one government and one magistracy -lrb- in common -rrb- with themselves from unite with they iv -- when caesar inquire of they what state be in arm how powerful they be and what they could do in war he receive the follow information : that the greater part of the belgae be spring from the german and that have cross the rhine at a early period they have settle there on account of the fertility of the country and have drive out the gaul who inhabit those region and that they be the only people who in the memory of we father when all gaul be overrun have prevent the teutone and the cimbrus from enter they territory the effect of which be that from the recollection of those event they assume to themselves great authority and haughtiness in military matter the remus say that they have know accurately everything respect they number because be unite to they by neighborhood and by alliance they have learn what number each state have in the general council of the belgae promise for that war that the bellovacus be the most powerful amongst they in valor influence and number of man that these could muster 100000 armed man -lrb- and have -rrb- promise 60000 pick man out of that number and demand for themselves the command of the whole war that the suessione be they nearest neighbor and possess a very extensive and fertile country that among they even in we own memory divitiacus the most powerful man of all gaul have be king who have hold the government of a great part of these region as well as of britain that they king at present be galba that the direction of the whole war be confer by the consent of all upon he on account of he integrity and prudence that they have twelve town that they have promise 50000 armed man and that the nervius who be reckon the most warlike among they and be situate at a very great distance -lrb- have promise -rrb- as many the atrebate 15000 the ambiani 10000 the morinus 25000 the menapu 9000 the caletus 10000 the velocass and the veromanduus as many the aduatucus 19000 that the condrusus the eburone the caeraesus the paemanus who be call by the common name of german -lrb- have promise -rrb- they think to the number of 40000 v -- caesar have encourage the remus and address they courteously order the whole senate to assemble before he and the child of they chief man to be bring to he as hostage all which command they punctually perform by the day -lrb- appoint -rrb- he address himself to divitiacus the aeduan with great earnestness point out how much it concern the republic and they common security that the force of the enemy should be divide so that it might not be necessary to engage with so large a number at one time -lrb- he assert -rrb- that this might be effect if the aeduus would lead they force into the territory of the bellovacus and begin to lay waste they country with these instruction he dismiss he from he presence after he perceive that all the force of the belgae which have be collect in one place be approach towards he and learn from the scout whom he have send out and -lrb- also -rrb- from the remus that they be not then far distant he hasten to lead he army over the aisne which be on the border of the remus and there pitch he camp this position fortify one side of he camp by the bank of the river render the country which lay in he rear secure from the enemy and furthermore ensure that provision might without danger be bring to he by the remus and the rest of the state over that river be a bridge : there he place a guard and on the other side of the river he leave q titurus sabinus he lieutenant with six cohort he order he to fortify a camp with a rampart twelve foot in height and a trench eighteen foot in breadth vi -- there be a town of the remus by name bibrax eight mile distant from this camp this the belga on they march begin to attack with great vigor -lrb- the assault -rrb- be with difficulty sustain for that day the gaul ' mode of besiege be the same as that of the belgae : when after have draw a large number of man around the whole of the fortification stone have begin to be cast against the wall on all side and the wall have be stript of its defender -lrb- then -rrb- form a testudo they advance to the gate and undermine the wall : which be easily effect on this occasion for while so large a number be cast stone and dart no one be able to maintain he position upon the wall when night have put a end to the assault iccius who be then in command of the town one of the remus a man of the highest rank and influence amongst he people and one of those who have come to caesar as ambassador -lrb- to sue -rrb- for a peace send messenger to he -lrb- to report -rrb- that unless assistance be send to he he could not hold out any longer vii -- thither immediately after midnight caesar use as guide the same person who have come to he as messenger from iccius send some numidian and cretan archer and some balearian slinger as a relief to the townspeople by whose arrival both a desire to resist together with the hope of -lrb- make good they -rrb- defense be infuse into the remus and for the same reason the hope of gain the town abandon the enemy therefore after stay a short time before the town and lay waste the country of the remus when all the village and building which they could approach have be burn they hasten with all they force to the camp of caesar and encamp within less than two mile -lrb- of it -rrb- and they camp as be indicate by the smoke and fire extend more than eight mile in breadth viii -- caesar at first determine to decline a battle as well on account of the great number of the enemy as they distinguished reputation for valor : daily however in cavalry action he strive to ascertain by frequent trial what the enemy could effect by they prowess and what we man would dare when he perceive that we man be not inferior as the place before the camp be naturally convenient and suitable for marshal a army -lrb- since the hill where the camp be pitch rise gradually from the plain extended forward in breadth as far as the space which the marshal army could occupy and have steep decline of its side in either direction and gently slope in front gradually sink to the plain -rrb- on either side of that hill he draw a cross trench of about four hundred pace and at the extremity of that trench build fort and place there he military engine lest after he have marshal he army the enemy since they be so powerful in point of number should be able to surround he man in the flank while fight after do this and leave in the camp the two legion which he have last raise that if there should be any occasion they might be bring as a reserve he form the other six legion in order of battle before the camp the enemy likewise have draw up they force which they have bring out of the camp ix -- there be a marsh of no great extent between we army and that of the enemy the latter be wait to see if we man would pass this we man also be ready in arm to attack they while disorder if the first attempt to pass should be make by they in the meantime battle be commence between the two army by a cavalry action when neither army begin to pass the marsh caesar upon the skirmish of the horse -lrb- proving -rrb- favourable to we man lead back he force into the camp the enemy immediately hasten from that place to the river aisne which it have be state be behind we camp find a ford there they endeavor to lead a part of they force over it with the design that if they could they might carry by storm the fort which q titurius caesar 's lieutenant command and might cut off the bridge but if they could not do that they should lay waste the land of the remus which be of great use to we in carry on the war and might hinder we man from forage x -- caesar be apprise of this by titurius lead all he cavalry and light-armed numidian slinger and archer over the bridge and hasten towards they there be a severe struggle in that place we man attack in the river the disorder enemy slew a great part of they by the immense number of they missile they drive back the rest who in a most courageous manner be attempt to pass over they body and surround with they cavalry and cut to piece those who have first cross the river the enemy when they perceive that they hope have deceive they both with regard to they take the town by storm and also they pass the river and do not see we man advance to a more disadvantageous place for the purpose of fight and when provision begin to fail they have call a council determine that it be best for each to return to he country and resolve to assemble from all quarter to defend those into whose territory the roman should first march a army that they might contend in they own rather than in a foreign country and might enjoy the store of provision which they possess at home together with other cause this consideration also lead they to that resolution viz : that they have learn that divitiacus and the aeduus be approach the territory of the bellovacus and it be impossible to persuade the latter to stay any longer or to deter they from convey succor to they own people xi -- that matter be determine on march out of they camp at the second watch with great noise and confusion in no fixed order nor under any command since each seek for himself the foremost place in the journey and hasten to reach home they make they departure appear very like a flight caesar immediately learn this through he scout -lrb- but -rrb- fear a ambuscade because he have not yet discover for what reason they be depart keep he army and cavalry within the camp at daybreak the intelligence have be confirm by the scout he send forward he cavalry to harass they rear and give the command of it to two of he lieutenant q pedius and l aurunculeius cotta he order t labienus another of he lieutenant to follow they closely with three legion these attack they rear and pursue they for many mile slew a great number of they as they be flee while those in the rear with whom they have come up halted and bravely sustain the attack of we soldier the van because they appear to be remove from danger and be not restrain by any necessity or command as soon as the noise be hear break they rank and to a man rest they safety in flight thus without any risk -lrb- to themselves -rrb- we man kill as great a number of they as the length of the day allow and at sunset desist from the pursuit and betook themselves into the camp as they have be command xii -- on the day follow before the enemy could recover from they terror and flight caesar lead he army into the territory of the suessione which be next to the remus and have accomplish a long march hasten to the town name noviodunum have attempt to take it by storm on he march because he hear that it be destitute of -lrb- sufficient -rrb- defender he be not able to carry it by assault on account of the breadth of the ditch and the height of the wall though few be defend it therefore have fortify the camp he begin to bring up the vinea and to provide whatever thing be necessary for the storm in the meantime the whole body of the suessione after they flight come the next night into the town the vinea have be quickly bring up against the town a mound throw up and tower build the gaul amaze by the greatness of the work such as they have neither see nor hear of before and strike also by the despatch of the roman send ambassador to caesar respect a surrender and succeed in consequence of the remus request that they -lrb- the suessione -rrb- might be spare xiii -- caesar have receive as hostage the first man of the state and even the two son of king galba himself and all the arm in the town have be deliver up admit the suessione to a surrender and lead he army against the bellovacus who when they have convey themselves and all they possession into the town call bratuspantium and caesar with he army be about five mile distant from that town all the old man go out of the town begin to stretch out they hand to caesar and to intimate by they voice that they would throw themselves on he protection and power nor would contend in arm against the roman people in like manner when he have come up to the town and there pitch he camp the boy and the woman from the wall with outstretched hand after they custom beg peace from the roman xiv -- for these divitiacus plead -lrb- for after the departure of the belgae have dismiss the troops of the aeduus he have return to caesar -rrb- the bellovacus have at all time be in the alliance and friendship of the aeduan state that they have revolt from the aeduus and make war upon the roman people be urge thereto by they noble who say that the aeduus reduce to slavery by caesar be suffer every indignity and insult that they who have be the leader of that plot because they perceive how great a calamity they have bring upon the state have flee into britain that not only the bellovacus but also the aeduus entreat he to use he -lrb- accustomed -rrb- clemency and lenity towards they -lrb- the bellovacus -rrb- : which if he do he would increase the influence of the aeduus among all the belga by whose succor and resource they have be accustom to support themselves whenever any war occur xv -- caesar say that on account of he respect for divitiacus and the aeduan he would receive they into he protection and would spare they but because the state be of great influence among the belga and pre-eminent in the number of its population he demand 600 hostage when these be deliver and all the arm in the town collect he go from that place into the territory of the ambianus who without delay surrender themselves and all they possession upon they territory border the nervius concern whose character and custom when caesar inquire he receive the follow information : -- that there be no access for merchant to they that they suffer no wine and other thing tend to luxury to be import because they think that by they use the mind be enervate and the courage impair : that they be a savage people and of great bravery : that they upbraid and condemn the rest of the belgae who have surrender themselves to the roman people and throw aside they national courage : that they openly declare they would neither send ambassador nor accept any condition of peace xvi -- after he have make three day ' march through they territory he discover from some prisoner that the river sambre be not more than ten mile from he camp : that all the nervius have station themselves on the other side of that river and together with the atrebate and the veromanduus they neighbor be there await the arrival of the roman for they have persuade both these nation to try the same fortune of war -lrb- as themselves -rrb- : that the force of the aduatucus be also expect by they and be on they march that they have put they woman and those who through age appear useless for war in a place to which there be no approach for a army on account of the marsh xvii -- have learn these thing he send forward scout and centurion to choose a convenient place for the camp and as a great many of the surround belga and other gaul follow caesar march with he some of these as be afterwards learn from the prisoner have accurately observe during those day the army 's method of march go by night to the nervius and inform they that a great number of baggage-train pass between the several legion and that there would be no difficulty when the first legion have come into the camp and the other legion be at a great distance to attack that legion while under baggage which be route and the baggage-train seize it would come to pass that the other legion would not dare to stand they ground it add weight also to the advice of those who report that circumstance that the nervius from early time because they be weak in cavalry -lrb- for not even at this time do they attend to it but accomplish by they infantry whatever they can -rrb- in order that they might the more easily obstruct the cavalry of they neighbor if they come upon they for the purpose of plunder have cut young tree and bent they by means of they numerous branch -lrb- extend -rrb- on to the side and the quick-briar and thorn spring up between they have make these hedge present a fortification like a wall through which it be not only impossible to enter but even to penetrate with the eye since -lrb- therefore -rrb- the march of we army would be obstruct by these thing the nervius think that the advice ought not to be neglect by they xviii -- the nature of the ground which we man have choose for the camp be this : a hill decline evenly from the top extend to the river sambre which we have mention above : from this river there arise a -lrb- second -rrb- hill of like ascent on the other side and opposite to the former and open from about 200 pace at the lowest part but in the upper part woody -lrb- so much so -rrb- that it be not easy to see through it into the interior within those wood the enemy keep themselves in concealment a few troops of horse-soldier appear on the open ground along the river the depth of the river be about three foot xix -- caesar have send he cavalry on before follow close after they with all he force but the plan and order of the march be different from that which the belga have report to the nervius for as he be approach the enemy caesar accord to he custom lead on -lrb- as the van -rrb- six legion unencumbered by baggage behind they he have place the baggage-train of the whole army then the two legion which have be last raise close the rear and be a guard for the baggage-train we horse with the slinger and archer have pass the river commence action with the cavalry of the enemy while they from time to time betook themselves into the wood to they companion and again make a assault out of the wood upon we man who do not dare to follow they in they retreat further than the limit to which the plain and open part extend in the meantime the six legion which have arrive first have measure out the work begin to fortify the camp when the first part of the baggage-train of we army be see by those who lay hide in the wood which have be agree on among they as the time for commence action as soon as they have arrange they line of battle and form they rank within the wood and have encourage one another they rush out suddenly with all they force and make a attack upon we horse the latter be easily route and throw into confusion the nervius run down to the river with such incredible speed that they seem to be in the wood the river and close upon we almost at the same time and with the same speed they hasten up the hill to we camp and to those who be employ in the work xx -- caesar have everything to do at one time : the standard to be display which be the sign when it be necessary to run to arm the signal to be give by the trumpet the soldier to be call off from the work those who have proceed some distance for the purpose of seek material for the rampart to be summon the order of battle to be form the soldier to be encourage the watchword to be give a great part of these arrangement be prevent by the shortness of time and the sudden approach and charge of the enemy under these difficulty two thing prove of advantage -lrb- first -rrb- the skill and experience of the soldier because have be train by former engagement they could suggest to themselves what ought to be do as conveniently as receive information from other and -lrb- secondly -rrb- that caesar have forbid he several lieutenant to depart from the work and they respective legion before the camp be fortify these on account of the near approach and the speed of the enemy do not then wait for any command from caesar but of themselves execute whatever appear proper xxi -- caesar have give the necessary order hasten to and fro into whatever quarter fortune carry he to animate the troops and come to the tenth legion have encourage the soldier with no further speech than that they should keep up the remembrance of they wonted valor and not be confuse in mind but valiantly sustain the assault of the enemy as the latter be not farther from they than the distance to which a dart could be cast he give the signal for commence battle and have go to another quarter for the purpose of encouraging -lrb- the soldier -rrb- he find they fight such be the shortness of the time and so determine be the mind of the enemy on fight that time be want not only for affix the military insignia but even for put on the helmet and draw off the cover from the shield to whatever part any one by chance come from the work -lrb- in which he have be employ -rrb- and whatever standard he see first at these he stand lest in seek he own company he should lose the time for fight xxii -- the army have be marshal rather as the nature of the ground and the declivity of the hill and the exigency of the time than as the method and order of military matter require whilst the legion in the different place be withstand the enemy some in one quarter some in another and the view be obstruct by the very thick hedge intervene as we have before remark neither could proper reserve be post nor could the necessary measure be take in each part nor could all the command be issue by one person therefore in such a unfavourable state of affair various event of fortune follow xxiii -- the soldier of the ninth and tenth legion as they have be station on the left part of the army cast they weapon speedily drive the atrebate -lrb- for that division have be oppose to they -rrb- who be breathless with run and fatigue and wear out with wound from the higher ground into the river and follow they as they be endeavor to pass it slew with they sword a great part of they while impede -lrb- therein -rrb- they themselves do not hesitate to pass the river and have advance to a disadvantageous place when the battle be renew they -lrb- nevertheless -rrb- again put to flight the enemy who have return and be oppose they in like manner in another quarter two different legion the eleventh and the eighth have route the veromanduus with whom they have engage be fight from the higher ground upon the very bank of the river but almost the whole camp on the front and on the left side be then expose since the twelfth legion be post in the right wing and the seventh at no great distance from it all the nervius in a very close body with boduognatus who hold the chief command as they leader hasten towards that place and part of they begin to surround the legion on they unprotected flank part to make for the highest point of the encampment xxiv -- at the same time we horseman and light-armed infantry who have be with those who as i have relate be route by the first assault of the enemy as they be betake themselves into the camp meet the enemy face to face and again seek flight into another quarter and the camp-follower who from the decuman gate and from the highest ridge of the hill have see we man pass the river as victor when after go out for the purpose of plunder they look back and see the enemy parading in we camp commit themselves precipitately to flight at the same time there arise the cry and shout of those who come with the baggage-train and they -lrb- affright -rrb- be carry some one way some another by all these circumstance the cavalry of the trevirus be much alarmed -lrb- whose reputation for courage be extraordinary among the gaul and who have come to caesar be send by they state as auxiliary -rrb- and when they see we camp fill with a large number of the enemy the legion hard press and almost hold surround the camp-retainer horseman slinger and numidian flee on all side divide and scatter they despair of we affair hasten home and related to they state that the roman be route and conquer -lrb- and -rrb- that the enemy be in possession of they camp and baggage-train xxv -- caesar proceed after encourage the tenth legion to the right wing where he perceive that he man be hard press and that in consequence of the standard of the twelfth legion be collect together in one place the crowded soldier be a hindrance to themselves in the fight that all the centurion of the fourth cohort be slay and the standard-bearer kill the standard itself lose almost all the centurion of the other cohort either wound or slay and among they the chief centurion of the legion p sextius baculus a very valiant man who be so exhaust by many and severe wound that he be already unable to support himself he likewise perceive that the rest be slacken they effort and that some desert by those in the rear be retire from the battle and avoid the weapon that the enemy -lrb- on the other hand -rrb- though advance from the lower ground be not relax in front and be -lrb- at the same time -rrb- press hard on both flank he also perceive that the affair be at a crisis and that there be not any reserve which could be bring up have therefore snatch a shield from one of the soldier in the rear -lrb- for he himself have come without a shield -rrb- he advance to the front of the line and address the centurion by name and encourage the rest of the soldier he order they to carry forward the standard and extend the company that they might the more easily use they sword on he arrival as hope be bring to the soldier and they courage restore whilst every one for he own part in the sight of he general desire to exert he utmost energy the impetuosity of the enemy be a little check xxvi -- caesar when he perceive that the seventh legion which stand close by he be also hard press by the enemy direct the tribune of the soldier to effect a junction of the legion gradually and make they charge upon the enemy with a double front which have be do since they bring assistance the one to the other nor fear lest they rear should be surround by the enemy they begin to stand they ground more boldly and to fight more courageously in the meantime the soldier of the two legion which have be in the rear of the army as a guard for the baggage-train upon the battle be report to they quicken they pace and be see by the enemy on the top of the hill and titus labienus have gain possession of the camp of the enemy and observe from the higher ground what be go on in we camp send the tenth legion as a relief to we man who when they have learn from the flight of the horse and the sutler in what position the affair be and in how great danger the camp and the legion and the commander be involve left undo nothing -lrb- which tend -rrb- to despatch xxvi -- by they arrival so great a change of matter be make that we man even those who have fall down exhaust with wound lean on they shield and renew the fight : then the camp-retainer though unarmed see the enemy completely dismayed attack -lrb- they though -rrb- arm the horseman too that they might by they valor blot out the disgrace of they flight thrust themselves before the legionary soldier in all part of the battle but the enemy even in the last hope of safety display such great courage that when the foremost of they have fall the next stand upon they prostrate and fight from they body when these be overthrow and they corpse heap up together those who survive cast they weapon against we man -lrb- thence -rrb- as from a mound and return we dart which have fall between -lrb- the army -rrb- so that it ought not to be conclude that man of such great courage have injudiciously dare to pass a very broad river ascend very high bank and come up to a very disadvantageous place since they greatness of spirit have render these action easy although in themselves very difficult xxviii -- this battle be end and the nation and name of the nervius be almost reduce to annihilation they old man whom together with the boy and woman we have state to have be collect together in the fenny place and marsh on this battle have be report to they since they be convince that nothing be a obstacle to the conqueror and nothing safe to the conquer send ambassador to caesar by the consent of all who remain and surrender themselves to he and in recount the calamity of they state say that they senator be reduce from 600 to three that from 60000 man they -lrb- be reduce -rrb- to scarcely 500 who could bear arm whom caesar that he might appear to use compassion towards the wretched and the suppliant most carefully spare and order they to enjoy they own territory and town and command they neighbor that they should restrain themselves and they dependant from offer injury or outrage -lrb- to they -rrb- xxix -- when the aduatucus of whom we have write above be come with all they force to the assistance of the nervius upon this battle be report to they they return home after they be on the march desert all they town and fort they convey together all they possession into one town eminently fortify by nature while this town have on all side around it very high rock and precipice there be leave on one side a gently ascend approach of not more than 200 foot in width which place they have fortify with a very lofty double wall : besides they have place stone of great weight and sharpened stake upon the wall they be descend from the cimbrus and teutone who when they be march into we province and italy have deposit on this side the river rhine such of they baggage-train as they could not drive or convey with they leave 6000 of they man as a guard and defense for they these have after the destruction of they countryman be harass for many year by they neighbor while one time they wage war offensively and at another resist it when wage against they conclude a peace with the consent of all and choose this place as they settlement xxx -- and on the first arrival of we army they make frequent sally from the town and contend with we man in trifling skirmish : afterwards when hem in by a rampart of twelve foot -lrb- in height -rrb- and fifteen mile in circuit they keep themselves within the town when vineae have be bring up and a mound raise they observe that a tower also be be build at a distance they at first begin to mock the roman from they wall and to taunt they with the follow speech for what purpose be so vast a machine construct at so great a distance with what hand or with what strength do they especially -lrb- as they be -rrb- man of such very small stature -lrb- for we shortness of stature in comparison with the great size of they body be generally a subject of much contempt to the man of gaul -rrb- trust to place against they wall a tower of such great weight xxxi -- but when they see that it be be move and be approach they wall startle by the new and unaccustomed sight they send ambassador to caesar -lrb- to treat -rrb- about peace who speak in the follow manner : that they do not believe the roman wage war without divine aid since they be able to move forward machine of such a height with so great speed and thus fight from close quarter : that they resign themselves and all they possession to -lrb- caesar 's -rrb- disposal : that they beg and earnestly entreat one thing viz that if perchance agreeably to he clemency and humanity which they have hear of from other he should resolve that the aduatucus be to be spare he would not deprive they of they arm that all they neighbor be enemy to they and envy they courage from whom they could not defend themselves if they arm be deliver up : that it be better for they if they should be reduce to that state to suffer any fate from the roman people than to be tortured to death by those among whom they have be accustom to rule xxxii -- to these thing caesar reply that he in accordance with he custom rather than owe to they desert should spare the state if they should surrender themselves before the battering-ram should touch the wall but that there be no condition of surrender except upon they arm be deliver up that he should do to they that which he have do in the case of the nervius and would command they neighbor not to offer any injury to those who have surrender to the roman people the matter be report to they countryman they say that they would execute he command have cast a very large quantity of they arm from the wall into the trench which be before the town so that the heap of arm almost equal the top of the wall and the rampart and nevertheless have retain and conceal as we afterwards discover about a third part in the town the gate be open and they enjoy peace for that day xxxiii -- towards evening caesar order the gate to be shut and the soldier to go out of the town lest the townspeople should receive any injury from they by night they -lrb- the aduatucus -rrb- by a design before enter into as we afterwards understand because they believe that as a surrender have be make we man would dismiss they guard or at least would keep watch less carefully partly with those arm which they have retain and conceal partly with shield make of bark or interwoven wicker which they have hastily cover over with skin -lrb- as the shortness of time require -rrb- in the third watch suddenly make a sally from the town with all they force -lrb- in that direction -rrb- in which the ascent to we fortification seem the least difficult the signal have be immediately give by fire as caesar have previously command a rush be make thither -lrb- _ ie _ by the roman soldier -rrb- from the nearest fort and the battle be fight by the enemy as vigorously as it ought to be fight by brave man in the last hope of safety in a disadvantageous place and against those who be throw they weapon from a rampart and from tower since all hope of safety depend on they courage alone about 4000 of the man have be slay the rest be force back into the town the day after caesar after break open the gate which there be no one then to defend and send in we soldier sell the whole spoil of that town the number of 53000 person be report to he by those who have buy they xxxiv -- at the same time he be inform by p crassus whom he have send with one legion against the venetus the unelli the osismius the curiosolita the sesuvius the aulercus and the rhedone which be maritime state and touch upon the -lrb- atlantic -rrb- ocean that all these nation be bring under the dominion and power of the roman people xxxv -- these thing be achieve -lrb- and -rrb- all gaul be subdue so high a opinion of this war be spread among the barbarian that ambassador be send to caesar by those nation who dwell beyond the rhine to promise that they would give hostage and execute he command which embassy caesar because he be hasten into italy and illyricum order to return to he at the beginning of the follow summer he himself have lead he legion into winter-quarter among the carnute the ande and the turone which state be close to those region in which he have wage war set out for italy and a thanksgiving of fifteen day be decree for those achievement upon receive caesar 's letter -lrb- a honor -rrb- which before that time have be confer on none book iii i -- when caesar be set out for italy he send servius galba with the twelfth legion and part of the cavalry against the nantuate the veragrus and sedunus who extend from the territory of the allobroge and the lake of geneva and the river rhone to the top of the alp the reason for send he be that he desire that the pass along the alp through which -lrb- the roman -rrb- merchant have be accustom to travel with great danger and under great impost should be open he permit he if he think it necessary to station the legion in these place for the purpose of winter galba have fight some successful battle and storm several of they fort upon ambassador be send to he from all part and hostage give and a peace conclude determine to station two cohort among the nantuate and to winter in person with the other cohort of that legion in a village of the veragrus which be call octodurus and this village be situate in a valley with a small plain annex to it be bound on all side by very high mountain as this village be divide into two part by a river he grant one part of it to the gaul and assign the other which have be leave by they unoccupied to the cohort to winter in he fortify this -lrb- latter -rrb- part with a rampart and a ditch ii -- when several day have elapse in winter quarter and he have order corn to be bring in he be suddenly inform by he scout that all the people have go off in the night from that part of the town which he have give up to the gaul and that the mountain which hang over it be occupy by a very large force of the sedanus and veragrus it have happen for several reason that the gaul suddenly form the design of renew the war and cut off that legion first because they despise a single legion on account of its small number and that not quite full -lrb- two cohort have be detach and several individual be absent who have be despatch for the purpose of seek provision -rrb- then likewise because they think that on account of the disadvantageous character of the situation even they first attack could not be sustain -lrb- by we -rrb- when they would rush from the mountain into the valley and discharge they weapon upon we to this be add that they be indignant that they child be tear from they under the title of hostage and they be persuade that the roman design to seize upon the summit of the alp and unite those part to the neighbouring province -lrb- of gaul -rrb- not only to secure the pass but also as a constant possession iii -- have receive these tiding galba since the work of the winter quarter and the fortification be not fully complete nor be sufficient preparation make with regard to corn and other provision -lrb- since as a surrender have be make and hostage receive he have think he need entertain no apprehension of a war -rrb- speedily summon a council begin to anxiously inquire they opinion in which council since so much sudden danger have happen contrary to the general expectation and almost all the higher place be see already cover with a multitude of armed man nor could -lrb- either -rrb- troops come to they relief or provision be bring in as the pass be block up -lrb- by the enemy -rrb- safety be now nearly despaired of some opinion of this sort be deliver that leave they baggage and make a sally they should hasten away for safety by the same route by which they have come thither to the greater part however it seem best reserve that measure to the last to await the issue of the matter and to defend the camp iv -- a short time only have elapse so that time be scarcely give for arrange and execute those thing which they have determine on the enemy upon the signal be give rush down -lrb- upon we man -rrb- from all part and discharge stone and dart upon we rampart we man at first while they strength be fresh resist bravely nor do they cast any weapon ineffectually from they higher station as soon as any part of the camp be destitute of defender seem to be hard press thither they run and bring assistance but they be over-matched in this that the enemy when weary by the long continuance of the battle go out of the action and other with fresh strength come in they place none of which thing could be do by we man owe to the smallness of they number and not only be permission not give to the wearied -lrb- roman -rrb- to retire from the fight but not even to the wound -lrb- be liberty grant -rrb- to quit the post where he have be station and recover v -- when they have now be fight for more than six hour without cessation and not only strength but even weapon be fail we man and the enemy be press on more rigorously and have begin to demolish the rampart and to fill up the trench while we man be become exhaust and the matter be now bring to the last extremity p sextius baculus a centurion of the first rank whom we have relate to have be disable by severe wound in the engagement with the nervius and also c volusenus a tribune of the soldier a man of great skill and valor hasten to galba and assure he that the only hope of safety lay in make a sally and try the last resource whereupon assemble the centurion he quickly give order to the soldier to discontinue the fight a short time and only collect the weapon fling -lrb- at they -rrb- and recruit themselves after they fatigue and afterwards upon the signal be give sally forth from the camp and place in they valor all they hope of safety vi -- they do what they be order and make a sudden sally from all the gate -lrb- of the camp -rrb- leave the enemy the means neither of know what be take place nor of collect themselves fortune thus take a turn -lrb- we man -rrb- surround on every side and slay those who have entertain the hope of gain the camp and have kill more than the third part of a army of more than 30000 man -lrb- which number of the barbarian it appear certain have come up to we camp -rrb- put to flight the rest when panic-stricken and do not suffer they to halt even upon the higher grounds all the force of the enemy be thus route and strip of they arm -lrb- we man -rrb- betake themselves to they camp and fortification which battle be finish inasmuch as galba be unwilling to tempt fortune again and remember that he have come into winter quarter with one design and see that he have meet with a different state of affair chiefly however urge by the want of corn and provision have the next day burn all the building of that village he hasten to return into the province and as no enemy oppose or hinder he march he bring the legion safe into the -lrb- country of the -rrb- nantuate thence into -lrb- that of -rrb- the allobroge and there winter vii -- these thing be achieve while caesar have every reason to suppose that gaul be reduce to a state of tranquillity the belgae be overcome the german expel the sedunus among the alp defeat and when he have therefore in the beginning of winter set out for illyricum as he wish to visit those nation and acquire a knowledge of they country a sudden war spring up in gaul the occasion of that war be this : p crassus a young man have take up he winter quarter with the seventh legion among the ande who border upon the -lrb- atlantic -rrb- ocean he as there be a scarcity of corn in those part send out some officer of cavalry and several military tribune amongst the neighbouring state for the purpose of procure corn and provision in which number t terrasidius be send amongst the esubius m trebius gallus amongst the curiosolitae q velanius with t silius amongst the venetus viii -- the influence of this state be by far the most considerable of any of the country on the whole sea coast because the venetus both have a very great number of ship with which they have be accustom to sail to britain and -lrb- thus -rrb- excel the rest in they knowledge and experience of nautical affair and as only a few port lie scatter along that stormy and open sea of which they be in possession they hold as tributary almost all those who be accustom to traffic in that sea with they arise the beginning -lrb- of the revolt -rrb- by they detain silius and velanius for they think that they should recover by they means the hostage which they have give to crassus the neighbouring people lead on by they influence -lrb- as the measure of the gaul be sudden and hasty -rrb- detain trebius and terrasidius for the same motive and quickly send ambassador by means of they lead man they enter into a mutual compact to do nothing except by general consent and abide the same issue of fortune and they solicit the other state to choose rather to continue in that liberty which they have receive from they ancestor than endure slavery under the roman all the sea coast be quickly bring over to they sentiment they send a common embassy to p crassus -lrb- to say -rrb- if he wish to receive back he officer let he send back to they they hostage ix -- caesar be inform of these thing by crassus since he be so far distant himself order ship of war to be build in the meantime on the river loire which flow into the ocean rower to be raise from the province sailor and pilot to be provide these matter be quickly execute he himself as soon as the season of the year permit hasten to the army the venetus and the other state also be inform of caesar 's arrival when they reflect how great a crime they have commit in that the ambassador -lrb- a character which have amongst all nation ever be sacred and inviolable -rrb- have by they be detain and throw into prison resolve to prepare for a war in proportion to the greatness of they danger and especially to provide those thing which appertain to the service of a navy with the greater confidence inasmuch as they greatly rely on the nature of they situation they know that the pass by land be cut off by estuary that the approach by sea be most difficult by reason of we ignorance of the locality -lrb- and -rrb- the small number of the harbor and they trust that we army would not be able to stay very long among they on account of the insufficiency of corn and again even if all these thing should turn out contrary to they expectation yet they be very powerful in they navy they well understand that the roman neither have any number of ship nor be acquaint with the shallows the harbor or the island of those part where they would have to carry on the war and that navigation be very different in a narrow sea from what it be in the vast and open ocean have come to this resolution they fortify they town convey corn into they from the country part bring together as many ship as possible to venetium where it appear caesar would at first carry on the war they unite to themselves as ally for that war the osismius the lexovius the nannete the ambiliatus the morinus the diablinte and the menapius and send for auxiliary from britain which be situate over against those region x -- there be these difficulty which we have mention above in carry on the war but many thing nevertheless urge caesar to that war the open insult offer to the state in the detention of the roman knight the rebellion raise after surrender the revolt after hostage be give the confederacy of so many state but principally lest if -lrb- the conduct of -rrb- this part be overlook the other nation should think that the same thing be permit they wherefore since he reflect that almost all the gaul be fond of revolution and easily and quickly excite to war that all man likewise by nature love liberty and hate the condition of slavery he think he ought to divide and more widely distribute he army before more state should join the confederation xi -- he therefore send t labienus he lieutenant with the cavalry to the trevirus who be nearest to the river rhine he charge he to visit the remus and the other belgian and to keep they in they allegiance and repel the german -lrb- who be say to have be summon by the belgae to they aid -rrb- if they attempt to cross the river by force in they ship he order p crassus to proceed into aquitanium with twelve legionary cohort and a great number of the cavalry lest auxiliary should be send into gaul by these state and such great nation be unite he send q titurius sabinus he lieutenant with three legion among the unelli the curiosolita and the lexovius to take care that they force should be keep separate from the rest he appoint d brutus a young man over the fleet and those gallic vessel which he have order to be furnish by the pictone and the santonus and the other province which remain at peace and command he to proceed towards the venetus as soon as he could he himself hasten thither with the land force xii -- the site of they town be generally such that be place on extreme point -lrb- of land -rrb- and on promontory they neither have a approach by land when the tide have rush in from the main ocean which always happen twice in the space of twelve hour nor by ship because upon the tide ebb again the ship be likely to be dash upon the shoal thus by either circumstance be the storm of they town render difficult and if at any time perchance the venetus overpower by the greatness of we work -lrb- the sea have be exclude by a mound and large dam and the latter be make almost equal in height to the wall of the town -rrb- have begin to despair of they fortune bring up a large number of ship of which they have a very great quantity they carry off all they property and betook themselves to the nearest town there they again defend themselves by the same advantage of situation they do this the more easily during a great part of the summer because we ship be keep back by storm and the difficulty of sailing be very great in that vast and open sea with its strong tide and its harbor far apart and exceedingly few in number xiii -- for they ship be build and equip after this manner the keel be somewhat flatter than those of we ship whereby they could more easily encounter the shallows and the ebbing of the tide : the prow be raise very high and in like manner the stern be adapt to the force of the wave and storm -lrb- which they be form to sustain -rrb- the ship be build wholly of oak and design to endure any force and violence whatever the bench which be make of plank a foot in breadth be fasten by iron spike of the thickness of a man 's thumb the anchor be secure fast by iron chain instead of cable and for sail they use skin and thin dress leather these -lrb- be use -rrb- either through they want of canvas and they ignorance of its application of for this reason which be more probable that they think that such storm of the ocean and such violent gale of wind could not be resist by sail nor ship of such great burden be conveniently enough manage by they the encounter of we fleet with these ship be of such a nature that we fleet excel in speed alone and the ply of the oar other thing consider the nature of the place -lrb- and -rrb- the violence of the storm be more suitable and better adapt on they side for neither could we ship injure theirs with they beak -lrb- so great be they strength -rrb- nor on account of they height be a weapon easily cast up to they and for the same reason they be less readily lock in by rock to this be add that whenever a storm begin to rage and they run before the wind they both could weather the storm more easily and heave to securely in the shallows and when leave by the tide fear nothing from rock and shelf : the risk of all which thing be much to be dread by we ship xiv -- caesar after take many of they town perceive that so much labor be spend in vain and that the flight of the enemy could not be prevent on the capture of they town and that injury could not be do they he determine to wait for he fleet as soon as it come up and be first see by the enemy about 220 of they ship fully equip and appoint with every kind of -lrb- naval -rrb- implement sail forth from the harbor and draw up opposite to ours nor do it appear clear to brutus who command the fleet or to the tribune of the soldier and the centurion to whom the several ship be assign what to do or what system of tactic to adopt for they know that damage could not be do by they beak and that although turret be build -lrb- on they deck -rrb- yet the height of the stem of the barbarian ship exceed these so that weapon could not be cast up from -lrb- we -rrb- lower position with sufficient effect and those cast by the gaul fall the more forcibly upon we one thing provide by we man be of great service -lrb- viz -rrb- sharp hook insert into and fasten upon pole of a form not unlike the hook use in attack town wall when the rope which fasten the sail-yard to the mast be catch by they and pull and we vessel vigorously impel with the oar they -lrb- the rope -rrb- be sever and when they be cut away the yard necessarily fall down so that as all the hope of the gallic vessel depend on they sail and rig upon these be cut away the entire management of the ship be take from they at the same time the rest of the contest depend on courage in which we man decidedly have the advantage and the more so because the whole action be carry on in the sight of caesar and the entire army so that no act a little more valiant than ordinary could pass unobserved for all the hill and higher grounds from which there be a near prospect of the sea be occupy by we army xv -- the sail-yard -lrb- of the enemy -rrb- as we have say be bring down although two and -lrb- in some case -rrb- three ship -lrb- of theirs -rrb- surround each one -lrb- of ours -rrb- the soldier strive with the greatest energy to board the ship of the enemy : and after the barbarian observe this take place as a great many of they ship be beat and as no relief for that evil could be discover they hasten to seek safety in flight and have now turn they vessel to that quarter in which the wind blow so great a calm and lull suddenly arise that they could not move out of they place which circumstance truly be exceedingly opportune for finish the business for we man give chase and take they one by one so that very few out of all the number -lrb- and those -rrb- by the intervention of night arrive at the land after the battle have last almost from the fourth hour till sunset xvi -- by this battle the war with the venetus and the whole of the sea coast be finish for both all the youth and all too of more advanced age in whom there be any discretion or rank have assemble in that battle and they have collect in that one place whatever naval force they have anywhere and when these be lose the survivor have no place to retreat to nor mean of defend they town they accordingly surrender themselves and all they possession to caesar on whom caesar thought that punishment should be inflict the more severely in order that for the future the rights of ambassador might be more carefully respect by barbarian : have therefore put to death all they senate he sell the rest for slave xvii -- while these thing be go on amongst the veneti q titurius sabinus with those troops which he have receive from caesar arrive in the territory of the unellus over these people viridovix rule and hold the chief command of all those state which have revolt : from which he have collect a large and powerful army and in those few day the aulercus and the sexovius have slay they senate because they would not consent to be promoter of the war shut they gate -lrb- against we -rrb- and unite themselves to viridovix a great multitude besides of desperate man and robber assemble out of gaul from all quarter whom the hope of plunder and the love of fight have call away from husbandry and they daily labor sabinus keep himself within he camp which be in a position convenient for everything while viridovix encamp over against he at a distance of two mile and daily bring out he force give he a opportunity of fight so that sabinus have now not only come into contempt with the enemy but also be somewhat taunt by the speech of we soldier and furnish so great a suspicion of he cowardice that the enemy presume to approach even to the very rampart of we camp he adopt this conduct for the follow reason : because he do not think that a lieutenant ought to engage in battle with so great a force especially while he who hold the chief command be absent except on advantageous ground or some favourable circumstance present itself xviii -- after have establish this suspicion of he cowardice he select a certain suitable and crafty gaul who be one of those whom he have with he as auxiliary he induce he by great gift and promise to go over to the enemy and inform -lrb- he -rrb- of what he wish to be do who when he arrive amongst they as a deserter lay before they the fear of the roman and inform they by what difficulty caesar himself be harass and that the matter be not far remove from this -- that sabinus would the next night privately draw off he army out of the camp and set forth to caesar for the purpose of carry -lrb- he -rrb- assistance which when they hear they all cry out together that a opportunity of successfully conduct they enterprise ought not to be throw away that they ought to go to the -lrb- roman -rrb- camp many thing persuade the gaul to this measure the delay of sabinus during the previous day the positive assertion of the -lrb- pretended -rrb- deserter want of provision for a supply of which they have not take the requisite precaution the hope spring from the venetic war and -lrb- also -rrb- because in most case man willingly believe what they wish influence by these thing they do not discharge viridovix and the other leader from the council before they gain permission from they to take up arm and hasten to -lrb- we -rrb- camp which be grant rejoice as if victory be fully certain they collect faggot and brushwood with which to fill up the roman trench and hasten to the camp xix -- the situation of the camp be a rise ground gently slope from the bottom for about a mile thither they proceed with great speed -lrb- in order that as little time as possible might be give to the roman to collect and arm themselves -rrb- and arrive quite out of breath sabinus have encourage he man give they the signal which they earnestly desire while the enemy be encumber by reason of the burden which they be carry he order a sally to be suddenly make from two gate -lrb- of the camp -rrb- it happen by the advantage of situation by the unskilfulness and the fatigue of the enemy by the valor of we soldier and they experience in former battle that they could not stand one attack of we man and immediately turn they back : and we man with full vigor follow they while disorder and slew a great number of they the horse pursue the rest leave but few who escape by flight thus at the same time sabinus be inform of the naval battle and caesar of victory gain by sabinus and all the state immediately surrender themselves to titurius : for as the temper of the gaul be impetuous and ready to undertake war so they mind be weak and by no means resolute in enduring calamity xx -- about the same time p crassus when he have arrive in aquitanium -lrb- which as have be before say both from its extent of territory and the great number of its people be to be reckon a third part of gaul -rrb- understanding that he be to wage war in these part where a few year before l valerius praeconinus the lieutenant have be kill and he army route and from which l manilius the proconsul have flee with the loss of he baggage he perceive that no ordinary care must be use by he wherefore have provide corn procure auxiliary and cavalry -lrb- and -rrb- have summon by name many valiant man from tolosa carcaso and narbo which be the state of the province of gaul that border on these region -lrb- aquitanium -rrb- he lead he army into the territory of the sotiate on he arrival be know the sotiate have bring together great force and -lrb- much -rrb- cavalry in which they strength principally lay and assail we army on the march engage first in a cavalry action then when they cavalry be route and we man pursue they suddenly display they infantry force which they have place in ambuscade in a valley these attack we man -lrb- while -rrb- disorder and renew the fight xxi -- the battle be long and vigorously contest since the sotiate rely on they former victory imagine that the safety of the whole of aquitanium rest on they valor -lrb- and -rrb- we man on the other hand desire it might be see what they could accomplish without they general and without the other legion under a very young commander at length the enemy wear out with wound begin to turn they back and a great number of they be slay crassus begin to besiege the -lrb- principal -rrb- town of the sotiate on he march upon they valiantly resist he raise vinea and turret they at one time attempt a sally at another form mine to we rampart and vinea -lrb- at which the aquitanus be eminently skilled because in many place amongst they there be copper mine -rrb- when they perceive that nothing could be gain by these operation through the perseverance of we man they send ambassador to crassus and entreat he to admit they to a surrender have obtain it they be order to deliver up they arm comply xxii -- and while the attention of we man be engage in that matter in another part adcantuannus who hold the chief command with 600 devoted follower whom they call soldurius -lrb- the condition of whose association be these -- that they enjoy all the convenience of life with those to whose friendship they have devote themselves : if anything calamitous happen to they either they endure the same destiny together with they or commit suicide : nor hitherto in the memory of man have there be find any one who upon he be slay to whose friendship he have devote himself refuse to die -rrb- adcantuannus -lrb- i say -rrb- endeavor to make a sally with these when we soldier have rush together to arm upon a shout be raise at that part of the fortification and a fierce battle have be fight there be drive back into the town yet he obtain from crassus -lrb- the indulgence -rrb- that he should enjoy the same term of surrender -lrb- as the other inhabitant -rrb- xxiii -- crassus have receive they arm and hostage march into the territory of the vocate and the tarusate but then the barbarian be alarm because they have hear that a town fortify by the nature of the place and by art have be take by we in a few day after we arrival there begin to send ambassador into all quarter to combine to give hostage one to another to raise troops ambassador also be send to those state of hither spain which be nearest to aquitanium and auxiliary and leader be summon from they on whose arrival they proceed to carry on the war with great confidence and with a great host of man they who have be with q sertorius the whole period -lrb- of he war in spain -rrb- and be suppose to have very great skill in military matter be choose leader these adopt the practice of the roman people begin to select -lrb- advantageous -rrb- place to fortify they camp to cut off we man from provision which when crassus observe -lrb- and likewise -rrb- that he force on account of they small number could not safely be separate that the enemy both make excursion and beset the pass and -lrb- yet -rrb- leave sufficient guard for they camp that on that account corn and provision could not very conveniently be bring up to he and that the number of the enemy be daily increase he think that he ought not to delay in give battle this matter be bring to a council when he discover that all think the same thing he appoint the next day for the fight xxiv -- have draw out all he force at the break of day and marshal they in a double line he post the auxiliary in the center and wait to see what measure the enemy would take they although on account of they great number and they ancient renown in war and the small number of we man they suppose they might safely fight nevertheless consider it safer to gain the victory without any wound by beset the pass -lrb- and -rrb- cut off the provision : and if the roman on account of the want of corn should begin to retreat they intend to attack they while encumber in they march and depress in spirit -lrb- as be assail while -rrb- under baggage this measure be approve of by the leader and the force of the roman draw out the enemy -lrb- still -rrb- keep themselves in they camp crassus have remark this circumstance since the enemy intimidate by they own delay and by the reputation -lrb- _ ie _ for cowardice arise thence -rrb- have render we soldier more eager for fight and the remark of all be hear -lrb- declare -rrb- that no longer ought delay to be make in go to the camp after encourage he man he march to the camp of the enemy to the great gratification of he own troops xxv -- there while some be fill up the ditch and other by throw a large number of dart be drive the defender from the rampart and fortification and the auxiliary on whom crassus do not much rely in the battle by supply stone and weapon -lrb- to the soldier -rrb- and by convey turf to the mound present the appearance and character of man engage in fight while also the enemy be fight resolutely and boldly and they weapon discharge from they higher position fall with great effect the horse have go round the camp of the enemy report to crassus that the camp be not fortify with equal care on the side of the decuman gate and have a easy approach xxvi -- crassus have exhort the commander of the horse to animate they man by great reward and promise point out to they what he wish to have do they as they have be command have bring out the four cohort which as they have be leave as a guard for the camp be not fatigue by exertion and have lead they round by a somewhat longer way lest they could be see from the camp of the enemy when the eye and mind of all be intent upon the battle quickly arrive at those fortification which we have speak of and have demolish these stand in the camp of the enemy before they be see by they or it be know what be go on and then a shout be hear in that quarter we man they strength have be recruit -lrb- which usually occur on the hope of victory -rrb- begin to fight more vigorously the enemy surround on all side -lrb- and -rrb- all they affair be despair of make great attempt to cast themselves down over the rampart and to seek safety in flight these the cavalry pursue over the very open plain and after leave scarcely a fourth part out of the number of 50000 which it be certain have assemble out of aquitanium and from the cantabrus return late at night to the camp xxvii -- have hear of this battle the greatest part of aquitanium surrender itself to crassus and of its own accord send hostage in which number be the tarbellus the bigerrione the precianus the vocasate the tarusate the elurate the garite the auscus the garumnus the sibuzate the cocosate a few -lrb- and those -rrb- most remote nation rely on the time of the year because winter be at hand neglect to do this xxviii -- about the same time caesar although the summer be nearly past yet since all gaul be reduce the morinus and the menapius alone remain in arm and have never send ambassador to he -lrb- to make a treaty -rrb- of peace speedily lead he army thither think that that war might soon be terminate they resolve to conduct the war on a very different method from the rest of the gaul for as they perceive that the greatest nation -lrb- of gaul -rrb- who have engage in war have be route and overcome and as they possess continuous range of forest and morass they remove themselves and all they property thither when caesar have arrive at the opening of these forest and have begin to fortify he camp and no enemy be in the meantime see while we man be disperse on they respective duty they suddenly rush out from all part of the forest and make a attack on we man the latter quickly take up arm and drive they back again to they forest and have kill a great many lose a few of they own man while pursue they too far through those intricate place xxix -- during the remain day after this caesar begin to cut down the forest and that no attack might be make on the flank of the soldier while unarmed and not foresee it he place together -lrb- opposite to the enemy -rrb- all that timber which be cut down and pile it up as a rampart on either flank when a great space have be with incredible speed clear in a few day when the cattle -lrb- of the enemy -rrb- and the rear of they baggage-train be already seize by we man and they themselves be seek for the thickest part of the forest storm of such a kind come on that the work be necessarily suspend and through the continuance of the rain the soldier could not any longer remain in they tent therefore have lay waste all they country -lrb- and -rrb- have burn they village and house caesar lead back he army and station they in winter-quarter among the aulercus and lexovius and the other state which have make war upon he last book iv i-the follow winter -lrb- this be the year in which cn pompey and m crassus be consul -rrb- those german -lrb- call -rrb- the usipete and likewise the tenchtherus with a great number of man cross the rhine not far from the place at which that river discharge itself into the sea the motive for cross -lrb- that river -rrb- be that have be for several year harass by the suevus they be constantly engage in war and hinder from the pursuit of agriculture the nation of the suevus be by far the largest and the most warlike nation of all the german they be say to possess a hundred canton from each of which they yearly send from they territory for the purpose of war a thousand armed man : the other who remain at home maintain -lrb- both -rrb- themselves and those engage in the expedition the latter again in they turn be in arm the year after : the former remain at home thus neither husbandry nor the art and practice of war be neglect but among they there exist no private and separate land nor be they permit to remain more than one year in one place for the purpose of residence they do not live much on corn but subsist for the most part on milk and flesh and be much -lrb- engage -rrb- in hunting which circumstance must by the nature of they food and by they daily exercise and the freedom of they life -lrb- for have from boyhood be accustom to no employment or discipline they do nothing at all contrary to they inclination -rrb- both promote they strength and render they man of vast stature of body and to such a habit have they bring themselves that even in the coldest part they wear no clothing whatever except skin by reason of the scantiness of which a great portion of they body be bare and besides they bathe in open river ii -- merchant have access to they rather that they may have person to whom they may sell those thing which they have take in war than because they need any commodity to be import to they moreover even as to labor cattle in which the gaul take the greatest pleasure and which they procure at a great price the german do not employ such as be import but those poor and ill-shaped animal which belong to they country these however they render capable of the greatest labor by daily exercise in cavalry action they frequently leap from they horse and fight on foot and train they horse to stand still in the very spot on which they leave they to which they retreat with great activity when there be occasion nor accord to they practice be anything regard as more unseemly or more unmanly than to use housing accordingly they have the courage though they be themselves but few to advance against any number whatever of horse mount with housing they on no account permit wine to be import to they because they consider that man degenerate in they power of endure fatigue and be render effeminate by that commodity iii -- they esteem it they greatest praise as a nation that the land about they territory lie unoccupied to a very great extent inasmuch as -lrb- they think -rrb- that by this circumstance be indicate that a great number of nation can not withstand they power and thus on one side of the suevus the land be say to lie desolate for about six hundred mile on the other side they border on the ubius whose state be large and flourishing consider the condition of the german and who be somewhat more refined than those of the same race and the rest -lrb- of the german -rrb- and that because they border on the rhine and be much resort to by merchant and be accustom to the manners of the gaul by reason of they approximity to they though the suevus after make the attempt frequently and in several war could not expel this nation from they territory on account of the extent and population of they state yet they make they tributary and render they less distinguished and powerful -lrb- than they have ever be -rrb- iv -- in the same condition be the usipete and the tenchtherus -lrb- whom we have mention above -rrb- who for many year resist the power of the suevus but be at last drive from they possession and have wander through many part of germany come to the rhine to district which the menapius inhabit and where they have land house and village on either side of the river the latter people alarm by the arrival of so great a multitude remove from those house which they have on the other side of the river and have place guard on this side the rhine proceed to hinder the german from cross they find themselves after they have try all means unable either to force a passage on account of they deficiency in shipping or cross by stealth on account of the guard of the menapius pretend to return to they own settlement and district and after have proceed three day ' march return and they cavalry have perform the whole of this journey in one night cut off the menapius who be ignorant of and do not expect -lrb- they approach and -rrb- who have moreover be inform of the departure of the german by they scout have without apprehension return to they village beyond the rhine have slay these and seize they ship they cross the river before that part of the menapius who be at peace in they settlement over the rhine be apprise of -lrb- they intention -rrb- and seize all they house maintain themselves upon they provision during the rest of the winter v -- caesar when inform of these matter fear the fickle disposition of the gaul who be easily prompt to take up resolution and much addict to change consider that nothing be to be entrust to they for it be the custom of that people to compel traveller to stop even against they inclination and inquire what they may have hear or may know respect any matter and in town the common people throng around merchant and force they to state from what country they come and what affair they know of there they often engage in resolution concern the most important matter induce by these report and story alone of which they must necessarily instantly repent since they yield to mere unauthorised report and since most people give to they question answer frame agreeably to they wish vi -- caesar be aware of they custom in order that he might not encounter a more formidable war set forward to the army earlier in the year than he be accustom to do when he have arrive there he discover that those thing which he have suspect would occur have take place that embassy have be send to the german by some of the state and that they have be entreat to leave the rhine and have be promise that all thing which they desire should be provide by the gaul allure by this hope the german be then make excursion to greater distance and have advance to the territory of the eburone and the condrusus who be under the protection of the trevirus after summon the chief of gaul caesar think proper to pretend ignorance of the thing which he have discover and have conciliate and confirm they mind and order some cavalry to be raise resolve to make war against the german vii -- have provide corn and select he cavalry he begin to direct he march towards those part in which he hear the german be when he be distant from they only a few day ' march ambassador come to he from they state whose speech be as follow : -- that the german neither make war upon the roman people first nor do they decline if they be provoke to engage with they in arm for that this be the custom of the german hand down to they from they forefather to resist whatsoever people make war upon they and not to avert it by entreaty this however they confess -- that they have come hither reluctantly have be expel from they country if the roman be dispose to accept they friendship they might be serviceable ally to they and let they either assign they land or permit they to retain those which they have acquire by they arm that they be inferior to the suevus alone to whom not even the immortal god can show themselves equal that there be none at all besides on earth whom they could not conquer viii -- to these remark caesar reply in such term as he think proper but the conclusion of he speech be that he could make no alliance with they if they continue in gaul that it be not probable that they who be not able to defend they own territory should get possession of those of other nor be there any land lie waste in gaul which could be give away especially to so great a number of man without do wrong -lrb- to other -rrb- but they might if they be desirous settle in the territory of the ubius whose ambassador be then with he and be complain of the aggression of the suevus and request assistance from he and that he would obtain this request from they ix -- the ambassador say that they would report these thing to they countryman and after have deliberate on the matter would return to caesar after the third day they beg that he would not in the meantime advance he camp nearer to they caesar say that he could not grant they even that for he have learn that they have send a great part of they cavalry over the meuse to the ambivaritus some day before for the purpose of plunder and procure forage he suppose that they be then wait for these horse and that the delay be cause on this account x -- the meuse rise from mount le vosge which be in the territory of the lingone and have receive a branch of the rhine which be call the waal form the island of the batavus and not more than eighty mile from it it fall into the ocean but the rhine take its course among the lepontius who inhabit the alp and be carry with a rapid current for a long distance through the territory of the sarunate helvetii sequani mediomatricus tribucus and trevirus and when it approach the ocean divide into several branch and have form many and extensive island a great part of which be inhabit by savage and barbarous nation -lrb- of whom there be some who be suppose to live on fish and the egg of sea-fowl -rrb- flow into the ocean by several mouth xi -- when caesar be not more than twelve mile distant from the enemy the ambassador return to he as have be arrange who meet he on the march earnestly entreat he not to advance any farther when they could not obtain this they beg he to send on a despatch to those who have march in advance of the main army and forbid they to engage and grant they permission to send ambassador to the ubius and if the prince and senate of the latter would give they security by oath they assure caesar that they would accept such condition as might be propose by he and request that he would give they the space of three day for negotiate these affair caesar think that these thing tend to the self-same point -lrb- as they other proposal -rrb- -lrb- namely -rrb- that in consequence of a delay of three day intervene they horse which be at a distance might return however he say that he would not that day advance farther than four mile for the purpose of procure water he order that they should assemble at that place in as large a number as possible the follow day that he might inquire into they demand in the meantime he send messenger to the officer who have march in advance with all the cavalry to order they not to provoke the enemy to a engagement and if they themselves be assail to sustain the attack until he come up with the army xii -- but the enemy as soon as they see we horse the number of which be 5000 whereas they themselves have not more than 800 horse because those which have go over the meuse for the purpose of forage have not return while we man have no apprehension because they ambassador have go away from caesar a little before and that day have be request by they as a period of truce make a onset on we man and soon throw they into disorder when we man in they turn make a stand they accord to they practice leap from they horse to they foot and stab we horse in the belly and overthrow a great many of we man put the rest to flight and drive they forward so much alarm that they do not desist from they retreat till they have come in sight of we army in that encounter seventy-four of we horse be slay among they piso a aquitanian a most valiant man and descend from a very illustrious family whose grandfather have hold the sovereignty of he state and have be style friend by we senate he while he be endeavor to render assistance to he brother who be surround by the enemy and whom he rescue from danger be himself throw from he horse which be wound under he but still oppose -lrb- he antagonist -rrb- with the greatest intrepidity as long as he be able to maintain the conflict when at length he fall surround on all side and after receive many wound and he brother who have then retire from the fight observe it from a distance he spur on he horse throw himself upon the enemy and be kill xiii -- after this engagement caesar consider that neither ought ambassador to be receive to audience nor condition be accept by he from those who after have sue for peace by way of stratagem and treachery have make war without provocation and to wait till the enemy 's force be augmented and they cavalry have return he conclude would be the greatest madness and know the fickleness of the gaul he feel how much influence the enemy have already acquire among they by this one skirmish he -lrb- therefore -rrb- deem that no time for convert measure ought to be afford they after have resolve on these thing and communicate he plan to he lieutenant and quaestor in order that he might not suffer any opportunity for engage to escape he a very seasonable event occur namely that on the morning of the next day a large body of german consist of they prince and old man come to the camp to he to practice the same treachery and dissimulation but as they assert for the purpose of acquit themselves for have engage in a skirmish the day before contrary to what have be agree and to what indeed they themselves have request and also if they could by any means obtain a truce by deceive he caesar rejoice that they have fall into he power order they to be detain he then draw all he force out of the camp and command the cavalry because he think they be intimidate by the late skirmish to follow in the rear xiv -- have marshal he army in three line and in a short time perform a march of eight mile he arrive at the camp of the enemy before the german could perceive what be go on who be suddenly alarm by all the circumstance both by the speediness of we arrival and the absence of they own officer as time be afford neither for concert measure nor for seize they arm be perplex as to whether it would be better to lead out they force against the enemy or to defend they camp or seek they safety by flight they consternation be make apparent by they noise and tumult we soldier excite by the treachery of the precede day rush into the camp : such of they as could readily get they arm for a short time withstand we man and give battle among they cart and baggage-waggon but the rest of the people -lrb- consist -rrb- of boy and woman -lrb- for they have leave they country and cross the rhine with all they family -rrb- begin to fly in all direction in pursuit of whom caesar send the cavalry xv -- the german when upon hear a noise behind they -lrb- they look and -rrb- see that they family be be slay throw away they arm and abandon they standard flee out of the camp and when they have arrive at the confluence of the meuse and the rhine the survivor despair of farther escape as a great number of they countryman have be kill throw themselves into the river and there perish overcome by fear fatigue and the violence of the stream we soldier after the alarm of so great a war for the number of the enemy amount to 430000 return to they camp all safe to a man very few be even wound caesar grant those whom he have detain in the camp liberty of depart they however dread revenge and torture from the gaul whose land they have harass say that they desire to remain with he caesar grant they permission xvi -- the german war be finish caesar think it expedient for he to cross the rhine for many reason of which this be the most weighty that since he see the german be so easily urge to go into gaul he desire they should have they fear for they own territory when they discover that the army of the roman people both could and dare pass the rhine there be add also that that portion of the cavalry of the usipete and the tenchtherus which i have above related to have cross the meuse for the purpose of plunder and procure forage and be not present at the engagement have betake themselves after the retreat of they countryman across the rhine into the territory of the sigambrus and unite themselves to they when caesar send ambassador to they to demand that they should give up to he those who have make war against he and against gaul they reply that the rhine bound the empire of the roman people if he do not think it just for the german to pass over into gaul against he consent why do he claim that anything beyond the rhine should be subject to he dominion or power the ubius also who alone out of all the nation lie beyond the rhine have send ambassador to caesar and form a alliance and give hostage earnestly entreat that he would bring they assistance because they be grievously oppress by the suevus or if he be prevent from do so by the business of the commonwealth he would at least transport he army over the rhine that that would be sufficient for they present assistance and they hope for the future that so great be the name and the reputation of he army even among the most remote nation of the german arise from the defeat of ariovistus and this last battle which be fight that they might be safe under the fame and friendship of the roman people they promise a large number of ship for transport the army xvii -- caesar for those reason which i have mention have resolve to cross the rhine but to cross by ship he neither deem to be sufficiently safe nor considered consistent with he own dignity or that of the roman people therefore although the greatest difficulty in form a bridge be present to he on account of the breadth rapidity and depth of the river he nevertheless consider that it ought to be attempt by he or that he army ought not otherwise to be lead over he devise this plan of a bridge he join together at the distance of two foot two pile each a foot and a half thick sharpen a little at the lower end and proportion in length to the depth of the river after he have by means of engine sink these into the river and fix they at the bottom and then drive they in with rammer not quite perpendicularly like a stake but bend forward and slope so as to incline in the direction of the current of the river he also place two -lrb- other pile -rrb- opposite to these at the distance of forty foot lower down fasten together in the same manner but direct against the force and current of the river both these moreover be keep firmly apart by beam two foot thick -lrb- the space which the binding of the pile occupy -rrb- lay in at they extremity between two brace on each side and in consequence of these be in different direction and fasten on side the one opposite to the other so great be the strength of the work and such the arrangement of the material that in proportion as the greater body of water dash against the bridge so much the closer be its part hold fasten together these beam be bind together by timber lay over they in the direction of the length of the bridge and be -lrb- then -rrb- cover over with lath and hurdle and in addition to this pile be drive into the water obliquely at the lower side of the bridge and these serve as buttress and be connect with every portion of the work sustain the force of the stream : and there be other also above the bridge at a moderate distance that if trunk of tree or vessel be float down the river by the barbarian for the purpose of destroy the work the violence of such thing might be diminish by these defence and might not injure the bridge xviii -- within ten day after the timber begin to be collect the whole work be complete and the whole army lead over caesar leave a strong guard at each end of the bridge hasten into the territory of the sigambrus in the meantime ambassador from several nation come to he whom on they sue for peace and alliance he answer in a courteous manner and order hostage to be bring to he but the sigambrus at the very time the bridge be begin to be build make preparation for a flight -lrb- by the advice of such of the tenchtherus and usipete as they have amongst they -rrb- and quit they territory and convey away all they possession and conceal themselves in desert and wood xix -- caesar have remain in they territory a few day and burnt all they village and house and cut down they corn proceed into the territory of the ubius and have promise they he assistance if they be ever harass by the suevus he learn from they these particulars : that the suevus after they have by means of they scout find that the bridge be be build have call a council accord to they custom and send order to all part of they state to remove from the town and convey they child wife and all they possession into the wood and that all who could bear arm should assemble in one place that the place thus choose be nearly the center of those region which the suevus possess that in this spot they have resolve to await the arrival of the roman and give they battle there when caesar discover this have already accomplish all those thing on account of which he have resolve to lead he army over namely to strike fear into the german take vengeance on the sigambrus and free the ubius from the invasion of the suevus have spend altogether eighteen day beyond the rhine and think he have advance far enough to serve both honor and interest he return into gaul and cut down the bridge xx -- during the short part of summer which remain caesar although in these country as all gaul lie towards the north the winter be early nevertheless resolve to proceed into britain because he discover that in almost all the war with the gaul succor have be furnish to we enemy from that country and even if the time of year should be insufficient for carry on the war yet he think it would be of great service to he if he only enter the island and see into the character of the people and get knowledge of they locality harbor and landing-place all which be for the most part unknown to the gaul for neither do any one except merchant generally go thither nor even to they be any portion of it known except the sea-coast and those part which be opposite to gaul therefore after have call up to he the merchant from all part he could learn neither what be the size of the island nor what or how numerous be the nation which inhabit it nor what system of war they follow nor what custom they use nor what harbor be convenient for a great number of large ship xxi -- he send before he caius volusenus with a ship of war to acquire a knowledge of these particulars before he in person should make a descent into the island as he be convince that this be a judicious measure he commission he to thoroughly examine into all matter and then return to he as soon as possible he himself proceed to the morinus with all he force he order ship from all part of the neighbouring country and the fleet which the precede summer he have build for the war with the venetus to assemble in this place in the meantime he purpose have be discover and report to the briton by merchant ambassador come to he from several state of the island to promise that they will give hostage and submit to the government of the roman people have give they a audience he after promise liberally and exhort they to continue in that purpose send they back to they own country and -lrb- despatch -rrb- with they commius whom upon subdue the atrebate he have create king there a man whose courage and conduct he esteem and who he think would be faithful to he and whose influence rank highly in those country he order he to visit as many state as he could and persuade they to embrace the protection of the roman people and apprise they that he would shortly come thither volusenus have view the locality as far as means could be afford one who dare not leave he ship and trust himself to barbarian return to caesar on the fifth day and report what he have there observe xxii -- while caesar remain in these part for the purpose of procure ship ambassador come to he from a great portion of the morinus to plead they excuse respect they conduct on the late occasion allege that it be as man uncivilised and as those who be unacquainted with we custom that they have make war upon the roman people and promise to perform what he should command caesar think that this have happen fortunately enough for he because he neither wish to leave a enemy behind he nor have a opportunity for carry on a war by reason of the time of year nor consider that employment in such trifling matter be to be prefer to he enterprise on britain impose a large number of hostage and when these be bring he receive they to he protection have collect together and provide about eighty transport ship as many as he think necessary for convey over two legion he assign such -lrb- ship -rrb- of war as he have besides to the quaestor he lieutenant and officer of cavalry there be in addition to these eighteen ship of burden which be prevent eight mile from that place by wind from be able to reach the same port these he distribute amongst the horse the rest of the army he deliver to q titurius sabinus and l aurunculeius cotta he lieutenant to lead into the territory of the menapius and those canton of the morinus from which ambassador have not come to he he order p sulpicius rufus he lieutenant to hold possession of the harbor with such a garrison as he think sufficient xxiii -- these matter be arrange find the weather favourable for he voyage he set sail about the third watch and order the horse to march forward to the farther port and there embark and follow he as this be perform rather tardily by they he himself reach britain with the first squadron of ship about the fourth hour of the day and there see the force of the enemy draw up in arm on all the hill the nature of the place be this : the sea be confine by mountain so close to it that a dart could be throw from they summit upon the shore consider this by no mean a fit place for disembark he remain at anchor till the ninth hour for the other ship to arrive there have in the meantime assemble the lieutenant and military tribune he tell they both what he have learn from volusenus and what he wish to be do and enjoin they -lrb- as the principle of military matter and especially as maritime affair which have a precipitate and uncertain action require -rrb- that all thing should be perform by they at a nod and at the instant have dismiss they meet both with wind and tide favourable at the same time the signal be give and the anchor weigh he advance about seven mile from that place and station he fleet over against a open and level shore xxiv -- but the barbarian upon perceive the design of the roman send forward they cavalry and charioteer a class of warrior of whom it be they practice to make great use in they battle and follow with the rest of they force endeavor to prevent we man landing in this be the greatest difficulty for the follow reason namely because we ship on account of they great size could be station only in deep water and we soldier in place unknown to they with they hand embarrassed oppress with a large and heavy weight of armor have at the same time to leap from the ship stand amidst the wave and encounter the enemy whereas they either on dry ground or advance a little way into the water free in all they limb in place thoroughly know to they could confidently throw they weapon and spur on they horse which be accustom to this kind of service dismayed by these circumstance and altogether untrained in this mode of battle we man do not all exert the same vigor and eagerness which they have be wont to exert in engagement on dry ground xxv -- when caesar observe this he order the ship of war the appearance of which be somewhat strange to the barbarian and the motion more ready for service to be withdraw a little from the transport vessel and to be propel by they oar and be station towards the open flank of the enemy and the enemy to be beat off and drive away with sling arrow and engine : which plan be of great service to we man for the barbarian be startle by the form of we ship and the motion of we oar and the nature of we engine which be strange to they stop and shortly after retreat a little and while we man be hesitate -lrb- whether they should advance to the shore -rrb- chiefly on account of the depth of the sea he who carry the eagle of the tenth legion after supplicate the god that the matter might turn out favourably to the legion exclaim leap fellow soldier unless you wish to betray you eagle to the enemy i for my part will perform my duty to the commonwealth and my general when he have say this with a loud voice he leap from the ship and proceed to bear the eagle toward the enemy then we man exhort one another that so great a disgrace should not be incur all leap from the ship when those in the nearest vessel see they they speedily follow and approach the enemy xxvi -- the battle be maintain vigorously on both side we man however as they could neither keep they rank nor get firm footing nor follow they standard and as one from one ship and another from another assemble around whatever standard they meet be throw into great confusion but the enemy who be acquaint with all the shallows when from the shore they see any come from a ship one by one spur on they horse and attack they while embarrassed many surround a few other throw they weapon upon we collect force on they expose flank when caesar observe this he order the boat of the ship of war and the spy sloop to be fill with soldier and send they up to the succor of those whom he have observe in distress we man as soon as they make good they footing on dry ground and all they comrade have join they make a attack upon the enemy and put they to flight but could not pursue they very far because the horse have not be able to maintain they course at sea and reach the island this alone be want to caesar 's accustomed success xxvii -- the enemy be thus vanquish in battle as soon as they recover after they flight instantly send ambassador to caesar to negotiate about peace they promise to give hostage and perform what he should command together with these ambassador come commius the atrebatian who as i have above say have be send by caesar into britain he they have seize upon when leave he ship although in the character of ambassador he bear the general 's commission to they and throw into chain : then after the battle be fight they send he back and in sue for peace cast the blame of that act upon the common people and entreat that it might be pardon on account of they indiscretion caesar complain that after they have sue for peace and have voluntarily send ambassador into the continent for that purpose they have make war without a reason say that he would pardon they indiscretion and impose hostage a part of whom they give immediately the rest they say they would give in a few day since they be send for from remote place in the meantime they order they people to return to the country part and the chief assemble from all quarter and proceed to surrender themselves and they state to caesar xxviii -- a peace be establish by these proceedings four day after we have come into britain the eighteen ship to which reference have be make above and which convey the cavalry set sail from the upper port with a gentle gale when however they be approach britain and be see from the camp so great a storm suddenly arise that none of they could maintain they course at sea and some be take back to the same port from which they have start -- other to they great danger be drive to the lower part of the island nearer to the west which however after have cast anchor as they be get fill with water put out to sea through necessity in a stormy night and make for the continent xxix -- it happen that night to be full moon which usually occasion very high tide in that ocean and that circumstance be unknown to we man thus at the same time the tide begin to fill the ship of war which caesar have provide to convey over he army and which he have draw up on the strand and the storm begin to dash the ship of burden which be ride at anchor against each other nor be any means afford we man of either manage they or of render any service a great many ship have be wreck inasmuch as the rest have lose they cable anchor and other tackle be unfit for sail a great confusion as would necessarily happen arise throughout the army for there be no other ship in which they could be convey back and all thing which be of service in repair vessel be want and corn for the winter have not be provide in those place because it be understand by all that they would certainly winter in gaul xxx -- on discover these thing the chief of britain who have come up after the battle be fight to perform those condition which caesar have impose hold a conference when they perceive that cavalry and ship and corn be want to the roman and discover the small number of we soldier from the small extent of the camp -lrb- which too be on this account more limited than ordinary because caesar have convey over he legion without baggage -rrb- and think that the best plan be to renew the war and cut off we man from corn and provision and protract the affair till winter because they feel confident that if they be vanquish or cut off from a return no one would afterwards pass over into britain for the purpose of make war therefore again enter into a conspiracy they begin to depart from the camp by degree and secretly bring up they people from the country part xxxi -- but caesar although he have not as yet discover they measure yet both from what have occur to he ship and from the circumstance that they have neglect to give the promise hostage suspect that the thing would come to pass which really do happen he therefore provide remedy against all contingency for he daily convey corn from the country part into the camp use the timber and brass of such ship as be most seriously damage for repair the rest and order whatever thing besides be necessary for this object to be bring to he from the continent and thus since that business be execute by the soldier with the greatest energy he effect that after the loss of twelve ship a voyage could be make well enough in the rest xxxii -- while these thing be be transact one legion have be send to forage accord to custom and no suspicion of war have arise as yet and some of the people remain in the country part other go backwards and forwards to the camp they who be on duty at the gate of the camp report to caesar that a greater dust than be usual be see in that direction in which the legion have march caesar suspect that which be -lrb- really the case -rrb- -- that some new enterprise be undertake by the barbarian order the two cohort which be on duty to march into that quarter with he and two other cohort to relieve they on duty the rest to be arm and follow he immediately when he have advance some little way from the camp he see that he man be overpower by the enemy and scarcely able to stand they ground and that the legion be crowd together weapon be be cast on they from all side for as all the corn be reap in every part with the exception of one the enemy suspect that we man would repair to that have conceal themselves in the wood during the night then attack they suddenly scatter as they be and when they have lay aside they arm and be engage in reap they kill a small number throw the rest into confusion and surround they with they cavalry and chariot xxxiii -- they mode of fight with they chariot be this : firstly they drive about in all direction and throw they weapon and generally break the rank of the enemy with the very dread of they horse and the noise of they wheel and when they have work themselves in between the troops of horse leap from they chariot and engage on foot the charioteer in the meantime withdraw some little distance from the battle and so place themselves with the chariot that if they master be overpower by the number of the enemy they may have a ready retreat to they own troops thus they display in battle the speed of horse -lrb- together with -rrb- the firmness of infantry and by daily practice and exercise attain to such expertness that they be accustom even on a decline and steep place to check they horse at full speed and manage and turn they in a instant and run along the pole and stand on the yoke and thence betake themselves with the greatest celerity to they chariot again xxxiv-under these circumstance we man be dismay by the novelty of this mode of battle caesar most seasonably bring assistance for upon he arrival the enemy pause and we man recover from they fear upon which think the time unfavourable for provoke the enemy and come to a action he keep himself in he own quarter and a short time have intervene draw back the legion into the camp while these thing be go on and all we man engage the rest of the briton who be in the field depart storm then set in for several successive day which both confine we man to camp and hinder the enemy from attack we in the meantime the barbarian despatch messenger to all part and report to they people the small number of we soldier and how good a opportunity be give for obtain spoil and for liberating themselves for ever if they should only drive the roman from they camp have by these means speedily get together a large force of infantry and of cavalry they come up to the camp xxxv -- although caesar anticipate that the same thing which have happen on former occasion would then occur -- that if the enemy be route they would escape from danger by they speed still have get about thirty horse which commius the atrebatian of whom mention have be make have bring over with he -lrb- from gaul -rrb- he draw up the legion in order of battle before the camp when the action commence the enemy be unable to sustain the attack of we man long and turn they back we man pursue they as far as they speed and strength permit and slew a great number of they then have destroy and burnt everything far and wide they retreat to they camp xxxvi -- the same day ambassador send by the enemy come to caesar to negotiate a peace caesar double the number of hostage which he have before demand and order that they should be bring over to the continent because since the time of the equinox be near he do not consider that with he ship out of repair the voyage ought to be defer till winter have meet with favourable weather he set sail a little after midnight and all he fleet arrive safe at the continent except two of the ship of burden which could not make the same port which the other ship do and be carry a little lower down xxxvii -- when we soldier about 300 in number have be draw out of these two ship and be march to the camp the morinus whom caesar when set forth for britain have leave in a state of peace excite by the hope of spoil at first surround they with a small number of man and order they to lay down they arm if they do not wish to be slay afterwards however when they form a circle stand on they defense a shout be raise and about 6000 of the enemy soon assemble which be report caesar send all the cavalry in the camp as a relief to he man in the meantime we soldier sustain the attack of the enemy and fight most valiantly for more than four hour and receive but few wound themselves slew several of they but after we cavalry come in sight the enemy throw away they arm turn they back and a great number of they be kill xxxviii -- the day follow caesar send labienus he lieutenant with those legion which he have bring back from britain against the morinus who have revolt who as they have no place to which they might retreat on account of the dry up of they marsh -lrb- which they have avail themselves of as a place of refuge the precede year -rrb- almost all fall into the power of labienus in the meantime caesar 's lieutenant q titurius and l cotta who have lead the legion into the territory of the menapius have lay waste all they land cut down they corn and burn they house return to caesar because the menapius have all conceal themselves in they thickest wood caesar fix the winter quarter of all the legion amongst the belgae thither only two british state send hostage the rest omit to do so for these success a thanksgiving of twenty day be decree by the senate upon receive caesar 's letter book v i -- lucius domitius and appius claudius be consul caesar when depart from he winter quarter into italy as he have be accustom to do yearly command the lieutenant whom he appoint over the legion to take care that during the winter as many ship as possible should be build and the old repair he plan the size and shape of they for despatch of lading and for draw they on shore he make they a little lower than those which we have be accustom to use in we sea and that so much the more because he know that on account of the frequent change of the tide less swell occur there for the purpose of transport little and a great number of horse -lrb- he make they -rrb- a little broader than those which we use in other sea all these he order to be construct for lightness and expedition to which object they lowness contribute greatly he order those thing which be necessary for equip ship to be bring thither from spain he himself on the assizes of hither gaul be conclude proceeds into illyricum because he hear that the part of the province nearest they be be lay waste by the incursion of the pirusta when he have arrive there he levy soldier upon the state and order they to assemble at a appoint place which circumstance have be report -lrb- to they -rrb- the pirusta send ambassador to he to inform he that no part of those proceedings be do by public deliberation and assert that they be ready to make compensation by all means for the injury -lrb- inflict -rrb- caesar accept they defense demand hostage and order they to be bring to he on a specify day and assure they that unless they do so he would visit they state with war these be bring to he on the day which he have order he appoint arbitrator between the state who should estimate the damages and determine the reparation ii -- these thing be finish and the assizes be conclude he return into hither gaul and proceed thence to the army when he have arrive there have make a survey of the winter quarter he find that by the extraordinary ardor of the soldier amidst the utmost scarcity of all material about six hundred ship of that kind which we have describe above and twenty-eight ship of war have be build and be not far from that state that they might be launch in a few day have commend the soldier and those who have preside over the work he inform they what he wish to be do and order all the ship to assemble at port itius from which port he have learn that the passage into britain be shortest -lrb- be only -rrb- about thirty mile from the continent he leave what seem a sufficient number of soldier for that design he himself proceed into the territory of the trevirus with four legion without baggage and 800 horse because they neither come to the general diet -lrb- of gaul -rrb- nor obey he command and be moreover say to be tamper with the german beyond the rhine iii -- this state be by far the most powerful of all gaul in cavalry and have great force of infantry and as we have remark above border on the rhine in that state two person indutiomarus and cingetorix be then contend with each other for the supreme power one of whom as soon as the arrival of caesar and he legion be know come to he assure he that he and all he party would continue in they allegiance and not revolt from the alliance of the roman people and inform he of the thing which be go on amongst the trevirus but indutiomarus begin to collect cavalry and infantry and make preparation for war have conceal those who by reason of they age could not be under arm in the forest arduenna which be of immense size -lrb- and -rrb- extend from the rhine across the country of the trevirus to the frontier of the remus but after that some of the chief person of the state both influence by they friendship for cingetorix and alarm at the arrival of we army come to caesar and begin to solicit he privately about they own interest since they could not provide for the safety of the state indutiomarus dread lest he should be abandon by all send ambassador to caesar to declare that he absent himself from he countryman and refrain from come to he on this account that he might the more easily keep the state in its allegiance lest on the departure of all the nobility the commonalty should in they indiscretion revolt and thus the whole state be at he control and that he if caesar would permit would come to the camp to he and would commit he own fortune and those of the state to he good faith iv -- caesar though he discern from what motive these thing be say and what circumstance deter he from he meditated plan still in order that he might not be compel to waste the summer among the trevirus while all thing be prepare for the war with britain order indutiomarus to come to he with 200 hostage when these be bring -lrb- and -rrb- among they he son and near relation whom he have demand by name he console indutiomarus and enjoin he to continue in he allegiance yet nevertheless summon to he the chief man of the trevirus he reconcile they individually to cingetorix : this he both think should be do by he in justice to the merit of the latter and also judge that it be of great importance that the influence of one whose singular attachment towards he he have fully see should prevail as much as possible among he people indutiomarus be very much offend at this act -lrb- see that -rrb- he influence be diminish among he countryman and he who already before have bear a hostile mind towards we be much more violently inflamed against we through resentment at this v -- these matter be settle caesar go to port itius with the legion there he discover that forty ship which have be build in the country of the meldus have be drive back by a storm have be unable to maintain they course and have return to the same port from which they have set out he find the rest ready for sailing and furnish with everything in the same place the cavalry of the whole of gaul in number 4000 assemble and -lrb- also -rrb- the chief person of all the state he have determine to leave in gaul a very few of they whose fidelity towards he he have clearly discern and take the rest with he as hostage because he fear a commotion in gaul when he should be absent vi -- there be together with the other dumnorix the aeduan of whom we have make previous mention he in particular he have resolve to have with he because he have discover he to be fond of change fond of power possess great resolution and great influence among the gaul to this be add that dumnorix have before say in a assembly of aeduan that the sovereignty of the state have be make over to he by caesar which speech the aeduus bear with impatience and yet dare not send ambassador to caesar for the purpose of either reject or deprecate -lrb- that appointment -rrb- that fact caesar have learn from he own personal friend he at first strove to obtain by every entreaty that he should be leave in gaul partly because be unaccustomed to sailing he fear the sea partly because he say he be prevent by divine admonition after he see that this request be firmly refuse he all hope of success be lose he begin to tamper with the chief person of the gaul to call they apart singly and exhort they to remain on the continent to agitate they with the fear that it be not without reason that gaul should be stript of all she nobility that it be caesar 's design to bring over to britain and put to death all those whom he fear to slay in the sight of gaul to pledge he honor to the rest to ask for they oath that they would by common deliberation execute what they should perceive to be necessary for gaul these thing be report to caesar by several person vii -- have learn this fact caesar because he have confer so much honor upon the aeduan state determine that dumnorix should be restrain and deter by whatever mean he could and that because he perceive he insane design to be proceed farther and farther care should be take lest he might be able to injure he and the commonwealth therefore have stay about twenty-five day in that place because the north wind which usually blow a great part of every season prevent the voyage he exert himself to keep dumnorix in he allegiance -lrb- and -rrb- nevertheless learn all he measure : have at length meet with favourable weather he order the foot soldier and the horse to embark in the ship but while the mind of all be occupy dumnorix begin to take he departure from the camp homewards with the cavalry of the aeduus caesar be ignorant of it caesar on this matter be report to he cease from he expedition and defer all other affair send a great part of the cavalry to pursue he and command that he be bring back he order that if he use violence and do not submit that he be slay : consider that dumnorix would do nothing as a rational man while he himself be absent since he have disregard he command even when present he however when recall begin to resist and defend himself with he hand and implore the support of he people often exclaim that he be free and the subject of a free state they surround and kill the man as they have be command but the aeduan horseman all return to caesar viii -- when these thing be do -lrb- and -rrb- labienus leave on the continent with three legion and 2000 horse to defend the harbor and provide corn and discover what be go on in gaul and take measure accord to the occasion and accord to the circumstance he himself with five legion and a number of horse equal to that which he be leave on the continent set sail at sunset and -lrb- though for a time -rrb- bear forward by a gentle south-west wind he do not maintain he course in consequence of the wind die away about midnight and be carry on too far by the tide when the sun rise espy britain pass on he left then again follow the change of tide he urge on with the oar that he might make that port of the island in which he have discover the precede summer that there be the best landing-place and in this affair the spirit of we soldier be very much to be extol for they with the transport and heavy ship the labor of rowing not be -lrb- for a moment -rrb- discontinue equal the speed of the ship of war all the ship reach britain nearly at mid-day nor be there see a -lrb- single -rrb- enemy in that place but as caesar afterwards find from some prisoner though large body of troops have assemble there yet be alarm by the great number of we ship more than eight hundred of which include the ship of the preceding year and those private vessel which each have build for he own convenience have appear at one time they have quit the coast and conceal themselves among the higher point ix -- caesar have disembark he army and choose a convenient place for the camp when he discover from the prisoner in what part the force of the enemy have lodge themselves have leave ten cohort and 300 horse at the sea to be a guard to the ship hasten to the enemy at the third watch fear the less for the ship for this reason because he be leave they fasten at anchor upon a even and open shore and he place q atrius over the guard of the ship he himself have advance by night about twelve mile espy the force of the enemy they advance to the river with they cavalry and chariot from the higher ground begin to annoy we man and give battle be repulse by we cavalry they conceal themselves in wood as they have secure a place admirably fortify by nature and by art which as it seem they have before prepare on account of a civil war for all entrance to it be shut up by a great number of fell tree they themselves rush out of the wood to fight here and there and prevent we man from enter they fortification but the soldier of the seventh legion have form a testudo and throw up a rampart against the fortification take the place and drive they out of the wood receive only a few wound but caesar forbid he man to pursue they in they flight any great distance both because he be ignorant of the nature of the ground and because as a great part of the day be spend he wish time to be leave for the fortification of the camp x -- the next day early in the morning he send both foot-soldier and horse in three division on a expedition to pursue those who have flee these have advance a little way when already the rear -lrb- of the enemy -rrb- be in sight some horse come to caesar from quintus atrius to report that the precede night a very great storm have arise almost all the ship be dash to piece and cast upon the shore because neither the anchor and cable could resist nor could the sailor and pilot sustain the violence of the storm and thus great damage be receive by that collision of the ship xi -- these thing be know -lrb- to he -rrb- caesar order the legion and cavalry to be recall and to cease from they march he himself return to the ship : he see clearly before he almost the same thing which he have hear of from the messenger and by letter so that about forty ship be lose the remainder seem capable of be repair with much labor therefore he select workman from the legion and order other to be send for from the continent he write to labienus to build as many ship as he could with those legion which be with he he himself though the matter be one of great difficulty and labor yet think it to be most expedient for all the ship to be bring up on shore and join with the camp by one fortification in these matter he employ about ten day the labor of the soldier be unremitting even during the hour of night the ship have be bring up on shore and the camp strongly fortify he leave the same force which he do before as a guard for the ship he set out in person for the same place that he have return from when he have come thither greater force of the briton have already assemble at that place the chief command and management of the war have be entrust to cassivellaunus whose territory a river which be call the thame separate from the maritime state at about eighty mile from the sea at a earlier period perpetual war have take place between he and the other state but greatly alarm by we arrival the briton have place he over the whole war and the conduct of it xii -- the interior portion of britain be inhabit by those of whom they say that it be hand down by tradition that they be bear in the island itself : the maritime portion by those who have pass over from the country of the belgae for the purpose of plunder and make war almost all of whom be call by the name of those state from which be spring they go thither and have wage war continue there and begin to cultivate the land the number of the people be countless and they building exceedingly numerous for the most part very like those of the gaul : the number of cattle be great they use either brass or iron ring determine at a certain weight as they money tin be produce in the midland region in the maritime iron but the quantity of it be small : they employ brass which be import there as in gaul be timber of every description except beech and fir they do not regard it lawful to eat the hare and the cock and the goose they however breed they for amusement and pleasure the climate be more temperate than in gaul the cold be less severe xiii -- the island be triangular in its form and one of its side be opposite to gaul one angle of this side which be in kent whither almost all ship from gaul be direct -lrb- look -rrb- to the east the lower look to the south this side extend about 500 mile another side lie towards spain and the west on which part be ireland less as be reckon than britain by one-half but the passage -lrb- from it -rrb- into britain be of equal distance with that from gaul in the middle of this voyage be a island which be call mona many smaller island besides be suppose to lie -lrb- there -rrb- of which island some have write that at the time of the winter solstice it be night there for thirty consecutive day we in we inquiry about that matter ascertain nothing except that by accurate measurement with water we perceive the night to be shorter there than on the continent the length of this side as they account state be 700 mile the third side be towards the north to which portion of the island no land be opposite but a angle of that side look principally towards germany this side be consider to be 800 mile in length thus the whole island be -lrb- about -rrb- 2000 mile in circumference xiv -- the most civilised of all these nation be they who inhabit kent which be entirely a maritime district nor do they differ much from the gallic custom most of the inland inhabitant do not sow corn but live on milk and flesh and be clothe with skin all the briton indeed dye themselves with wood which occasion a bluish color and thereby have a more terrible appearance in fight they wear they hair long and have every part of they body shave except they head and upper lip ten and even twelve have wife common to they and particularly brother among brother and parent among they child but if there be any issue by these wife they be repute to be the child of those by whom respectively each be first espouse when a virgin xv -- the horse and charioteer of the enemy contend vigorously in a skirmish with we cavalry on the march yet so that we man be conqueror in all part and drive they to they wood and hill but have slay a great many they pursue too eagerly and lose some of they man but the enemy after some time have elapse when we man be off they guard and occupy in the fortification of the camp rush out of the wood and make a attack upon those who be place on duty before the camp fight in a determine manner and two cohort be send by caesar to they relief and these severally the first of two legion when these have take up they position at a very small distance from each other as we man be disconcert by the unusual mode of battle the enemy break through the middle of they most courageously and retreat thence in safety that day q laberius durus a tribune of the soldier be slay the enemy since more cohort be send against they be repulse xvi -- in the whole of this method of fight since the engagement take place under the eye of all and before the camp it be perceive that we man on account of the weight of they arm inasmuch as they could neither pursue -lrb- the enemy when -rrb- retreat nor dare quit they standard be little suit to this kind of enemy that the horse also fight with great danger because they -lrb- the briton -rrb- generally retreat even designedly and when they have draw off we man a short distance from the legion leap from they chariot and fight on foot in unequal -lrb- and to they advantageous -rrb- battle but the system of cavalry engagement be wont to produce equal danger and indeed the same both to those who retreat and those who pursue to this be add that they never fight in close order but in small party and at great distance and have detachment place -lrb- in different part -rrb- and then the one relieve the other and the vigorous and fresh succeed the wearied xvii -- the follow day the enemy halt on the hill a distance from we camp and present themselves in small party and begin to challenge we horse to battle with less spirit than the day before but at noon when caesar have send three legion and all the cavalry with c trebonius the lieutenant for the purpose of forage they fly upon the forager suddenly from all quarter so that they do not keep off -lrb- even -rrb- from the standard and the legion we man make a attack on they vigorously repulse they nor do they cease to pursue they until the horse rely on relief as they see the legion behind they drive the enemy precipitately before they and slaying a great number of they do not give they the opportunity either of rally or halt or leap from they chariot immediately after this retreat the auxiliary who have assemble from all side depart nor after that time do the enemy ever engage with we in very large number xviii -- caesar discover they design lead he army into the territory of cassivellaunus to the river thame which river can be ford in one place only and that with difficulty when he have arrive there he perceive that numerous force of the enemy be marshal on the other bank of the river the bank also be defend by sharp stake fix in front and stake of the same kind fix under the water be cover by the river these thing be discover from -lrb- some -rrb- prisoner and deserter caesar send forward the cavalry order the legion to follow they immediately but the soldier advance with such speed and such ardor though they stand above the water by they head only that the enemy could not sustain the attack of the legion and of the horse and quit the bank and commit themselves to flight xix -- cassivellaunus as we have state above all hope -lrb- rise out -rrb- of battle be lay aside the greater part of he force be dismiss and about 4000 charioteer only be leave use to observe we march and retire a little from the road and conceal himself in intricate and woody place and in those neighborhood in which he have discover we be about to march he use to drive the cattle and the inhabitant from the field into the wood and when we cavalry for the sake of plunder and ravage the more freely scatter themselves among the field he use to send out charioteer from the wood by all the well-known road and path and to the great danger of we horse engage with they and this source of fear hinder they from straggle very extensively the result be that caesar do not allow excursion to be make to a great distance from the main body of the legion and order that damage should be do to the enemy in ravage they land and kindle fire only so far as the legionary soldier could by they own exertion and march accomplish it xx -- in the meantime the trinobante almost the most powerful state of those part from which the young man mandubratius embrace the protection of caesar have come to the continent of gaul to -lrb- meet -rrb- he -lrb- whose father imanuentius have possess the sovereignty in that state and have be kill by cassivellaunus he himself have escape death by flight -rrb- send ambassador to caesar and promise that they will surrender themselves to he and perform he command they entreat he to protect mandubratius from the violence of cassivellaunus and send to they state some one to preside over it and possess the government caesar demand forty hostage from they and corn for he army and send mandubratius to they they speedily perform the thing demand and send hostage to the number appoint and the corn xxi -- the trinobante be protect and secure from any violence of the soldier the cenimagnus the segontiacus the ancalite the bibrocus and the cassus send embassy surrender themselves to caesar from they he learn that the capital town of cassivellaunus be not far from that place and be defend by wood and morass and a very large number of man and of cattle have be collect in it -lrb- now the briton when they have fortify the intricate wood in which they be wont to assemble for the purpose of avoid the incursion of a enemy with a entrenchment and a rampart call they a town -rrb- thither he proceed with he legion : he find the place admirably fortify by nature and art he however undertake to attack it in two direction the enemy have remain only a short time do not sustain the attack of we soldier and hurry away on the other side of the town a great amount of cattle be find there and many of the enemy be take and slay in they flight xxii -- while these thing be go forward in those place cassivellaunus send messenger into kent which we have observe above be on the sea over which district four several king reign cingetorix carvilius taximagulus and segonax and command they to collect all they force and unexpectedly assail and storm the naval camp when they have come to the camp we man after make a sally slaying many of they man and also capture a distinguished leader name lugotorix bring back they own man in safety cassivellaunus when this battle be report to he as so many loss have be sustain and he territory lay waste be alarm most of all by the desertion of the state send ambassador to caesar -lrb- to treat -rrb- about a surrender through the mediation of commius the atrebatian caesar since he have determine to pass the winter on the continent on account of the sudden revolt of gaul and as much of the summer do not remain and he perceive that even that could be easily protracted demand hostage and prescribe what tribute britain should pay each year to the roman people he forbid and command cassivellaunus that he wage not war against mandubratius or the trinobante xxiii -- when he have receive the hostage he lead back the army to the sea and find the ship repair after launch these because he have a large number of prisoner and some of the ship have be lose in the storm he determine to convey back he army at two embarkation and it so happen that out of so large a number of ship in so many voyage neither in this nor in the previous year be any ship miss which convey soldier but very few out of those which be send back to he from the continent empty as the soldier of the former convoy have be disembark and out of those -lrb- sixty in number -rrb- which labienus have take care to have build reach they destination almost all the rest be drive back and when caesar have wait for they for some time in vain lest he should be debar from a voyage by the season of the year inasmuch as the equinox be at hand he of necessity stow he soldier the more closely and a very great calm come on after he have weigh anchor at the beginning of the second watch he reach land at break of day and bring in all the ship in safety xxiv -- the ship have be draw up and a general assembly of the gaul hold at samarobriva because the corn that year have not prosper in gaul by reason of the drought he be compel to station he army in its winter-quarter differently from the former year and to distribute the legion among several state : one of they he give to c fabius he lieutenant to be march into the territory of the morinus a second to q cicero into those of the nervius a third to l roscius into those of the essui a fourth he order to winter with t labienus among the remus in the confines of the trevirus he station three in belgium over these he appoint m crassus he questor and l munatius plancus and c trebonius he lieutenant one legion which he have raise last on the other side of the po and five cohort he send amongst the eburone the greatest portion of whom lie between the meuse and the rhine -lrb- and -rrb- who be under the government of ambiorix and cativolcus he order q titurius sabinus and l aurunculeius cotta he lieutenant to take the command of these soldier the legion be distribute in this manner he think he could most easily remedy the scarcity of corn and yet the winter-quarter of all these legion -lrb- except that which he have give to l roscius to be lead into the most peaceful and tranquil neighborhood -rrb- be comprehend within -lrb- about -rrb- 100 mile he himself in the meanwhile until he have station the legion and know that the several winter-quarter be fortify determine to stay in gaul xxv -- there be among the carnute a man name tasgetius bear of very high rank whose ancestor have hold the sovereignty in he state to he caesar have restore the position of he ancestor in consideration of he prowess and attachment towards he because in all he war he have avail himself of he valuable service he personal enemy have kill he when in the third year of he reign many even of he own state be openly promoter -lrb- of that act -rrb- this event be relate to caesar he fear because several be involve in the act that the state might revolt at they instigation order lucius plancus with a legion to proceed quickly from belgium to the carnute and winter there and arrest and send to he the person by whose instrumentality he should discover that tasgetius be slay in the meantime he be apprise by all the lieutenant and questor to whom he have assign the legion that they have arrive in winter-quarter and that the place for the quarter be fortify xxvi -- about fifteen day after they have come into winter-quarter the beginning of a sudden insurrection and revolt arise from ambiorix and cativolcus who though they have meet with sabinus and cotta at the border of they kingdom and have convey corn into we winter-quarter induce by the message of indutiomarus one of the trevirus excite they people and after have suddenly assail the soldier engage in procure wood come with a large body to attack the camp when we man have speedily take up arm and have ascend the rampart and send out some spanish horse on one side have prove conqueror in a cavalry action the enemy despairing of success draw off they troops from the assault then they shout accord to they custom that some of we man should go forward to a conference -lrb- allege -rrb- that they have some thing which they desire to say respect the common interest by which they trust they dispute could be remove xxvii -- c arpineius a roman knight the intimate friend of q titurius and with he q junius a certain person from spain who already on previous occasion have be accustom to go to ambiorix at caesar 's mission be send to they for the purpose of a conference : before they ambiorix speak to this effect : that he confess that for caesar 's kindness towards he he be very much indebted to he inasmuch as by he aid he have be free from a tribute which he have be accustom to pay to the aduatucus he neighbor and because he own son and the son of he brother have be send back to he whom when send in the number of hostage the aduatucus have detain among they in slavery and in chain and that he have not do that which he have do in regard to the attack of the camp either by he own judgment or desire but by the compulsion of he state and that he government be of that nature that the people have as much of authority over he as he over the people to the state moreover the occasion of the war be this -- that it could not withstand the sudden combination of the gaul that he could easily prove this from he own weakness since he be not so little verse in affair as to presume that with he force he could conquer the roman people but that it be the common resolution of gaul that that day be appoint for the storm of all caesar 's winter-quarter in order that no legion should be able to come to the relief of another legion that gaul could not easily deny gaul especially when a measure seem enter into for recover they common freedom since he have perform he duty to they on the score of patriotism -lrb- he say -rrb- he have now regard to gratitude for the kindness of caesar that he warn that he pray titurius by the claim of hospitality to consult for he and he soldier ' safety that a large force of the german have be hire and have pass the rhine that it would arrive in two day that it be for they to consider whether they think fit before the nearest people perceive it to lead off they soldier when draw out of winter-quarter either to cicero or to labienus one of whom be about fifty mile distant from they the other rather more that this he promise and confirm by oath that he would give they a safe passage through he territory and when he do that he be both consult for he own state because it would be relieve from the winter-quarter and also make a requital to caesar for he obligation xxviii -- arpineius and junius relate to the lieutenant what they have hear they greatly alarm by the unexpected affair though those thing be speak by a enemy still think they be not to be disregard and they be especially influence by this consideration that it be scarcely credible that the obscure and humble state of the eburone have dare to make war upon the roman people of they own accord accordingly they refer the matter to a council and a great controversy arise among they l aurunculeius and several tribune of the soldier and the centurion of the first rank be of opinion that nothing should be do hastily and that they should not depart from the camp without caesar 's order they declare that any force of the german however great might be encounter by fortify winter-quarter that this fact be a proof -lrb- of it -rrb- that they have sustain the first assault of the german most valiantly inflict many wound upon they that they be not distressed for corn that in the meantime relief would come both from the nearest winter-quarter and from caesar lastly they put the query what could be more undetermined more undignified than to adopt measure respect the most important affair on the authority of a enemy xxix -- in opposition to those thing titurius exclaim that they would do this too late when greater force of the enemy after a junction with the german should have assemble or when some disaster have be receive in the neighbouring winter-quarter that the opportunity for deliberate be short that he believe that caesar have set forth into italy as the carnute would not otherwise have take the measure of slaying tasgetius nor would the eburone if he have be present have come to the camp with so great defiance of we that he do not regard the enemy but the fact as the authority that the rhine be near that the death of ariovistus and we previous victory be subject of great indignation to the german that gaul be inflamed that after have receive so many defeat she be reduce under the sway of the roman people she pristine glory in military matter be extinguish lastly who would persuade himself of this that ambiorix have resort to a design of that nature without sure grounds that he own opinion be safe on either side if there be nothing very formidable they would go without danger to the nearest legion if all gaul conspire with the german they only safety lay in despatch what issue would the advice of cotta and of those who differ from he have from which if immediate danger be not to be dread yet certainly famine by a protracted siege be xxx -- this discussion have be hold on the two side when opposition be offer strenuously by cotta and the principal officer prevail say sabinus if so you wish it and he say it with a louder voice that a great portion of the soldier might hear he nor be i the person among you he say who be most powerfully alarm by the danger of death these will be aware of it and then if any thing disastrous shall have occur they will demand a reckoning at you hand these who if it be permit by you unite three day hence with the nearest winter-quarter may encounter the common condition of war with the rest and not as if force away and separate far from the rest perish either by the sword or by famine xxxi -- they rise from the council detain both and entreat that they do not bring the matter into the greatest jeopardy by they dissension and obstinacy the affair be a easy one if only they all think and approve of the same thing whether they remain or depart on the other hand they see no security in dissension the matter be prolong by debate till midnight at last cotta be overrule yield he assent the opinion of sabinus prevail it be proclaim that they will march at day-break the remainder of the night be spend without sleep since every soldier be inspect he property -lrb- to see -rrb- what he could carry with he and what out of the appurtenance of the winter-quarter he would be compel to leave every reason be suggest to show why they could not stay without danger and how that danger would be increase by the fatigue of the soldier and they want of sleep at break of day they quit the camp in a very extended line and with a very large amount of baggage in such a manner as man who be convince that the advice be give by ambiorix not as a enemy but as most friendly -lrb- towards they -rrb- xxxii -- but the enemy after they have make the discovery of they intended departure by the noise during the night and they not retire to rest have place a ambuscade in two division in the wood in a suitable and conceal place two mile from the camp wait for the arrival of the roman and when the greater part of the line of march have descend into a considerable valley they suddenly present themselves on either side of that valley and begin both to harass the rear and hinder the van from ascend and to give battle in a place exceedingly disadvantageous to we man xxxiii -- then at length titurius as one who have provide nothing beforehand be confuse run to and fro and set about arrange he troops these very thing however he do timidly and in such a manner that all resource seem to fail he : which generally happen to those who be compel to take council in the action itself but cotta who have reflect that these thing might occur on the march and on that account have not be a adviser of the departure be want to the common safety in no respect both in address and encourage the soldier he perform the duty of a general and in the battle those of a soldier and since they -lrb- titurius and cotta -rrb- could less easily perform everything by themselves and provide what be to be do in each place by reason of the length of the line of march they order -lrb- the officer -rrb- to give the command that they should leave the baggage and form themselves into a orb which measure though in a contingency of that nature it be not to be condemn still turn out unfortunately for it both diminish the hope of we soldier and render the enemy more eager for the fight because it appear that this be not do without the greatest fear and despair besides that happen which would necessarily be the case that the soldier for the most part quit they ensign and hurry to seek and carry off from the baggage whatever each think valuable and all part be fill with uproar and lamentation xxxiv -- but judgment be not want to the barbarian for they leader order -lrb- the officer -rrb- to proclaim through the rank that no man should quit he place that the booty be theirs and for they be reserve whatever the roman should leave therefore let they consider that all thing depend on they victory we man be equal to they in fight both in courage and in number and though they be desert by they leader and by fortune yet they still place all hope of safety in they valor and as often as any cohort sally forth on that side a great number of the enemy usually fall ambiorix when he observe this order the command to be issue that they throw they weapon from a distance and do not approach too near and in whatever direction the roman should make a attack there give way -lrb- from the lightness of they appointment and from they daily practice no damage could be do they -rrb- -lrb- but -rrb- pursue they when betake themselves to they standard again xxxv -- which command have be most carefully obey when any cohort have quit the circle and make a charge the enemy flee very precipitately in the meantime that part of the roman army of necessity be leave unprotected and the weapon receive on they open flank again when they have begin to return to that place from which they have advance they be surround both by those who have retreat and by those who stand next they but if on the other hand they wish to keep they place neither be a opportunity leave for valor nor could they be crowd together escape the weapon cast by so large a body of man yet though assail by so many disadvantage -lrb- and -rrb- have receive many wound they withstand the enemy and a great portion of the day be spend though they fight from day-break till the eighth hour they do nothing which be unworthy of they at length each thigh of t balventius who the year before have be chief centurion a brave man and one of great authority be pierce with a javelin q lucanius of the same rank fight most valiantly be slay while he assist he son when surround by the enemy l cotta the lieutenant when encourage all the cohort and company be wound full in the mouth by a sling xxxvi -- much trouble by these event q titurius when he have perceive ambiorix in the distance encourage he man send to he he interpreter cn pompey to beg that he would spare he and he soldier he when address reply if he wish to confer with he it be permit that he hope what pertain to the safety of the soldier could be obtain from the people that to he however certainly no injury would be do and that he pledge he faith to that effect he consult with cotta who have be wound whether it would appear right to retire from battle and confer with ambiorix -lrb- say -rrb- that he hope to be able to succeed respect he own and the soldier ' safety cotta say he will not go to a armed enemy and in that persevere xxxvii -- sabinus order those tribune of the soldier whom he have at the time around he and the centurion of the first rank to follow he and when he have approach near to ambiorix be order to throw down he arm he obey the order and command he man to do the same in the meantime while they treat upon the term and a longer debate than necessary be designedly enter into by ambiorix be surround by degree he be slay then they accord to they custom shout out victory and raise they war-cry and make a attack on we man break they rank there l cotta while fight be slay together with the greater part of the soldier the rest betake themselves to the camp from which they have march forth and one of they l petrosidius the standard bearer when he be overpower by the great number of the enemy throw the eagle within the entrenchment and be himself slay while fight with the greatest courage before the camp they with difficulty sustain the attack till night despairing of safety they all to a man destroy themselves in the night a few escape from the battle make they way to labienus at winter-quarter after wander at random through the wood and inform he of these event xxxviii -- elate by this victory ambiorix march immediately with he cavalry to the aduatucus who border on he kingdom he halt neither day nor night and order the infantry to follow he closely have relate the exploit and rouse the aduatucus the next day he arrive among the nervius and entreat that they should not throw away the opportunity of liberating themselves for ever and of punish the roman for those wrong which they have receive from they -lrb- he tell they -rrb- that two lieutenant have be slay and that a large portion of the army have perish that it be not a matter of difficulty for the legion which be winter with cicero to be cut off when suddenly assault he declare himself ready to co-operate in that design he easily gain over the nervius by this speech xxxix -- accordingly messenger have be forthwith despatch to the centrone the grudius the levacus the pleumoxius and the geidunus all of whom be under they government they assemble as large body as they can and rush unexpectedly to the winter-quarter of cicero the report of the death of titurius not have as yet be convey to he that also occur to he which be the consequence of a necessary work -- that some soldier who have go off into the wood for the purpose of procure timber and therewith construct fortification be intercept by the sudden arrival of -lrb- the enemy 's -rrb- horse these have be entrap the eburone the nervius and the aduatucus and all they ally and dependant begin to attack the legion : we man quickly run together to arm and mount the rampart : they sustain the attack that day with great difficulty since the enemy place all they hope in despatch and feel assure that if they obtain this victory they would be conqueror for ever xl -- letter be immediately send to caesar by cicero great reward be offer -lrb- to the messenger -rrb- if they carry they through all the pass have be beset those who be send be intercept during the night as many as 120 tower be raise with incredible despatch out of the timber which they have collect for the purpose of fortification : the thing which seem necessary to the work be complete the follow day the enemy have collect far greater force attack the camp -lrb- and -rrb- fill up the ditch resistance be make by we man in the same manner as the day before : this same thing be do afterwards during the remain day the work be carry on incessantly in the night : not even to the sick or wounded be opportunity give for rest : whatever thing be require for resist the assault of the next day be provide during the night : many stake burn at the end and a large number of mural pike be procure : tower be build up battlements and parapet be form of interwoven hurdle cicero himself though he be in very weak health do not leave himself the night-time for repose so that he be force to spare himself by the spontaneous movement and entreaty of the soldier xli -- then these leader and chief of the nervius who have any intimacy and grounds of friendship with cicero say they desire to confer with he when permission be grant they recount the same thing which ambiorix have relate to titurius namely that all gaul be in arm that the german have pass the rhine that the winter-quarter of caesar and of the other be attack they report in addition also about the death of sabinus they point to ambiorix for the purpose of obtain credence they be mistaken say they if they hope for any relief from those who distrust they own affair that they bear such feeling towards cicero and the roman people that they deny they nothing but winter-quarter and be unwilling that this practice should become constant that through they -lrb- the nervius 's -rrb- mean it be possible for they -lrb- the roman -rrb- to depart from they winter-quarter safely and to proceed without fear into whatever part they desire to these cicero make only one reply : that it be not the custom of the roman people to accept any condition from a armed enemy : if they be willing to lay down they arm they may employ he as they advocate and send ambassador to caesar : that he believe from he -lrb- caesar 's -rrb- justice they would obtain the thing which they might request xlii -- disappointed in this hope the nervius surround the winter-quarter with a rampart eleven foot high and a ditch thirteen foot in depth these military work they have learn from we man in the intercourse of former year and have take some of we army prisoner be instruct by they : but as they have no supply of iron tool which be requisite for this service they be force to cut the turf with they sword and to empty out the earth with they hand and cloak from which circumstance the vast number of the man could be infer for in less than three hour they complete a fortification of ten mile in circumference and during the rest of the day they begin to prepare and construct tower of the height of the rampart and grapple iron and mantlet which the same prisoner have teach they xliii -- on the seventh day of the attack a very high wind have spring up they begin to discharge by they sling hot ball make of burnt or hardened clay and heated javelin upon the hut which after the gallic custom be thatch with straw these quickly take fire and by the violence of the wind scatter they flame in every part of the camp the enemy follow up they success with a very loud shout as if victory be already obtain and secure begin to advance they tower and mantlet and climb the rampart with ladder but so great be the courage of we soldier and such they presence of mind that though they be scorch on all side and harass by a vast number of weapon and be aware that they baggage and they possession be burn not only do no one quit the rampart for the purpose of withdraw from the scene but scarcely do any one even then look behind and they all fight most vigorously and most valiantly this day be by far the most calamitous to we man it have this result however that on that day the largest number of the enemy be wound and slay since they have crowd beneath the very rampart and the hindmost do not afford the foremost a retreat the flame have abate a little and a tower have be bring up in a particular place and touch the rampart the centurion of the third cohort retire from the place in which they be stand and draw off all they man : they begin to call on the enemy by gesture and by word to enter if they wish but none of they dare to advance then stone have be cast from every quarter the enemy be dislodge and they tower set on fire xliv -- in that legion there be two very brave man centurion who be now approach the first rank t pulfio and l varenus these use to have continual dispute between they which of they should be prefer and every year use to contend for promotion with the utmost animosity when the fight be go on most vigorously before the fortification pulfio one of they say why do you hesitate varenus or what -lrb- better -rrb- opportunity of signalise you valor do you seek this very day shall decide we dispute when he have utter these word he proceed beyond the fortification and rush on that part of the enemy which appear the thickest nor do varenus remain within the rampart but respect the high opinion of all follow close after then when a inconsiderable space intervene pulfio throw he javelin at the enemy and pierce one of the multitude who be run up and while the latter be wound and slay the enemy cover he with they shield and all throw they weapon at the other and afford he no opportunity of retreat the shield of pulfio be pierce and a javelin be fasten in he belt this circumstance turn aside he scabbard and obstruct he right hand when attempt to draw he sword : the enemy crowd around he when -lrb- thus -rrb- embarrass he rival run up to he and succor he in this emergency immediately the whole host turn from pulfio to he suppose the other to be pierce through by the javelin varenus rush on briskly with he sword and carry on the combat hand to hand and have slay one man for a short time drive back the rest : while he urge on too eagerly slip into a hollow he fall to he in he turn when surround pulfio bring relief and both have slay a great number retreat into the fortification amidst the highest applause fortune so deal with both in this rivalry and conflict that the one competitor be a succor and a safeguard to the other nor could it be determine which of the two appear worthy of be prefer to the other xlv -- in proportion as the attack become daily more formidable and violent and particularly because as a great number of the soldier be exhaust with wound the matter have come to a small number of defender more frequent letter and messenger be send to caesar a part of which messenger be take and tortured to death in the sight of we soldier there be within we camp a certain nervian by name vertico bear in a distinguished position who in the beginning of the blockade have desert to cicero and have exhibit he fidelity to he he persuade he slave by the hope of freedom and by great reward to convey a letter to caesar this he carry out bind about he javelin and mix among the gaul without any suspicion by be a gaul he reach caesar from he they receive information of the imminent danger of cicero and the legion xlvi -- caesar have receive the letter about the eleventh hour of the day immediately send a messenger to the bellovacus to m crassus questor there whose winter-quarter be twenty-five mile distant from he he order the legion to set forward in the middle of the night and come to he with despatch crassus set out with the messenger he send anther to c fabius the lieutenant order he to lead forth he legion into the territory of the atrebate to which he know he march must be make he write to labienus to come with he legion to the frontier of the nervius if he could do so to the advantage of the commonwealth : he do not consider that the remain portion of the army because it be somewhat farther distant should be wait for but assemble about 400 horse from the nearest winter-quarter xlvii -- have be apprise of the arrival of crassus by the scout at about the third hour he advance twenty mile that day he appoint crassus over samarobriva and assign he a legion because he be leave there the baggage of the army the hostage of the state the public document and all the corn which he have convey thither for pass the winter fabius without delay a moment meet he on the march with he legion as he have be command labienus have learn the death of sabinus and the destruction of the cohort as all the force of the trevirus have come against he begin to fear lest if he make a departure from he winter-quarter resemble a flight he should not be able to support the attack of the enemy particularly since he know they to be elate by they recent victory send back a letter to caesar inform he with what great hazard he would lead out he legion from winter-quarter he relate at large the affair which have take place among the eburone he inform he that all the infantry and cavalry of the trevirus have encamp at a distance of only three mile from he own camp xlviii -- caesar approve of he motive although he be disappoint in he expectation of three legion and reduce to two yet place he only hope of the common safety in despatch he go into the territory of the nervius by long march there he learn from some prisoner what thing be go on in the camp of cicero and in how great jeopardy the affair be then with great reward he induce a certain man of the gallic horse to convey a letter to cicero this he send write in greek character lest the letter be intercept we measure should be discover by the enemy he direct he if he should be unable to enter to throw he spear with the letter fasten to the thong inside the fortification of the camp he write in the letter that he have set out with he legion will quickly be there : he entreat he to maintain he ancient valor the gaul apprehend danger throw he spear as he have be direct it by chance stick in a tower and not be observe by we man for two day be see by a certain soldier on the third day : when take down it be carry to cicero he after peruse it read it out in a assembly of the soldier and fill all with the greatest joy then the smoke of the fire be see in the distance a circumstance which banish all doubt of the arrival of the legion xlix -- the gaul have discover the matter through they scout abandon the blockade and march towards caesar with all they force : these be about 60000 armed man cicero a opportunity be now afford again beg of that vertico the gaul whom we mention above to convey back a letter to caesar he advise he to perform he journey warily he write in the letter that the enemy have depart and have turn they entire force against he when this letter be bring to he about the middle of the night caesar apprise he soldier of its contents and inspire they with courage for fighting : the follow day at the dawn he move he camp and have proceed four mile he espy the force of the enemy on the other side of a considerable valley and rivulet it be a affair of great danger to fight with such large force in a disadvantageous situation for the present therefore inasmuch as he know that cicero be release from the blockade and think that he might on that account relax he speed he halt there and fortify a camp in the most favourable position he can and this though it be small in itself -lrb- there be -rrb- scarcely 7000 man and these too without baggage still by the narrowness of the passage he contract as much as he can with this object that he may come into the greatest contempt with the enemy in the meanwhile scout have be send in all direction he examine by what most convenient path he might cross the valley l -- that day slight skirmish of cavalry have take place near the river both army keep in they own position : the gaul because they be await larger force which have not then arrive caesar -lrb- to see -rrb- if perchance by pretence of fear he could allure the enemy towards he position so that he might engage in battle in front of he camp on this side of the valley if he could not accomplish this that have inquire about the pass he might cross the valley and the river with the less hazard at day-break the cavalry of the enemy approach to the camp and join battle with we horse caesar order the horse to give way purposely and retreat to the camp : at the same time he order the camp to be fortify with a higher rampart in all direction the gate to be barricade and in execute these thing as much confusion to be show as possible and to perform they under the pretence of fear li -- induce by all these thing the enemy lead over they force and draw up they line in a disadvantageous position and as we man also have be lead down from the rampart they approach nearer and throw they weapon into the fortification from all side and send herald round order it to be proclaim that if any either gaul or roman be willing to go over to they before the third hour it be permit after that time there would not be permission and so much do they disregard we man that the gate have be block up with single row of turf as a mere appearance because they do not seem able to burst in that way some begin to pull down the rampart with they hand other to fill up the trench then caesar make a sally from all the gate and send out the cavalry soon put the enemy to flight so that no one at all stand he ground with the intention of fight and he slew a great number of they and deprive all of they arm lii -- caesar fear to pursue they very far because wood and morass intervene and also -lrb- because -rrb- he see that they suffer no small loss in abandon they position reach cicero the same day with all he force safe he witness with surprise the tower mantlet and -lrb- other -rrb- fortification belong to the enemy : the legion have be draw out he find that even every tenth soldier have not escape without wound from all these thing he judge with what danger and with what great courage matter have be conduct he commend cicero accord to he desert and likewise the legion he address individually the centurion and the tribune of the soldier whose valor he have discover to have be signal he receive information of the death of sabinus and cotta from the prisoner a assembly be hold the follow day he state the occurrence he console and encourage the soldier he suggest that the disaster which have be occasion by the misconduct and rashness of he lieutenant should be bear with a patient mind because by the favor of the immortal god and they own valor neither be lasting joy leave to the enemy nor very lasting grief to they liii -- in the meanwhile the report respect the victory of caesar be convey to labienus through the country of the remus with incredible speed so that though he be about sixty mile distant from the winter-quarter of cicero and caesar have arrive there after the ninth hour before midnight a shout arise at the gate of the camp by which shout a indication of the victory and a congratulation on the part of the remus be give to labienus this report have be carry to the trevirus indutiormarus who have resolve to attack the camp of labienus the follow day fly by night and lead back all he force into the country of the trevirus caesar send back fabius with he legion to he winter-quarter he himself determine to winter with three legion near samarobriva in three different quarter and because such great commotion have arise in gaul he resolve to remain during the whole winter with the army himself for the disaster respect the death of sabinus have be circulate among they almost all the state of gaul be deliberate about war send messenger and embassy into all quarter inquire what further measure they should take and hold council by night in secluded place nor do any period of the whole winter pass over without fresh anxiety to caesar or without he receive some intelligence respect the meeting and commotion of the gaul among these he be inform by l roscius the lieutenant whom he have place over the thirteenth legion that large force of those state of the gaul which be call the armorica have assemble for the purpose of attack he and be not more than eight mile distant but intelligence respect the victory of caesar be carry -lrb- to they -rrb- have retreat in such a manner that they departure appear like a flight liv -- but caesar have summon to he the principal person of each state in one case by alarming they since he declare that he know what be go on and in another case by encourage they retain a great part of gaul in its allegiance the senone however which be a state eminently powerful and one of great influence among the gaul attempt by general design to slay cavarinus whom caesar have create king among they -lrb- whose brother moritasgus have hold the sovereignty at the period of the arrival of caesar in gaul and whose ancestor have also previously hold it -rrb- when he discover they plot and flee pursued he even to the frontier -lrb- of the state -rrb- and drive he from he kingdom and he home and after have send ambassador to caesar for the purpose of conclude a peace when he order all they senate to come to he do not obey that command so far do it operate among those barbarian people that there be find some to be the first to wage war and so great a change of inclination do it produce in all that except the aeduus and the remus whom caesar have always hold in especial honor the one people for they long standing and uniform fidelity towards the roman people the other for they late service in the gallic war there be scarcely a state which be not suspect by we and i do not know whether that ought much to be wonder at as well for several other reason as particularly because they who rank above all nation for prowess in war most keenly regret that they have lose so much of that reputation as to submit to command from the roman people lv -- but the trevirus and indutiomarus let no part of the entire winter pass without send ambassador across the rhine importune the state promise money and assert that as a large portion of we army have be cut off a much smaller portion remain however none of the german state could be induce to cross the rhine since they have twice essay it they say in the war with ariovistus and in the passage of the tenchtherus there that fortune be not to be tempt any more indutiomarus disappoint in this expectation nevertheless begin to raise troops and discipline they and procure horse from the neighbouring people and allure to he by great reward the outlaw and convict throughout gaul and such great influence have he already acquire for himself in gaul by these means that embassy be flock to he in all direction and seek publicly and privately he favor and friendship lvi -- when he perceive that they be come to he voluntarily that on the one side the senone and the carnute be stimulate by they consciousness of guilt on the other side the nervius and the aduatucus be prepare war against the roman and that force of volunteer would not be want to he if he begin to advance from he own territory he proclaim a armed council -lrb- this accord to the custom of the gaul be the commencement of war -rrb- at which by a common law all the youth be wont to assemble in arm whoever of they come last be kill in the sight of the whole assembly after be rack with every torture in that council he declare cingetorix the leader of the other faction he own son-in-law -lrb- whom we have above mention as have embrace the protection of caesar and never have desert he -rrb- a enemy and confiscate he property when these thing be finish he assert in the council that he invite by the senone and the carnute and several other state of gaul be about to march thither through the territory of the remus devastate they land and attack the camp of labienus : before he do that he inform they of what he desire to be do lvii -- labienus since he be confine himself within a camp strongly fortify by the nature of the ground and by art have no apprehension as to he own and the legion 's danger but be devise that he might throw away no opportunity of conduct the war successfully accordingly the speech of indutiomarus which he have deliver in the council have be make known -lrb- to he -rrb- by cingetorix and he ally he send messenger to the neighbouring state and summons horse from all quarter : he appoint to they a fixed day for assemble in the meantime indutiomarus with all he cavalry nearly every day use to parade close to he -lrb- labienus 's -rrb- camp at one time that he might inform himself of the situation of the camp at another time for the purpose of confer with or of intimidate he labienus confine he man within the fortification and promote the enemy 's belief of he fear by whatever method he could lviii -- since indutiomarus be daily advance up to the camp with greater defiance all the cavalry of the neighbouring state which he -lrb- labienus -rrb- have take care to have send for have be admit in one night he confine all he man within the camp by guard with such great strictness that that fact could by no means be report or carry to the trevirus in the meanwhile indutiomarus accord to he daily practice advance up to the camp and spend a great part of the day there : he horse cast they weapon and with very insulting language call out we man to battle no reply be give by we man the enemy when they think proper depart towards evening in a disorderly and scattered manner labienus unexpectedly send out all the cavalry by two gate he give this command and prohibition that when the enemy should be terrify and put to flight -lrb- which he foresee would happen as it do -rrb- they should all make for indutiomarus and no one wound any man before he should have see he slay because he be unwilling that he should escape in consequence of gain time by the delay -lrb- occasion by the pursuit -rrb- of the rest he offer great reward for those who should kill he : he send up the cohort as a relief to the horse the issue justify the policy of the man and since all aim at one indutiomarus be slay have be overtake at the very ford of the river and he head be carry to the camp : the horse when return pursue and slay all whom they can this affair have be know all the force of the eburone and the nervius which have assemble depart and for a short time after this action caesar be less harass in the government of gaul book vi i -- caesar expect for many reason a greater commotion in gaul resolve to hold a levy by the means of m silanus c antistius reginus and t sextius he lieutenant : at the same time he request of cn pompey the proconsul that since he be remain near the city invest with military command for the interest of the commonwealth he would command those man whom when consul he have levy by the military oath in cisalpine gaul to join they respective corps and to proceed to he think it of great importance as far as regard the opinion which the gaul would entertain for the future that the resource of italy should appear so great that if any loss should be sustain in war not only could it be repair in a short time but likewise be further supply by still larger force and when pompey have grant this to the interest of the commonwealth and the claim of friendship caesar have quickly complete the levy by means of he lieutenant after three legion have be both form and bring to he before the winter -lrb- have -rrb- expire and the number of those cohort which he have lose under q titurius have be double teach the gaul both by he dispatch and by he force what the discipline and the power of the roman people could accomplish ii -- indutiomarus have be slay as we have state the government be confer upon he relative by the trevirus they cease not to importune the neighbouring german and to promise they money : when they could not obtain -lrb- they object -rrb- from those nearest they they try those more remote have find some state willing to accede to they wish they enter into a compact with they by a mutual oath and give hostage as a security for the money : they attach ambiorix to they by a alliance and confederacy caesar on be inform of they act since he see that war be be prepare on all side that the nervius aduatucus and menapius with the addition of all the german on this side of the rhine be under arm that the senone do not assemble accord to he command and be concert measure with the carnute and the neighbouring state that the german be importune by the trevirus in frequent embassy think that he ought to take measure for the war earlier -lrb- than usual -rrb- iii-accordingly while the winter be not yet end have concentrate the four nearest legion he march unexpectedly into the territory of the nervius and before they could either assemble or retreat after capture a large number of cattle and of man and waste they land and give up that booty to the soldier compel they to enter into a surrender and give he hostage that business have be speedily execute he again lead he legion back into winter-quarter have proclaim a council of gaul in the beginning of the spring as he have be accustom -lrb- to do -rrb- when the deputy from the rest except the senone the carnute and the trevirus have come judge this to be the commencement of war and revolt that he might appear to consider all thing of less consequence -lrb- than that war -rrb- he transfer the council to lutetium of the parisius these be adjacent to the senone and have unite they state to they during the memory of they father but be think to have no part in the present plot have proclaim this from the tribunal he advance the same day towards the senone with he legion and arrive among they by long march iv -- acco who have be the author of that enterprise on be inform of he arrival order the people to assemble in the town to they while attempt this and before it could be accomplish news be bring that the roman be close at hand : through necessity they give over they design and send ambassador to caesar for the purpose of implore pardon they make advance to he through the aeduus whose state be from ancient time under the protection of rome caesar readily grant they pardon and receive they excuse at the request of the aeduus because he think that the summer season be one for a impending war not for a investigation have impose one hundred hostage he deliver these to the aeduus to be hold in charge by they to the same place the carnute send ambassador and hostage employ as they mediator the remus under whose protection they be : they receive the same answer caesar conclude the council and impose a levy of cavalry on the state v -- this part of gaul have be tranquillize he apply himself entirely both in mind and soul to the war with the trevirus and ambiorix he order cavarinus to march with he with the cavalry of the senone lest any commotion should arise either out of he hot temper or out of the hatred of the state which he have incur after arrange these thing as he consider it certain that ambiorix would not contend in battle he watch he other plan attentively the menapius border on the territory of the eburone and be protect by one continue extent of morass and wood and they alone out of gaul have never send ambassador to caesar on the subject of peace caesar know that a tie of hospitality subsist between they and ambiorix : he also discover that the latter have enter into a alliance with the german by means of the trevirus he think that these auxiliary ought to be detach from he before he provoke he to war lest he despair of safety should either proceed to conceal himself in the territory of the menapius or should be drive to coalesce with the german beyond the rhine have enter upon this resolution he send the baggage of the whole army to labienus in the territory of the trevirus and order two legion to proceed to he : he himself proceed against the menapius with five lightly-equipped legion they have assemble no troops as they rely on the defense of they position retreat into the wood and morass and convey thither all they property vi -- caesar have divide he force with c fabius he lieutenant and m crassus he questor and have hastily construct some bridge enter they country in three division burn they house and village and get possession of a large number of cattle and man constrain by these circumstance the menapius send ambassador to he for the purpose of sue for peace he after receive hostage assure they that he will consider they in the number of he enemy if they shall receive within they territory either ambiorix or he ambassador have determinately settle these thing he leave among the menapius commius the atrebatian with some cavalry as a guard he himself proceed toward the trevirus vii -- while these thing be be perform by caesar the trevirus have draw together large force of infantry and of cavalry be prepare to attack labienus and the legion which be winter in they territory and be already not further distant from he than a journey of two day when they learn that two legion have arrive by the order of caesar have pitch they camp fifteen mile off they resolve to await the support of the german labienus have learn the design of the enemy hope that through they rashness there would be some opportunity of engage after leave a guard of five cohort for the baggage advance against the enemy with twenty-five cohort and a large body of cavalry and leave the space of a mile between they fortify he camp there be between labienus and the enemy a river difficult to cross and with steep bank : this neither do he himself design to cross nor do he suppose the enemy would cross it they hope of auxiliary be daily increase he -lrb- labienus -rrb- openly say in a council that since the german be say to be approach he would not bring into uncertainty he own and the army 's fortune and the next day would move he camp at early dawn these word be quickly carry to the enemy since out of so large a number of cavalry compose of gaul nature compel some to favor the gallic interest labienus have assemble the tribune of the soldier and principal centurion by night state what he design be and that he may the more easily give the enemy a belief of he fear he order the camp to be move with greater noise and confusion than be usual with the roman people by these means he make he departure -lrb- appear -rrb- like a retreat these thing also since the camp be so near be report to the enemy by scout before daylight viii -- scarcely have the rear advanced beyond the fortification when the gaul encourage one another not to cast from they hand the anticipated booty that it be a tedious thing while the roman be panic stricken to be wait for the aid of the german and that they dignity do not suffer they to fear to attack with such great force so small a band particularly when retreat and encumber do not hesitate to cross the river and give battle in a disadvantageous position labienus suspect that these thing would happen be proceed quietly and use the same pretence of a march in order that he might entice they across the river then have send forward the baggage some short distance and place it on a certain eminence he say soldier you have the opportunity you have seek : you hold the enemy in a encumber and disadvantageous position : display to we you leader the same valor you have ofttime display to you general : imagine that he be present and actually see these exploit at the same time he order the troops to face about towards the enemy and form in line of battle and despatch a few troops of cavalry as a guard for the bag gage he place the rest of the horse on the wing we man raise a shout quickly throw they javelin at the enemy they when contrary to they expectation they see those whom they believe to be retreat advance towards they with threaten banner be not able to sustain even the charge and be put to flight at the first onslaught seek the nearest wood : labienus pursue they with the cavalry upon a large number be slay and several take prisoner get possession of the state a few day after for the german who be come to the aid of the trevirus have be inform of they flight retreat to they home the relation of indutiomarus who have be the promoter of the revolt accompany they quit they own state with they the supreme power and government be deliver to cingetorix whom we have state to have remain firm in he allegiance from the commencement ix -- caesar after he come from the territory of the menapius into those of the trevirus resolve for two reason to cross the rhine one of which be because they have send assistance to the trevirus against he the other that ambiorix might not have a retreat among they have determine on these matter he begin to build a bridge a little above that place at which he have before convey over he army the plan have be know and lay down the work be accomplish in a few day by the great exertion of the soldier have leave a strong guard at the bridge on the side of the trevirus lest any commotion should suddenly arise among they he lead over the rest of the force and the cavalry the ubius who before have send hostage and come to a capitulation send ambassador to he for the purpose of vindicate themselves to assure he that neither have auxiliary be send to the trevirus from they state nor have they violate they allegiance they entreat and beseech he to spare they lest in he common hatred of the german the innocent should suffer the penalty of the guilty : they promise to give more hostage if he desire they have investigate the case caesar find that the auxiliary have be send by the suevus he accept the apology of the ubius and make minute inquiry concern the approach and the route to the territory of the suevus x -- in the meanwhile he be inform by the ubius a few day after that the suevus be draw all they force into one place and be give order to those nation which be under they government to send auxiliary of infantry and of cavalry have learn these thing he provide a supply of corn select a proper place for he camp and command the ubius to drive off they cattle and carry away all they possession from the country part into the town hope that they be a barbarous and ignorant people when harass by the want of provision might be bring to a engagement on disadvantageous term : he order they to send numerous scout among the suevus and learn what thing be go on among they they execute the order and a few day have intervene report that all the suevus after certain intelligence concern the army of the roman have come retreat with all they own force and those of they ally which they have assemble to the utmost extremity of they territory : that there be a wood there of very great extent which be call baceni that this stretch a great way into the interior and be oppose as a natural barrier defend from injury and incursion the cheruscus against the suevus and the suevus against the cheruscus : that at the entrance of that forest the suevus have determine to await the come up of the roman xi -- since we have come to this place it do not appear to be foreign to we subject to lay before the reader a account of the manners of gaul and germany and wherein these nation differ from each other in gaul there be faction not only in all the state and in all the canton and they division but almost in each family and of these faction those be the leader who be consider accord to they judgment to possess the greatest influence upon whose will and determination the management of all affair and measure depend and that seem to have be institute in ancient time with this view that no one of the common people should be in want of support against one more powerful for none -lrb- of those leader -rrb- suffer he party to be oppress and defraud and if he do otherwise he have no influence among he party this same policy exist throughout the whole of gaul for all the state be divide into two faction xii -- when caesar arrive in gaul the aeduus be the leader of one faction the sequanus of the other since the latter be less powerful by themselves inasmuch as the chief influence be from of old among the aeduus and they dependency be great they have unite to themselves the german and ariovistus and have bring they over to they party by great sacrifice and promise and have fight several successful battle and slay all the nobility of the aeduus they have so far surpass they in power that they bring over from the aeduus to themselves a large portion of they dependant and receive from they the son of they lead man as hostage and compel they to swear in they public character that they would enter into no design against they and hold a portion of the neighbouring land seize on by force and possess the sovereignty of the whole of gaul divitiacus urge by this necessity have proceed to rome to the senate for the purpose of entreat assistance and have return without accomplish he object a change of affair ensue on the arrival of caesar the hostage be return to the aeduus they old dependency restore and new acquire through caesar -lrb- because those who have attach themselves to they alliance see that they enjoy a better state and a milder government -rrb- they other interest they influence they reputation be likewise increase and in consequence the sequanus lose the sovereignty the remus succeed to they place and as it be perceive that they equal the aeduus in favor with caesar those who on account of they old animosity could by no means coalesce with the aeduus consign themselves in clientship to the remus the latter carefully protect they thus they possess both a new and suddenly acquire influence affair be then in that position that the aeduus be consider by far the lead people and the remus hold the second post of honor xiii -- throughout all gaul there be two order of those man who be of any rank and dignity : for the commonality be hold almost in the condition of slave and dare to undertake nothing of itself and be admit to no deliberation the greater part when they be press either by debt or the large amount of they tribute or the oppression of the more powerful give themselves up in vassalage to the noble who possess over they the same rights without exception as master over they slave but of these two order one be that of the druid the other that of the knight the former be engage in thing sacred conduct the public and the private sacrifice and interpret all matter of religion to these a large number of the young man resort for the purpose of instruction and they -lrb- the druid -rrb- be in great honor among they for they determine respect almost all controversy public and private and if any crime have be perpetrate if murder have be commit if there be any dispute about a inheritance if any about boundary these same person decide it they decree reward and punishment if any one either in a private or public capacity have not submit to they decision they interdict he from the sacrifice this among they be the most heavy punishment those who have be thus interdict be esteem in the number of the impious and the criminal : all shun they and avoid they society and conversation lest they receive some evil from they contact nor be justice administer to they when seek it nor be any dignity bestow on they over all these druid one preside who possess supreme authority among they upon he death if any individual among the rest be pre-eminent in dignity he succeed but if there be many equal the election be make by the suffrage of the druid sometimes they even contend for the presidency with arm these assemble at a fixed period of the year in a consecrate place in the territory of the carnute which be reckon the central region of the whole of gaul hither all who have dispute assemble from every part and submit to they decree and determination this institution be suppose to have be devise in britain and to have be bring over from it into gaul and now those who desire to gain a more accurate knowledge of that system generally proceed thither for the purpose of study it xiv -- the druid do not go to war nor pay tribute together with the rest they have a exemption from military service and a dispensation in all matter induce by such great advantage many embrace this profession of they own accord and -lrb- many -rrb- be send to it by they parent and relation they be say there to learn by heart a great number of verse accordingly some remain in the course of training twenty year nor do they regard it lawful to commit these to write though in almost all other matter in they public and private transaction they use greek character that practice they seem to I to have adopt for two reason because they neither desire they doctrine to be divulge among the mass of the people nor those who learn to devote themselves the less to the effort of memory rely on write since it generally occur to most man that in they dependence on write they relax they diligence in learn thoroughly and they employment of the memory they wish to inculcate this as one of they lead tenet that soul do not become extinct but pass after death from one body to another and they think that man by this tenet be in a great degree excite to valor the fear of death be disregard they likewise discuss and impart to the youth many thing respect the star and they motion respect the extent of the world and of we earth respect the nature of thing respect the power and the majesty of the immortal god xv -- the other order be that of the knight these when there be occasion and any war occur -lrb- which before caesar 's arrival be for the most part wont to happen every year as either they on they part be inflict injury or repel those which other inflict on they -rrb- be all engage in war and those of they most distinguish by birth and resource have the greatest number of vassal and dependant about they they acknowledge this sort of influence and power only xvi -- the nation of all the gaul be extremely devote to superstitious rite and on that account they who be trouble with unusually severe disease and they who be engage in battle and danger either sacrifice man as victim or vow that they will sacrifice they and employ the druid as the performer of those sacrifice because they think that unless the life of a man be offer for the life of a man the mind of the immortal god can not be render propitious and they have sacrifice of that kind ordain for national purpose other have figure of vast size the limb of which form of osier they fill with live man which be set on fire the man perish envelop in the flame they consider that the oblation of such as have be take in theft or in robbery or any other offence be more acceptable to the immortal god but when a supply of that class be want they have recourse to the oblation of even the innocent xvii -- they worship as they divinity mercury in particular and have many image of he and regard he as the inventor of all art they consider he the guide of they journey and march and believe he to have very great influence over the acquisition of gain and mercantile transaction next to he they worship apollo and mar and jupiter and minerva respect these deity they have for the most part the same belief as other nation : that apollo avert disease that minerva impart the invention of manufacture that jupiter possess the sovereignty of the heavenly power that mar preside over war to he when they have determine to engage in battle they commonly vow those thing they shall take in war when they have conquer they sacrifice whatever capture animal may have survive the conflict and collect the other thing into one place in many state you may see pile of these thing heap up in they consecrate spot nor do it often happen that any one disregard the sanctity of the case dare either to secrete in he house thing capture or take away those deposit and the most severe punishment with torture have be establish for such a deed xviii -- all the gaul assert that they be descend from the god di and say that this tradition have be hand down by the druid for that reason they compute the division of every season not by the number of day but of night they keep birthday and the beginning of month and year in such a order that the day follow the night among the other usage of they life they differ in this from almost all other nation that they do not permit they child to approach they openly until they be grow up so as to be able to bear the service of war and they regard it as indecorous for a son of boyish age to stand in public in the presence of he father xix -- whatever sum of money the husband have receive in the name of dowry from they wife make a estimate of it they add the same amount out of they own estate a account be keep of all this money conjointly and the profit be lay by : whichever of they shall have survive -lrb- the other -rrb- to that one the portion of both revert together with the profit of the previous time husband have power of life and death over they wife as well as over they child : and when the father of a family bear in a more than commonly distinguish rank have die he relation assemble and if the circumstance of he death be suspicious hold a investigation upon the wife in the manner adopt towards slave and if proof be obtain put they to severe torture and kill they they funeral consider the state of civilization among the gaul be magnificent and costly and they cast into the fire all thing include live creature which they suppose to have be dear to they when alive and a little before this period slave and dependant who be ascertain to have be beloved by they be after the regular funeral rite be complete burn together with they xx -- those state which be consider to conduct they commonwealth more judiciously have it ordain by they law that if any person shall have hear by rumor and report from he neighbor anything concern the commonwealth he shall convey it to the magistrate and not impart it to any other because it have be discover that inconsiderate and inexperienced man be often alarm by false report and drive to some rash act or else take hasty measure in affair of the highest importance the magistrate conceal those thing which require to be keep unknown and they disclose to the people whatever they determine to be expedient it be not lawful to speak of the commonwealth except in council xxi -- the german differ much from these usage for they have neither druid to preside over sacred office nor do they pay great regard to sacrifice they rank in the number of the god those alone whom they behold and by whose instrumentality they be obviously benefit namely the sun fire and the moon they have not hear of the other deity even by report they whole life be occupy in hunting and in the pursuit of the military art from childhood they devote themselves to fatigue and hardship those who have remain chaste for the longest time receive the greatest commendation among they people : they think that by this the growth be promote by this the physical power be increase and the sinew be strengthened and to have have knowledge of a woman before the twentieth year they reckon among the most disgraceful act of which matter there be no concealment because they bathe promiscuously in the river and -lrb- only -rrb- use skin or small cloak of deer ' hide a large portion of the body be in consequence naked xxii -- they do not pay much attention to agriculture and a large portion of they food consist in milk cheese and flesh nor have any one a fix quantity of land or he own individual limit but the magistrate and the lead man each year apportion to the tribe and family who have unite together as much land as and in the place in which they think proper and the year after compel they to remove elsewhere for this enactment they advance many reason -- lest seduce by long-continued custom they may exchange they ardor in the wage of war for agriculture lest they may be anxious to acquire extensive estate and the more powerful drive the weaker from they possession lest they construct they house with too great a desire to avoid cold and heat lest the desire of wealth spring up from which cause division and discord arise and that they may keep the common people in a contented state of mind when each see he own means place on a equality with -lrb- those of -rrb- the most powerful xxiii -- it be the greatest glory to the several state to have as wide desert as possible around they they frontier have be lay waste they consider this the real evidence of they prowess that they neighbor shall be drive out of they land and abandon they and that no one dare settle near they at the same time they think that they shall be on that account the more secure because they have remove the apprehension of a sudden incursion when a state either repel war wage against it or wages it against another magistrate be choose to preside over that war with such authority that they have power of life and death in peace there be no common magistrate but the chief of province and canton administer justice and determine controversy among they own people robbery which be commit beyond the boundary of each state bear no infamy and they avow that these be commit for the purpose of discipline they youth and of prevent sloth and when any of they chief have say in a assembly that he will be they leader let those who be willing to follow give in they name they who approve of both the enterprise and the man arise and promise they assistance and be applaud by the people such of they as have not follow he be account in the number of deserter and traitor and confidence in all matter be afterwards refuse they to injure guest they regard as impious they defend from wrong those who have come to they for any purpose whatever and esteem they inviolable to they the house of all be open and maintenance be freely supply xxiv -- and there be formerly a time when the gaul excel the german in prowess and wage war on they offensively and on account of the great number of they people and the insufficiency of they land send colony over the rhine accordingly the volcae tectosage seize on those part of germany which be the most fruitful -lrb- and lie -rrb- around the hercynian forest -lrb- which i perceive be know by report to eratosthene and some other greek and which they call orcynium -rrb- and settle there which nation to this time retain its position in those settlement and have a very high character for justice and military merit : now also they continue in the same scarcity indigence hardihood as the german and use the same food and dress but they proximity to the province and knowledge of commodity from country beyond the sea supply to the gaul many thing tend to luxury as well as civilization accustom by degree to be overmatch and worst in many engagement they do not even compare themselves to the german in prowess xxv -- the breadth of this hercynian forest which have be refer to above be to a quick traveller a journey of nine day for it can not be otherwise compute nor be they acquaint with the measure of road it begin at the frontier of the helvetii nemete and rauracus and extend in a right line along the river danube to the territory of the dacus and the anarte : it bend thence to the leave in a different direction from the river and owe to its extent touch the confines of many nation nor be there any person belong to this part of germany who say that he either have go to the extremity of that forest though he have advance a journey of sixty day or have hear in what place it begin it be certain that many kind of wild beast be produce in it which have not be see in other part of which the follow be such as differ principally from other animal and appear worthy of be commit to record xxvi -- there be a ox of the shape of a stag between whose ear a horn rise from the middle of the forehead higher and straighter than those horn which be know to we from the top of this branch like palm stretch out a considerable distance the shape of the female and of the male be the same the appearance and the size of the horn be the same xxvii -- there be also -lrb- animal -rrb- which be call elk the shape of these and the varied color of they skin be much like roe but in size they surpass they a little and be destitute of horn and have leg without joint and ligature nor do they lie down for the purpose of rest nor if they have be throw down by any accident can they raise or lift themselves up tree serve as bed to they they lean themselves against they and thus recline only slightly they take they rest when the huntsman have discover from the footstep of these animal whither they be accustom to betake themselves they either undermine all the tree at the root or cut into they so far that the upper part of the tree may appear to be leave stand when they have lean upon they accord to they habit they knock down by they weight the unsupported tree and fall down themselves along with they xxviii-there be a third kind consist of those animal which be call urus these be a little below the elephant in size and of the appearance color and shape of a bull they strength and speed be extraordinary they spare neither man nor wild beast which they have espy these the german take with much pain in pit and kill they the young man harden themselves with this exercise and practice themselves in this kind of hunting and those who have slay the greatest number of they have produce the horn in public to serve as evidence receive great praise but not even when take very young can they be render familiar to man and tame the size shape and appearance of they horn differ much from the horn of we ox these they anxiously seek after and bind at the tip with silver and use as cup at they most sumptuous entertainment xxix -- caesar after he discover through the ubian scout that the suevus have retire into they wood apprehend a scarcity of corn because as we have observe above all the german pay very little attention to agriculture resolve not to proceed any farther but that he might not altogether relieve the barbarian from the fear of he return and that he might delay they succor have lead back he army he break down to the length of 200 foot the farther end of the bridge which join the bank of the ubius and at the extremity of the bridge raise tower of four story and station a guard of twelve cohort for the purpose of defend the bridge and strengthen the place with considerable fortification over that fort and guard he appoint c volcatius tullus a young man he himself when the corn begin to ripen have set forth for the war with 40 ambiorix -lrb- through the forest arduenna which be the largest of all gaul and reach from the bank of the rhine and the frontier of the trevirus to those of the nervius and extend over more than 500 mile -rrb- he send forward l minucius basilus with all the cavalry to try if he might gain any advantage by rapid march and the advantage of time he warn he to forbid fire be make in the camp lest any indication of he approach be give at a distance : he tell he that he will follow immediately xxx -- basilus do as he be command have perform he march rapidly and even surpass the expectation of all he surprise in the field many not expect he through they information he advance towards ambiorix himself to the place in which he be say to be with a few horse fortune accomplish much not only in other matter but also in the art of war for as it happen by a remarkable chance that he fall upon -lrb- ambiorix -rrb- himself unguarded and unprepared and that he arrival be see by the people before the report or information of he arrival be carry thither so it be a incident of extraordinary fortune that although every implement of war which he be accustom to have about he be seize and he chariot and horse surprise yet he himself escape death but it be effect owe to this circumstance that he house be surround by a wood -lrb- as be generally the dwelling of the gaul who for the purpose of avoid heat mostly seek the neighborhood of wood and river -rrb- he attendant and friend in a narrow spot sustain for a short time the attack of we horse while they be fight one of he follower mount he on a horse : the wood sheltered he as he flee thus fortune tend much both towards he encounter and he escape danger xxxi -- whether ambiorix do not collect he force from cool deliberation because he consider he ought not to engage in a battle or -lrb- whether -rrb- he be debar by time and prevent by the sudden arrival of we horse when he suppose the rest of the army be closely follow be doubtful but certainly despatch messenger through the country he order every one to provide for himself and a part of they flee into the forest arduenna a part into the extensive morass those who be nearest the ocean conceal themselves in the island which the tide usually form many depart from they territory commit themselves and all they possession to perfect stranger cativolcus king of one-half of the eburone who have enter into the design together with ambiorix since be now wear out by age he be unable to endure the fatigue either of war or flight have curse ambiorix with every imprecation as the person who have be the contriver of that measure destroy himself with the juice of the yew tree of which there be a great abundance in gaul and germany xxxii -- the seguus and condrusus of the nation and number of the german and who be between the eburone and the trevirus send ambassador to caesar to entreat that he would not regard they in the number of he enemy nor consider that the cause of all the german on this side the rhine be one and the same that they have form no plan of war and have send no auxiliary to ambiorix caesar have ascertain this fact by a examination of he prisoner command that if any of the eburone in they flight have repair to they they should be send back to he he assure they that if they do that he will not injure they territory then have divide he force into three part he send the baggage of all the legion to aduatuca that be the name of a fort this be nearly in the middle of the eburone where titurius and aurunculeius have be quarter for the purpose of wintering this place he select as well on other account as because the fortification of the previous year remain in order that he might relieve the labor of the soldier he leave the fourteenth legion as a guard for the baggage one of those three which he have lately raise in italy and bring over over that legion and camp he place q tullius cicero and give he 200 horse xxxiii -- have divide the army he order t labienus to proceed with three legion towards the ocean into those part which border on the menappius he send c trebonius with a like number of legion to lay waste that district which lie contiguous to the aduatucus he himself determine to go with the remain three to the river sambre which flow into the meuse and to the most remote part of arduenna whither he hear that ambiorix have go with a few horse when depart he promise that he will return before the end of the seventh day on which day he be aware corn be due to that legion which be be leave in garrison he direct labienus and trebonius to return by the same day if they can do so agreeably to the interest of the republic so that they measure have be mutually impart and the plan of the enemy have be discover they might be able to commence a different line of operation xxxiv -- there be as we have above observe no regular army nor a town nor a garrison which could defend itself by arm but the people be scatter in all direction where either a hidden valley or a woody spot or a difficult morass furnish any hope of protection or of security to any one there he have fix himself these place be know to those that dwell in the neighborhood and the matter demand great attention not so much in protect the main body of the army -lrb- for no peril could occur to they altogether from those alarmed and scattered troops -rrb- as in preserve individual soldier which in some measure tend to the safety of the army for both the desire of booty be lead many too far and the wood with they unknown and hidden route would not allow they to go in large body if he desire the business to be complete and the race of those infamous people to be cut off more body of man must be send in several direction and the soldier must be detach on all side if he be dispose to keep the company at they standard as the established discipline and practice of the roman army require the situation itself be a safeguard to the barbarian nor be there want to individual the daring to lay secret ambuscade and beset scattered soldier but amidst difficulty of this nature as far as precaution could be take by vigilance such precaution be take so that some opportunity of injure the enemy be neglect though the mind of all be burn to take revenge rather than that injury should be effect with any loss to we soldier caesar despatch messenger to the neighbouring state by the hope of booty he invite all to he for the purpose of plunder the eburone in order that the life of the gaul might be hazard in the wood rather than the legionary soldier at the same time in order that a large force be draw around they the race and name of that state may be annihilate for such a crime a large number from all quarter speedily assemble xxxv -- these thing be go on in all part of the territory of the eburone and the seventh day be draw near by which day caesar have purpose to return to the baggage and the legion here it might be learn how much fortune achieve in war and how great casualty she produce the enemy have be scatter and alarm as we related above there be no force which might produce even a slight occasion of fear the report extend beyond the rhine to the german that the eburone be be pillage and that all be without distinction invite to the plunder the sigambrus who be nearest to the rhine by whom we have mention above the tenchtherus and usipete be receive after they retreat collect 2000 horse they cross the rhine in ship and bark thirty mile below that place where the bridge be entire and the garrison leave by caesar they arrive at the frontier of the eburone surprise many who be scatter in flight and get possession of a large amount of cattle of which barbarian be extremely covetous allure by booty they advance farther neither morass nor forest obstruct these man bear amidst war and depredation they inquire of they prisoner in what part caesar be they find that he have advance farther and learn that all the army have remove thereon one of the prisoner say why do you pursue such wretched and trifling spoil you to whom it be grant to become even now most richly endowed by fortune in three hour you can reach aduatuca there the roman army have deposit all its fortune there be so little of a garrison that not even the wall can be man nor dare any one go beyond the fortification a hope have be present they the german leave in concealment the plunder they have acquire they themselves hasten to aduatuca employ as they guide the same man by whose information they have become inform of these thing xxxvi -- cicero who during all the foregoing day have keep he soldier in camp with the greatest exactness and agreeably to the injunction of caesar have not permit even any of the camp-follower to go beyond the fortification distrust on the seventh day that caesar would keep he promise as to the number of day because he hear that he have proceed farther and no report as to he return be bring to he and be urge at the same time by the expression of those who call he tolerance almost a siege if forsooth it be not permit they to go out of the camp since he might expect no disaster whereby he could be injure within three mile of the camp while nine legion and all the cavalry be under arm and the enemy scatter and almost annihilate send five cohort into the neighbouring cornland between which and the camp only one hill intervene for the purpose of forage many soldier of the legion have be leave invalide in the camp of whom those who have recover in this space of time be about 300 be set together under one standard a large number of soldier ' attendant besides with a great number of beast of burden which have remain in the camp permission be grant follow they xxxvii -- at this very time the german horse by chance come up and immediately with the same speed with which they have advance attempt to force the camp at the decuman gate nor be they see in consequence of wood lie in the way on that side before they be just reach the camp : so much so that the sutler who have they booth under the rampart have not a opportunity of retreat within the camp we man not anticipate it be perplex by the sudden affair and the cohort on the outpost scarcely sustain the first attack the enemy spread themselves on the other side to ascertain if they could find any access we man with difficulty defend the gate the very position of itself and the fortification secure the other access there be a panic in the entire camp and one inquire of another the cause of the confusion nor do they readily determine whither the standard should be bear nor into what quarter each should betake himself one avow that the camp be already take another maintain that the enemy have destroy the army and commander-in-chief be come thither as conqueror most form strange superstitious fancy from the spot and place before they eye the catastrophe of cotta and titurius who have fall in the same fort all be greatly disconcert by this alarm the belief of the barbarian be strengthen that there be no garrison within as they have hear from they prisoner they endeavor to force a entrance and encourage one another not to cast from they hand so valuable a prize xxxviii-p sextius baculus who have lead a principal century under caesar -lrb- of whom we have make mention in previous engagement -rrb- have be leave a invalid in the garrison and have now be five day without food he distrust he own safety and that of all go forth from he tent unarmed he see that the enemy be close at hand and that the matter be in the utmost danger he snatch arm from those nearest and station himself at the gate the centurion of that cohort which be on guard follow he for a short time they sustain the fight together sextius faint after receive many wound he be with difficulty save draw away by the hand of the soldier this space have intervene the other resume courage so far as to venture to take they place on the fortification and present the aspect of defender xxxix -- the forage have in the meantime be complete we soldier distinctly hear the shout the horse hasten on before and discover in what danger the affair be but here there be no fortification to receive they in they alarm : those last enlist and unskilled in military discipline turn they face to the military tribune and the centurion they wait to find what order may be give by they no one be so courageous as not to be disconcert by the suddenness of the affair the barbarian espy we standard in the distance desist from the attack at first they suppose that the legion which they have learn from they prisoner have remove farther off have return afterwards despise they small number they make a attack on they at all side xl-the camp-follower run forward to the nearest rise ground be speedily drive from this they throw themselves among the standard and company : they thus so much the more alarm the soldier already affright some propose that form a wedge they suddenly break through since the camp be so near and if any part should be surround and slay they fully trust that at least the rest may be save other that they take they stand on a eminence and all undergo the same destiny the veteran soldier whom we state to have set out together -lrb- with the other -rrb- under a standard do not approve of this therefore encouraging each other under the conduct of caius trebonius a roman knight who have be appoint over they they break through the midst of the enemy and arrive in the camp safe to a man the camp-attendant and the horse follow close upon they with the same impetuosity be save by the courage of the soldier but those who have take they stand upon the eminence have even now acquire no experience of military matter neither could persevere in that resolution which they approve of namely to defend themselves from they higher position nor imitate that vigor and speed which they have observe to have avail other but attempt to reach the camp have descend into a unfavourable situation the centurion some of whom have be promote for they valor from the lower rank of other legion to higher rank in this legion in order that they might not forfeit they glory for military exploit previously acquire fall together fight most valiantly the enemy have be dislodge by they valor a part of the soldier arrive safe in camp contrary to they expectation a part perish surround by the barbarian xli -- the german despair of take the camp by storm because they see that we man have take up they position on the fortification retreat beyond the rhine with that plunder which they have deposit in the wood and so great be the alarm even after the departure of the enemy that when c volusenus who have be send with the cavalry arrive that night he could not gain credence that caesar be close at hand with he army safe fear have so pre-occupied the mind of all that they reason be almost estrange they say that all the other force have be cut off the cavalry alone have arrive there by flight and assert that if the army be safe the german would not have attack the camp : which fear the arrival of caesar remove xlii -- he on he return be well aware of the casualty of war complain of one thing -lrb- only -rrb- namely that the cohort have be send away from the outpost and garrison -lrb- duty -rrb- and point out that room ought not to have be leave for even the most trivial casualty that fortune have exercise great influence in the sudden arrival of they enemy much greater in that she have turn the barbarian away from the very rampart and gate of the camp of all which event it seem the most surprising that the german who have cross the rhine with this object that they might plunder the territory of ambiorix be lead to the camp of the roman render ambiorix a most acceptable service xliii -- caesar have again march to harass the enemy after collect a large number -lrb- of auxiliary -rrb- from the neighbouring state despatch they in all direction all the village and all the building which each beheld be on fire : spoil be be drive off from all part the corn not only be be consume by so great number of cattle and man but also have fall to the earth owe to the time of the year and the storm so that if any have conceal themselves for the present still it appear likely that they must perish through want of all thing when the army should be draw off and frequently it come to that point as so large a body of cavalry have be send abroad in all direction that the prisoner declare ambiorix have just then be see by they in flight and have not even pass out of sight so that the hope of overtake he be raise and unbounded exertion have be resort to those who think they should acquire the highest favor with caesar nearly overcome nature by they ardor and continually a little only seem want to complete success but he rescue himself by -lrb- means of -rrb- lurking-place and forest and conceal by the night make for other district and quarter with no greater guard than that of four horseman to whom alone he venture to confide he life xliv -- have devastate the country in such a manner caesar lead back he army with the loss of two cohort to durocortorum of the remus and have summon a council of gaul to assemble at that place he resolve to hold a investigation respect the conspiracy of the senone and carnute and have pronounce a most severe sentence upon acco who have be the contriver of that plot he punish he after the custom of we ancestor some fear a trial flee when he have forbid these fire and water he station in winter quarter two legion at the frontier of the trevirus two among the lingone the remain six at agendicum in the territory of the senone and have provide corn for the army he set out for italy as he have determine to hold the assizes book vii i -- gaul be tranquil caesar as he have determine set out for italy to hold the provincial assizes there he receive intelligence of the death of clodius and be inform of the decree of the senate -lrb- to the effect -rrb- that all the youth of italy should take the military oath he determine to hold a levy throughout the entire province report of these event be rapidly bear into transalpine gaul the gaul themselves add to the report and invent what the case seem to require -lrb- namely -rrb- that caesar be detain by commotion in the city and could not amidst so violent dissension come to he army animated by this opportunity they who already previously to this occurrence be indignant that they be reduce beneath the dominion of rome begin to organize they plan for war more openly and daringly the lead man of gaul have convene council among themselves in the wood and retire place complain of the death of acco : they point out that this fate may fall in turn on themselves : they bewail the unhappy fate of gaul and by every sort of promise and reward they earnestly solicit some to begin the war and assert the freedom of gaul at the hazard of they life they say that special care should be pay to this that caesar should be cut off from he army before they secret plan should be divulge that this be easy because neither would the legion in the absence of they general dare to leave they winter quarter nor could the general reach he army without a guard : finally that it be better to be slay in battle than not to recover they ancient glory in war and that freedom which they have receive from they forefather ii -- whilst these thing be in agitation the carnute declare that they would decline no danger for the sake of the general safety and promise that they would be the first of all to begin the war and since they can not at present take precaution by give and receive hostage that the affair shall not be divulge they require that a solemn assurance be give they by oath and plighted honor they military standard be bring together -lrb- in which manner they most sacred obligation be make binding -rrb- that they should not be desert by the rest of the gaul on commence the war iii -- when the appoint day come the carnute under the command of cotuatus and conetodunus desperate man meet together at genabum and slay the roman citizen who have settle there for the purpose of trading -lrb- among the rest caius fusius cita a distinguished roman knight who by caesar 's order have preside over the provision department -rrb- and plunder they property the report be quickly spread among all the state of gaul for whenever a more important and remarkable event take place they transmit the intelligence through they land and district by a shout the other take it up in succession and pass it to they neighbor as happen on this occasion for the thing which be do at genabum at sunrise be hear in the territory of the arvernus before the end of the first watch which be a extent of more than a hundred and sixty mile iv -- there in like manner vercingetorix the son of celtillus the arvernian a young man of the highest power -lrb- whose father have hold the supremacy of entire gaul and have be put to death by he fellow citizen for this reason because he aim at sovereign power -rrb- summon together he dependent and easily excite they on he design be make know they rush to arm : he be expel from the town of gergovium by he uncle gobanitio and the rest of the noble who be of opinion that such a enterprise ought not to be hazard : he do not however desist but hold in the country a levy of the needy and desperate have collect such a body of troops he bring over to he 30 sentiment such of he fellow citizen as he have access to : he exhort they to take up arm in behalf of the general freedom and have assemble great force he drive from the state he opponent by whom he have be expel a short time previously he be salute king by he partisan he send ambassador in every direction he conjure they to adhere firmly to they promise he quickly attach to he interest the senone parisius pictone cadurci turone aulerci lemovice and all the other who border on the ocean the supreme command be confer on he by unanimous consent on obtain this authority he demand hostage from all these state he order a fixed number of soldier to be send to he immediately he determine what quantity of arm each state shall prepare at home and before what time he pay particular attention to the cavalry to the utmost vigilance he add the utmost rigor of authority and by the severity of he punishment bring over the wavering : for on the commission of a greater crime he put the perpetrator to death by fire and every sort of torture for a slighter cause he send home the offender with they ear cut off or one of they eye put out that they may be a example to the rest and frighten other by the severity of they punishment v -- have quickly collect a army by they punishment he send lucterius one of the cadurcus a man of the utmost daring with part of he force into the territory of the rutenus and march in person into the country of the biturige on he arrival the biturige send ambassador to the aeduus under whose protection they be to solicit aid in order that they might more easily resist the force of the enemy the aeduus by the advice of the lieutenant whom caesar have leave with the army send supplies of horse and foot to succor the biturige when they come to the river loire which separate the biturige from the aeduus they delay a few day there and not daring to pass the river return home and send back word to the lieutenant that they have return through fear of the treachery of the biturige who they ascertain have form this design that if the aeduus should cross the river the biturige on the one side and the arvernus on the other should surround they whether they do this for the reason which they allege to the lieutenant or influence by treachery we think that we ought not to state as certain because we have no proof on they departure the biturige immediately unite themselves to the arvernus vi -- these affair be announce to caesar in italy at the time when he understand that matter in the city have be reduce to a more tranquil state by the energy of cneius pompey he set out for transalpine gaul after he have arrive there he be greatly at a loss to know by what means he could reach he army for if he should summon the legion into the province he be aware that on they march they would have to fight in he absence he foresee too that if he himself should endeavor to reach the army he would act injudiciously in trust he safety even to those who seem to be tranquillize vii -- in the meantime lucterius the cadurcan have be send into the country of the ruteni gain over that state to the arvernus have advance into the country of the nitiobrige and gabalus he receive hostage from both nation and assemble a numerous force march to make a descent on the province in the direction of narbo caesar when this circumstance be announce to he think that the march to narbo ought to take the precedence of all he other plan when he arrive there he encourage the timid and station garrison among the rutenus in the province of the volcae arecomici and the country around narbo which be in the vicinity of the enemy he order a portion of the force from the province and the recruit which he have bring from italy to rendezvous among the helvius who border on the territory of the arvernus viii -- these matter be arrange and lucterius now check and force to retreat because he think it dangerous to enter the line of roman garrison caesar march into the country of the helvius although mount cevenne which separate the arvernus from the helvius block up the way with very deep snow as it be the severest season of the year yet have clear away the snow to the depth of six foot and have open the road he reach the territory of the arvernus with infinite labor to he soldier this people be surprised because they consider themselves defend by the cevenne as by a wall and the path at this season of the year have never before be passable even to individual he order the cavalry to extend themselves as far as they could and strike as great a panic as possible into the enemy these proceedings be speedily announce to vercingetorix by rumor and he messenger around he all the arvernus crowd in alarm and solemnly entreat he to protect they property and not to suffer they to be plunder by the enemy especially as he see that all the war be transfer into they country be prevail upon by they entreaty he move he camp from the country of the biturige in the direction of the arvernus ix -- caesar have delay two day in that place because he have anticipate that in the natural course of event such would be the conduct of vercingetorix leave the army under pretence of raise recruit and cavalry : he place brutus a young man in command of these force he give he instruction that the cavalry should range as extensively as possible in all direction that he would exert himself not to be absent from the camp longer than three day have arrange these matter he march to vienna by as long journey as he can when he own soldier do not expect he find there a fresh body of cavalry which he have send on to that place several day before march incessantly night and day he advance rapidly through the territory of the aeduus into that of the lingone in which two legion be winter that if any plan affect he own safety should have be organise by the aeduus he might defeat it by the rapidity of he movement when he arrive there he send information to the rest of the legion and gather all he army into one place before intelligence of he arrival could be announce to the arverni vercingetorix on hearing this circumstance lead back he army into the country of the biturige and after march from it to gergovia a town of the boius whom caesar have settle there after defeat they in the helvetian war and have render tributary to the aeduus he determine to attack it x -- this action cause great perplexity to caesar in the selection of he plan -lrb- he fear -rrb- lest if he should confine he legion in one place for the remain portion of the winter all gaul should revolt when the tributary of the aeduus be subdue because it would appear that there be in he no protection for he friend but if he should draw they too soon out of they winter quarter he might be distressed by the want of provision in consequence of the difficulty of conveyance it seem better however to endure every hardship than to alienate the affection of all he ally by submit to such a insult have therefore impressed on the aeduus the necessity of supply he with provision he send forward messenger to the boius to inform they of he arrival and encourage they to remain firm in they allegiance and resist the attack of the enemy with great resolution have leave two legion and the luggage of the entire army at agendicum he march to the boius xi -- on the second day when he come to vellaunodunum a town of the senone he determine to attack it in order that he might not leave a enemy in he rear and might the more easily procure supplies of provision and draw a line of circumvallation around it in two day : on the third day ambassador be send from the town to treat of a capitulation he order they arm to be bring together they cattle to be bring forth and six hundred hostage to be give he leave caius trebonius he lieutenant to complete these arrangement he himself set out with the intention of march as soon as possible to genabum a town of the carnute who have then for the first time receive information of the siege of vellaunodunum as they think that it would be protracted to a longer time be prepare a garrison to send to genabum for the defense of that town caesar arrive here in two day after pitch he camp before the town be prevent by the time of the day he defer the attack to the next day and order he soldier to prepare whatever be necessary for that enterprise and as a bridge over the loire connect the town of genabum with the opposite bank fear lest the inhabitant should escape by night from the town he order two legion to keep watch under arm the people of genabum come forth silently from the city before midnight and begin to cross the river when this circumstance be announce by scout caesar have set fire to the gate send in the legion which he have order to be ready and obtain possession of the town so completely that very few of the whole number of the enemy escape be take alive because the narrowness of the bridge and the road prevent the multitude from escape he pillage and burn the town give the booty to the soldier then lead he army over the loire and march into the territory of the biturige xii -- vercingetorix when he ascertain the arrival of caesar desist from the siege -lrb- of gergovium -rrb- and march to meet caesar the latter have commence to besiege noviodunum and when ambassador come from this town to beg that he would pardon they and spare they life in order that he might execute the rest of he design with the rapidity by which he have accomplish most of they he order they arm to be collect they horse to be bring forth and hostage to be give a part of the hostage be now deliver up when the rest of the term be be perform a few centurion and soldier be send into the town to collect the arm and horse the enemy 's cavalry which have outstrip the main body of vercingetorix 's army be see at a distance as soon as the townsman behold they and entertain hope of assistance raise a shout they begin to take up arm shut the gate and line the wall when the centurion in the town understand from the signal-making of the gaul that they be form some new design they draw they sword and seize the gate and recover all they man safe xiii -- caesar order the horse to be draw out of the camp and commence a cavalry action he man be now distressed caesar send to they aid about four hundred german horse which he have determine at the begin to keep with himself the gaul could not withstand they attack but be put to flight and retreat to they main body after lose a great number of man when they be route the townsman again intimidate arrest those person by whose exertion they think that the mob have be rouse and bring they to caesar and surrender themselves to he when these affair be accomplish caesar march to the avaricum which be the largest and best fortify town in the territory of the biturige and situate in a most fertile tract of country because he confidently expect that on take that town he would reduce beneath he dominion the state of the biturige xiv -- vercingetorix after sustain such a series of loss at vellaunodunum genabum and noviodunum summons he man to a council he impress on they that the war must be prosecute on a very different system from that which have be previously adopt but they should by all mean aim at this object that the roman should be prevent from forage and procure provision that this be easy because they themselves be well supply with cavalry and be likewise assist by the season of the year that forage could not be cut that the enemy must necessarily disperse and look for it in the house that all these might be daily destroy by the horse besides that the interest of private property must be neglect for the sake of the general safety that the village and house ought to be fire over such a extent of country in every direction from boia as the roman appear capable of scour in they search for forage that a abundance of these necessaries could be supply to they because they would be assist by the resource of those in whose territory the war would be wage : that the roman either would not bear the privation or else would advance to any distance from the camp with considerable danger and that it make no difference whether they slew they or strip they of they baggage since if it be lose they could not carry on the war besides that the town ought to be burnt which be not secure against every danger by they fortification or natural advantage that there should not be place of retreat for they own countryman for decline military service nor be expose to the roman as inducement to carry off abundance of provision and plunder if these sacrifice should appear heavy or galling that they ought to consider it much more distressing that they wife and child should be drag off to slavery and themselves slay the evil which must necessarily befall the conquer xv -- this opinion have be approve of by unanimous consent more than twenty town of the biturige be burn in one day conflagration be behold in every quarter and although all bear this with great regret yet they lay before themselves this consolation that as the victory be certain they could quickly recover they loss there be a debate concern avaricum in the general council whether they should decide that it should be burnt or defend the biturige throw themselves at the foot of all the gaul and entreat that they should not be compel to set fire with they own hand to the fairest city of almost the whole of gaul which be both a protection and ornament to the state they say that they could easily defend it owe to the nature of the ground for be enclose almost on every side by a river and a marsh it have only one entrance and that very narrow permission be grant to they at they earnest request vercingetorix at first dissuade they from it but afterwards concede the point owe to they entreaty and the compassion of the soldier a proper garrison be select for the town xvi -- vercingetorix follow closely upon caesar by shorter march and select for he camp a place defend by wood and marsh at the distance of fifteen mile from avaricum there he receive intelligence by trusty scout every hour in the day of what be go on at avaricum and order whatever he wish to be do he closely watch all we expedition for corn and forage and whenever they be compel to go to a greater distance he attack they when disperse and inflict severe loss upon they although the evil be remedy by we man as far as precaution could be take by go forth at irregular time and by different way xvii -- caesar pitch he camp at that side of the town which be not defend by the river and marsh and have a very narrow approach as we have mention begin to raise the vinea and erect two tower for the nature of the place prevent he from draw a line of circumvallation he never cease to importune the boius and aeduus for supplies of corn of whom the one -lrb- the aeduus -rrb- because they be act with no zeal do not aid he much the other -lrb- the boius -rrb- as they resource be not great quickly consume what they have although the army be distressed by the greatest want of corn through the poverty of the boius the apathy of the aeduus and the burning of the house to such a degree that for several day the soldier be without corn and satisfy they extreme hunger with cattle drive from the remote village yet no language be hear from they unworthy of the majesty of the roman people and they former victory moreover when caesar address the legion one by one when at work and say that he would raise the siege if they feel the scarcity too severely they unanimously beg he not to do so that they have serve for several year under he command in such a manner that they never submit to insult and never abandon a enterprise without accomplish it that they should consider it a disgrace if they abandon the siege after commence it that it be better to endure every hardship than not to avenge the mane of the roman citizen who perish at genabum by the perfidy of the gaul they entrust the same declaration to the centurion and military tribune that through they they might be communicate to caesar xviii -- when the tower have now approach the wall caesar ascertain from the captive that vercingetorix after destroy the forage have pitch he camp nearer avaricum and that he himself with the cavalry and light-armed infantry who generally fight among the horse have go to lay a ambuscade in that quarter to which he think that we troops would come the next day to forage on learn these fact he set out from the camp secretly at midnight and reach the camp of the enemy early in the morning they have quickly learn the arrival of caesar by scout hide they car and baggage in the thickest part of the wood and draw up all they force in a lofty and open space : which circumstance be announce caesar immediately order the baggage to be pile and the arm to be get ready xix -- there be a hill of a gentle ascent from the bottom a dangerous and impassable marsh not more than fifty foot broad begirt it on almost every side the gaul have break down the bridge post themselves on this hill in confidence of they position and be draw up in tribe accord to they respective state hold all the ford and passage of that marsh with trusty guard thus determine that if the roman should attempt to force the marsh they would overpower they from the higher ground while stick in it so that whoever see the nearness of the position would imagine that the two army be prepare to fight on almost equal term but whoever should view accurately the disadvantage of position would discover that they be show off a empty affectation of courage caesar clearly point out to he soldier who be indignant that the enemy could bear the sight of they at the distance of so short a space and be earnestly demand the signal for action with how great loss and the death of how many gallant man the victory would necessarily be purchase : and when he see they so determine to decline no danger for he renown that he ought to be consider guilty of the utmost injustice if he do not hold they life dearer than he own personal safety have thus console he soldier he lead they back on the same day to the camp and determine to prepare the other thing which be necessary for the siege of the town xx -- vercingetorix when he have return to he man be accuse of treason in that he have move he camp nearer the roman in that he have go away with all the cavalry in that he have leave so great force without a commander in that on he departure the roman have come at such a favourable season and with such despatch that all these circumstance could not have happen accidentally or without design that he prefer hold the sovereignty of gaul by the grant of caesar to acquire it by they favor be accuse in such a manner he make the following reply to these charge : -- that he move he camp have be cause by want of forage and have be do even by they advice that he approach near the roman have be a measure dictate by the favourable nature of the ground which would defend he by its natural strength that the service of the cavalry could not have be requisite in marshy ground and be useful in that place to which they have go that he on he departure have give the supreme command to no one intentionally lest he should be induce by the eagerness of the multitude to hazard a engagement to which he perceive that all be incline owe to they want of energy because they be unable to endure fatigue any longer that if the roman in the meantime come up by chance they -lrb- the gaul -rrb- should feel grateful to fortune if invite by the information of some one they should feel grateful to he because they be enable to see distinctly from the higher ground the smallness of the number of they enemy and despise the courage of those who not daring to fight retreat disgracefully into they camp that he desire no power from caesar by treachery since he could have it by victory which be now assure to himself and to all the gaul nay that he would even give they back the command if they think that they confer honor on he rather then receive safety from he that you may be assure say he that i speak these word with truth -- listen to these roman soldier he produce some camp-follower whom he have surprise on a forage expedition some day before and have tortured by famine and confinement they be previously instruct in what answer they should make when examine say that they be legionary soldier that urge by famine and want they have recently go forth from the camp -lrb- to see -rrb- if they could find any corn or cattle in the field that the whole army be distressed by a similar scarcity nor have any one now sufficient strength nor could bear the labor of the work and therefore that the general be determine if he make no progress in the siege to draw off he army in three day these benefit say vercingetorix you receive from I whom you accuse of treason -- I by whose exertion you see so powerful and victorious a army almost destroy by famine without shed one drop of you blood and i have take precaution that no state shall admit within its territory this army in its ignominious flight from this place xxi -- the whole multitude raise a shout and clash they arm accord to they custom as they usually do in the case of he whose speech they approve -lrb- they exclaim -rrb- that vercingetorix be a consummate general and that they have no doubt of he honor that the war could not be conduct with greater prudence they determine that ten thousand man should be pick out of the entire army and send into the town and decide that the general safety should not be entrust to the biturige alone because they be aware that the glory of the victory must rest with the biturige if they make good the defense of the town xxii -- to the extraordinary valor of we soldier device of every sort be oppose by the gaul since they be a nation of consummate ingenuity and most skilful in imitate and make those thing which be impart by any one for they turn aside the hook with noose and when they have catch hold of they firmly draw they on by means of engine and undermine the mound the more skilfully on this account because there be in they territory extensive iron mine and consequently every description of mining operation be know and practice by they they have furnish moreover the whole wall on every side with turret and have cover they with skin besides in they frequent sally by day and night they attempt either to set fire to the mound or attack we soldier when engage in the work and moreover by splicing the upright timber of they own tower they equal the height of ours as fast as the mound have daily raise they and countermine we mine and impede the working of they by stake bent and sharpen at the end and boiling pitch and stone of very great weight and prevent they from approach the wall xxiii -- but this be usually the form of all the gallic wall straight beam connect lengthwise and two foot distant from each other at equal interval be place together on the ground these be mortise on the inside and cover with plenty of earth but the interval which we have mention be close up in front by large stone these be thus lay and cement together another row be add above in such a manner that the same interval may be observe and that the beam may not touch one another but equal space intervene each row of beam be keep firmly in its place by a row of stone in this manner the whole wall be consolidate until the regular height of the wall be complete this work with respect to appearance and variety be not unsightly owe to the alternate row of beam and stone which preserve they order in right line and besides it possess great advantage as regard utility and the defense of city for the stone protect it from fire and the wood from the batter ram since it -lrb- the wood -rrb- be mortise in the inside with row of beam generally forty foot each in length can neither be break through nor torn asunder xxiv -- the siege have be impede by so many disadvantage the soldier although they be retard during the whole time by the mud cold and constant shower yet by they incessant labor overcome all these obstacle and in twenty-five day raise a mound three hundred and thirty foot broad and eighty foot high when it almost touch the enemy 's wall and caesar accord to he usual custom keep watch at the work and encourage the soldier not to discontinue the work for a moment : a little before the third watch they discover that the mound be sink since the enemy have set it on fire by a mine and at the same time a shout be raise along the entire wall and a sally be make from two gate on each side of the turret some at a distance be cast torch and dry wood from the wall on the mound other be pour on it pitch and other material by which the flame might be excite so that a plan could hardly be form as to where they should first run to the defense or to what part aid should be bring however as two legion always keep guard before the camp by caesar 's order and several of they be at stated time at the work measure be promptly take that some should oppose the sally party other draw back the tower and make a cut in the rampart and moreover that the whole army should hasten from the camp to extinguish the flame xxv -- when the battle be go on in every direction the rest of the night be now spend and fresh hope of victory always arise before the enemy : the more so on this account because they see the covering of we tower burn away and perceive that we be expose could not easily go to give assistance and they themselves be always relieve the weary with fresh man and consider that all the safety of gaul rest on this crisis there happen in my own view a circumstance which have appear to be worthy of record we think it ought not to be omit a certain gaul before the gate of the town who be cast into the fire opposite the turret ball of tallow and fire which be pass along to he be pierce with a dart on the right side and fall dead one of those next he step over he as he lay and discharge the same office : when the second man be slay in the same manner by a wound from a cross-bow a third succeed he and a fourth succeed the third : nor be this post leave vacant by the besiege until the fire of the mound have be extinguish and the enemy repulse in every direction a end be put to the fight xxvi -- the gaul have try every expedient as nothing have succeed adopt the design of flee from the town the next day by the advice and order of vercingetorix they hope that by attempt it at the dead of night they would effect it without any great loss of man because the camp of vercingetorix be not far distant from the town and the extensive marsh which intervene be likely to retard the roman in the pursuit and they be now prepare to execute this by night when the matron suddenly run out into the street and weep cast themselves at the foot of they husband and request of they with every entreaty that they should not abandon themselves and they common child to the enemy for punishment because the weakness of they nature and physical power prevent they from take to flight when they see that they -lrb- as fear do not generally admit of mercy in extreme danger -rrb- persist in they resolution they begin to shout aloud and give intelligence of they flight to the roman the gaul be intimidate by fear of this lest the pass should be pre-occupied by the roman cavalry desist from they design xxvii -- the next day caesar the tower be advance and the work which he have determine to raise be arrange a violent storm arise think this no bad time for execute he design because he observe the guard arrange on the wall a little too negligently and therefore order he own man to engage in they work more remissly and point out what he wish to be do he draw up he soldier in a secret position within the vinea and exhort they to reap at least the harvest of victory proportionate to they exertion he propose a reward for those who should first scale the wall and give the signal to the soldier they suddenly fly out from all quarter and quickly fill the wall xxviii -- the enemy be alarm by the suddenness of the attack be dislodge from the wall and tower and draw up in form of a wedge in the market-place and the open street with this intention that if a attack should be make on any side they should fight with they line draw up to receive it when they see no one descend to the level ground and the enemy extend themselves along the entire wall in every direction fear lest every hope of flight should be cut off they cast away they arm and seek without stop the most remote part of the town a part be then slay by the infantry when they be crowd upon one another in the narrow passage of the gate and a part have get without the gate be cut to piece by the cavalry : nor be there one who be anxious for the plunder thus be excite by the massacre at genabum and the fatigue of the siege they spare neither those wear out with year woman or child finally out of all that number which amount to about forty thousand scarcely eight hundred who flee from the town when they hear the first alarm reach vercingetorix in safety : and he the night be now far spend receive they in silence after they flight -lrb- fear that any sedition should arise in the camp from they entrance in a body and the compassion of the soldier -rrb- so that have arrange he friend and the chief of the state at a distance on the road he take precaution that they should be separate and conduct to they fellow countryman to whatever part of the camp have be assign to each state from the begin xxix -- vercingetorix have convene a assembly on the follow day console and encourage he soldier in the follow word : -- that they should not be too much depress in spirit nor alarmed at they loss that the roman do not conquer by valor nor in the field but by a kind of art and skill in assault with which they themselves be unacquainted that whoever expect every event in the war to be favourable err that it never be he opinion that avaricum should be defend of the truth of which statement he have themselves as witness but that it be owe to the imprudence of the biturige and the too ready compliance of the rest that this loss be sustain that however he would soon compensate it by superior advantage for that he would by he exertion bring over those state which sever themselves from the rest of the gaul and would create a general unanimity throughout the whole of gaul the union of which not even the whole earth could withstand and that he have it already almost effect that in the meantime it be reasonable that he should prevail on they for the sake of the general safety to begin to fortify they camp in order that they might the more easily sustain the sudden attack of the enemy xxx -- this speech be not disagreeable to the gaul principally because he himself be not dishearten by receive so severe a loss and have not conceal himself nor shun the eye of the people : and he be believe to possess greater foresight and sounder judgment than the rest because when the affair be undecided he have at first be of opinion that avaricum should be burnt and afterwards that it should be abandon accordingly as ill success weaken the authority of other general so on the contrary he dignity increase daily although a loss be sustain : at the same time they begin to entertain hope on he assertion of unite the rest of the state to themselves and on this occasion for the first time the gaul begin to fortify they camp and be so alarmed that although they be man unaccustomed to toil yet they be of opinion that they ought to endure and suffer everything which should be impose upon they xxxi -- nor do vercingetorix use less effort than he have promise to gain over the other state and -lrb- in consequence -rrb- endeavor to entice they leader by gift and promise for this object he select fitting emissary by whose subtle plead or private friendship each of the noble could be most easily influence he take care that those who flee to he on the storm of avaricum should be provide with arm and clothes at the same time that he diminished force should be recruit he levy a fixed quota of soldier from each state and define the number and day before which he should wish they bring to the camp and order all the archer of whom there be a very great number in gaul to be collect and send to he by these mean the troops which be lose at avaricum be speedily replace in the meantime teutomarus the son of ollovicon the king of the nitiobrige whose father have receive the appellation of friend from we senate come to he with a great number of he own horse and those whom he have hire from aquitanium xxxii -- caesar after delay several day at avaricum and finding there the greatest plenty of corn and other provision refresh he army after they fatigue and privation the winter be almost end when he be invite by the favourable season of the year to prosecute the war and march against the enemy -lrb- and try -rrb- whether he could draw they from the marsh and wood or else press they by a blockade some nobleman of the aeduus come to he as ambassador to entreat that in a extreme emergency he should succor they state that they affair be in the utmost danger because whereas single magistrate have be usually appoint in ancient time and hold the power of king for a single year two person now exercise this office and each assert that he be appoint accord to they law that one of they be convictolitanis a powerful and illustrious youth the other cotus spring from a most ancient family and personally a man of very great influence and extensive connection he brother valetiacus have bear the same office during the last year : that the whole state be up in arm the senate divide the people divide that each of they have he own adherent and that if the animosity would be foment any longer the result would be that one part of the state would come to a collision with the other that it rest with he activity and influence to prevent it xxxiii -- although caesar consider it ruinous to leave the war and the enemy yet be well aware what great evil generally arise from internal dissension lest a state so powerful and so closely connect with the roman people which he himself have always foster and honor in every respect should have recourse to violence and arm and that the party which have less confidence in its own power should summon aid from vercingetorix he determine to anticipate this movement and because by the law of the aeduus it be not permit those who hold the supreme authority to leave the country he determine to go in person to the aeduus lest he should appear to infringe upon they government and law and summon all the senate and those between whom the dispute be to meet he at decetium when almost all the state have assemble there and he be inform that one brother have be declare magistrate by the other when only a few person be privately summon for the purpose at a different time and place from what he ought whereas the law not only forbid two belong to one family to be elect magistrate while each be alive but even deter they from be in the senate he compel cotus to resign he office he order convictolitani who have be elect by the priest accord to the usage of the state in the presence of the magistrate to hold the supreme authority xxxiv -- have pronounce this decree between -lrb- the contend party -rrb- he exhort the aeduus to bury in oblivion they dispute and dissension and lay aside all these thing devote themselves to the war and expect from he on the conquest of gaul those reward which they should have earn and send speedily to he all they cavalry and ten thousand infantry which he might place in different garrison to protect he convoy of provision and then divide he army into two part : he give labienus four legion to lead into the country of the senone and parisius and lead in person six into the country of the arvernus in the direction of the town of gergovium along the bank of the allier he give part of the cavalry to labienus and keep part to himself vercingetorix on learn this circumstance break down all the bridge over the river and begin to march on the other bank of the allier xxxv -- when each army be in sight of the other and be pitch they camp almost opposite that of the enemy scout be distribute in every quarter lest the roman should build a bridge and bring over they troops it be to caesar a matter attend with great difficulty lest he should be hinder from pass the river during the greater part of the summer as the allier can not generally be ford before the autumn therefore that this might not happen have pitch he camp in a woody place opposite to one of those bridge which vercingetorix have take care should be break down the next day he stop behind with two legion in a secret place : he send on the rest of the force as usual with all the baggage after have select some cohort that the number of the legion might appear to be complete have order these to advance as far as they could when now from the time of day he conjecture they have come to a encampment he begin to rebuild the bridge on the same pile the lower part of which remain entire have quickly finish the work and lead he legion across he select a fit place for a camp and recall the rest of he troops vercingetorix on ascertain this fact go before he by force march in order that he might not be compel to come to a action against he will xxxvi -- caesar in five day ' march go from that place to gergovium and after engage in a slight cavalry skirmish that day on view the situation of the city which be build on a very high mountain be very difficult of access he despair of take it by storm and determine to take no measure with regard to besiege it before he should secure a supply of provision but vercingetorix have pitch he camp on the mountain near the town place the force of each state separately and at small interval around himself and have occupy all the hill of that range as far as they command a view -lrb- of the roman encampment -rrb- he present a formidable appearance he order the ruler of the state whom he have select as he council of war to come to he daily at the dawn whether any measure seem to require deliberation or execution nor do he allow almost any day to pass without testing in a cavalry action the archer be intermix what spirit and valor there be in each of he own man there be a hill opposite the town at the very foot of that mountain strongly fortify and precipitous on every side -lrb- which if we man could gain they seem likely to exclude the enemy from a great share of they supply of water and from free foraging but this place be occupy by they with a weak garrison -rrb- : however caesar set out from the camp in the silence of night and dislodge the garrison before succor could come from the town he get possession of the place and post two legion there and draw from the greater camp to the less a double trench twelve foot broad so that the soldier could even singly pass secure from any sudden attack of the enemy xxxvii -- whilst these affair be go on at gergovium convictolitani the aeduan to whom we have observe the magistracy be adjudge by caesar be bribe by the arvernus hold a conference with certain young man the chief of whom be litavicus and he brother who be bear of a most noble family he share the bribe with they and exhort they to remember that they be free and bear for empire that the state of the aeduus be the only one which retard the most certain victory of the gaul that the rest be hold in check by its authority and if it be bring over the roman would not have room to stand on in gaul that he have receive some kindness from caesar only so far however as gain a most just cause by he decision but that he assign more weight to the general freedom for why should the aeduus go to caesar to decide concern they rights and law rather than the roman come to the aeduus the young man be easily win over by the speech of the magistrate and the bribe when they declare that they would even be leader in the plot a plan for accomplish it be consider because they be confident they state could not be induce to undertake the war on slight grounds it be resolve that litavicus should have the command of the ten thousand which be be send to caesar for the war and should have charge of they on they march and that he brother should go before he to caesar they arrange the other measure and the manner in which they should have they do xxxviii -- litavicus have receive the command of the army suddenly convene the soldier when he be about thirty mile distant from gergovium and weep say soldier whither be we go all we knight and all we noble have perish eporedorix and viridomarus the principal man of the state be accuse of treason have be slay by the roman without even permission to plead they cause learn this intelligence from those who have escape from the massacre for i since my brother and all my relation have be slay be prevent by grief from declare what have take place person be bring forward whom he have instruct in what he would have they say and make the same statement to the soldiery as litavicus have make : that all the knight of the aeduus be slay because they be say to have hold conference with the arvernus that they have conceal themselves among the multitude of soldier and have escape from the midst of the slaughter the aeduus shout aloud and conjure litavicus to provide for they safety as if say he it be a matter of deliberation and not of necessity for we to go to gergovium and unite ourselves to the arvernus or have we any reason to doubt that the roman after perpetrate the atrocious crime be now hasten to slay we therefore if there be any spirit in we let we avenge the death of those who have perish in a most unworthy manner and let we slay these robber he point to the roman citizen who have accompany they in reliance on he protection he immediately seize a great quantity of corn and provision cruelly torture they and then put they to death send messenger throughout the entire state of the aeduus and rouse they completely by the same falsehood concern the slaughter of they knight and noble he earnestly advise they to avenge in the same manner as he do the wrong which they have receive xxxix -- eporedorix the aeduan a young man bear in the highest rank and possess very great influence at home and along with viridomarus of equal age and influence but of inferior birth whom caesar have raise from a humble position to the highest rank on be recommend to he by divitiacus have come in the number of horse be summon by caesar by name these have a dispute with each other for precedence and in the struggle between the magistrate they have contend with they utmost effort the one for convictolitani the other for cotus of these eporedorix on learn the design of litavicus lay the matter before caesar almost at midnight he entreat that caesar should not suffer they state to swerve from the alliance with the roman people owe to the depraved counsel of a few young man which he foresee would be the consequence if so many thousand man should unite themselves to the enemy as they relation could not neglect they safety nor the state regard it as a matter of slight importance xl -- caesar feel great anxiety on this intelligence because he have always especially indulge the state of the aeduus and without any hesitation draw out from the camp four light-armed legion and all the cavalry : nor have he time at such a crisis to contract the camp because the affair seem to depend upon despatch he leave caius fabius he lieutenant with two legion to guard the camp when he order the brother of litavicus to be arrest he discover that they have flee a short time before to the camp of the enemy he encourage he soldier not to be dishearten by the labor of the journey on such a necessary occasion and after advance twenty-five mile all be most eager he come in sight of the army of the aeduus and by send on he cavalry retard and impede they march he then issue strict order to all he soldier to kill no one he command eporedorix and viridomarus who they think be kill to move among the cavalry and address they friend when they be recognize and the treachery of litavicus discover the aeduus begin to extend they hand to intimate submission and lay down they arm to deprecate death litavicus with he clansman who after the custom of the gaul consider it a crime to desert they patron even in extreme misfortune flee forth to gergovium xli -- caesar after send messenger to the state of the aeduus to inform they that they whom he could have put to death by the right of war be spare through he kindness and after give three hour of the night to he army for he repose direct he march to gergovium almost in the middle of the journey a party of horse that be send by fabius state in how great danger matter be they inform he that the camp be attack by a very powerful army while fresh man be frequently relieve the wearied and exhausting we soldier by the incessant toil since on account of the size of the camp they have constantly to remain on the rampart that many have be wound by the immense number of arrow and all kind of missile that the engine be of great service in withstand they that fabius at they departure leave only two gate open be block up the rest and be add breast-works to the rampart and be prepare himself for a similar casualty on the follow day caesar after receive this information reach the camp before sunrise owing to the very great zeal of he soldier xlii -- whilst these thing be go on at gergovium the aeduus on receive the first announcement from litavicus leave themselves no time to ascertain the truth of these statement some be stimulate by avarice other by revenge and credulity which be a innate propensity in that race of man to such a degree that they consider a slight rumor as a ascertain fact they plunder the property of the roman citizen and either massacre they or drag they away to slavery convictolitani increase the evil state of affair and goad on the people to fury that by the commission of some outrage they may be ashamed to return to propriety they entice from the town of cabillonus by a promise of safety marcus aristius a military tribune who be on he march to he legion they compel those who have settle there for the purpose of trading to do the same by constantly attack they on they march they strip they of all they baggage they besiege day and night those that resist when many be slay on both side they excite a greater number to arm xliii -- in the meantime when intelligence be bring that all they soldier be in caesar 's power they run in a body to aristius they assure he that nothing have be do by public authority they order a inquiry to be make about the plundered property they confiscate the property of litavicus and he brother they send ambassador to caesar for the purpose of clear themselves they do all this with a view to recover they soldier but be contaminate by guilt and charm by the gain arise from the plundered property as that act be share in by many and be tempt by the fear of punishment they begin to form plan of war and stir up the other state by embassy although caesar be aware of this proceeding yet he address the ambassador with as much mildness as he can : that he do not think worse of the state on account of the ignorance and fickleness of the mob nor would diminish he regard for the aeduus he himself fear a greater commotion in gaul in order to prevent he be surround by all the state begin to form plan as to the manner in which he should return from gergovium and again concentrate he force lest a departure arise from the fear of a revolt should seem like a flight xliv -- whilst he be consider these thing a opportunity of act successfully seem to offer for when he have come into the smaller camp for the purpose of secure the work he notice that the hill in the possession of the enemy be stript of man although on the former day it could scarcely be see on account of the number on it be astonish he inquire the reason of it from the deserter a great number of whom flock to he daily they all concur in assert what caesar himself have already ascertain by he scout that the back of that hill be almost level but likewise woody and narrow by which there be a pass to the other side of the town that they have serious apprehension for this place and have no other idea on the occupation of one hill by the roman than that if they should lose the other they would be almost surround and cut off from all egress and forage that they be all summon by vercingetorix to fortify this place xlv -- caesar on be inform of this circumstance send several troops of horse to the place immediately after midnight he order they to range in every quarter with more tumult than usual at dawn he order a large quantity of baggage to be draw out of the camp and the muleteer with helmet in the appearance and guise of horseman to ride round the hill to these he add a few cavalry with instruction to range more widely to make a show he order they all to seek the same quarter by a long circuit these proceedings be see at a distance from the town as gergovium command a view of the camp nor could the gaul ascertain at so great a distance what certainty there be in the maneuver he send one legion to the same hill and after it have march a little station it in the lower ground and conceal it in the wood the suspicion of the gaul be increase and all they force be march to that place to defend it caesar have perceive the camp of the enemy desert cover the military insignia of he man conceal the standard and transfer he soldier in small body from the greater to the less camp and point out to the lieutenant whom he have place in command over the respective legion what he should wish to be do he particularly advise they to restrain they man from advance too far through they desire of fight or they hope of plunder he set before they what disadvantage the unfavourable nature of the ground carry with it that they could be assist by despatch alone : that success depend on a surprise and not on a battle after state these particulars he give the signal for action and detach the aeduus at the same time by another ascent a the right xlvi -- the town wall be 1200 pace distant from the plain and foot of the ascent in a straight line if no gap intervene whatever circuit be add to this ascent to make the hill easy increase the length of the route but almost in the middle of the hill the gaul have previously build a wall six foot high make of large stone and extend in length as far as the nature of the ground permit as a barrier to retard the advance of we man and leave all the lower space empty they have fill the upper part of the hill as far as the wall of the town with they camp very close to one another the soldier on the signal be give quickly advance to this fortification and pass over it make themselves master of the separate camp and so great be they activity in take the camp that teutomarus the king of the nitiobrige be suddenly surprise in he tent as he have go to rest at noon with difficulty escape from the hand of the plunderer with the upper part of he person naked and he horse wound xlvii -- caesar have accomplish the object which he have in view order the signal to be sound for a retreat and the soldier of the tenth legion by which he be then accompany halted but the soldier of the other legion not hear the sound of the trumpet because there be a very large valley between they be however keep back by the tribune of the soldier and the lieutenant accord to caesar 's order but be animated by the prospect of speedy victory and the flight of the enemy and the favourable battle of former period they think nothing so difficult that they bravery could not accomplish it nor do they put a end to the pursuit until they draw nigh to the wall of the town and the gate but then when a shout arise in every quarter of the city those who be at a distance be alarm by the sudden tumult flee hastily from the town since they think that the enemy be within the gate the matron begin to cast they clothes and silver over the wall and bend over as far as the lower part of the bosom with outstretched hand beseech the roman to spare they and not to sacrifice to they resentment even woman and child as they have do at avaricum some of they let themselves down from the wall by they hand and surrender to we soldier lucius fabius a centurion of the eighth legion who it be ascertain have say that day among he fellow soldier that he be excite by the plunder of avaricum and would not allow any one to mount the wall before he find three man of he own company and be raise up by they scale the wall he himself in turn take hold of they one by one draw they up to the wall xlviii -- in the meantime those who have go to the other part of the town to defend it as we have mention above at first arouse by hear the shout and afterwards by frequent account that the town be in possession of the roman send forward they cavalry and hasten in larger number to that quarter as each first come he stand beneath the wall and increase the number of he countryman engage in action when a great multitude of they have assemble the matron who a little before be stretch they hand from the wall to the roman begin to beseech they countryman and after the gallic fashion to show they dishevelled hair and bring they child into public view neither in position nor in number be the contest a equal one to the roman at the same time be exhaust by run and the long continuation of the fight they could not easily withstand fresh and vigorous troops xlix -- caesar when he perceive that he soldier be fight on unfavourable ground and that the enemy 's force be increase be alarm for the safety of he troops send order to titus sextius one of he lieutenant whom he have leave to guard the smaller camp to lead out he cohort quickly from the camp and post they at the foot of the hill on the right wing of the enemy that if he should see we man drive from the ground he should deter the enemy from follow too closely he himself advance with the legion a little from that place where he have take he post await the issue of the battle l -- while the fight be go on most vigorously hand to hand and the enemy depend on they position and number we man on they bravery the aeduus suddenly appear on we expose flank as caesar have send they by another ascent on the right for the sake of create a diversion these from the similarity of they arm greatly terrify we man and although they be discover to have they right shoulder bare which be usually the sign of those reduce to peace yet the soldier suspect that this very thing be do by the enemy to deceive they at the same time lucius fabius the centurion and those who have scale the wall with he be surround and slay be cast from the wall marcus petreius a centurion of the same legion after attempt to hew down the gate be overpower by number and despairing of he safety have already receive many wound say to the soldier of he own company who follow he : since i can not save you as well as myself i shall at least provide for you safety since i allured by the love of glory lead you into this danger do you save yourselve when a opportunity be give at the same time he rush into the midst of the enemy and slaying two of they drive back the rest a little from the gate when he man attempt to aid he in vain he say you endeavor to procure my safety since blood and strength be now fail I therefore leave this while you have the opportunity and retreat to the legion thus he fall fight a few moment after and save he man by he own death li -- we soldier be hard press on every side be dislodge from they position with the loss of forty-six centurion but the tenth legion which have be post in reserve on ground a little more level check the gaul in they eager pursuit it be support by the cohort of the thirteenth legion which be lead from the smaller camp have under the command of titus sextius occupy the higher ground the legion as soon as they reach the plain halted and face the enemy vercingetorix lead back he man from the part of the hill within the fortification on that day little less than seven hundred of the soldier be miss lii -- on the next day caesar have call a meeting censure the rashness and avarice of he soldier in that they have judge for themselves how far they ought to proceed or what they ought to do and could not be keep back by the tribune of the soldier and the lieutenant and state what the disadvantage of the ground could effect what opinion he himself have entertain at avaricum when have surprise the enemy without either general or cavalry he have give up a certain victory lest even a trifling loss should occur in the contest owe to the disadvantage of position that as much as he admire the greatness of they courage since neither the fortification of the camp nor the height of the mountain nor the wall of the town could retard they in the same degree he censure they licentiousness and arrogance because they think that they know more than they general concern victory and the issue of action : and that he require in he soldier forbearance and self-command not less than valor and magnanimity liii -- have hold this assembly and have encourage the soldier at the conclusion of he speech that they should not be dispirit on this account nor attribute to the valor of the enemy what the disadvantage of position have cause entertain the same view of he departure that he have previously have he lead forth the legion from the camp and draw up he army in order of battle in a suitable place when vercingetorix nevertheless would not descend to the level ground a slight cavalry action and that a successful one have take place he lead back he army into the camp when he have do this the next day think that he have do enough to lower the pride of the gaul and to encourage the mind of he soldier he move he camp in the direction of the aeduus the enemy not even then pursue we on the third day he repair the bridge over the river allier and lead over he whole army liv -- have then hold a interview with viridomarus and eporedorix the aeduan he learn that litavicus have set out with all the cavalry to raise the aeduus that it be necessary that they too should go before he to confirm the state in they allegiance although he now see distinctly the treachery of the aeduus in many thing and be of opinion that the revolt of the entire state would be hasten by they departure yet he think that they should not be detain lest he should appear either to offer a insult or betray some suspicion of fear he briefly state to they when depart he service towards the aeduus : in what a state and how humble he have find they drive into they town deprive of they land strip of all they force a tribute impose on they and hostage wrest from they with the utmost insult and to what condition and to what greatness he have raise they -lrb- so much so -rrb- that they have not only recover they former position but seem to surpass the dignity and influence of all the previous era of they history after give these admonition he dismiss they lv -- noviodunum be a town of the aeduus advantageously situate on the bank of the loire caesar have convey hither all the hostage of gaul the corn public money a great part of he own baggage and that of he army he have send hither a great number of horse which he have purchase in italy and spain on account of this war when eporedorix and viridomarus come to this place and receive information of the disposition of the state that litavicus have be admit by the aeduus into bibracte which be a town of the greatest importance among they that convictolitani the chief magistrate and a great part of the senate have go to meet he that ambassador have be publicly send to vercingetorix to negotiate a peace and alliance they think that so great a opportunity ought not to be neglect therefore have put to the sword the garrison of noviodunum and those who have assemble there for the purpose of trading or be on they march they divide the money and horse among themselves they take care that the hostage of the -lrb- different -rrb- state should be bring to bibracte to the chief magistrate they burn the town to prevent its being of any service to the roman as they be of opinion that they could not hold it they carry away in they vessel whatever corn they could in the hurry they destroy the remainder by -lrb- throw it -rrb- into the river or set it on fire they themselves begin to collect force from the neighbouring country to place guard and garrison in different position along the bank of the loire and to display the cavalry on all side to strike terror into the roman -lrb- to try -rrb- if they could cut they off from a supply of provision in which expectation they be much aid from the circumstance that the loire have swollen to such a degree from the melting of the snow that it do not seem capable of be ford at all lvi -- caesar on be inform of these movement be of opinion that he ought to make haste even if he should run some risk in complete the bridge in order that he might engage before greater force of the enemy should be collect in that place for no one even then consider it a absolutely necessary act that change he design he should direct he march into the province both because the infamy and disgrace of the thing and the intervene mount cevenne and the difficulty of the road prevent he and especially because he have serious apprehension for the safety of labienus whom he have detach and those legion whom he have send with he therefore have make very long march by day and night he come to the river loire contrary to the expectation of all and have by means of the cavalry find out a ford suitable enough consider the emergency of such depth that they arm and shoulder could be above water for support they accoutrements he disperse he cavalry in such a manner as to break the force of the current and have confound the enemy at the first sight lead he army across the river in safety and finding corn and cattle in the field after refresh he army with they he determine to march into the country of the senone lvii -- whilst these thing be be do by caesar labienus leave at agendicum the recruit who have lately arrive from italy to guard the baggage march with four legion to lutetium -lrb- which be a town of the parisius situate on a island of the river seine -rrb- whose arrival be discover by the enemy numerous force arrive from the neighbouring state the supreme command be entrust to camulogenus one of the aulercus who although almost wear out with age be call to that honor on account of he extraordinary knowledge of military tactic he when he observe that there be a large marsh which communicate with the seine and render all that country impassable encamp there and determine to prevent we troops from pass it lviii -- labienus at first attempt to raise vinea fill up the marsh with hurdle and clay and secure a road after he perceive that this be too difficult to accomplish he issue in silence from he camp at the third watch and reach melodunum by the same route by which he come this be a town of the senone situate on a island in the seine as we have just before observe of lutetium have seize upon about fifty ship and quickly join they together and have place soldier in they he intimidate by he unexpected arrival the inhabitant of whom a great number have be call out to the war and obtain possession of the town without a contest have repair the bridge which the enemy have break down during the precede day he lead over he army and begin to march along the bank of the river to lutetia the enemy on learn the circumstance from those who have escape from melodunum set fire to lutetium and order the bridge of that town to be break down : they themselves set out from the marsh and take they position on the bank of the seine over against lutetium and opposite the camp of labienus lix -- caesar be now report to have depart from gergovium intelligence be likewise bring to they concern the revolt of the aeduus and a successful rise in gaul and that caesar have be prevent from prosecute he journey and cross the loire and have be compel by the want of corn have march hastily to the province but the bellovacus who have be previously disaffected of themselves on learn the revolt of the aeduus begin to assemble force and openly to prepare for war then labienus as the change in affair be so great thought that he must adopt a very different system from what he have previously intend and he do not now think of make any new acquisition or of provoke the enemy to a action but that he might bring back he army safe to agendicum for on one side the bellovacus a state which hold the highest reputation for prowess in gaul be press on he and camulogenus with a disciplined and well-equipped army hold the other side moreover a very great river separate and cut off the legion from the garrison and baggage he see that in consequence of such great difficulty be throw in he way he must seek aid from he own energy of disposition lx -- have therefore call a council of war a little before evening he exhort he soldier to execute with diligence and energy such command as he should give he assign the ship which he have bring from melodunum to roman knight one to each and order they to fall down the river silently for four mile at the end of the fourth watch and there wait for he he leave the five cohort which he consider to be the most steady in action to guard the camp he order the five remain cohort of the same legion to proceed a little after midnight up the river with all they baggage in a great tumult he collect also some small boat and send they in the same direction with order to make a loud noise in rowing he himself a little after march out in silence and at the head of three legion seek that place to which he have order the ship to be bring lxi -- when he have arrive there the enemy 's scout as they be station along every part of the river not expect a attack because a great storm have suddenly arise be surprise by we soldier : the infantry and cavalry be quickly transport under the superintendence of the roman knight whom he have appoint to that office almost at the same time a little before daylight intelligence be give to the enemy that there be a unusual tumult in the camp of the roman and that a strong force be march up the river and that the sound of oar be distinctly hear in the same quarter and that soldier be be convey across in ship a little below on hear these thing because they be of opinion that the legion be pass in three different place and that the entire army be terrify by the revolt of the aeduus be prepare for flight they divide they force also into three division for leave a guard opposite to the camp and send a small body in the direction of metiosedum with order to advance as far as the ship would proceed they lead the rest of they troops against labienus lxii -- by day-break all we soldier be bring across and the army of the enemy be in sight labienus have encourage he soldier to retain the memory of they ancient valor and so many most successful action and imagine caesar himself under whose command they have so often route the enemy to be present give the signal for action at the first onset the enemy be beat and put to flight in the right wing where the seventh legion stand : on the left wing which position the twelfth legion hold although the first rank fall transfix by the javelin of the roman yet the rest resist most bravely nor do any one of they show the slightest intention of fly camulogenus the general of the enemy be present and encourage he troops but when the issue of the victory be still uncertain and the circumstance which be take place on the left wing be announce to the tribune of the seventh legion they face about they legion to the enemy 's rear and attack it : not even then do any one retreat but all be surround and slay camulogenus meet the same fate but those who be leave as a guard opposite the camp of labienus when they hear that the battle be commence march to aid they countryman and take possession of a hill but be unable to withstand the attack of the victorious soldier in this manner mix with they own fugitive such as the wood and mountain do not shelter be cut to piece by we cavalry when this battle be finish labienus return to agendicum where the baggage of the whole army have be leave : from it he march with all he force to caesar lxiii -- the revolt of the aeduus be know the war grow more dangerous embassy be send by they in all direction : as far as they can prevail by influence authority or money they strive to excite the state -lrb- to revolt -rrb- have get possession of the hostage whom caesar have deposit with they they terrify the hesitate by put they to death the aeduus request vercingetorix to come to they and communicate he plan of conduct the war on obtain this request they insist that the chief command should be assign to they and when the affair become a dispute question a council of all gaul be summon to bibracte they come together in great number and from every quarter to the same place the decision be leave to the vote of the mass : all to a man approve of vercingetorix as they general the remus lingone and trevirus be absent from this meet the two former because they attach themselves to the alliance of rome the trevirus because they be very remote and be hard press by the german which be also the reason of they be absent during the whole war and they send auxiliary to neither party the aeduus be highly indignant at be deprive of the chief command they lament the change of fortune and miss caesar 's indulgence towards they however after engage in the war they do not dare to pursue they own measure apart from the rest eporedorix and viridomarus youth of the greatest promise submit reluctantly to vercingetorix lxiv -- the latter demand hostage from the remain state : nay more appoint a day for this proceeding he order all the cavalry fifteen thousand in number to quickly assemble here he say that he will be content with the infantry which he have before and would not tempt fortune nor come to a regular engagement but since he have abundance of cavalry it would be very easy for he to prevent the roman from obtain forage or corn provide that they themselves should resolutely destroy they corn and set fire to they house by which sacrifice of private property they would evidently obtain perpetual dominion and freedom after arrange these matter he levy ten thousand infantry on the aeduus and segusianus who border on we province : to these he add eight hundred horse he set over they the brother of eporedorix and order he to wage war against the allobroge on the other side he send the gabalus and the nearest canton of the arvernus against the helvius he likewise send the rutenus and cadurcus to lay waste the territory of the volcae arecomici besides by secret message and embassy he tamper with the allobroge whose mind he hope have not yet settle down after the excitement of the late war to they noble he promise money and to they state the dominion of the whole province lxv -- the only guard provide against all these contingency be twenty-two cohort which be collect from the entire province by lucius caesar the lieutenant and oppose to the enemy in every quarter the helvius voluntarily engage in battle with they neighbor be defeat and caius valerius donotaurus the son of caburus the principal man of the state and several other be slay they be force to retire within they town and fortification the allobroge place guard along the course of the rhine defend they frontier with great vigilance and energy caesar as he perceive that the enemy be superior in cavalry and he himself could receive no aid from the province or italy while all communication be cut off send across the rhine into germany to those state which he have subdue in the precede campaign and summons from they cavalry and the light-armed infantry who be accustom to engage among they on they arrival as they be mount on unserviceable horse he take horse from the military tribune and the rest nay even from the roman knight and veteran and distribute they among the german lxvi -- in the meantime whilst these thing be go on the force of the enemy from the arvernus and the cavalry which have be demand from all gaul meet together a great number of these have be collect when caesar be march into the country of the sequanus through the confines of the lingone in order that he might the more easily render aid to the province vercingetorix encamp in three camp about ten mile from the roman : and have summon the commander of the cavalry to a council he show that the time of victory be come that the roman be flee into the province and leave gaul that this be sufficient for obtain immediate freedom but be of little moment in acquire peace and tranquillity for the future for the roman would return after assemble greater force and would not put a end to the war therefore they should attack they on they march when encumber if the infantry should -lrb- be oblige to -rrb- relieve they cavalry and be retard by do so the march could not be accomplish : if abandon they baggage they should provide for they safety -lrb- a result which he trust be more likely to ensue -rrb- they would lose both property and character for as to the enemy 's horse they ought not to entertain a doubt that none of they would dare to advance beyond the main body in order that they -lrb- the gaul -rrb- may do so with greater spirit he would marshal all they force before the camp and intimidate the enemy the cavalry unanimously shout out that they ought to bind themselves by a most sacred oath that he should not be receive under a roof nor have access to he child parent or wife who shall not twice have ride through the enemy 's army lxvii -- this proposal receive general approbation and all be force to take the oath on the next day the cavalry be divide into three part and two of these division make a demonstration on we two flank while one in front begin to obstruct we march on this circumstance be announce caesar order he cavalry also to form three division and charge the enemy then the action commence simultaneously in every part : the main body halt the baggage be receive within the rank of the legion if we man seem to be distressed or hard press in any quarter caesar usually order the troops to advance and the army to wheel round in that quarter which conduct retard the enemy in the pursuit and encourage we man by the hope of support at length the german on the right wing have gain the top of the hill dislodge the enemy from they position and pursue they even as far as the river at which vercingetorix with the infantry be station and slay several of they the rest on observe this action fear lest they should be surround betake themselves to flight a slaughter ensue in every direction and three of the noblest of the audus be take and bring to caesar : cotus the commander of the cavalry who have be engage in the contest with convictolitani the last election cavarillus who have hold the command of the infantry after the revolt of litavicus and eporedorix under whose command the aeduus have engage in war against the sequanus before the arrival of caesar lxviii -- all he cavalry be route vercingetorix lead back he troops in the same order as he have arrange they before the camp and immediately begin to march to alesium which be a town of the mandubius and order the baggage to be speedily bring forth from the camp and follow he closely caesar have convey he baggage to the nearest hill and have leave two legion to guard it pursue as far as the time of day would permit and after slaying about three thousand of the rear of the enemy encamp at alesium on the next day on reconnoitr the situation of the city finding that the enemy be panic-stricken because the cavalry in which they place they chief reliance be beat he encourage he man to endure the toil and begin to draw a line of circumvallation round alesium lxix -- the town itself be situate on the top of a hill in a very lofty position so that it do not appear likely to be take except by a regular siege two river on two different side wash the foot of the hill before the town lay a plain of about three mile in length on every other side hill at a moderate distance and of a equal degree of height surround the town the army of the gaul have fill all the space under the wall comprise the part of the hill which look to the rise sun and have draw in front a trench and a stone wall six foot high the circuit of that fortification which be commence by the roman comprise eleven mile the camp be pitch in a strong position and twenty-three redoubt be raise in it in which sentinel be place by day lest any sally should be make suddenly and by night the same be occupy by watch and strong guard lxx-the work have be begin a cavalry action ensue in that plain which we have already describe as break by hill and extend three mile in length the contest be maintain on both side with the utmost vigor caesar send the german to aid we troops when distressed and draw up the legion in front of the camp lest any sally should be suddenly make by the enemy 's infantry the courage of we man be increase by the additional support of the legion the enemy be put to flight hinder one another by they number and as only the narrower gate be leave open be crowd together in they then the german pursue they with vigor even to the fortification a great slaughter ensue some leave they horse and endeavor to cross the ditch and climb the wall caesar order the legion which he have draw up in front of the rampart to advance a little the gaul who be within the fortification be no less panic-stricken thinking that the enemy be come that moment against they and unanimously shout to arm some in they alarm rush into the town vercingetorix order the gate to be shut lest the camp should be leave undefended the german retreat after slaying many and take several horse lxxi -- vercingetorix adopt the design of send away all he cavalry by night before the fortification should be complete by the roman he charge they when depart that each of they should go to he respective state and press for the war all who be old enough to bear arm he state he own merit and conjure they to consider he safety and not surrender he who have deserve so well of the general freedom to the enemy for torture he point out to they that if they should be remiss eighty thousand choose man would perish with he that upon make a calculation he have barely corn for thirty day but could hold out a little longer by economy after give these instruction he silently dismiss the cavalry in the second watch -lrb- on that side -rrb- where we work be not complete he order all the corn to be bring to himself he ordain capital punishment to such as should not obey he distribute among they man by man the cattle great quantity of which have be drive there by the mandubius he begin to measure out the corn sparingly and by little and little he receive into the town all the force which he have post in front of it in this manner he prepare to await the succor from gaul and carry on the war lxxii -- caesar on learn these proceedings from the deserter and captive adopt the follow system of fortification he dig a trench twenty foot deep with perpendicular side in such a manner that the base of this trench should extend so far as the edge be apart at the top he raise all he other work at a distance of four hundred foot from that ditch -lrb- he do -rrb- that with this intention lest -lrb- since he necessarily embrace so extensive a area and the whole work could not be easily surround by a line of soldier -rrb- a large number of the enemy should suddenly or by night sally against the fortification or lest they should by day cast weapon against we man while occupy with the work have leave this interval he draw two trench fifteen foot broad and of the same depth the innermost of they be in low and level ground he fill with water convey from the river behind these he raise a rampart and wall twelve foot high : to this he add a parapet and battlements with large stake cut like stag ' horn project from the junction of the parapet and battlements to prevent the enemy from scale it and surround the entire work with turret which be eighty foot distant from one another lxxiii -- it be necessary at one and the same time to procure timber -lrb- for the rampart -rrb- lay in supplies of corn and raise also extensive fortification and the available troops be in consequence of this reduce in number since they use to advance to some distance from the camp and sometimes the gaul endeavor to attack we work and to make a sally from the town by several gate and in great force on which caesar think that further addition should be make to these work in order that the fortification might be defensible by a small number of soldier have therefore cut down the trunk of tree or very thick branch and have strip they top of the bark and sharpen they into a point he draw a continue trench everywhere five foot deep these stake be sink into this trench and fasten firmly at the bottom to prevent the possibility of they be tear up have they branch only project from the ground there be five row in connection with and intersect each other and whoever enter within they be likely to impale themselves on very sharp stake the soldier call these cippus before these which be arrange in oblique row in the form of a quincunx pit three foot deep be dig which gradually diminish in depth to the bottom in these pit taper stake of the thickness of a man 's thigh sharpen at the top and harden in the fire be sink in such a manner as to project from the ground not more than four inch at the same time for the purpose of give they strength and stability they be each fill with trample clay to the height of one foot from the bottom : the rest of the pit be cover over with osier and twig to conceal the deceit eight row of this kind be dig and be three foot distant from each other they call this a lily from its resemblance to that flower stake a foot long with iron hook attach to they be entirely sink in the ground before these and be plant in every place at small interval these they call spur lxxiv -- after complete these work have select as level ground as he could consider the nature of the country and have enclose a area of fourteen mile he construct against a external enemy fortification of the same kind in every respect and separate from these so that the guard of the fortification could not be surround even by immense number if such a circumstance should take place owe to the departure of the enemy 's cavalry and in order that the roman soldier might not be compel to go out of the camp with great risk he order all to provide forage and corn for thirty day lxxv -- whilst those thing be carry on at alesium the gaul have convene a council of they chief nobility determine that all who could bear arm should not be call out which be the opinion of vercingetorix but that a fixed number should be levy from each state lest when so great a multitude assemble together they could neither govern nor distinguish they man nor have the means of supply they with corn they demand thirty-five thousand man from the aeduus and they dependent the segusiani ambivaretus and aulercus brannovice a equal number from the arvernus in conjunction with the eleutetus cadurcus gabalus and velaunus who be accustom to be under the command of the arvernus twelve thousand each from the senone sequani biturige santone rutenus and carnute ten thousand from the bellovacus the same number from the lemovicus eight thousand each from the pictone and turonus and parisius and helvius five thousand each from the suessione ambiani mediomatricus petrocorius nervius morinus and nitiobrige the same number from the aulercus cenomanus four thousand from the atrebate three thousand each from the bellocassus lexovius and aulercus eburovice thirty thousand from the rauracus and boius six thousand from all the state together which border on the atlantic and which in they dialect be call armorica -lrb- in which number be comprehend the curisolite rhedone ambibarus calte osismii lemovice venetus and unellus -rrb- of these the bellovacus do not contribute they number as they say that they would wage war against the roman on they own account and at they own discretion and would not obey the order of any one : however at the request of commius they send two thousand in consideration of a tie of hospitality which subsist between he and they lxxvi -- caesar have as we have previously narrated avail himself of the faithful and valuable service of this commius in britain in former year : in consideration of which merit he have exempt from tax he -lrb- commius 's -rrb- state and have confer on commius himself the country of the morinus yet such be the unanimity of the gaul in assert they freedom and recover they ancient renown in war that they be influence neither by favor nor by the recollection of private friendship and all earnestly direct they energy and resource to that war and collect eight thousand cavalry and about two hundred and forty thousand infantry these be review in the country of the aeduus and a calculation be make of they number : commander be appoint : the supreme command be entrust to commius the atrebatian viridomarus and eporedorix the aeduan and vergasillaunus the arvernian the cousin-german of vercingetorix to they be assign man select from each state by whose advice the war should be conduct all march to alesia sanguine and full of confidence : nor be there a single individual who imagine that the roman could withstand the sight of such a immense host : especially in a action carry on both in front and rear when -lrb- on the inside -rrb- the besiege would sally from the town and attack the enemy and on the outside so great force of cavalry and infantry would be see lxxvii -- but those who be blockade at alesium the day be past on which they have expect auxiliary from they countryman and all they corn be consume ignorant of what be go on among the aeduus convene a assembly and deliberate on the exigency of they situation after various opinion have be express among they some of which propose a surrender other a sally whilst they strength would support it the speech of critognatus ought not to be omit for its singular and detestable cruelty he spring from the noblest family among the arvernus and possess great influence say i shall pay no attention to the opinion of those who call a most disgraceful surrender by the name of a capitulation nor do i think that they ought to be consider as citizen or summon to the council my business be with those who approve of a sally : in whose advice the memory of we ancient prowess seem to dwell in the opinion of you all to be unable to bear privation for a short time be disgraceful cowardice not true valor those who voluntarily offer themselves to death be more easily find than those who would calmly endure distress and i would approve of this opinion -lrb- for honor be a powerful motive with I -rrb- could i foresee no other loss save that of life : but let we in adopt we design look back on all gaul which we have stir up to we aid what courage do you think would we relative and friend have if eighty thousand man be butcher in one spot suppose that they should be force to come to a action almost over we corpse do not utterly deprive they of you aid for they have spurn all thought of personal danger on account of you safety nor by you folly rashness and cowardice crush all gaul and doom it to a eternal slavery do you doubt they fidelity and firmness because they have not come at the appoint day what then do you suppose that the roman be employ every day in the outer fortification for mere amusement if you can not be assure by they despatch since every avenue be block up take the roman as evidence that they approach be draw near since they intimidate by alarm at this labor night and day at they work what therefore be my design to do as we ancestor do in the war against the cimbrus and teutone which be by no means equally momentous who when drive into they town and oppress by similar privation support life by the corpse of those who appear useless for war on account of they age and do not surrender to the enemy : and even if we have not a precedent for such cruel conduct still i should consider it most glorious that one should be establish and deliver to posterity for in what be that war like this the cimbrus after lay gaul waste and inflict great calamity at length depart from we country and seek other land they leave we we rights law land and liberty but what other motive or wish have the roman than induce by envy to settle in the land and state of those whom they have learn by fame to be noble and powerful in war and impose on they perpetual slavery for they never have carry on war on any other term but if you know not these thing which be go on in distant country look to the neighbouring gaul which be reduce to the form of a province strip of its rights and law and subject to roman despotism be oppress by perpetual slavery lxxviii -- when different opinion be express they determine that those who owe to age or ill health be unserviceable for war should depart from the town and that themselves should try every expedient before they have recourse to the advice of critognatus : however that they would rather adopt that design if circumstance should compel they and they ally should delay than accept any term of a surrender or peace the mandubius who have admit they into the town be compel to go forth with they wife and child when these come to the roman fortification weep they beg of the soldier by every entreaty to receive they as slave and relieve they with food but caesar placing guard on the rampart forbid they to be admit lxxix -- in the meantime commius and the rest of the leader to whom the supreme command have be intrust come with all they force to alesium and have occupy the entire hill encamp not more than a mile from we fortification the following day have lead forth they cavalry from the camp they fill all that plain which we have relate extended three mile in length and draw out they infantry a little from that place and post they on the higher ground the town alesium command a view of the whole plain the besiege run together when these auxiliary be see mutual congratulation ensue and the mind of all be elate with joy accordingly draw out they troops they encamp before the town and cover the nearest trench with hurdle and fill it up with earth and make ready for a sally and every casualty lxxx -- caesar have station he army on both side of the fortification in order that if occasion should arise each should hold and know he own post order the cavalry to issue forth from the camp and commence action there be a commanding view from the entire camp which occupy a ridge of hill and the mind of all the soldier anxiously await the issue of the battle the gaul have scatter archer and light-armed infantry here and there among they cavalry to give relief to they retreat troops and sustain the impetuosity of we cavalry several of we soldier be unexpectedly wound by these and leave the battle when the gaul be confident that they countryman be the conqueror in the action and behold we man hard press by number both those who be hem in by the line of circumvallation and those who have come to aid they support the spirit of they man by shout and yell from every quarter as the action be carry on in sight of all neither a brave nor cowardly act could be conceal both the desire of praise and the fear of ignominy urge on each party to valor after fight from noon almost to sunset without victory inclining in favor of either the german on one side make a charge against the enemy in a compact body and drive they back and when they be put to flight the archer be surround and cut to piece in other part likewise we man pursue to the camp the retreat enemy and do not give they a opportunity of rally but those who have come forth from alesium return into the town dejected and almost despairing of success lxxxi -- the gaul after the interval of a day and after make during that time a immense number of hurdle scale ladder and iron hook silently go forth from the camp at midnight and approach the fortification in the plain raise a shout suddenly that by this intimation those who be besiege in the town might learn they arrival they begin to cast down hurdle and dislodge we man from the rampart by sling arrow and stone and execute the other movement which be requisite in storm at the same time vercingetorix have hear the shout give the signal to he troops by a trumpet and lead they forth from the town we troops as each man 's post have be assign he some day before man the fortification they intimidate the gaul by sling large stone stake which they have place along the work and bullet all view be prevent by the darkness many wound be receive on both side several missile be throw from the engine but marcus antonius and caius trebonius the lieutenant to whom the defense of these part have be allot draughted troops from the redoubt which be more remote and send they to aid we troops in whatever direction they understand that they be hard press lxxxii -- whilst the gaul be at a distance from the fortification they do more execution owe to the immense number of they weapon : after they come nearer they either unawares empale themselves on the spur or be pierce by the mural dart from the rampart and tower and thus perish after receive many wound on all side and have force no part of the work when day draw nigh fear lest they should be surround by a sally make from the higher camp on the expose flank they retreat to they countryman but those within whilst they bring forward those thing which have be prepare by vercingetorix for a sally fill up the nearest trench have delay a long time in execute these movement they learn the retreat of they countryman before they draw nigh to the fortification thus they return to the town without accomplish they object lxxxiii -- the gaul have be twice repulse with great loss consult what they should do : they avail themselves of the information of those who be well acquaint with the country from they they ascertain the position and fortification of the upper camp there be on the north side a hill which we man could not include in they work on account of the extent of the circuit and have necessarily make they camp in ground almost disadvantageous and pretty steep caius antistius reginus and caius caninius rebilus two of the lieutenant with two legion be in possession of this camp the leader of the enemy have reconnoitr the country by they scout select from the entire army sixty thousand man belong to those state which bear the highest character for courage : they privately arrange among themselves what they wish to be do and in what manner they decide that the attack should take place when it should seem to be noon they appoint over they force vergasillaunus the arvernian one of the four general and a near relative of vercingetorix he have issue from the camp at the first watch and have almost complete he march a little before the dawn hide himself behind the mountain and order he soldier to refresh themselves after they labor during the night when noon now seem to draw nigh he march hastily against that camp which we have mention before and at the same time the cavalry begin to approach the fortification in the plain and the rest of the force to make a demonstration in front of the camp lxxxiv -- vercingetorix have behold he countryman from the citadel of alesium issue forth from the town he bring forth from the camp long hook movable pent-house mural hook and other thing which he have prepare for the purpose of make a sally they engage on all side at once and every expedient be adopt they flock to whatever part of the work seem weakest the army of the roman be distribute along they extensive line and with difficulty meet the enemy in every quarter the shout which be raise by the combatant in they rear have a great tendency to intimidate we man because they perceive that they danger rest on the valor of other : for generally all evil which be distant most powerfully alarm man 's mind lxxxv -- caesar have select a commanding situation see distinctly whatever be go on in every quarter and send assistance to he troops when hard press the idea uppermost in the mind of both party be that the present be the time in which they would have the fairest opportunity of make a struggle the gaul despair of all safety unless they should succeed in force the line : the roman expect a end to all they labor if they should gain the day the principal struggle be at the upper line to which we have say vergasillaunus be send the least elevation of ground add to a declivity exercise a momentous influence some be cast missile other form a testudo advance to the attack fresh man by turn relieve the wearied the earth heap up by all against the fortification give the means of ascent to the gaul and cover those work which the roman have conceal in the ground we man have no longer arm or strength lxxxvi -- caesar on observe these movement send labienus with six cohort to relieve he distressed soldier : he order he if he should be unable to withstand they to draw off the cohort and make a sally but not to do this except through necessity he himself go to the rest and exhort they not to succumb to the toil he show they that the fruit of all former engagement depend on that day and hour the gaul within despairing of force the fortification in the plain on account of the greatness of the work attempt the place precipitous in ascent : hither they bring the engine which they have prepare by the immense number of they missile they dislodge the defender from the turret : they fill the ditch with clay and hurdle then clear the way they tear down the rampart and breast-work with hook lxxxvii -- caesar send at first young brutus with six cohort and afterwards caius fabius he lieutenant with seven other : finally as they fight more obstinately he lead up fresh man to the assistance of he soldier after renew the action and repulse the enemy he march in the direction in which he have send labienus draft four cohort from the nearest redoubt and order part of the cavalry to follow he and part to make the circuit of the external fortification and attack the enemy in the rear labienus when neither the rampart or ditch could check the onset of the enemy inform caesar by messenger of what he intend to do caesar hasten to share in the action lxxxviii -- he arrival be know from the color of he robe and the troops of cavalry and the cohort which he have order to follow he be see as these low and sloping grounds be plainly visible from the eminence the enemy join battle a shout be raise by both side it be succeed by a general shout along the rampart and whole line of fortification we troops lay aside they javelin carry on the engagement with they sword the cavalry be suddenly see in the rear of the gaul : the other cohort advance rapidly the enemy turn they back the cavalry intercept they in they flight and a great slaughter ensue sedulius the general and chief of the lemovice be slay vergasillaunus the arvernian be take alive in the flight seventy-four military standard be bring to caesar and few out of so great a number return safe to they camp the besiege beholding from the town the slaughter and flight of they countryman despair of safety lead back they troops from the fortification a flight of the gaul from they camp immediately ensue on hearing of this disaster and have not the soldier be weary by send frequent reinforcement and the labor of the entire day all the enemy 's force could have be destroy immediately after midnight the cavalry be send out and overtake the rear a great number be take or cut to piece the rest by flight escape in different direction to they respective state vercingetorix have convene a council the follow day declare that he have undertake that war not on account of he own exigency but on account of the general freedom and since he must yield to fortune he offer himself to they for either purpose whether they should wish to atone to the roman by he death or surrender he alive ambassador be send to caesar on this subject he order they arm to be surrender and they chieftain deliver up he seat himself at the head of the line in front of the camp the gallic chieftain be bring before he they surrender vercingetorix and lay down they arm reserve the aeduus and arvernus -lrb- to try -rrb- if he could gain over through they influence they respective state he distribute one of the remain captive to each soldier throughout the entire army as plunder xc -- after make these arrangement he march into the -lrb- country of the -rrb- aeduus and recover that state to this place ambassador be send by the arvernus who promise that they will execute he command he demand a great number of hostage he send the legion to winter quarter he restore about twenty thousand captive to the aeduus and arvernus he order titus labienus to march into the -lrb- country of the -rrb- sequanus with two legion and the cavalry and to he he attach marcus sempronius rutilus he place caius fabius and lucius minucius basilus with two legion in the country of the remus lest they should sustain any loss from the bellovacus in they neighborhood he send caius antistius reginus into the -lrb- country of the -rrb- ambivaretus titus sextius into the territory of the biturige and caius caninius rebilus into those of the rutenus with one legion each he station quintus tullius cicero and publius sulpicius among the aeduus at cabillo and matisco on the saone to procure supplies of corn he himself determine to winter at bibracte a supplication of twenty day be decree by the senate at rome on learn these success from caesar 's despatch book viii continuation of caesar 's gallic war ascribe to aulus hirtius preface prevail on by you continued solicitation balbus i have engage in a most difficult task as my daily refusal appear to plead not my inability but indolence as a excuse i have compile a continuation of the commentary of we caesar 's war in gaul not indeed to be compare to he writings which either precede or follow they and recently i have complete what he leave imperfect after the transaction in alexandrium to the end not indeed of the civil broil to which we see no issue but of caesar 's life i wish that those who may read they could know how unwillingly i undertake to write they as then i might the more readily escape the imputation of folly and arrogance in presume to intrude among caesar 's writings for it be agree on all hand that no composition be ever execute with so great care that it be not exceed in elegance by these commentary which be publish for the use of historian that they might not want memoirs of such achievement and they stand so high in the esteem of all man that historian seem rather deprive of than furnished with material at which we have more reason to be surprised than other man for they can only appreciate the elegance and correctness with which he finish they while we know with what ease and expedition caesar possess not only a uncommon flow of language and elegance of style but also a thorough knowledge of the method of convey he idea but i have not even the good fortune to share in the alexandrian or african war and though these be partly communicate to I by caesar himself in conversation yet we listen with a different degree of attention to those thing which strike we with admiration by they novelty and those which we design to attest to posterity but in truth whilst i urge every apology that i may not be compare to caesar i incur the charge of vanity by think it possible that i can in the judgment of any one be put in competition with he farewell i -- gaul be entirely reduce when caesar have wage war incessantly during the former summer wish to recruit he soldier after so much fatigue by repose in winter quarter news be bring he that several state be simultaneously renew they hostile intention and form combination for which a probable reason be assign : namely that the gaul be convince that they be not able to resist the roman with any force they could collect in one place and hope that if several state make war in different place at the same time the roman army would neither have aid nor time nor force to prosecute they all : nor ought any single state to decline any inconvenience that might befall they provide that by such delay the rest should be enable to assert they liberty ii -- that this notion might not be confirm among the gaul caesar left marcus antonius he quaestor in charge of he quarter and set out himself with a guard of horse the day before the kalends of January from the town bibracte to the thirteenth legion which he have station in the country of the biturige not far from the territory of the aeduus and join to it the eleventh legion which be next it leave two cohort to guard the baggage he lead the rest of he army into the most plentiful part of the country of the biturige who possess a extensive territory and several town be not to be deter by a single legion quarter among they from make warlike preparation and form combination iii-by caesar 's sudden arrival it happen as it necessarily must to a unprovided and dispersed people that they be surprise by we horse whilst cultivate the field without any apprehension before they have time to fly to they town for the usual sign of a enemy 's invasion which be generally intimate by the burning of they town be forbid by caesar 's order : lest if he advance far forage and corn should become scarce or the enemy be warn by the fire to make they escape many thousand be take as many of the biturige as be able to escape the first come of the roman flee to the neighbouring state rely either on private friendship or public alliance in vain for caesar by hasty march anticipate they in every place nor do he allow any state leisure to consider the safety of other in preference to they own by this activity he both retain he friend in they loyalty and by fear oblige the waver to accept offer of peace such offer be make to the biturige when they perceive that through caesar 's clemency a avenue be open to he friendship and that the neighbouring state have give hostage without incur any punishment and have be receive under he protection they do the same iv-caesar promise he soldier as a reward for they labor and patience in cheerfully submit to hardship from the severity of the winter the difficulty of the road and the intolerable cold two hundred sestertius each and to every centurian two thousand to be give instead of plunder and send he legion back to quarter he himself return on the fortieth day to bibracte whilst he be dispense justice there the biturige send ambassador to he to entreat he aid against the carnute who they complain have make war against they upon this intelligence though he have not remain more than eighteen day in winter quarter he draw the fourteenth and sixth legion out of quarter on the saone where he have post they as mention in a former commentary to procure supplies of corn with these two legion he march in pursuit of the carnute v -- when the news of the approach of we army reach the enemy the carnute terrify by the suffering of other state desert they village and town -lrb- which be small building raise in a hurry to meet the immediate necessity in which they live to shelter themselves against the winter for be lately conquer they have lose several town -rrb- and dispersed and flee caesar unwilling to expose he soldier to the violent storm that break out especially at that season take up he quarter at genabum a town of the carnute and lodge he man in house partly belong to the gaul and partly build to shelter the tent and hastily cover with thatch but the horse and auxiliary he send to all part to which he be tell the enemy have march and not without effect as we man generally return load with booty the carnute overpower by the severity of the winter and the fear of danger and not daring to continue long in any place as they be drive from they house and not find sufficient protection in the wood from the violence of the storm after lose a considerable number of they man disperse and take refuge among the neighbouring state vi -- caesar be contented at so severe a season to disperse the gathering foe and prevent any new war from break out and be convince as far as reason could foresee that no war of consequence could be set on foot in the summer campaign station caius trebonius with the two legion which he have with he in quarter at genabum : and be inform by frequent embassy from the remus that the bellovacus -lrb- who exceed all the gaul and belga in military prowess -rrb- and the neighbouring state head by correus one of the bellovacus and comius the atrebatian be raise a army and assemble at a general rendezvous design with they united force to invade the territory of the suessione who be put under the patronage of the remus : and moreover consider that not only he honor but he interest be concern that such of he ally as deserve well of the republic should suffer no calamity he again draw the eleventh legion out of quarter and write besides to caius fabius to march with he two legion to the country of the suessione and he send to trebonius for one of he two legion thus as far as the convenience of the quarter and the management of the war admit he lay the burden of the expedition on the legion by turn without any intermission to he own toil vii -- as soon as he troops be collect he march against the bellovacus : and pitch he camp in they territory detach troops of horse all round the country to take prisoner from whom he might learn the enemy 's plan the horse have execute he order bring he back word that but few be find in the house : and that even these have not stay at home to cultivate they land -lrb- for the emigration be general from all part -rrb- but have be send back to watch we motion upon caesar 's inquire from they where the main body of the bellovacus be post and what be they design : they make answer that all the bellovacus fit for carry arm have assemble in one place and along with they the ambiani aulercus calete velocass and atrebate and that they have choose for they camp a elevated position surround by a dangerous morass : that they have convey all they baggage into the most remote wood : that several nobleman be unite in the management of the war but that the people be most inclined to be govern by correus because they know that he have the strongest aversion to the name of the roman people : that a few day before comius have leave the camp to engage the german to they aid whose nation border on theirs and whose number be countless : that the bellovacus have come to a resolution with the consent of all the general and the earnest desire of the people if caesar should come with only three legion as be report to give he battle that they might not be oblige to encounter he whole army on a future occasion when they should be in a more wretched and distressed condition but if he bring a stronger force they intend to remain in the position they have choose and by ambuscade to prevent the roman from get forage -lrb- which at that season be both scarce and much scatter -rrb- corn and other necessaries viii -- when caesar be convince of the truth of this account from the concur testimony of several person and perceive that the plan which be propose be full of prudence and very unlike the rash resolve of a barbarous people he consider it incumbent on he to use every exertion in order that the enemy might despise he small force and come to a action for he have three veteran legion of distinguished valor the seventh eighth and ninth the eleventh consist of choose youth of great hope who have serve eight campaign but who compare with the other have not yet acquire any great reputation for experience and valor call therefore a council and lay before it the intelligence which he have receive he encourage he soldier in order if possible to entice the enemy to a engagement by the appearance of only three legion he range he army in the follow manner : that the seventh eighth and ninth legion should march before all the baggage that then the eleventh should bring up the rear of the whole train of baggage -lrb- which however be but small as be usual on such expedition -rrb- so that the enemy could not get a sight of a greater number than they themselves be willing to encounter by this disposition he form he army almost into a square and bring they within sight of the enemy sooner than be anticipate ix -- when the gaul whose bold resolution have be report to caesar see the legion advance with a regular motion draw up in battle array either from the danger of a engagement or we sudden approach or with the design of watch we movement they draw up they force before the camp and do not quit the rise ground though caesar wish to bring they to battle yet be surprise to see so vast a host of the enemy he encamp opposite to they with a valley between they deep rather than extensive he order he camp to be fortify with a rampart twelve foot high with breast-works build on it proportion to its height and two trench each fifteen foot broad with perpendicular side to be sink : likewise several turret three story high to be raise with a communication to each other by gallery lay across and cover over which should be guard in front by small parapet of osier that the enemy might be repulse by two row of soldier the one of whom be more secure from danger by they height might throw they dart with more daring and to a greater distance the other which be nearer the enemy be station on the rampart would be protect by they gallery from dart fall on they head at the entrance he erect gate and turret of a considerable height x-caesar have a double design in this fortification for he both hope that the strength of he work and he -lrb- apparent -rrb- fear would raise confidence in the barbarian and when there should be occasion to make a distant excursion to get forage or corn he see that he camp would be secure by the work with a very small force in the meantime there be frequent skirmish across the marsh a few on both side sally out between the two camp sometimes however we gallic or german auxiliary cross the marsh and furiously pursue the enemy or on the other hand the enemy pass it and beat back we man moreover there happen in the course of we daily forage what must of necessity happen when corn be to be collect by a few scattered man out of private house that we forager disperse in a intricate country be surround by the enemy by which though we suffer but a inconsiderable loss of cattle and servant yet it raise foolish hope in the barbarian but more especially because comius who i say have go to get aid from the german return with some cavalry and though the german be only 500 yet the barbarian be elate by they arrival xi-caesar observe that the enemy keep for several day within they camp which be well secure by a morass and its natural situation and that it could not be assault without a dangerous engagement nor the place enclose with line without a addition to he army write to trebonius to send with all despatch for the thirteenth legion which be in winter-quarter among the biturige under titus sextius one of he lieutenant and then to come to he by force march with the three legion he himself send the cavalry of the remus and lingone and other state from whom he have require a vast number to guard he forage party and to support they in case of any sudden attack of the enemy xii -- as this continue for several day and they vigilance be relax by custom -lrb- a effect which be generally produce by time -rrb- the bellovacus have make themselves acquaint with the daily station of we horse lie in ambush with a select body of foot in a place cover with wood to it they send they horse the next day who be first to decoy we man into the ambuscade and then when they be surround to attack they it be the lot of the remus to fall into this snare to whom that day have be allot to perform this duty for have suddenly get sight of the enemy 's cavalry and despise they weakness in consequence of they superior number they pursue they too eagerly and be surround on every side by the foot be by this mean throw into disorder they return with more precipitation than be usual in cavalry action with the loss of vertiscus the governor of they state and the general of they horse who though scarcely able to sit on horseback through year neither in accordance with the custom of the gaul plead he age in excuse for not accept the command nor would he suffer they to fight without he the spirit of the barbarian be puff up and inflate at the success of this battle in kill the prince and general of the remus and we man be teach by this loss to examine the country and post they guard with more caution and to be more moderate in pursue a retreat enemy xiii -- in the meantime daily skirmish take place continually in view of both camp these be fight at the ford and pass of the morass in one of these contest the german whom caesar have bring over the rhine to fight intermix with the horse have resolutely cross the marsh and slay the few who make resistance and boldly pursue the rest so terrify they that not only those who be attack hand to hand or wound at a distance but even those who be station at a greater distance to support they flee disgracefully and be often beat from the rise grounds do not stop till they have retire into they camp or some impel by fear have flee farther they danger draw they whole army into such confusion that it be difficult to judge whether they be more insolent after a slight advantage or more deject by a trifling calamity xiv -- after spend several day in the same camp the guard of the bellovacus learning that caius trebonius be advance nearer with he legion and fear a siege like that of alesium send off by night all who be disable by age or infirmity or unarmed and along with they they whole baggage whilst they be prepare they disorderly and confused troop for march -lrb- for the gaul be always attend by a vast multitude of waggon even when they have very light baggage -rrb- be overtake by daylight they draw they force out before they camp to prevent the roman attempt a pursuit before the line of they baggage have advance to a considerable distance but caesar do not think it prudent to attack they when stand on they defense with such a steep hill in they favor nor keep he legion at such a distance that they could quit they post without danger : but perceive that he camp be divide from the enemy 's by a deep morass so difficult to cross that he could not pursue with expedition and that the hill beyond the morass which extend almost to the enemy 's camp be separate from it only by a small valley he lay a bridge over the morass and lead he army across and soon reach the plain on the top of the hill which be fortify on either side by a steep ascent have there draw up he army in order of battle he march to the furthest hill from which he could with he engine shower dart upon the thickest of the enemy xv -- the gaul confide in the natural strength of they position though they would not decline a engagement if the roman attempt to ascend the hill yet dare not divide they force into small party lest they should be throw into disorder by be disperse and therefore remain in order of battle caesar perceive that they persist in they resolution keep twenty cohort in battle array and measure out ground there for a camp order it to be fortify have complete he work he draw up he legion before the rampart and station the cavalry in certain position with they horse bridle when the bellovacus see the roman prepare to pursue they and that they could not wait the whole night or continue longer in the same place without provision they form the follow plan to secure a retreat they hand to one another the bundle of straw and stick on which they sit -lrb- for it be the custom of the gaul to sit when draw up in order of battle as have be assert in former commentary -rrb- of which they have great plenty in they camp and pile they in the front of they line and at the close of the day on a certain signal set they all on fire at one and the same time the continue blaze soon screen all they force from the sight of the roman which no sooner happen than the barbarian flee with the greatest precipitation xvi -- though caesar could not perceive the retreat of the enemy for the intervention of the fire yet suspect that they have adopt that method to favor they escape he make he legion advance and send a party of horse to pursue they but apprehensive of a ambuscade and that the enemy might remain in the same place and endeavor to draw we man into a disadvantageous situation he advance himself but slowly the horse be afraid to venture into the smoke and dense line of flame and those who be bold enough to attempt it be scarcely able to see they horse ' head give the enemy free liberty to retreat through fear of a ambuscade thus by a flight full at once of cowardice and address they advance without any loss about ten mile and encamp in a very strong position from which lay numerous ambuscade both of horse and foot they do considerable damage to the roman forager xvii -- after this have happen several time caesar discover from a certain prisoner that correus the general of the bellovacus have select six thousand of he bravest foot and a thousand horse with which he design to lie in ambush in a place to which he suspect the roman would send to look for forage on account of the abundance of corn and grass upon receive information of they design caesar draw out more legion than he usually do and send forward he cavalry as usual to protect the forager with these he intermix a guard of light infantry and himself advance with the legion as fast as he could xviii -- the gaul place in ambush have choose for the seat of action a level piece of bind not more than a mile in extent enclose on every side by a thick wood or a very deep river as by a toil and this they surround we man apprise of the enemy 's design march in good order to the ground ready both in heart and hand to give battle and willing to hazard any engagement when the legion be at they back on they approach as correus suppose that he have get a opportunity of effect he purpose he at first show himself with a small party and attack the foremost troops we man resolutely stand the charge and do not crowd together in one place as commonly happen from surprise in engagement between the horse whose number prove injurious to themselves xix -- when by the judicious arrangement of we force only a few of we man fight by turn and do not suffer themselves to be surround the rest of the enemy break out from the wood whilst correus be engage the battle be maintain in different part with great vigor and continue for a long time undecided till at length a body of foot gradually advance from the wood in order of battle and force we horse to give ground : the light infantry which be send before the legion to the assistance of the cavalry soon come up and mix with the horse fight with great courage the battle be for some time doubtful but as usually happen we man who stand the enemy 's first charge become superior from this very circumstance that though suddenly attack from a ambuscade they have sustain no loss in the meantime the legion be approach and several messenger arrive with notice to we man and the enemy that the -lrb- roman -rrb- general be near at hand with he force in battle array upon this intelligence we man confide in the support of the cohort fight most resolutely fear lest if they should be slow in they operation they should let the legion participate in the glory of the conquest the enemy lose courage and attempt to escape by different way in vain for they be themselves entangled in that labyrinth in which they think to entrap the roman be defeat and put to the rout and have lose the greater part of they man they flee in consternation whither-soever chance carry they some seek the wood other the river but be vigorously pursue by we man and put to the sword yet in the meantime correus unconquered by calamity could not be prevail on to quit the field and take refuge in the wood or accept we offer of quarter but fight courageously and wound several provoke we man elate with victory to discharge they weapon against he xx -- after this transaction caesar have come up immediately after the battle and imagine that the enemy upon receive the news of so great a defeat would be so depressed that they would abandon they camp which be not above eight mile distant from the scene of action though he see he passage obstruct by the river yet he march he army over and advanced but the bellovacus and the other state be inform of the loss they have sustain by a few wounded man who have escape by the shelter of the wood have return to they after the defeat and learning that everything have turn out unfavourable that correus be slay and the horse and most valiant of they foot cut off imagine that the roman be march against they and call a council in haste by sound of trumpet unanimously cry out to send ambassador and hostage to caesar xxi -- this proposal have meet with general approbation comius the atrebatian flee to those german from whom he have borrow auxiliary for that war the rest instantly send ambassador to caesar and request that he would be contented with that punishment of he enemy which if he have possess the power to inflict on they before the engagement when they be yet uninjured they be persuade from he usual clemency and mercy he never would have inflict that the power of the bellovacus be crush by the cavalry action that many thousand of they choicest foot have fall that scarce a man have escape to bring the fatal news that however the bellovacus have derive from the battle one advantage of some importance consider they loss that correus the author of the rebellion and agitator of the people be slay : for that whilst he live the senate have never equal influence in the state with the giddy populace xxii -- caesar remind the ambassador who make these supplication that the bellovacus have at the same season the year before in conjunction with other state of gaul undertake a war and that they have persevere the most obstinately of all in they purpose and be not bring to a proper way of think by the submission of the rest that he know and be aware that the guilt of a crime be easily transfer to the dead but that no one person could have such influence as to be able by the feeble support of the multitude to raise a war and carry it on without the consent of the noble in opposition to the senate and in despite of every virtuous man however he be satisfy with the punishment which they have draw upon themselves xxiii -- the night follow the ambassador bring back he answer to they countryman and prepare the hostage ambassador flock in from the other state which be wait for the issue of the -lrb- war with the -rrb- bellovacus : they give hostage and receive he order all except comius whose fear restrain he from entrust he safety to any person 's honor for the year before while caesar be hold the assizes in hither gaul titus labienus have discover that comius be tamper with the state and raise a conspiracy against caesar thought he might punish he infidelity without perfidy but judge that he would not come to he camp at he invitation and unwilling to put he on he guard by the attempt he send caius volusenus quadratus with order to have he put to death under pretence of a conference to effect he purpose he send with he some choose centurion when they come to the conference and volusenus as have be agree on have take hold of comius by the hand and one of the centurion as if surprise at so uncommon a incident attempt to kill he he be prevent by the friend of comius but wound he severely in the head by the first blow sword be draw on both side not so much with a design to fight as to effect a escape we man believe that comius have receive a mortal stroke and the gaul from the treachery which they have see dread that a deeper design lay conceal upon this transaction it be say that comius make a resolution never to come within sight of any roman xxiv -- when caesar have completely conquer the most warlike nation perceive that there be now no state which could make preparation for war to oppose he but that some be remove and flee from they country to avoid present subjection he resolve to detach he army into different part of the country he keep with himself marcus antonius the quaestor with the eleventh legion caius fabius be detach with twenty-five cohort into the remotest part of gaul because it be rumor that some state have rise in arm and he do not think that caius caninius rebilus who have the charge of that country be strong enough to protect it with two legion he order titus labienus to attend himself and send the twelfth legion which have be under he in winter quarter to hither gaul to protect the roman colony and prevent any loss by the inroad of barbarian similar to that which have happen the year before to the tergestine who be cut off by a sudden depredation and attack he himself march to depopulate the country of ambiorix whom he have terrify and force to fly but despaired of be able to reduce under he power but he think it most consistent with he honor to waste he country both of inhabitant cattle and building so that from the abhorrence of he countryman if fortune suffer any to survive he might be exclude from a return to he state for the calamity which he have bring on it xxv -- after he have send either he legion or auxiliary through every part of ambiorix 's dominion and waste the whole country by sword fire and rapine and have kill or take prodigious number he send labienus with two legion against the trevirus whose state from its vicinity to germany be engage in constant war differ but little from the german in civilization and savage barbarity and never continue in its allegiance except when awed by the presence of he army xxvi -- in the meantime caius caninius a lieutenant have receive information by letter and message from duracius who have always continue in friendship to the roman people though a part of he state have revolt that a great multitude of the enemy be in arm in the country of the pictone march to the town limonum when he be approach it he be inform by some prisoner that duracius be shut up by several thousand man under the command of dumnacus general of the ande and that limonum be besiege but not daring to face the enemy with he weak legion he encamp in a strong position : dumnacus have notice of caninius 's approach turn he whole force against the legion and prepare to assault the roman camp but after spend several day in the attempt and lose a considerable number of man without be able to make a breach in any part of the work he return again to the siege of limonum xxvii -- at the same time caius fabius a lieutenant bring back many state to they allegiance and confirm they submission by take hostage he be then inform by letter from caninius of the proceedings among the pictone upon which he set off to bring assistance to duracius but dumnacus hearing of the approach of fabius and despairing of safety if at the same time he should be force to withstand the roman army without and observe and be under apprehension from the town 's people make a precipitate retreat from that place with all he force nor do he think that he should be sufficiently secure from danger unless he lead he army across the loire which be too deep a river to pass except by a bridge though fabius have not yet come within sight of the enemy nor join caninius yet be inform of the nature of the country by person acquaint with it he judge it most likely that the enemy would take that way which he find they do take he therefore march to that bridge with he army and order he cavalry to advance no further before the legion than that they could return to the same camp at night without fatigue they horse we horse pursue accord to order and fall upon dumnacus 's rear and attack they on they march while flee dismayed and laden with baggage they slew a great number and take a rich booty have execute the affair so successfully they retire to the camp xxviii -- the night follow fabius send he horse before he with order to engage the enemy and delay they march till he himself should come up that he order might be faithfully perform quintus atius varus general of the horse a man of uncommon spirit and skill encourage he man and pursue the enemy dispose some of he troops in convenient place and with the rest give battle to the enemy the enemy 's cavalry make a bold stand the foot relieve each other and make a general halt to assist they horse against ours the battle be warmly contest for we man despise the enemy whom they have conquer the day before and know that the legion be follow they animated both by the disgrace of retreat and a desire of conclude the battle expeditiously by they own courage fight most valiantly against the foot : and the enemy imagine that no more force would come against they as they have experience the day before think they have get a favourable opportunity of destroy we whole cavalry xxix-after the conflict have continue for some time with great violence dumnacus draw out he army in such a manner that the foot should by turn assist the horse then the legion march in close order come suddenly in sight of the enemy at this sight the barbarian horse be so astonished and the foot so terrify that break through the line of baggage they betake themselves to flight with a loud shout and in great disorder but we horse who a little before have vigorously engage they whilst they make resistance be elate with joy at they victory raise a shout on every side pour round they as they run and as long as they horse have strength to pursue or they arm to give a blow so long do they continue the slaughter of the enemy in that battle and have kill above twelve thousand man in arm or such as throw away they arm through fear they take they whole train of baggage xxx -- after this defeat when it be ascertain that drape a senonian -lrb- who in the beginning of the revolt of gaul have collect from all quarter man of desperate fortune invite the slave to liberty call in the exile of the whole kingdom give a asylum to robber and intercept the roman baggage and provision -rrb- be march to the province with five thousand man be all he could collect after the defeat and that luterius a cadurcian who as it have be observe in a former commentary have design to make a attack on the province in the first revolt of gaul have form a junction with he caius caninius go in pursuit of they with two legion lest great disgrace might be incur from the fear or injury do to the province by the depredation of a band of desperate man xxxi -- caius fabius set off with the rest of the army to the carnute and those other state whose force he be inform have serve as auxiliary in that battle which he fight against dumnacus for he have no doubt that they would be more submissive after they recent suffering but if respite and time be give they they might be easily excite by the earnest solicitation of the same dumnacus on this occasion fabius be extremely fortunate and expeditious in recover the state for the carnute who though often harass have never mention peace submit and give hostage : and the other state which lie in the remotest part of gaul adjoining the ocean and which be call armoricae influence by the example of the carnute as soon as fabius arrive with he legion without delay comply with he command dumnacus expel from he own territory wander and skulk about be force to seek refuge by himself in the most remote part of gaul xxxii -- but crape in conjunction with literius know that caninius be at hand with the legion and that they themselves could not without certain destruction enter the boundary of the province whilst a army be in pursuit of they and be no longer at liberty to roam up and down and pillage halt in the country of the cadurcus as luterius have once in he prosperity possess a powerful influence over the inhabitant who be he countryman and be always the author of new project have considerable authority among the barbarian with he own and drape ' troops he seize uxellodunum a town formerly in vassalage to he and strongly fortify by its natural situation and prevail on the inhabitant to join he xxxiii -- after caninius have rapidly march to this place and perceive that all part of the town be secure by very craggy rock which it would be difficult for man in arm to climb even if they meet with no resistance and moreover observe that the town 's people be possess of effect to a considerable amount and that if they attempt to convey they away in a clandestine manner they could not escape we horse nor even we legion he divide he force into three part and pitch three camp on very high ground with the intention of draw line round the town by degree as he force could bear the fatigue xxxiv -- when the townsman perceive he design be terrify by the recollection of the distress at alesium they begin to dread similar consequence from a siege and above all luterius who have experience that fatal event caution they to make provision of corn they therefore resolve by general consent to leave part of they troops behind and set out with they light troops to bring in corn the scheme have meet with approbation the follow night drape and luterius leave two thousand man in the garrison march out of the town with the rest after a few day ' stay in the country of the cadurcus -lrb- some of whom be dispose to assist they with corn and other be unable to prevent they take it -rrb- they collect a great store sometimes also attack be make on we little fort by sally at night for this reason caninius defer draw he work round the whole town lest he should be unable to protect they when complete or by dispose he garrison in several place should make they too weak xxxv -- drape and luterius have lay in a large supply of corn occupy a position at about ten mile distance from the town intend from it to convey the corn into the town by degree they choose each he respective department drape stay behind in the camp with part of the army to protect it luterius convey the train with provision into the town accordingly have dispose guard here and there along the road about the tenth hour of the night he set out by narrow path through the wood to fetch the corn into the town but they noise be hear by the sentinel of we camp and the scout which we have send out have bring a account of what be go on caninius instantly with the ready-armed cohort from the nearest turret make a attack on the convoy at the break of day they alarm at so unexpected a evil flee by different way to they guard : which as soon as we man perceive they fall with great fury on the escort and do not allow a single man to be take alive luterius escape thence with a few follower but do not return to the camp xxxvi -- after this success caninius learn from some prisoner that a part of the force be encamp with drape not more than ten mile off which be confirm by several suppose that after the defeat of one general the rest would be terrify and might be easily conquer he think it a most fortunate event that none of the enemy have flee back from the slaughter to the camp to give drape notice of the calamity which have befall he and as he could see no danger in make the attempt he send forward all he cavalry and the german foot man of great activity to the enemy 's camp he divide one legion among the three camp and take the other without baggage along with he when he have advance near the enemy he be inform by scout which he have send before he that the enemy 's camp as be the custom of barbarian be pitch low near the bank of a river and that the higher grounds be unoccupied : but that the german horse have make a sudden attack on they and have begin the battle upon this intelligence he march up with he legion armed and in order of battle then on a signal be suddenly give on every side we man take possession of the higher grounds upon this the german horse observe the roman color fight with great vigor immediately all the cohort attack they on every side and have either kill or make prisoner of they all gain great booty in that battle drape himself be take prisoner xxxvii -- caninius have accomplish the business so successfully without have scarcely a man wound return to besiege the town and have destroy the enemy without for fear of whom he have be prevent from strengthen he redoubt and surround the enemy with he line he order the work to be complete on every side the next day caius fabius come to join he with he force and take upon he the siege of one side xxxviii -- in the meantime caesar leave caius antonius in the country of the bellovacus with fifteen cohort that the belgae might have no opportunity of form new plan in future he himself visit the other state demand a great number of hostage and by he encouraging language allay the apprehension of all when he come to the carnute in whose state he have in a former commentary mention that the war first break out observe that from a consciousness of they guilt they seem to be in the greatest terror : to relieve the state the sooner from its fear he demand that guturvatus the promoter of that treason and the instigator of that rebellion should be deliver up to punishment and though the latter do not dare to trust he life even to he own countryman yet such diligent search be make by they all that he be soon bring to we camp caesar be force to punish he by the clamor of the soldier contrary to he natural humanity for they allege that all the danger and loss incur in that war ought to be imputed to guturvatus accordingly he be whip to death and he head cut off xxxix -- here caesar be inform by numerous letter from caninius of what have happen to drape and luterius and in what conduct the town 's people persist : and though he despise the smallness of they number yet he think they obstinacy deserving a severe punishment lest gaul in general should adopt a idea that she do not want strength but perseverance to oppose the roman and lest the other state rely on the advantage of situation should follow they example and assert they liberty especially as he know that all the gaul understand that he command be to continue but one summer longer and if they could hold out for that time that they would have no further danger to apprehend he therefore leave quintus calenus one of he lieutenant behind he with two legion and instruction to follow he by regular march he hasten as much as he could with all the cavalry to caninius xl -- have arrive at uxellodunum contrary to the general expectation and perceive that the town be surround by the work and that the enemy have no possible means of retire from the assault and be likewise inform by the deserter that the townsman have abundance of corn he endeavor to prevent they get water a river divide the valley below which almost surround the steep craggy mountain on which uxellodunum be build the nature of the ground prevent he turn the current for it run so low down at the foot of the mountain that no drain could be sink deep enough to draw it off in any direction but the descent to it be so difficult that if we make opposition the besiege could neither come to the river nor retire up the precipice without hazard of they life caesar perceive the difficulty disposed archer and slinger and in some place opposite to the easiest descent place engine and attempt to hinder the townsman from get water at the river which oblige they afterwards to go all to one place to procure water xli -- close under the wall of the town a copious spring gush out on that part which for the space of nearly three hundred foot be not surround by the river whilst every other person wish that the besiege could be debar from this spring caesar alone see that it could be effect though not without great danger opposite to it he begin to advance the vinea towards the mountain and to throw up a mound with great labor and continual skirmishing for the townsman run down from the high ground and fight without any risk and wound several of we man yet they obstinately push on and be not deter from move forward the vinea and from surmount by they assiduity the difficulty of situation at the same time they work mine and move the crate and vinea to the source of the fountain this be the only work which they could do without danger or suspicion a mound sixty foot high be raise on it be erect a turret of ten story not with the intention that it should be on a level with the wall -lrb- for that could not be effect by any work -rrb- but to rise above the top of the spring when we engine begin to play from it upon the path that lead to the fountain and the townsman could not go for water without danger not only the cattle design for food and the work cattle but a great number of man also die of thirst xlii -- alarmed at this calamity the townsman fill barrel with tallow pitch and dry wood these they set on fire and roll down on we work at the same time they fight most furiously to deter the roman by the engagement and danger from extinguish the flame instantly a great blaze arise in the work for whatever they throw down the precipice striking against the vine and agger communicate the fire to whatever be in the way we soldier on the other hand though they be engage in a perilous sort of encounter and labor under the disadvantage of position yet support all with very great presence of mind for the action happen in a elevated situation and in sight of we army and a great shout be raise on both side therefore every man face the weapon of the enemy and the flame in as conspicuous a manner as he could that he valor might be the better known and attest xliii -- caesar observe that several of he man be wound order the cohort to ascend the mountain on all side and under pretence of assail the wall to raise a shout : at which the besiege be frightened and not know what be go on in other place call off they armed troops from attack we work and dispose they on the wall thus we man without hazard a battle gain time partly to extinguish the work which have catch fire and partly to cut off the communication as the townsman still continue to make a obstinate resistance and even after lose the greatest part of they force by drought persevere in they resolution : at last the vein of the spring be cut across by we mine and turn from they course by this they constant spring be suddenly dry up which reduce they to such despair that they imagine that it be not do by the art of man but the will of the god force therefore by necessity they at length submit xliv -- caesar be convince that he lenity be know to all man and be under no fear of be think to act severely from a natural cruelty and perceive that there would be no end to he trouble if several state should attempt to rebel in like manner and in different place resolve to deter other by inflict a exemplary punishment on these accordingly he cut off the hand of those who have bear arm against he they life he spare that the punishment of they rebellion might be the more conspicuous drape who i have say be take by caninius either through indignation and grief arise from he captivity or through fear of severer punishment abstain from food for several day and thus perish at the same time luterius who i have relate have escape from the battle have fall into the hand of epasnactus a arvernian -lrb- for he frequently change he quarter and throw himself on the honor of several person as he see that he dare not remain long in one place and be conscious how great a enemy he deserve to have in caesar -rrb- be by this epasnactus the arvernian a sincere friend of the roman people deliver without any hesitation a prisoner to caesar xlv -- in the meantime labienus engage in a successful cavalry action among the trevirus and have kill several of they and of the german who never refuse they aid to any person against the roman he get they chief alive into he power and amongst they surus a aeduan who be highly renowned both for he valor and birth and be the only aeduan that have continue in arm till that time caesar be inform of this and perceive that he have meet with good success in all part of gaul and reflect that in former campaign -lrb- celtic -rrb- gaul have be conquer and subdue but that he have never go in person to aquitanium but have make a conquest of it in some degree by marcus crassus set out for it with two legion design to spend the latter part of the summer there this affair he execute with he usual despatch and good fortune for all the state of aquitanium send ambassador to he and deliver hostage these affair be conclude he march with a guard of cavalry towards narbo and draw off he army into winter quarter by he lieutenant he post four legion in the country of the belgae under marcus antonius caius trebonius publius vatinius and quintus tullius he lieutenant two he detach to the aeduus know they to have a very powerful influence throughout all gaul two he place among the turonus near the confines of the carnute to keep in awe the entire tract of country border on the ocean the other two he place in the territory of the lemovice at a small distance from the arvernus that no part of gaul might be without a army have spend a few day in the province he quickly run through all the business of the assizes settle all public dispute and distribute reward to the most deserving for he have a good opportunity of learn how every person be disposed towards the republic during the general revolt of gaul which he have withstand by the fidelity and assistance of the province xlvii -- have finish these affair he return to he legion among the belga and winter at nemetocenna : there he get intelligence that comius the atrebatian have have a engagement with he cavalry for when antonius have go into winter quarter and the state of the atrebate continue in they allegiance comius who after that wound which i before mention be always ready to join he countryman upon every commotion that they might not want a person to advise and head they in the management of the war when he state submit to the roman support himself and he adherent on plunder by means of he cavalry infested the road and intercept several convoy which be bring provision to the roman quarter xlviii -- caius volusenus quadratus be appoint commander of the horse under antonius to winter with he : antonius send he in pursuit of the enemy 's cavalry now volusenus add to that valor which be pre-eminent in he a great aversion to comius on which account he execute the more willingly the order which he receive have therefore lay ambuscade he have several encounter with he cavalry and come off successful at last when a violent contest ensue and volusenus through eagerness to intercept comius have obstinately pursue he with a small party and comius have by the rapidity of he flight draw volusenus to a considerable distance from he troops he on a sudden appeal to the honor of all about he for assistance not to suffer the wound which he have perfidiously receive to go without vengeance and wheeling he horse about ride unguardedly before the rest up to the commander all he horse follow he example make a few of we man turn they back and pursue they comius clap spur to he horse ride up to volusenus and point he lance pierce he in the thigh with great force when they commander be wound we man no longer hesitate to make resistance and face about beat back the enemy when this occur several of the enemy repulse by the great impetuosity of we man be wound and some be trample to death in strive to escape and some be make prisoner they general escape this misfortune by the swiftness of he horse we commander be severely wound so much so that he appear to run the risk of lose he life be carry back to the camp but comius have either gratify he resentment or because he have lose the greatest part of he follower send ambassador to antonius and assure he that he would give hostage as a security that he would go wherever antonius should prescribe and would comply with he order and only entreat that this concession should be make to he fear that he should not be oblige to go into the presence of any roman as antonius judge that he request originate in a just apprehension he indulge he in it and accept he hostage \* \* \* \* \* caesar i know have make a separate commentary of each year 's transaction which i have not think it necessary for I to do because the following year in which lucius paulus and caius marcellus be consul produce no remarkable occurrence in gaul but that no person may be leave in ignorance of the place where caesar and he army be at that time i have think proper to write a few word in addition to this commentary \* \* \* \* \* xlix -- caesar whilst in winter quarter in the country of the belgae make it he only business to keep the state in amity with he and to give none either hope of or pretext for a revolt for nothing be further from he wish than to be under the necessity of engage in another war at he departure lest when he be draw he army out of the country any war should be leave unfinished which the gaul would cheerfully undertake when there be no immediate danger therefore by treat the state with respect make rich present to the lead man impose no new burden and make the term of they subjection lighter he easily keep gaul -lrb- already exhaust by so many unsuccessful battle -rrb- in obedience l -- when the winter quarter be break up he himself contrary to he usual practice proceed to italy by the longest possible stage in order to visit the free town and colony that he might recommend to they the petition of marcus antonius he treasurer for the priesthood for he exert he interest both cheerfully in favor of a man strongly attach to he whom he have send home before he to attend the election and zealously to oppose the faction and power of a few man who by reject marcus antonius wish to undermine caesar 's influence when go out of office though caesar hear on the road before he reach italy that he be create augur yet he think himself in honor bind to visit the free town and colony to return they thanks for render such service to antonius by they presence in such great number -lrb- at the election -rrb- and at the same time to recommend to they himself and he honor in he suit for the consulate the ensue year for he adversary arrogantly boast that lucius lentulus and caius marcellus have be appoint consul who would strip caesar of all honor and dignity : and that the consulate have be injuriously take from sergius galba though he have be much superior in vote and interest because he be unite to caesar both by friendship and by serve as lieutenant under he li -- caesar on he arrival be receive by the principal town and colony with incredible respect and affection for this be the first time he come since the war against unite gaul nothing be omit which could be think of for the ornament of the gate road and every place through which caesar be to pass all the people with they child go out to meet he sacrifice be offer up in every quarter the market place and temple be lay out with entertainment as if anticipate the joy of a most splendid triumph so great be the magnificence of the richer and zeal of the poorer rank of the people lii -- when caesar have go through all the state of cisalpine gaul he return with the greatest haste to the army at nemetocenna and have order all he legion to march from winter quarter to the territory of the trevirus he go thither and review they he make titus labienus governor of cisalpine gaul that he might be the more inclined to support he in he suit for the consulate he himself make such journey as he think would conduce to the health of he man by change of air and though he be frequently tell that labienus be solicit by he enemy and be assure that a scheme be in agitation by the contrivance of a few that the senate should interpose they authority to deprive he of a part of he army yet he neither give credit to any story concern labienus nor could be prevail upon to do anything in opposition to the authority of the senate for he think that he cause would be easily gain by the free voice of the senator for caius curio one of the tribune of the people have undertake to defend caesar 's cause and dignity have often propose to the senate that if the dread of caesar 's arm render any apprehensive as pompey 's authority and arm be no less formidable to the forum both should resign they command and disband they army that then the city would be free and enjoy its due rights and he not only propose this but of himself call upon the senate to divide on the question but the consul and pompey 's friend interpose to prevent it and regulate matter as they desire they break up the meeting liii -- this testimony of the unanimous voice of the senate be very great and consistent with they former conduct for the preceding year when marcellus attack caesar 's dignity he propose to the senate contrary to the law of pompey and crassus to dispose of caesar 's province before the expiration of he command and when the vote be call for and marcellus who endeavor to advance he own dignity by raise envy against caesar want a division the full senate go over to the opposite side the spirit of caesar 's foe be not break by this but it teach they that they ought to strengthen they interest by enlarge they connection so as to force the senate to comply with whatever they resolve on liv -- after this a decree be pass by the senate that one legion should be send by pompey and another by caesar to the parthian war but these two legion be evidently draw from caesar alone for the first legion which pompey send to caesar he give caesar as if it belong to himself though it be levy in caesar 's province caesar however though no one could doubt the design of he enemy send the legion back to cneius pompey and in compliance with the decree of the senate order the fifteenth belong to himself and which be quarter in cisalpine gaul to be deliver up in its room he send the thirteenth into italy to protect the garrison from which he have draft the fifteenth he dispose he army in winter quarter place caius trebonius with four legion among the belga and detach caius fabius with four more to the aeduus for he think that gaul would be most secure if the belgae a people of the greatest valor and the aeduus who possess the most powerful influence be keep in awe by he army lv -- he himself set out for italy where he be inform on he arrival that the two legion send home by he and which by the senate 's decree should have be send to the parthian war have be deliver over to pompey by caius marcellus the consul and be retain in italy although from this transaction it be evident to every one that war be design against caesar yet he resolve to submit to any thing as long as there be hope leave of decide the dispute in a equitable manner rather than have recourse to arm \* \* \* \* \* the civil war book i i -- when caesar 's letter be deliver to the consul they be with great difficulty and a hard struggle of the tribune prevail on to suffer it to be read in the senate but the tribune could not prevail that any question should be put to the senate on the subject of the letter the consul put the question on the regulation of the state lucius lentulus the consul promise that he will not fail the senate and republic if they declare they sentiment boldly and resolutely but if they turn they regard to caesar and court he favor as they do on former occasion he would adopt a plan for himself and not submit to the authority of the senate : that he too have a means of regain caesar 's favor and friendship scipio speak to the same purport that it be pompey 's intention not to abandon the republic if the senate would support he but if they should hesitate and act without energy they would in vain implore he aid if they should require it hereafter ii -- this speech of scipio 's as the senate be convene in the city and pompey be near at hand seem to have fall from the lip of pompey himself some deliver they sentiment with more moderation as marcellus first who in the beginning of he speech say that the question ought not to be put to the senate on this matter till levy be make throughout all italy and army raise under whose protection the senate might freely and safely pass such resolution as they think proper : as marcus calidius afterwards who be of opinion that pompey should set out for he province that there might be no cause for arm : that caesar be naturally apprehensive as two legion be force from he that pompey be retain those troops and keep they near the city to do he injury : as marcus rufus who follow calidius almost word for word they be all harshly rebuke by lentulus who peremptorily refuse to propose calidius 's motion marcellus overawe by he reproof retract he opinion thus most of the senate intimidate by the expression of the consul by the fear of a present army and the threat of pompey 's friend unwillingly and reluctantly adopt scipio 's opinion that caesar should disband he army by a certain day and should he not do so he should be consider as act against the state marcus antonius and quintus cassius tribune of the people interpose the question be immediately put on they interposition violent opinion be express : whoever speak with the greatest acrimony and cruelty be most highly commend by caesar 's enemy iii -- the senate have break up in the evening all who belong to that order be summon by pompey he applaud the forward and secure they vote for the next day the more moderate he reprove and excite against caesar many veteran from all part who have serve in pompey 's army be invite to he standard by the hope of reward and promotion several officer belong to the two legion which have be deliver up by caesar be send for the city and the comitium be crowd with tribune centurion and veteran all the consul ' friend all pompey 's connection all those who bear any ancient enmity to caesar be force into the senate house by they concourse and declaration the timid be awed the irresolute confirm and the greater part deprive of the power of speak they sentiment with freedom lucius piso the censor offer to go to caesar : as do likewise lucius roscius the praetor to inform he of these affair and require only six day ' time to finish the business opinion be express by some to the effect that commissioner should be send to caesar to acquaint he with the senate 's pleasure iv -- all these proposal be reject and opposition make to they all in the speech of the consul scipio and cato a old grudge against caesar and chagrin at a defeat actuate cato lentulus be work upon by the magnitude of he debt and the hope of have the government of a army and province and by the present which he expect from such prince as should receive the title of friend of the roman people and boast amongst he friend that he would be a second syllum to whom the supreme authority should return similar hope of a province and army which he expect to share with pompey on account of he connection with he urge on scipio and moreover -lrb- he be influence by -rrb- the fear of be call to trial and the adulation and a ostentatious display of himself and he friend in power who at that time have great influence in the republic and court of judicature pompey himself incite by caesar 's enemy because he be unwilling that any person should bear a equal degree of dignity have wholly alienate himself from caesar 's friendship and procure a reconciliation with they common enemy the greatest part of whom he have himself bring upon caesar during he affinity with he at the same time chagrin at the disgrace which he have incur by convert the two legion from they expedition through asia and syrium to -lrb- augment -rrb- he own power and authority he be anxious to bring matter to a war v -- for these reason everything be do in a hasty and disorderly manner and neither be time give to caesar 's relation to inform he -lrb- of the state of affair -rrb- nor liberty to the tribune of the people to deprecate they own danger nor even to retain the last privilege which syllum have leave they the interpose they authority but on the seventh day they be oblige to think of they own safety which the most turbulent tribune of the people be not accustom to attend to nor to fear be call to a account for they action till the eighth month recourse be have to that extreme and final decree of the senate -lrb- which be never resort to even by daring proposer except when the city be in danger of be set on fire or when the public safety be despair of -rrb- that the consul praetor tribune of the people and proconsul in the city should take care that the state receive no injury these decree be date the eighth day before the ides of January therefore in the first five day on which the senate could meet from the day on which lentulus enter into he consulate the two day of election except the severest and most virulent decree be pass against caesar 's government and against those most illustrious character the tribune of the people the latter immediately make they escape from the city and withdraw to caesar who be then at ravenna await a answer to he moderate demand -lrb- to see -rrb- if matter could be bring to a peaceful termination by any equitable act on the part of the enemy vi -- during the succeed day the senate be convene outside the city pompey repeat the same thing which he have declare through scipio he applaud the courage and firmness of the senate acquaint they with he force and tell they that he have ten legion ready that he be moreover inform and assure that caesar 's soldier be disaffected and that he could not persuade they to defend or even follow he motion be make in the senate concern other matter that levy should be make through all italy that faustus syllum should be send as propraetor into mauritanium that money should be grant to pompey from the public treasury it be also put to the vote that king juba should be -lrb- honor with the title of -rrb- friend and ally but marcellus say that he would not allow this motion for the present philip one of the tribune stop -lrb- the appointment of -rrb- sylla the resolution respect the other matter pass the province two of which be consular the remainder praetorian be decree to private person scipio get syrium lucius domitius gaul : philip and marcellus be omit from a private motive and they lot be not even admit to the other province praetor be send nor be time grant as in former year to refer to the people on they appointment nor to make they take the usual oath and march out of the city in a public manner robe in the military habit after offer they vow a circumstance which have never before happen both the consul leave the city and private man have lictor in the city and capital contrary to all precedent of former time levy be make throughout italy arm demand and money exact from the municipal town and violently take from the temple all distinction between thing human and divine be confound vii -- these thing be make know to caesar he harangue he soldier he remind they of the wrong do to he at all time by he enemy and complain that pompey have be alienate from he and lead astray by they through envy and a malicious opposition to he glory though he have always favor and promote pompey 's honor and dignity he complain that a innovation have be introduce into the republic that the intercession of the tribune which have be restore a few year before by syllum be brand as a crime and suppress by force of arm that sylla who have strip the tribune of every other power have nevertheless leave the privilege of intercession unrestrained that pompey who pretend to restore what they have lose have take away the privilege which they formerly have that whenever the senate decree that the magistrate should take care that the republic sustain no injury -lrb- by which word and decree the roman people be oblige to repair to arm -rrb- it be only when pernicious law be propose when the tribune attempt violent measure when the people secede and possess themselves of the temple and eminence of the city -lrb- and these instance of former time he show they be expiate by the fate of saturninus and the gracchus -rrb- : that nothing of this kind be attempt now nor even think of : that no law be promulgate no intrigue with the people go forward no secession make he exhort they to defend from the malice of he enemy the reputation and honor of that general under whose command they have for nine year most successfully support the state fight many successful battle and subdue all gaul and germany the soldier of the thirteenth legion which be present -lrb- for in the beginning of the disturbance he have call it out he other legion not have yet arrive -rrb- all cry out that they be ready to defend they general and the tribune of the common from all injury viii -- have make himself acquaint with the disposition of he soldier caesar set off with that legion to ariminum and there meet the tribune who have flee to he for protection he call he other legion from winter quarter and order they to follow he thither come lucius caesar a young man whose father be a lieutenant general under caesar he after conclude the rest of he speech and state for what purpose he have come tell caesar that he have command of a private nature for he from pompey that pompey wish to clear himself to caesar lest he should impute those action which he do for the republic to a design of affront he that he have ever prefer the interest of the state to he own private connection that caesar too for he own honor ought to sacrifice he desire and resentment to the public good and not vent he anger so violently against he enemy lest in he hope of injure they he should injure the republic he speak a few word to the same purport from himself in addition to pompey 's apology roscius the praetor confer with caesar almost in the same word and on the same subject and declare that pompey have empower he to do so ix -- though these thing seem to have no tendency towards redress he injury yet have get proper person by whom he could communicate he wish to pompey he require of they both that as they have convey pompey 's demand to he they should not refuse to convey he demand to pompey if by so little trouble they could terminate a great dispute and liberate all italy from she fear that the honor of the republic have ever be he first object and dearer to he than life that he be chagrin that the favor of the roman people be wrest from he by the injurious report of he enemy that he be deprive of a half-year 's command and drag back to the city though the people have order that regard should be pay to he suit for the consulate at the next election though he be not present that however he have patiently submit to this loss of honor for the sake of the republic that when he write letter to the senate require that all person should resign the command of they army he do not obtain even that request that levy be make throughout italy that the two legion which have be take from he under the pretence of the parthian war be keep at home and that the state be in arm to what do all these thing tend unless to he ruin but nevertheless he be ready to condescend to any term and to endure everything for the sake of the republic let pompey go to he own province let they both disband they army let all person in italy lay down they arm let all fear be remove from the city let free election and the whole republic be resign to the direction of the senate and roman people that these thing might be the more easily perform and condition secure and confirm by oath either let pompey come to caesar or allow caesar to go to he it might be that all they dispute would be settle by a interview x -- roscius and lucius caesar have receive this message go to capua where they meet the consul and pompey and declare to they caesar 's term have deliberate on the matter they reply and send write proposal to he by the same person the purport of which be that caesar should return into gaul leave ariminum and disband he army : if he comply with this that pompey would go to spain in the meantime until security be give that caesar would perform he promise that the consul and pompey would not give over they levy xi -- it be not a equitable proposal to require that caesar should quit ariminum and return to he province but that he -lrb- pompey -rrb- should himself retain he province and the legion that belong to another and desire that caesar 's army should be disband whilst he himself be make new levy : and that he should merely promise to go to he province without name the day on which he would set out so that if he should not set out till after caesar 's consulate expire yet he would not appear bind by any religious scruple about assert a falsehood but he not grant time for a conference nor promising to set out to meet he make the expectation of peace appear very hopeless caesar therefore send marcus antonius with five cohort from ariminum to arretium he himself stay at ariminum with two legion with the intention of raise levy there he secure pisaurus fanum and ancona with a cohort each xii -- in the meantime be inform that thermus the praetor be in possession of iguvium with five cohort and be fortify the town but that the affection of all the inhabitant be very well inclined towards himself he detach curio with three cohort which he have at ariminum and pisaurus upon notice of he approach thermus distrust the affection of the townsman draw he cohort out of it and make he escape he soldier desert he on the road and return home curio recover iguvium with the cheerful concurrence of all the inhabitant caesar have receive a account of this and rely on the affection of the municipal town draft all the cohort of the thirteenth legion from the garrison and set out for auximum a town into which attius have bring he cohort and of which he have take possession and from which he have send senator round about the country of picenum to raise new levy xiii -- upon news of caesar 's approach the senate of auximum go in a body to attius varus and tell he that it be not a subject for they to determine upon : yet neither they nor the rest of the freeman would suffer caius caesar a general who have merit so well of the republic after perform such great achievement to be exclude from they town and wall wherefore he ought to pay some regard to the opinion of posterity and he own danger alarm at this declaration attius varus draw out of the town the garrison which he have introduce and flee a few of caesar 's front rank have pursue he oblige he to halt and when the battle begin varus be desert by he troops : some of they disperse to they home the rest come over to caesar and along with they lucius pupius the chief centurion be take prisoner and bring to caesar he have hold the same rank before in cneius pompey 's army but caesar applaud the soldier of attius set pupius at liberty return thanks to the people of auximum and promise to be grateful for they conduct xiv -- intelligence of this be bring to rome so great a panic spread on a sudden that when lentulus the consul come to open the treasury to deliver money to pompey by the senate 's decree immediately on open the hallowed door he flee from the city for it be falsely rumor that caesar be approach and that he cavalry be already at the gate marcellus he colleague follow he and so do most of the magistrate cneius pompey have leave the city the day before and be on he march to those legion which he have receive from caesar and have dispose in winter quarter in apulium the levy be stop within the city no place on this side of capua be think secure at capua they first begin to take courage and to rally and determine to raise levy in the colony which have be send thither by the julian law : and lentulus bring into the public market-place the gladiator which caesar maintain there for the entertainment of the people and confirm they in they liberty and give they horse and order they to attend he but afterwards be warn by he friend that this action be censure by the judgment of all he distribute they among the slave of the district of campanium to keep guard there xv -- caesar have move forward from auximum traverse the whole country of picenum all the governor in these country most cheerfully receive he and aid he army with every necessary ambassador come to he even from cingulum a town which labienus have lay out and build at he own expense and offer most earnestly to comply with he order he demand soldier : they send they in the meantime the twelfth legion come to join caesar with these two he march to asculum the chief town of picenum lentulus spinther occupy that town with ten cohort but on be inform of caesar 's approach he flee from the town and in attempt to bring off he cohort with he be desert by a great part of he man be leave on the road with a small number he fall in with vibullius rufus who be send by pompey into picenum to confirm the people -lrb- in they allegiance -rrb- vibullius be inform by he of the transaction in picenum take he soldier from he and dismiss he he collect likewise from the neighbouring country as many cohort as he can from pompey 's new levy amongst they he meet with ulcille hirrus flee from camerinum with six cohort which he have in the garrison there by a junction with which he make up thirteen cohort with they he march by hasty journey to corfinium to domitius aenobarbus and inform he that caesar be advance with two legion domitius have collect about twenty cohort from alba and the marsian pelignian and neighbouring state xvi -- caesar have recover asculum and drive out lentulus order the soldier that have desert from he to be seek out and a muster to be make and have delay for one day there to provide corn he march to corfinium on he approach five cohort send by domitius from the town be break down a bridge which be over the river at three mile ' distance from it a engagement take place there with caesar 's advanced-guard domitius 's man be quickly beat off from the bridge and retreat precipitately into the town caesar have march he legion over halt before the town and encamp close by the wall xvii -- domitius upon observe this send messenger well acquaint with the country encourage by a promise of be amply reward with despatch to pompey to apulia to beg and entreat he to come to he assistance that caesar could be easily enclose by the two army through the narrowness of the country and prevent from obtain supplies : unless he do so that he and upward of thirty cohort and a great number of senator and roman knight would be in extreme danger in the meantime he encourage he troops disposed engine on the wall and assign to each man a particular part of the city to defend in a speech to the soldier he promise they land out of he own estate to every private soldier four acre and a corresponding share to the centurion and veteran xviii -- in the meantime word be bring to caesar that the people of sulmo a town about seven mile distant from corfinium be ready to obey he order but be prevent by quintus lucretius a senator and attius a pelignian who be in possession of the town with a garrison of seven cohort he send marcus antonius thither with five cohort of the eighth legion the inhabitant as soon as they see we standard throw open they gate and all the people both citizen and soldier go out to meet and welcome antonius lucretius and attius leap off the wall attius be bring before antonius beg that he might be send to caesar antonius return the same day on which he have set out with the cohort and attius caesar add these cohort to he own army and send attius away in safety the three first day caesar employ in fortify he camp with strong work in bring in corn from the neighbouring free town and wait for the rest of he force within the three day the eighth legion come to he and twenty-two cohort of the new levy in gaul and about three hundred horse from the king of noricum on they arrival he make a second camp on another part of the town and give the command of it to curio he determine to surround the town with a rampart and turret during the remainder of the time nearly at the time when the greatest part of the work be complete all the messenger send to pompey return xix -- have read pompey 's letter domitius conceal the truth give out in council that pompey would speedily come to they assistance and encourage they not to despond but to provide everything necessary for the defense of the town he hold private conference with a few of he most intimate friend and determine on the design of flee as domitius 's countenance do not agree with he word and he do everything with more confusion and fear than he have show on the precede day and as he have several private meeting with he friend contrary to he usual practice in order to take they advice and as he avoid all public council and assembly of the people the truth could be no longer hide nor dissemble for pompey have write back in answer that he would not put matter to the last hazard that domitius have retreat into the town of corfinium without either he advice or consent therefore if any opportunity should offer he -lrb- domitius -rrb- should come to he with the whole force but the blockade and work round the town prevent he escape xx -- domitius 's design be noised abroad the soldier in confinium -lrb- \*\* error in original : should be corfinium -rrb- early in the evening begin to mutiny and hold a conference with each other by they tribune and centurion and the most respectable amongst themselves : that they be besiege by caesar that he work and fortification be almost finish that they general domitius on whose hope and expectation they have confide have throw they off and be meditate he own escape that they ought to provide for they own safety at first the marsian differ in opinion and possess themselves of that part of the town which they think the strongest and so violent a dispute arise between they that they attempt to fight and decide it by arm however in a little time by messenger send from one side to the other they be inform of domitius 's meditate flight of which they be previously ignorant therefore they all with one consent bring domitius into public view gather round he and guard he and send deputy out of they number to caesar to say that they be ready to throw open they gate to do whatever he should order and to deliver up domitius alive into he hand xxi -- upon intelligence of these matter though caesar think it of great consequence to become master of the town as soon as possible and to transfer the cohort to he own camp lest any change should be work on they inclination by bribe encouragement or fictitious message because in war great event be often bring about by trifling circumstance yet dread lest the town should be plunder by the soldier enter into it and take advantage of the darkness of the night he commend the person who come to he and send they back to the town and order the gate and wall to be secure he dispose he soldier on the work which he have begin not at certain interval as be he practice before but in one continue range of sentinel and station so that they touch each other and form a circle round the whole fortification he order the tribune and general officer to ride round and exhort they not only to be on they guard against sally from the town but also to watch that no single person should get out privately nor be any man so negligent or drowsy as to sleep that night to so great height be they expectation raise that they be carry away heart and soul each to different object what would become of the corfinian what of domitius what of lentulus what of the rest what event would be the consequence of another xxii -- about the fourth watch lentulus spinther say to we sentinel and guard from the wall that he desire to have a interview with caesar if permission be give he have obtain it he be escort out of town nor do the soldier of domitius leave he till they bring he into caesar 's presence he plead with caesar for he life and entreat he to spare he and remind he of they former friendship and acknowledge that caesar 's favor to he be very great in that through he interest he have be admit into the college of priest in that after he praetorship he have be appoint to the government of spain in that he have be assist by he in he suit for the consulate caesar interrupt he in he speech and tell he that he have not leave he province to do mischief -lrb- to any man -rrb- but to protect himself from the injury of he enemy to restore to they dignity the tribune of the people who have be drive out of the city on he account and to assert he own liberty and that of the roman people who be oppress by a few factious man encourage by this address lentulus begged leave to return to the town that the security which he have obtain for himself might be a encouragement to the rest to hope for theirs say that some be so terrify that they be induce to make desperate attempt on they own life leave be grant he he depart xxiii -- when day appear caesar order all the senator and they child the tribune of the soldier and the roman knight to be bring before he among the person of senatorial rank be lucius domitius publius lentulus spinther lucius vibullius rufus sextus quintilius varus the quaestor and lucius rubrius besides the son of domitius and several other young man and a great number of roman knight and burgess whom domitius have summon from the municipal town when they be bring before he he protect they from the insolence and taunt of the soldier tell they in few word that they have not make he a grateful return on they part for he very extraordinary kindness to they and dismiss they all in safety sixty sestertium which domitius have bring with he and lodge in the public treasury be bring to caesar by the magistrate of corfinium he give they back to domitius that he might not appear more moderate with respect to the life of man than in money matter though he know that it be public money and have be give by pompey to pay he army he order domitius 's soldier to take the oath to himself and that day decamp and perform the regular march he stay only seven day before corfinium and march into apulium through the country of the marrucinian frentanian and larinate xxiv -- pompey be inform of what have pass at corfinium march from lucerium to canusium and thence to brundusium he order all the force raise everywhere by the new levy to repair to he he give arm to the slave that attend the flock and appoint horse for they of these he make up about three hundred horse lucius the praetor flee from alba with six cohort : rutilus lupus the praetor from tarracina with three these have descry caesar 's cavalry at a distance which be command by bivius curius and have desert the praetor carry they color to curius and go over to he in like manner during the rest of he march several cohort fall in with the main body of caesar 's army other with he horse cneius magius from cremona engineer-general to pompey be take prisoner on the road and bring to caesar but send back by he to pompey with this message : as hitherto he have not be allow a interview and be now on he march to he at brundusium that it deeply concern the commonwealth and general safety that he should have a interview with pompey and that the same advantage could not be gain at a great distance when the proposal be convey to they by other as if term be argue by they both in person xxv -- have deliver this message he march to brundusium with six legion four of they veteran : the rest those which he have raise in the late levy and complete on he march for he have send all domitius 's cohort immediately from corfinium to sicily he discover that the consul be go to dyrrachium with a considerable part of the army and that pompey remain at brundusium with twenty cohort but could not find out for a certainty whether pompey stay behind to keep possession of brundusium that he might the more easily command the whole adriatic sea with the extremity of italy and the coast of greece and be able to conduct the war on either side of it or whether he remain there for want of shipping and be afraid that pompey would come to the conclusion that he ought not to relinquish italy he determine to deprive he of the means of communication afford by the harbor of brundusium the plan of he work be as follow : -- where the mouth of the port be narrowest he throw up a mole of earth on either side because in these place the sea be shallow have go out so far that the mole could not be continue in the deep water he fix double float thirty foot on either side before the mole these he fasten with four anchor at the four corner that they might not be carry away by the wave have complete and secure they he then join to they other float of equal size these he cover over with earth and mould that he might not be prevent from access to they to defend they and in the front and on both side he protect they with a parapet of wicker work and on every fourth one raise a turret two story high to secure they the better from be attack by the shipping and set on fire xxvi -- to counteract this pompey fit out large merchant ship which he find in the harbor of brundusium : on they he erect turret three story high and have furnish they with several engine and all sort of weapon drive they amongst caesar 's work to break through the float and interrupt the work thus there happen skirmish every day at a distance with sling arrow and other weapon caesar conduct matter as if he think that the hope of peace be not yet to be give up and though he be very much surprised that magius whom he have send to pompey with a message be not send back to he and though he attempt a reconciliation often retard the vigorous prosecution of he plan yet he think that he ought by all means to persevere in the same line of conduct he therefore send caninius rebilus to have a interview with scribonius libo he intimate friend and relation he charge he to exhort libo to effect a peace but above all thing require that he should be admit to a interview with pompey he declare that he have great hope if that be allow he that the consequence would be that both party would lay down they arm on equal term that a great share of the glory and reputation of that event would redound to libo if through he advice and agency hostility should be end libo have part from the conference with caninius go to pompey and shortly after return with answer that as the consul be absent no treaty of composition could be engage in without they caesar therefore think it time at length to give over the attempt which he have often make in vain and act with energy in the war xxvii -- when caesar 's work be nearly half finished and after nine day be spend in they the ship which have convey the first division of the army to dyrrachium be send back by the consul return to brundusium pompey either frighten at caesar 's work or determine from the begin to quit italy begin to prepare for he departure on the arrival of the ship and the more effectually to retard caesar 's attack lest he soldier should force they way into the town at the moment of he departure he stop up the gate build wall across the street and avenue sink trench across the way and in they fixed palisado and sharp stake which he make level with the ground by means of hurdle and clay but he barricade with large beam fasten in the ground and sharpen at the end two passage and road without the wall which lead to the port after make these arrangement he order he soldier to go on board without noise and dispose here and there on the wall and turret some light-armed veteran archer and slinger these he design to call off by a certain signal when all the soldier be embark and leave row-galley for they in a secure place xxviii -- the people of brundusium irritated by the insolence of pompey 's soldier and the insult receive from pompey himself be in favor of caesar 's party therefore as soon as they be aware of pompey 's departure whilst he man be run up and down and busy about they voyage they make sign from the top of the house : caesar be apprize of the design by they order scale ladder to be get ready and he man to take arm that he might not lose any opportunity of come to a action pompey weigh anchor at nightfall the soldier who have be post on the wall to guard it be call off by the signal which have be agree on and know the road run down to the ship caesar 's soldier fix they ladder and scale the wall : but be caution by the people to beware of the hidden stake and cover trench they halt and be conduct by the inhabitant by a long circuit they reach the port and capture with they long boat and small craft two of pompey 's ship full of soldier which have strike against caesar 's mole xxix-though caesar highly approve of collect a fleet and cross the sea and pursue pompey before he could strengthen himself with he transmarine auxiliary with the hope of bring the war to a conclusion yet he dread the delay and length of time necessary to effect it : because pompey by collect all he ship have deprive he of the means of pursue he at present the only resource leave to caesar be to wait for a fleet from the distant region of gaul picenum and the strait of gibraltar but this on account of the season of the year appear tedious and troublesome he be unwilling that in the meantime the veteran army and the two spain one of which be bind to pompey by the strongest obligation should be confirm in he interest that auxiliary and cavalry should be provide and gaul and italy reduce in he absence xxx -- therefore for the present he relinquish all intention of pursue pompey and resolve to march to spain and command the magistrate of the free town to procure he ship and to have they convey to brundusium he detach valerius he lieutenant with one legion to sardinium curio the proprietor to sicily with three legion and order he when he have recover sicily to immediately transport he army to africa marcus cotta be at this time governor of sardinium : marcus cato of sicily : and tubero by the lot should have have the government of africa the caralitanus as soon as they hear that valerius be send against they even before he leave italy of they own accord drive cotta out of the town who terrify because he understand that the whole province be combine -lrb- against he -rrb- flee from sardinium to africa cato be in sicily repair the old ship of war and demand new one from the state and these thing he perform with great zeal he be raise levy of roman citizen among the lucanus and brutius by he lieutenant and exact a certain quota of horse and foot from the state of sicily when these thing be nearly complete be inform of curio 's approach he make a complaint that he be abandon and betray by pompey who have undertake a unnecessary war without make any preparation and when question by he and other member in the senate have assure they that every thing be ready and provide for the war after have make these complaint in a public assembly he flee from he province xxxi -- valerius find sardinium and curio sicily desert by they governor when they arrive there with they army when tubero arrive in africa he find attius varus in the government of the province who have lose he cohort as already relate at auximum have straightway flee to africa and find it without a governor have seize it of he own accord and make levy have raise two legion from he acquaintance with the people and country and he knowledge of that province he find the means of effect this because a few year before at the expiration of he praetorship he have obtain that province he when tubero come to utica with he fleet prevent he enter the port or town and do not suffer he son though labor under sickness to set foot on shore but oblige he to weigh anchor and quit the place xxxil -- when these affair be despatch caesar that there might be a intermission from labor for the rest of the season draw off he soldier to the nearest municipal town and set off in person for rome have assemble the senate he remind they of the injustice of he enemy and tell they that he aim at no extraordinary honor but have wait for the time appoint by law for stand candidate for the consulate be contented with what be allow to every citizen that a bill have be carry by the ten tribune of the people -lrb- notwithstanding the resistance of he enemy and a very violent opposition from cato who in he usual manner consume the day by a tedious harangue -rrb- that he should be allow to stand candidate though absent even in the consulship of pompey and if the latter disapprove of the bill why do he allow it to pass if he approve of it why should he debar he -lrb- caesar -rrb- from the people 's favor he make mention of he own patience in that he have freely propose that all army should be disband by which he himself would suffer the loss both of dignity and honor he urge the virulence of he enemy who refuse to comply with what they require from other and have rather that all thing should be throw into confusion than that they should lose they power and they army he expatiate on they injustice in take away he legion : they cruelty and insolence in abridge the privilege of the tribune the proposal he have make and he entreaty of a interview which have be refuse he : for which reason he beg and desire that they would undertake the management of the republic and unite with he in the administration of it but if through fear they decline it he would not be a burden to they but take the management of it on himself that deputy ought to be send to pompey to propose a reconciliation as he do not regard what pompey have lately assert in the senate that authority be acknowledge to be vest in those person to whom ambassador be send and fear imply in those that send they that these be the sentiment of low weak mind : that for he part as he have make it he study to surpass other in glory so he be desirous of excel they in justice and equity xxxiii -- the senate approve of send deputy but none could be find fit to execute the commission : for every person from he own private fear decline the office for pompey on leave the city have declare in the open senate that he would hold in the same degree of estimation those who stay in rome and those in caesar 's camp thus three day be waste in dispute and excuse besides lucius metellus one of the tribune be suborn by caesar 's enemy to prevent this and to embarrass everything else which caesar should propose caesar have discover he intention after spend several day to no purpose leave the city in order that he might not lose any more time and go to transalpine gaul without effect what he have intend xxxiv -- on he arrival there he be inform that vibullius rufus whom he have take a few day before at corfinium and set at liberty be send by pompey into spain and that domitius also be go to seize massilium with seven row-galley which be fit up by some private person at igilium and cosa and which he have man with he own slave freedman and colonist : and that some young nobleman of massilium have be send before he whom pompey when leave rome have exhort that the late service of caesar should not erase from they mind the memory of he former favor on receive this message the massilian have shut they gate against caesar and invite over to they the albicus who have formerly be in alliance with they and who inhabit the mountain that overhang massilium : they have likewise convey the corn from the surrounding country and from all the fort into the city have open armoury in the city : and be repair the wall the fleet and the gate xxxv -- caesar send for fifteen of the principal person of massilium to attend he to prevent the war commence among they he remonstrate -lrb- in the follow language -rrb- that they ought to follow the precedent set by all italy rather than submit to the will of any one man he make use of such argument as he think would tend to bring they to reason the deputy report he speech to they countryman and by the authority of the state bring he back this answer : that they understand that the roman people be divide into two faction : that they have neither judgment nor ability to decide which have the juster cause but that the head of these faction be cneius pompey and caius caesar the two patron of the state : the former of whom have grant to they state the land of the volcae arecomici and helvii the latter have assign they a part of he conquest in gaul and have augment they revenue wherefore have receive equal favor from both they ought to show equal affection to both and assist neither against the other nor admit either into they city or harbor xxxvi -- whilst this treaty be go forward domitius arrive at massilium with he fleet and be receive into the city and make governor of it the chief management of the war be entrust to he at he command they send the fleet to all part they seize all the merchantman they could meet with and carry they into the harbor they apply the nail timber and rig with which they be furnish to rig and refit they other vessel they lay up in the public store all the corn that be find in the ship and reserve the rest of they lading and convoy for the siege of the town should such a event take place provoke at such ill treatment caesar lead three legion against massilium and resolve to provide turret and vina to assault the town and to build twelve ship at arela which be complete and rig in thirty day -lrb- from the time the timber be cut down -rrb- and be bring to massilia he put under the command of decimus brutus and leave caius trebonius he lieutenant to invest the city xxxvii -- whilst he be prepare and get these thing in readiness he send caius fabius one of he lieutenant into spain with three legion which he have dispose in winter quarter in narbo and the neighbouring country and order he immediately to seize the pass of the pyrenee which be at that time occupy by detachment from lucius afranius one of pompey 's lieutenant he desire the other legion which be pass the winter at a great distance to follow close after he fabius accord to he order by use expedition dislodge the party from the hill and by hasty march come up with the army of afranius xxxviii -- on the arrival of vibullius rufus whom we have already mention pompey have send into spain afranius petreius and varro he lieutenant -lrb- one of whom have the command of hither spain with three legion the second of the country from the forest of castulo to the river guadiana with two legion the third from the river guadiana to the country of the vettone and lusitanium with the like number of legion -rrb- divide amongst themselves they respective department petreius be to march from lusitanium through the vettone and join afranius with all he force varro be to guard all further spain with what legion he have these matter be settle reinforcement of horse and foot be demand from lusitanium by petreius from the celtiberus cantabrus and all the barbarous nation which border on the ocean by afranius when they be raise petreius immediately march through the vettone to afranius they resolve by joint consent to carry on the war in the vicinity of ilerda on account of the advantage of its situation xxxix -- afranius as above mention have three legion petreius two there be besides about eighty cohort raise in hither and further spain -lrb- of which the troops belong to the former province have shield those of the latter target -rrb- and about five thousand horse raise in both province caesar have send he legion into spain with about six thousand auxiliary foot and three thousand horse which have serve under he in all he former war and the same number from gaul which he himself have provide have expressly call out all the most noble and valiant man of each state the bravest of these be from the aquitanus and the mountaineer who border on the province in gaul he have be inform that pompey be march through mauritanium with he legion to spain and would shortly arrive he at the same time borrow money from the tribune and centurion which he distribute amongst he soldier by this proceeding he gain two point he secure the interest of the centurion by this pledge in he hand and by he liberality he purchase the affection of he army xl -- fabius sound the inclination of the neighbouring state by letter and messenger he have make two bridge over the river segre at the distance of four mile from each other he send forage party over these bridge because he have already consume all the forage that be on he side of the river the general of pompey 's army do almost the same thing and for the same reason : and the horse have frequent skirmish with each other when two of fabius 's legion have as be they constant practice go forth as the usual protection to the forager and have cross the river and the baggage and all the horse be follow they on a sudden from the weight of the cattle and the mass of water the bridge fall and all the horse be cut off from the main army which be know to petreius and afranius from the timber and hurdle that be carry down the river afranius immediately cross he own bridge which communicate between he camp and the town with four legion and all the cavalry and march against fabius 's two legion when he approach be announce lucius plancus who have the command of those legion compel by the emergency take post on a rise ground and draw up he army with two front that it might not be surround by the cavalry thus though engage with superior number he sustain the furious charge of the legion and the horse when the battle be begin by the horse there be observe at a distance by both side the color of two legion which caius fabius have send round by the further bridge to reinforce we man suspect as the event verify that the enemy 's general would take advantage of the opportunity which fortune have put in they way to attack we man they approach put a end to the battle and each general lead back he legion to they respective camp xli -- in two day after caesar come to the camp with nine hundred horse which he have retain for a bodyguard the bridge which have be break down by the storm be almost repair and he order it to be finish in the night be acquaint with the nature of the country he leave behind he six cohort to guard the bridge the camp and all he baggage and the next day set off in person for ilerda with all he force draw up in three line and halt just before the camp of afranius and have remain there a short time under arm he offer he battle on equal term when this offer be make afranius draw out he force and post they on the middle of a hill near he camp when caesar perceive that afranius decline come to a engagement he resolve to encamp at somewhat less than half a mile 's distance from the very foot of the mountain and that he soldier whilst engage in they work might not be terrify by any sudden attack of the enemy or disturb in they work he order they not to fortify it with a wall which must rise high and be see at a distance but draw on the front opposite the enemy a trench fifteen foot broad the first and second line continue under arm as be from the first appoint behind they the third line be carry on the work without be see so that the whole be complete before afranius discover that the camp be be fortify xlii -- in the evening caesar draw he legion within this trench and rest they under arm the next night the day follow he keep he whole army within it and as it be necessary to bring material from a considerable distance he for the present pursue the same plan in he work and to each legion one after the other he assign one side of the camp to fortify and order trench of the same magnitude to be cut : he keep the rest of the legion under arm without baggage to oppose the enemy afranius and petreius to frighten we and obstruct the work draw out they force at the very foot of the mountain and challenge we to battle caesar however do not interrupt he work rely on the protection of the three legion and the strength of the fosse after stay for a short time and advance no great distance from the bottom of the hill they lead back they force to they camp the third day caesar fortify he camp with a rampart and order the other cohort which he have leave in the upper camp and he baggage to be remove to it xliil-between the town of ilerda and the next hill on which afranius and petreius be encamp there be a plain about three hundred pace broad and near the middle of it a eminence somewhat raise above the level : caesar hope that if he could get possession of this and fortify it he should be able to cut off the enemy from the town the bridge and all the store which they have lay up in the town in expectation of this he lead three legion out of the camp and draw up he army in a advantageous position he order the advanced man of one legion to hasten forward and seize the eminence upon intelligence of this the cohort which be on guard before afranius 's camp be instantly send a nearer way to occupy the same post the two party engage and as afranius 's man have reach the eminence first we man be repulse and on a reinforcement be send they be oblige to turn they back and retreat to the standard of legion xliv -- the manner of fighting of those soldier be to run forward with great impetuosity and boldly take a post and not to keep they rank strictly but to fight in small scatter party : if hard press they think it no disgrace to retire and give up the post be accustom to this manner of fighting among the lusitanian and other barbarous nation for it commonly happen that soldier be strongly influence by the custom of those country in which they have spend much time this method however alarm we man who be not use to such a description of warfare for they imagine that they be about to be surround on they expose flank by the single man who run forward from they rank and they think it they duty to keep they rank and not to quit they color nor without good reason to give up the post which they have take accordingly when the advanced guard give way the legion which be station on that wing do not keep its ground but retreat to the next hill xlv -- almost the whole army be daunt at this because it have occur contrary to they expectation and custom caesar encourage he man and lead the ninth legion to they relief and check the insolent and eager pursuit of the enemy and oblige they in they turn to show they back and retreat to ilerda and take post under the wall but the soldier of the ninth legion be over zealous to repair the dishonor which have be sustained have rashly pursue the flee enemy advance into disadvantageous ground and go up to the foot of the mountain on which the town ilerda be build and when they wish to retire they be again attack by the enemy from the rise ground the place be craggy in the front and steep on either side and be so narrow that even three cohort draw up in order of battle would fill it but no relief could be send on the flank and the horse could be of no service to they when hard press from the town indeed the precipice incline with a gentle slope for near four hundred pace we man have to retreat this way as they have through they eagerness advance too inconsiderately the greatest contest be in this place which be much to the disadvantage of we troops both on account of its narrowness and because they be post at the foot of the mountain so that no weapon be throw at they without effect : yet they exert they valor and patience and bear every wound the enemy 's force be increase and cohort be frequently send to they aid from the camp through the town that fresh man might relieve the weary caesar be oblige to do the same and relieve the fatigue by send cohort to that post xlvi -- after the battle have in this manner continue incessantly for five hour and we man have suffer much from superior number have spend all they javelin they draw they sword and charge the enemy up the hill and have kill a few oblige the rest to fly the cohort be beat back to the wall and some be drive by they fear into the town a easy retreat be afford to we man we cavalry also on either flank though station on sloping or low ground yet bravely struggle up to the top of the hill and ride between the two army make we retreat more easy and secure such be the various turn of fortune in the battle in the first encounter about seventy of we man fall : amongst they quintus fulgenius first centurion of the second line of the fourteenth legion who for he extraordinary valor have be promote from the lower rank to that post about six hundred be wound of afranius 's party there be kill titus caecilius principal centurion and four other centurion and above two hundred man xlvii -- but this opinion be spread abroad concern this day that each party think that they come off conqueror afranius 's soldier because though they be esteem inferior in the opinion of all yet they have stand we attack and sustain we charge and at first have keep the post and the hill which have be the occasion of the dispute and in the first encounter have oblige we man to fly : but ours because notwithstanding the disadvantage of the ground and the disparity of number they have maintain the battle for five hour have advance up the hill sword in hand and have force the enemy to fly from the higher ground and drive they into the town the enemy fortify the hill about which the contest have be with strong work and post a garrison on it xlviii -- in two day after this transaction there happen a unexpected misfortune for so great a storm arise that it be agree that there be never see higher flood in those country it sweep down the snow from all the mountain and break over the bank of the river and in one day carry away both the bridge which fabius have build -- a circumstance which cause great difficulty to caesar 's army for as we camp as already mention be pitch between two river the segre and cinca and as neither of these could be ford for the space of thirty mile they be all of necessity confine within these narrow limit neither could the state which have espouse caesar 's cause furnish he with corn nor the troops which have go far to forage return as they be stop by the water : nor could the convoy come from italy and gaul make they way to the camp besides it be the most distressing season of the year when there be no corn in the blade and it be nearly ripe : and the state be exhaust because afranius have convey almost all the corn before caesar 's arrival into ilerda and whatever he have leave have be already consume by caesar the cattle which might have serve as a secondary resource against want have be remove by the state to a great distance on account of the war they who have go out to get forage or corn be chase by the light troops of the lusitanian and the targeteer of hither spain who be well acquaint with the country and could readily swim across the river because it be the custom of all those people not to join they army without bladder xlix -- but afranius 's army have abundance of everything a great stock of corn have be provide and lay in long before a large quantity be come in from the whole province : they have a good store of forage the bridge of ilerda afford a opportunity of get all these without any danger and the place beyond the bridge to which caesar have no access be as yet untouched l -- those flood continue several day caesar endeavor to repair the bridge but the height of the water do not allow he : and the cohort dispose along the bank do not suffer they to be complete and it be easy for they to prevent it both from the nature of the river and the height of the water but especially because they dart be throw from the whole course of the bank on one confine spot and it be no easy matter at one and the same time to execute a work in a very rapid flood and to avoid the dart li -- intelligence be bring to afranius that the great convoy which be on they march to caesar have halt at the river archer from the ruthenus and horse from the gaul with a long train of baggage accord to the gallic custom of travel have arrive there there be besides about six thousand people of all description with slave and free man but there be no order or regular discipline as every one follow he own humor and all travel without apprehension take the same liberty as on former march there be several young nobleman son of senator and of equestrian rank there be ambassador from several state there be lieutenant of caesar 's the river stop they all to attack they by surprise afranius set out in the beginning of the night with all he cavalry and three legion and send the horse on before to fall on they unawares but the gallic horse soon get themselves in readiness and attack they though but few they withstand the vast number of the enemy as long as they fight on equal term : but when the legion begin to approach have lose a few man they retreat to the next mountain the delay occasion by this battle be of great importance to the security of we man for have gain time they retire to the higher grounds there be miss that day about two hundred bow-man a few horse and a inconsiderable number of servant and baggage lii -- however by all these thing the price of provision be raise which be commonly a disaster attendant not only on a time of present scarcity but on the apprehension of future want provision have now reach fifty denarius each bushel and the want of corn have diminish the strength of the soldier and the inconvenience be increase every day : and so great a alteration be work in a few day and fortune have so changed side that we man have to struggle with the want of every necessary while the enemy have a abundant supply of all thing and be consider to have the advantage caesar demand from those state which have accede to he alliance a supply of cattle as they have but little corn he send away the camp follower to the more distant state and endeavor to remedy the present scarcity by every resource in he power liii -- afranius and petreius and they friend send fuller and more circumstantial account of these thing to rome to they acquaintance report exaggerated they so that the war appear to be almost at a end when these letter and despatch be receive at rome a great concourse of people resort to the house of afranius and congratulation run high : several go out of italy to cneius pompey some of they to be the first to bring he the intelligence other that they might not be think to have wait the issue of the war and to have come last of all liv -- when caesar 's affair be in this unfavourable position and all the pass be guard by the soldier and horse of afranius and the bridge could not be prepared caesar order he soldier to make ship of the kind that he knowledge of britain a few year before have teach he first the keel and rib be make of light timber then the rest of the hulk of the ship be work with wicker-work and cover over with hide when these be finish he draw they down to the river in waggon in one night a distance of twenty-two mile from he camp and transport in they some soldier across the river and on a sudden take possession of a hill adjoining the bank this he immediately fortify before he be perceive by the enemy to this he afterwards transport a legion : and have begin a bridge on both side he finish it in two day by this mean he bring safe to he camp the convoy and those who have go out to forage and begin to prepare a conveyance for the provision lv -- the same day he make a great part of he horse pass the river who fall on the forager by surprise as they be disperse without any suspicion intercept a incredible number of cattle and people and when some spanish light-armed cohort be send to reinforce the enemy we man judiciously divide themselves into two part the one to protect the spoil the other to resist the advance foe and to beat they back and they cut off from the rest and surround one cohort which have rashly venture out of the line before the other and after put it to the sword return safe with considerable booty to the camp over the same bridge lvi -- whilst these affair be go forward at ilerda the massilian adopt the advice of domitius prepared seventeen ship of war of which eleven be deck to these they add several smaller vessel that we fleet might be terrify by number : they man they with a great number of archer and of the albicus of whom mention have be already make and these they incite by reward and promise domitius require certain ship for he own use which he man with colonist and shepherd whom he have bring along with he a fleet be thus furnish with every necessary he advance with great confidence against we ship command by decimus brutus it be station at a island opposite to massilia lvii -- brutus be much inferior in number of ship but caesar have appoint to that fleet the bravest man select from all he legion antesignanus and centurion who have request to be employ in that service they have provide iron hook and harpoon and have furnish themselves with a vast number of javelin dart and missile thus prepared and be apprise of the enemy 's approach they put out from the harbor and engage the massilian both side fight with great courage and resolution nor do the albicus a hardy people breed on the highland and inure to arm fall much short of we man in valor : and be lately come from the massilian they retain in they mind they recent promise : and the wild shepherd encourage by the hope of liberty be eager to prove they zeal in the presence of they master lviii -- the massilian themselves confide in the quickness of they ship and the skill of they pilot elude ours and evade the shock and as long as they be permit by clear space lengthen they line they endeavor to surround we or to attack single ship with several of theirs or to run across we ship and carry away we oar if possible but when necessity oblige they to come nearer they have recourse from the skill and art of the pilot to the valor of the mountaineer but we man not have such expert seaman or skilful pilot for they have be hastily draft from the merchant ship and be not yet acquaint even with the name of the rigging be moreover impede by the heaviness and slowness of we vessel which have be build in a hurry and of green timber be not so easily manoeuvre therefore when caesar 's man have a opportunity of a close engagement they cheerfully oppose two of the enemy 's ship with one of theirs and throw in the grapple iron and hold both ship fast they fight on both side of the deck and board the enemy 's and have kill number of the albicus and shepherd they sink some of they ship take other with the man on board and drive the rest into the harbor that day the massilian lose nine ship include those that be take lix -- when news of this battle be bring to caesar at ilerda the bridge be complete at the same time fortune soon take a turn the enemy daunt by the courage of we horse do not scour the country as freely or as boldly as before : but sometimes advance a small distance from the camp that they might have a ready retreat they forage within narrower bound : at other time they take a longer circuit to avoid we outpost and party of horse or have sustain some loss or descry we horse at a distance they flee in the midst of they expedition leave they baggage behind they at length they resolve to leave off forage for several day and contrary to the practice of all nation to go out at night lx -- in the meantime the oscens and the calagurritanus who be under the government of the oscens send ambassador to caesar and offer to submit to he order they be follow by the tarraconens jacetanus and ausetanus and in a few day more by the illurgavonens who dwell near the river ebro he require of they all to assist he with corn to which they agree and have collect all the cattle in the country they convey they into he camp one entire cohort of the illurgavonens know the design of they state come over to caesar from the place where they be station and carry they color with they a great change be shortly make in the face of affair the bridge be finish five powerful state be join to caesar a way open for the receiving of corn and the rumor of the assistance of legion which be say to be on they march with pompey at they head through mauritanium have die away several of the more distant state revolt from afranius and enter into league with caesar lxi -- whilst the spirit of the enemy be dismay at these thing caesar that he might not be always oblige to send he horse a long circuit round by the bridge have find a convenient place begin to sink several drain thirty foot deep by which he might draw off a part of the river segre and make a ford over it when these be almost finish afranius and petreius begin to be greatly alarmed lest they should be altogether cut off from corn and forage because caesar be very strong in cavalry they therefore resolve to quit they post and to transfer the war to celtiberium there be moreover a circumstance that confirm they in this resolution : for of the two adverse party that which have stand by sertorius in the late war be conquer by pompey still tremble at he name and sway though absent : the other which have remain firm in pompey 's interest love he for the favor which they have receive : but caesar 's name be not know to the barbarian from these they expect considerable aid both of horse and foot and hope to protract the war till winter in a friendly country have come to this resolution they give order to collect all the ship in the river ebro and to bring they to octogesa a town situate on the river ebro about twenty mile distant from they camp at this part of the river they order a bridge to be make of boat fasten together and transport two legion over the river segre and fortify they camp with a rampart twelve foot high lxii -- notice of this be give by the scout caesar continue he work day and night with very great fatigue to the soldier to drain the river and so far effect he purpose that the horse be both able and bold enough though with some difficulty and danger to pass the river but the foot have only they shoulder and upper part of they breast above the water so that they ford it be retard not only by the depth of the water but also by the rapidity of the current however almost at the same instant news be receive of the bridge be nearly complete over the ebro and a ford be find in the segre lxiii -- now indeed the enemy begin to think that they ought to hasten they march accordingly leave two auxiliary cohort in the garrison at ilerda they cross the segre with they whole force and form one camp with the two legion which they have lead across a few day before caesar have no resource but to annoy and cut down they rear since with he cavalry to go by the bridge require he to take a long circuit so that they would arrive at the ebro by a much shorter route the horse which he have detach cross the ford and when afranius and petreius have break up they camp about the third watch they suddenly appear on they rear and spread round they in great number begin to retard and impede they march lxiv -- at break of day it be perceive from the rise grounds which join caesar 's camp that they rear be vigorously press by we horse that the last line sometimes halt and be break at other time that they join battle and that we man be beat back by a general charge of they cohort and in they turn pursue they when they wheel about : but through the whole camp the soldier gather in party and declare they chagrin that the enemy have be suffer to escape from they hand and that the war have be unnecessarily protracted they apply to they tribune and centurion and entreat they to inform caesar that he need not spare they labor or consider they danger that they be ready and able and would venture to ford the river where the horse have cross caesar encourage by they zeal and importunity though he feel reluctant to expose he army to a river so exceedingly large yet judge it prudent to attempt it and make a trial accordingly he order all the weaker soldier whose spirit or strength seem unequal to the fatigue to be select from each century and leave they with one legion besides to guard the camp : the rest of the legion he draw out without any baggage and have dispose a great number of horse in the river above and below the ford he lead he army over a few of he soldier be carry away by the force of the current be stop by the horse and take up and not a man perish he army be safe on the opposite bank he draw out he force and resolve to lead they forward in three battalion : and so great be the ardor of the soldier that notwithstanding the addition of a circuit of six mile and a considerable delay in ford the river before the ninth hour of the day they come up with those who have set out at the third watch lxv -- when afranius who be in company with petreius see they at a distance be affright at so unexpected a sight he halt on a rise ground and draw up he army caesar refresh he army on the plain that he might not expose they to battle whilst fatigued and when the enemy attempt to renew they march he pursue and stop they they be oblige to pitch they camp sooner than they have intend for there be mountain at a small distance and difficult and narrow road await they about five mile off they retire behind these mountain that they might avoid caesar 's cavalry and place party in the narrow road stop the progress of he army and lead they own force across the ebro without danger or apprehension this it be they interest to attempt and to effect by any means possible but fatigue by the skirmish all day and by the labor of they march they defer it till the follow day : caesar likewise encamp on the next hill lxvi -- about midnight a few of they man who have go some distance from the camp to fetch water be take by we horse caesar be inform by they that the general of the enemy be draw they troops out of the camp without noise upon this information caesar order the signal to be give and the military shout to be raise for pack up the baggage when they hear the shout be afraid lest they should be stop in the night and oblige to engage under they baggage or lest they should be confine in the narrow road by caesar 's horse they put a stop to they march and keep they force in they camp the next day petreius go out privately with a few horse to reconnoitre the country a similar movement be make from caesar 's camp lucius decidius saxa be detach with a small party to explore the nature of the country each return with the same account to he camp that there be a level road for the next five mile that there then succeed a rough and mountainous country whichever should first obtain possession of the defile would have no trouble in prevent the other 's progress lxvii -- there be a debate in the council between afranius and petreius and the time of march be the subject the majority be of opinion that they should begin they march at night for they might reach the defile before they should be discover other because a shout have be raise the night before in caesar 's camp use this as a argument that they could not leave the camp unnoticed : that caesar 's cavalry be patrolling the whole night and that all the way and road be beset that battle at night ought to be avoid because in civil dissension a soldier once daunt be more apt to consult he fear than he oath that the daylight raise a strong sense of shame in the eye of all and that the presence of the tribune and centurion have the same effect : by these thing the soldier would be re strained and awed to they duty wherefore they should by all mean attempt to force they way by day for though a trifling loss might be sustained yet the post which they desire might be secure with safety to the main body of the army this opinion prevail in the council and the next day at the dawn they resolve to set forward lxviii -- caesar have take a view of the country the moment the sky begin to grow white lead he force from the camp and march at the head of he army by a long circuit keep to no regular road for the road which lead to the ebro and octogesa be occupy by the enemy 's camp which lay in caesar 's way he soldier be oblige to cross extensive and difficult valley craggy cliff in several place interrupt they march insomuch that they arm have to be hand to one another and the soldier be force to perform a great part of they march unarmed and be lift up the rock by each other but not a man murmur at the fatigue because they imagine that there would be a period to all they toil if they could cut off the enemy from the ebro and intercept they convoy lxix -- at first afranius 's soldier run in high spirit from they camp to look at we and in contumelious language upbraid we that we be force for want of necessary subsistence to run away and return to ilerda for we route be different from what we propose and we appear to be go a contrary way but they general applaud they own prudence in keep within they camp and it be a strong confirmation of they opinion that they see we march without waggon or baggage which make they confident that we could not long endure want but when they see we army gradually wheel to the right and observe we van be already pass the line of they camp there be nobody so stupid or averse to fatigue as not to think it necessary to march from the camp immediately and oppose we the cry to arm be raise and all the army except a few which be leave to guard the camp set out and march the direct road to the ebro lxx -- the contest depend entirely on despatch which should first get possession of the defile and the mountain the difficulty of the road delay caesar 's army but he cavalry pursue afranius 's force retard they march however the affair be necessarily reduce to this point with respect to afranius 's man that if they first gain the mountain which they desire they would themselves avoid all danger but could not save the baggage of they whole army nor the cohort which they have leave behind in the camp to which be intercept by caesar 's army by no means could assistance be give caesar first accomplish the march and have find a plain behind large rock draw up he army there in order of battle and face the enemy afranius perceive that he rear be gall by we cavalry and see the enemy before he have come to a hill make a halt on it thence he detach four cohort of spanish light infantry to the highest mountain which be in view : to this he order they to hasten with all expedition and to take possession of it with the intention of go to the same place with all he force then alter he route and cross the hill to octogesa as the spaniard be make towards it in a oblique direction caesar 's horse espy they and attack they nor be they able to withstand the charge of the cavalry even for a moment but be all surround and cut to piece in the sight of the two army lxxi -- there be now a opportunity for manage affair successfully nor do it escape caesar that a army daunt at suffer such a loss before they eye could not stand especially as they be surround by we horse and the engagement would take place on even and open ground to this he be importune on all side the lieutenant centurion and tribune gather round he and beg that he would not hesitate to begin the battle : that the heart of all the soldier be very anxious for it : that afranius 's man have by several circumstance betray sign of fear in that they have not assist they party in that they have not quit the hill in that they do not sustain the charge of we cavalry but crowd they standard into one place do not observe either rank or order but if he have any apprehension from the disadvantage of the ground that a opportunity would be give he of come to battle in some other place : for that afranius must certainly come down and would not be able to remain there for want of water lxxii -- caesar have conceive hope of end the affair without a engagement or without strike a blow because he have cut off the enemy 's supplies why should he hazard the loss of any of he man even in a successful battle why should he expose soldier to be wound who have deserve so well of he why in short should he tempt fortune especially when it be as much a general 's duty to conquer by tactic as by the sword besides he be move with compassion for those citizen who he foresee must fall : and he have rather gain he object without any loss or injury to they this resolution of caesar be not generally approve of but the soldier openly declare to each other that since such a opportunity of victory be let pass they would not come to a engagement even when caesar should wish it he persevere however in he resolution and retire a little from that place to abate the enemy 's fear petreius and afranius have get this opportunity retire to they camp caesar have dispose party on the mountain and cut off all access to the ebro fortify he camp as close to the enemy as he could lxxiii -- the day follow the general of he opponent be alarm that they have lose all prospect of supplies and of access to the ebro consult as to what other course they should take there be two road one to ilerda if they choose to return the other to tarraco if they should march to it whilst they be deliberate on these matter intelligence be bring they that they watering party be attack by we horse : upon which information they dispose several party of horse and auxiliary foot along the road and intermix some legionary cohort and begin to throw up a rampart from the camp to the water that they might be able to procure water within they line both without fear and without a guard petreius and afranius divide this task between themselves and go in person to some distance from they camp for the purpose of see it accomplish lxxiv -- the soldier have obtain by they absence a free opportunity of converse with each other come out in great number and inquire each for whatever acquaintance or fellow citizen he have in we camp and invite he to he first they return they general thanks for spare they the day before when they be greatly terrify and acknowledge that they be alive through they kindness then they inquire about the honor of we general and whether they could with safety entrust themselves to he and declare they sorrow that they have not do so in the beginning and that they have take up arm against they relation and kinsman encourage by these conference they desire the general 's parole for the life of petreius and afranius that they might not appear guilty of a crime in have betray they general when they be assure of obtain they demand they promise that they would immediately remove they standard and send centurion of the first rank as deputy to treat with caesar about a peace in the meantime some of they invite they acquaintance and bring they to they camp other be bring away by they friend so that the two camp seem to be unite into one and several of the tribune and centurion come to caesar and pay they respects to he the same be do by some of the nobility of spain whom they summon to they assistance and keep in they camp as hostage they inquire after they acquaintance and friend by whom each might have the means of be recommend to caesar even afranius 's son a young man endeavor by means of sulpitius the lieutenant to make term for he own and he father 's life every place be fill with mirth and congratulation in the one army because they think they have escape so impending danger in the other because they think they have complete so important a matter without blow and caesar in every man 's judgment reap the advantage of he former lenity and he conduct be applaud by all lxxv -- when these circumstance be announce to afranius he leave the work which he have begin and return to he camp determine as it appear whatever should be the event to bear it with a even and steady mind petreius do not neglect himself he arm he domestic with they and the praetorian cohort of spaniard and a few foreign horse he dependant whom he commonly keep near he to guard he person he suddenly fly to the rampart interrupt the conference of the soldier drive we man from the camp and put to death as many as he catch the rest form into a body and be alarm by the unexpected danger wrap they leave arm in they cloak and draw they sword and in this manner depend on the nearness of they camp defend themselves against the spaniard and the horse and make good they retreat to the camp where they be protect by the cohort which be on guard lxxvi -- petreius after accomplish this go round every maniple call the soldier by they name and entreat with tear that they would not give up he and they absent general pompey as a sacrifice to the vengeance of they enemy immediately they run in crowd to the general 's pavilion when he require they all to take a oath that they would not desert nor betray the army nor the general nor form any design distinct from the general interest he himself swear first to the tenor of those word and oblige afranius to take the same oath the tribune and centurion follow they example the soldier be bring out by century and take the same oath they give order that whoever have any of caesar 's soldier should produce they as soon as they be produce they put they to death publicly in the praetorium but most of they conceal those that they have entertain and let they out at night over the rampart thus the terror raise by the general the cruelty of the punishment the new obligation of a oath remove all hope of surrender for the present change the soldier ' mind and reduce matter to the former state of war lxxvii -- caesar order the enemy 's soldier who have come into he camp to hold a conference to be search for with the strictest diligence and send back but of the tribune and centurion several voluntarily remain with he and he afterwards treat they with great respect the centurion he promote to higher rank and confer on the roman knight the honor of tribune lxxviii -- afranius 's man be distressed in forage and procured water with difficulty the legionary soldier have a tolerable supply of corn because they have be order to bring from ilerda sufficient to last twenty-two day the spanish and auxiliary force have none for they have but few opportunity of procure any and they body be not accustom to bear burden and therefore a great number of they come over to caesar every day they affair be under these difficulty but of the two scheme propose the most expedient seem to be to return to ilerda because they have leave some corn there and there they hope to decide on a plan for they future conduct tarraco lay at a greater distance and in such a space they know affair might admit of many change they design have meet with approbation they set out from they camp caesar have send forward he cavalry to annoy and retard they rear follow close after with he legion not a moment pass in which they rear be not engage with we horse lxxix -- they manner of fighting be this : the light cohort close they rear and frequently make a stand on the level grounds if they have a mountain to ascend the very nature of the place readily secure they from any danger for the advanced guard from the rise grounds protect the rest in they ascent when they approach a valley or declivity and the advanced man could not impart assistance to the tardy we horse throw they dart at they from the rise grounds with advantage then they affair be in a perilous situation the only plan leave be that whenever they come near such place they should give order to the legion to halt and by a violent effort repulse we horse and these be force to give way they should suddenly with the utmost speed run all together down to the valley and have pass it should face about again on the next hill for so far be they from derive any assistance from they horse -lrb- of which they have a large number -rrb- that they be oblige to receive they into the center of they army and themselves protect they as they be daunt by former battle and on they march no one could quit the line without be take by caesar 's horse lxxx -- whilst skirmish be fight in this manner they advance but slowly and gradually and frequently halt to help they rear as then happen for have advance four mile and be very much harass by we horse they take post on a high mountain and there entrenched themselves on the front only face the enemy and do not take they baggage off they cattle when they perceive that caesar 's camp be pitch and the tent fix up and he horse send out to forage they suddenly rush out about twelve o'clock the same day and have hope that we should be delay by the absence of we horse they begin to march which caesar perceive follow they with the legion that remain he leave a few cohort to guard he baggage and order the forager to be call home at the tenth hour and the horse to follow he the horse shortly return to they daily duty on march and charge the rear so vigorously that they almost force they to fly and several private and some centurion be kill the main body of caesar 's army be at hand and universal ruin threaten they lxxxi -- then indeed not have opportunity either to choose a convenient position for they camp or to march forward they be oblige to halt and to encamp at a distance from water and on ground naturally unfavourable but for the reason already give caesar do not attack they nor suffer a tent to be pitch that day that he man might be the readier to pursue they whether they attempt to run off by night or by day observe the defect in they position they spend the whole night in extend they work and turn they camp to ours the next day at dawn they do the same and spend the whole day in that manner but in proportion as they advance they work and extend they camp they be farther distant from the water and one evil be remedy by another the first night no one go out for water the next day they leave a guard in the camp and lead out all they force to water : but not a person be send to look for forage caesar be more desirous that they should be humble by these means and force to come to term than decide the contest by battle yet he endeavor to surround they with a wall and trench that he might be able to check they most sudden sally to which he imagine that they must have recourse hereupon urge by want of fodder that they might be the readier for a march they kill all they baggage cattle lxxxii -- in this work and the deliberation on it two day be spend by the third day a considerable part of caesar 's work be finish to interrupt he progress they draw out they legion about the eighth hour by a certain signal and place they in order of battle before they camp caesar call he legion off from they work and order the horse to hold themselves in readiness marshal he army : for to appear to decline a engagement contrary to the opinion of the soldier and the general voice would have be attend with great disadvantage but for the reason already know he be dissuade from wish to engage and the more especially because the short space between the camp even if the enemy be put to flight would not contribute much to a decisive victory for the two camp be not distant from each other above two thousand foot two part of this be occupy by the army and one third left for the soldier to charge and make they attack if a battle should be begin the nearness of the camp would afford a ready retreat to the conquer party in the flight for this reason caesar have resolve to make resistance if they attack he but not to be the first to provoke the battle lxxxiii -- afranius 's five legion be draw up in two line the auxiliary cohort form the third line and act as reserve caesar have three line four cohort out of each of the five legion form the first line three more from each legion follow they as reserve : and three other be behind these the slinger and archer be station in the center of the line the cavalry close the flank the hostile army be arrange in this manner each seem determine to adhere to he first intention : caesar not to hazard a battle unless force to it afranius to interrupt caesar 's work however the matter be defer and both army keep under arm till sunset when they both return to they camp the next day caesar prepare to finish the work which he have begin the enemy attempt to pass the river segre by a ford caesar have perceive this send some light-armed german and a party of horse across the river and disposed several party along the bank to guard they lxxxiv -- at length beset on all side they cattle have be four day without fodder and have no water wood or corn they beg a conference and that if possible in a place remote from the soldier when this be refuse by caesar but a public interview offer if they choose it afranius 's son be give as a hostage to caesar they meet in the place appoint by caesar in the hearing of both army afranius speak thus : that caesar ought not to be displeased either with he or he soldier for wish to preserve they attachment to they general cneius pompey that they have now sufficiently discharge they duty to he and have suffer punishment enough in have endure the want of every necessary : but now pen up almost like wild beast they be prevent from procure water and prevent from walk abroad and be not able to bear the bodily pain or the mental disgrace : but confess themselves vanquish : and beg and entreat if there be any room leave for mercy that they should not be necessitate to suffer the most severe penalty these sentiment be deliver in the most submissive and humble language lxxxv -- caesar reply that either to complain or sue for mercy become no man less than he : for that every other person have do they duty : himself in have decline to engage on favourable term in a advantageous situation and time that all thing tend to a peace might be totally unembarrassed : he army in have preserve and protect the man whom they have in they power notwithstanding the injury which they have receive and the murder of they comrade and even afranius 's soldier who of themselves treat about conclude a peace by which they think that they would secure the life of all thus that the party on both side incline to mercy : that the general only be averse to peace : that they pay no regard to the law either of conference or truce and have most inhumanly put to death ignorant person who be deceive by a conference : that therefore they have meet that fate which usually befall man from excessive obstinacy and arrogance and be oblige to have recourse and most earnestly desire that which they have shortly before disdain that for he part he would not avail himself of they present humiliation or he present advantage to require term by which he power might be increase but only that those army which they have maintain for so many year to oppose he should be disband : for six legion have be send into spain and a seventh raise there and many and powerful fleet provide and general of great military experience send to command they for no other purpose than to oppose he that none of these measure be adopt to keep the spain in peace or for the use of the province which from the length of the peace stand in need of no such aid that all these thing be long since design against he : that against he a new sort of government be establish that the same person should be at the gate of rome to direct the affair of the city and though absent have the government of two most warlike province for so many year : that against he the law of the magistrate have be alter that the late praetor and consul should not be send to govern the province as have be the constant custom but person approve of and choose by a faction that against he the excuse of age be not admit : but person of try experience in former war be call up to take the command of the army that with respect to he only the routine be not observe which have be allow to all general that after a successful war they should return home and disband they army if not with some mark of honor at least without disgrace : that he have submit to all these thing patiently and would still submit to they : nor do he now desire to take they army from they and keep it to himself -lrb- which however would not be a difficult matter -rrb- but only that they should not have it to employ against he : and therefore as he say before let they quit the province and disband they army if this be comply with he would injure no person that these be the last and only condition of peace lxxxvi -- it be very acceptable and agreeable to afranius 's soldier as might be easily know from they sign of joy that they who expect some injury after this defeat should obtain without solicitation the reward of a dismissal for when a debate be introduce about the place and time of they dismissal they all begin to express both by word and sign from the rampart where they stand that they should be discharge immediately : for although every security might be give that they would be disband still the matter would be uncertain if it be defer to a future day after a short debate on either side it be bring to this issue : that those who have any settlement or possession in spain should be immediately discharge : the rest at the river var caesar give security that they should receive no damage and that no person should be oblige against he inclination to take the military oath under he lxxxvii -- caesar promise to supply they with corn from the present time till they arrive at the river var he further add that whatever any of they lose in the war which be in the possession of he soldier should be restore to those that lose they to he soldier he make a recompense in money for those thing a just valuation be make whatever dispute afranius 's soldier have afterwards amongst themselves they voluntarily submit to caesar 's decision afranius and petreius when pay be demand by the legion a sedition almost break out assert that the time have not yet come and require that caesar should take cognizance of it : and both party be content with he decision about a third part of they army be dismiss in two day caesar order two of he legion to go before the rest to follow the vanquished enemy : that they should encamp at a small distance from each other the execution of this business he give in charge to quintus fufius kalenus one of he lieutenant accord to he direction they march from spain to the river var and there the rest of the army be disband book ii i -- whilst these thing be go forward in spain caius trebonius caesar 's lieutenant who have be leave to conduct the assault of massilium begin to raise a mound vinea and turret against the town on two side : one of which be next the harbor and dock the other on that part where there be a passage from gaul and spain to that sea which force itself up the mouth of the rhone for massilium be wash almost on three side by the sea the remain fourth part be the only side which have access by land a part even of this space which reach to the fortress be fortify by the nature of the country and a very deep valley require a long and difficult siege to accomplish these work caius trebonius send for a great quantity of carriage and man from the whole province and order hurdle and material to be furnish these thing be provide he raise a mound eighty foot in height ii -- but so great a store of everything necessary for a war have be a long time before lay up in the town and so great a number of engine that no vinea make of hurdle could withstand they force for pole twelve foot in length point with iron and these too shoot from very large engine sink into the ground through four row of hurdle therefore the arch of the vinea be cover over with beam a foot thick fasten together and under this the material of the agger be hand from one to another before this be carry a testudo sixty foot long for level the ground make also of very strong timber and cover over with every thing that be capable of protect it against the fire and stone throw by the enemy but the greatness of the work the height of the wall and tower and the multitude of engine retard the progress of we work besides frequent sally be make from the town by the albicus and fire be throw on we mound and turret these we man easily repulse and do considerable damage to those who sally beat they back into the town iii -- in the meantime lucius nasidius be send by cneius pompey with a fleet of sixteen sail a few of which have beak of brass to the assistance of lucius domitius and the massilian pass the strait of sicily without the knowledge or expectation of curio and put with he fleet into messana and make the noble and senate take flight with the sudden terror carry off one of they ship out of dock have join this to he other ship he make good he voyage to massilium and have send in a galley privately acquaint domitius and the massilian of he arrival and earnestly encourage they to hazard another battle with brutus 's fleet with the addition of he aid iv -- the massilian since they former loss have bring the same number of old ship from the dock and have repair and fit they out with great industry : they have a large supply of seaman and pilot they have get several fishing-smack and cover they over that the seaman might be secure against dart : these they fill with archer and engine with a fleet thus appoint encourage by the entreaty and tear of all the old man matron and virgin to succor the state in this hour of distress they go on board with no less spirit and confidence than they have fight before for it happen from a common infirmity of human nature that we be more flush with confidence or more vehemently alarm at thing unseen conceal and unknown as be the case then for the arrival of lucius nasidius have fill the state with the most sanguine hope and wish have get a fair wind they sail out of port and go to nasidius to tauroi which be a fort belong to the massilian and there range they fleet and again encourage each other to engage and communicate they plan of operation the command of the right division be give to the massilian that of the leave to nasidius v -- brutus sail to the same place with a augmented fleet : for to those make by caesar at arela be add six ship take from the massilian which he have refit since the last battle and have furnish with every necessary accordingly have encourage he man to despise a vanquished people whom they have conquer when yet unbroken he advance against they full of confidence and spirit from trebonius 's camp and all the higher grounds it be easy to see into the town -- how all the youth which remain in it and all person of more advanced year with they wife and child and the public guard be either extend they hand from the wall to the heaven or be repair to the temple of the immortal god and prostrate themselves before they image be entreat they to grant they victory nor be there a single person who do not imagine that he future fortune depend on the issue of that day for the choice of they youth and the most respectable of every age be expressly invite and solicit have go on board the fleet that if any adverse fate should befall they they might see that nothing be leave for they to attempt and if they prove victorious they might have hope of preserve the city either by they internal resource or by foreign assistance vi -- when the battle be begin no effort of valor be want to the massilian but mindful of the instruction which they have a little before receive from they friend they fight with such spirit as if they suppose that they would never have another opportunity to attempt a defense and as if they believe that those whose life should be endanger in the battle would not long precede the fate of the rest of the citizen who if the city be take must undergo the same fortune of war we ship be at some distance from each other room be allow both for the skill of they pilot and the manoeuvring of they ship and if at any time ours gain a advantage by cast the iron hook on board they ship grapple with they from all part they assist those who be distressed nor after be join by the albicus do they decline come to close engagement nor be they much inferior to we man in valor at the same time shower of dart throw from a distance from the lesser ship suddenly inflict several wound on we man when off they guard and otherwise engage and two of they three-decked galley have descry the ship of decimus brutus which could be easily distinguish by its flag row up against he with great violence from opposite side : but brutus see into they design by the swiftness of he ship extricate himself with such address as to get clear though only by a moment from the velocity of they motion they strike against each other with such violence that they be both excessively injure by the shock the beak indeed of one of they be break off the whole ship be ready to founder which circumstance be observe the ship of brutus 's fleet which be nearest that station attack they when in this disorder and sink they both vii -- but nasidius 's ship be of no use and soon leave the fight for the sight of they country or the entreaty of they relation do not urge they to run a desperate risk of they life therefore of the number of the ship not one be lose : of the fleet of the massilian five be sink four take and one run off with nasidius : all that escape make the best of they way to hither spain but one of the rest be send forward to massilia for the purpose of bear this intelligence and when it come near the city the whole people crowd out to hear the tiding and on be inform of the event be so oppressed with grief that one would have imagine that the city have be take by a enemy at the same moment the massilian however begin to make the necessary preparation for the defense of they city with unwearied energy viii -- the legionary soldier who have the management of the work on the right side observe from the frequent sally of the enemy that it might prove a great protection to they to build a turret of brick under the wall for a fort and place of refuge which they at first build low and small -lrb- to guard they -rrb- against sudden attack to it they retreat and from it they make defense if any superior force attack they and from it they sally out either to repel or pursue the enemy it extend thirty foot on every side and the thickness of the wall be five foot but afterwards as experience be the best master in everything on which the wit of man be employ it be find that it might be of considerable service if it be raise to the usual height of turret which be effect in the follow manner ix-when the turret be raise to the height for flooring they lay it on the wall in such a manner that the end of the joist be cover by the outer face of the wall that nothing should project to which the enemy 's fire might adhere they moreover build over the joist with small brick as high as the protection of the pluteus and vinea permit they and on that place they lay two beam across angle-way at a small distance from the outer wall to support the rafter which be to cover the turret and on the beam they lay joist across in a direct line and on these they fasten down plank these joist they make somewhat longer to project beyond the outside of the wall that they might serve to hang a curtain on they to defend and repel all blow whilst they be build the wall between that and the next floor and the floor of this story they face with brick and mortar that the enemy 's fire might do they no damage and on this they spread mattress lest the weapon throw from engine should break through the flooring or stone from catapult should batter the brickwork they moreover make three mat of cable rope each of they the length of the turret wall and four foot broad and hang they round the turret on the three side which face the enemy fasten they to the project joist for this be the only sort of defense which they have learn by experience in other place could not be pierce by dart or engine but when that part of the turret which be complete be protect and secure against every attempt of the enemy they remove the pluteus to other work they begin to suspend gradually and raise by screw from the first-floor the entire roof of the turret and then they elevate it as high as the length of the mat allow hide and secure within these covering they build up the wall with brick and again by another turn of the screw clear a place for themselves to proceed with the building and when they think it time to lay another floor they lay the end of the beam cover in by the outer brick in like manner as in the first story and from that story they again raise the uppermost floor and the mat-work in this manner securely and without a blow or danger they raise it six story high and in lay the material leave loop-hole in such place as they think proper for work they engine x -- when they be confident that they could protect the work which lay around from this turret they resolve to build a musculus sixty foot long of timber two foot square and to extend it from the brick tower to the enemy 's tower and wall this be the form of it : two beam of equal length be lay on the ground at the distance of four foot from each other and in they be fasten small pillar five foot high which be join together by brace with a gentle slope on which the timber which they must place to support the roof of the musculus should be lay : upon this be lay beam two foot square bind with iron plate and nail to the upper covering of the musculus and the upper beam they fasten lath four finger square to support the tile which be to cover the musculus the roof be thus sloped and lay over in row in the same manner as the joist be lay on the brace the musculus be cover with tile and mortar to secure it against fire which might be throw from the wall over the tile hide be spread to prevent the water let in on they by spout from dissolve the cement of the brick again the hide be cover over with mattress that they might not be destroy by fire or stone the soldier under the protection of the vinea finish this whole work to the very tower and suddenly before the enemy be aware of it move it forward by naval machinery by put roller under it close up to the enemy 's turret so that it even touch the building xi -- the townsman affright at this unexpected stroke bring forward with lever the largest stone they can procure and pitch they from the wall roll they down on the musculus the strength of the timber withstand the shock and whatever fall on it slide off on account of the sloping roof when they perceive this they alter they plan and set fire to barrel fill with resin and tar and roll they down from the wall on the musculus as soon as they fall on it they slide off again and be remove from its side by long pole and fork in the meantime the soldier under cover of the musculus be looting out with crowbar the lowest stone of the enemy 's turret with which the foundation be lay the musculus be defend by dart throw from engine by we man from the brick tower and the enemy be beat off from the wall and turret nor be a fair opportunity of defend the wall give they at length several stone be pick away from the foundation of that turret next the musculus part of it fall down suddenly and the rest as if follow it lean forward xii -- hereupon the enemy distressed at the sudden fall of the turret surprise at the unforeseen calamity awed by the wrath of the god and dread the pillage of they city rush all together out of the gate unarmed with they temple bind with fillet and suppliantly stretch out they hand to the officer and the army at this uncommon occurrence the whole progress of the war be stop and the soldier turn away from the battle run eagerly to hear and listen to they when the enemy come up to the commander and the army they all fall down at they foot and besought they to wait till caesar 's arrival they see that they city be take we work complete and they tower undermine therefore they desist from a defense that no obstacle could arise to prevent they be instantly plunder at a beck as soon as he arrive if they refuse to submit to he order they inform they that if the turret have entirely fall down the soldier could not be withhold from force into the town and sack it in hope of get spoil these and several other argument to the same effect be deliver as they be a people of great learning with great pathos and lamentation xiii -- the lieutenant move with compassion draw off the soldier from the work desist from the assault and leave sentinel on the work a sort of a truce have be make through compassion for the besiege the arrival of caesar be anxiously await not a dart be throw from the wall or by we man but all remit they care and diligence as if the business be at a end for caesar have give trebonius strict charge not to suffer the town to be take by storm lest the soldier too much irritated both by abhorrence of they revolt by the contempt show to they and by they long labor should put to the sword all the grown-up inhabitant as they threaten to do and it be with difficulty that they be then restrain from break into the town and they be much displeased because they imagine that they be prevent by trebonius from take possession of it xiv -- but the enemy destitute of all honor only wait a time and opportunity for fraud and treachery and after a interval of some day when we man be careless and negligent on a sudden at noon when some be disperse and other indulge themselves in rest on the very work after the fatigue of the day and they arm be all lay by and cover up they sally out from the gate and the wind be high and favourable to they they set fire to we work and the wind spread it in such a manner that in the same instant the agger plutei testudo tower and engine all catch the flame and be consume before we could conceive how it have occur we man alarm at such a unexpected turn of fortune lay hold on such arm as they could find some rush from the camp a attack be make on the enemy : but they be prevent by arrow and engine from the wall from pursue they when they flee they retire to they wall and there without fear set the musculus and brick tower on fire thus by the perfidy of the enemy and the violence of the storm the labor of many month be destroy in a moment the massilian make the same attempt the next day have get such another storm they sally out against the other tower and agger and fight with more confidence but as we man have on the former occasion give up all thought of a contest so warn by the event of the precede day they have make every preparation for a defense accordingly they slew several and force the rest to retreat into the town without effect they design xv -- trebonius begin to provide and repair what have be destroy with much greater zeal on the part of the soldier for when they see that they extraordinary pain and preparation have a unfortunate issue they be fire with indignation that in consequence of the impious violation of the truce they valor should be hold in derision there be no place leave they from which the material for they mound could be fetch in consequence of all the timber far and wide in the territory of the massilian have be cut down and carry away they begin therefore to make a agger of a new construction never hear of before of two wall of brick each six foot thick and to lay floor over they of almost the same breadth with the agger make of timber but wherever the space between the wall or the weakness of the timber seem to require it pillar be place underneath and traverse beam lay on to strengthen the work and the space which be floor be cover over with hurdle and the hurdle plaster over with mortar the soldier cover overhead by the floor on the right and leave by the wall and in the front by the mantlet carry whatever material be necessary for the building without danger : the business be soon finish -- the loss of they laborious work be soon repair by the dexterity and fortitude of the soldier gate for make sally be leave in the wall in such place as they think proper xvi -- but when the enemy perceive that those work which they have hope could not be replace without a great length of time be put into so thorough repair by a few day ' labor and diligence that there be no room for perfidy or sally and that no means be leave they by which they could either hurt the man by resistance or the work by fire and when they find by former example that they town could be surround with a wall and turret on every part by which it be accessible by land in such a manner that they could not have room to stand on they own fortification because we work be build almost on the top of they wall by we army and dart could be throw from we hand and when they perceive that all advantage arise from they engine on which they have build great hope be totally lose and that though they have a opportunity of fight with we on equal term from wall and turret they could perceive that they be not equal to we man in bravery they have recourse to the same proposal of surrender as before xvii -- in further spain marcus varro in the beginning of the disturbance when he hear of the circumstance which take place in italy be diffident of pompey 's success use to speak in a very friendly manner of caesar that though be pre-engaged to cneius pompey in quality of lieutenant he be bind in honor to he that nevertheless there exist a very intimate tie between he and caesar that he be not ignorant of what be the duty of a lieutenant who bear a office of trust nor of he own strength nor of the disposition of the whole province to caesar these sentiment he constantly express in he ordinary conversation and do not attach himself to either party but afterwards when he find that caesar be detain before massilium that the force of petreius have effect a junction with the army of afranius that considerable reinforcement have come to they assistance that there be great hope and expectation and hear that the whole hither province have enter into a confederacy and of the difficulty to which caesar be reduce afterwards at ilerda for want of provision and afranius write to he a fuller and more exaggerated account of these matter he begin to regulate he movement by those of fortune xviii -- he make levy throughout the province and have complete he two legion he add to they about thirty auxiliary cohort : he collect a large quantity of corn to send partly to the massilian partly to afranius and petreius he command the inhabitant of gade to build ten ship of war besides he take care that several other should be build in spain he remove all the money and ornament from the temple of hercule to the town of gade and send six cohort thither from the province to guard they and give the command of the town of gade to caius gallonius a roman knight and friend of domitius who have come thither send by domitius to recover a estate for he and he deposit all the arm both public and private in gallonius 's house he himself -lrb- varro -rrb- make severe harangue against caesar he often pronounce from he tribunal that caesar have fight several unsuccessful battle and that a great number of he man have desert to afranius that he have these account from undoubted messenger and authority on which he could rely by these means he terrify the roman citizen of that province and oblige they to promise he for the service of the state one hundred and ninety thousand sesterce twenty thousand pound weight of silver and a hundred and twenty thousand bushel of wheat he lay heavier burden on those state which he think be friendly disposed to caesar and billet troops on they he pass judgment against some private person and condemn to confiscation the property of those who have speak or make oration against the republic and force the whole province to take a oath of allegiance to he and pompey be inform of all that happen in hither spain he prepare for war this be he plan of operation he be to retire with he two legion to gade and to lay up all the shipping and provision there for he have be inform that the whole province be incline to favor caesar 's party he think that the war might be easily protracted in a island if he be provide with corn and shipping caesar although call back to italy by many and important matter yet have determine to leave no dregs of war behind he in spain because he know that pompey have many dependant and client in the hither province xix -- have therefore send two legion into further spain under the command of quintus cassius tribune of the people he himself advance with six hundred horse by force march and issue a proclamation appoint a day on which the magistrate and nobility of all the state should attend he at corduba this proclamation be publish through the whole province there be not a state that do not send a part of they senate to corduba at the appoint time and not a roman citizen of any note but appear that day at the same time the senate at corduba shut the gate of they own accord against varro and post guard and sentinel on the wall and in the turret and detain two cohort -lrb- call colonica which have come there accidentally -rrb- for the defense of the town about the same time the people of carmona which be by far the strongest state in the whole province of themselves drive out of the town the cohort and shut the gate against they although three cohort have be detach by varro to garrison the citadel xx -- but varro be in greater haste on this account to reach gade with he legion as soon as possible lest he should be stop either on he march or on cross over to the island the affection of the province to caesar prove so great and so favourable that he receive a letter from gade before he be far advance on he march : that as soon as the nobility of gade hear of caesar 's proclamation they have combine with the tribune of the cohort which be in garrison there to drive gallonius out of the town and to secure the city and island for caesar that have agree on the design they have send notice to gallonius to quit gade of he own accord whilst he could do it with safety if he do not they would take measure for themselves that for fear of this gallonius have be induce to quit the town when this be know one of varro 's two legion which be call vernaculum carry off the color from varro 's camp he himself stand by and look on and retire to hispali and take post in the market and public place without do any injury and the roman citizen reside there approve so highly of this act that every one most earnestly offer to entertain they in they house when varro terrify at these thing have alter he route propose go to italica he be inform by he friend that the gate be shut against he then indeed when intercept from every road he send word to caesar that he be ready to deliver up the legion which he command he send to he sextus caesar and order he to deliver it up to he varro have deliver up the legion go to caesar to corduba and have lay before he the public account hand over to he most faithfully whatever money he have and tell he what quantity of corn and shipping he have and where xxi -- caesar make a public oration at corduba in which he return thanks to all severally : to the roman citizen because they have be zealous to keep the town in they own power to the spaniard for have drive out the garrison to the gaditanus for have defeat the attempt of he enemy and assert they own liberty to the tribune and centurion who have go there as a guard for have by they valor confirm they in they purpose he remit the tax which the roman citizen have promise to varro for the public use : he restore they goods to those who he be inform have incur that penalty by speak too freely have give public and private reward to some : he fill the rest with flattering hope of he future intention and have stay two day at corduba he set out for gade : he order the money and ornament which have be carry away from the temple of hercule and lodge in the house of private person to be replace in the temple he make quintus cassius governor of the province and assign he four legion he himself with those ship which marcus varro have build and other which the gaditanus have build by varro 's order arrive in a few day at tarraco where ambassador from the greatest part of the nearer province wait he arrival have in the same manner confer mark of honor both publicly and privately on some state he leave tarraco and go thence by land to narbo and thence to massilium there he be inform that a law be pass for create a dictator and that he have be nominate dictator by marcus lepidus the praetor xxii -- the massilian weary out by misfortune of every sort reduce to the lowest ebb for want of corn conquer in two engagement at sea defeat in they frequent sally and struggle moreover with a fatal pestilence from they long confinement and change of victuals -lrb- for they all subsist on old millet and damaged barley which they have formerly provide and lay up in the public store against a emergency of this kind -rrb- they turret be demolish a great part of they wall have give way and despairing of any aid either from the province or they army for these they have hear have fall into caesar 's power resolve to surrender now without dissimulation but a few day before lucius domitius have discover the intention of the massilian and have procure three ship two of which he give up to he friend go on board the third himself have get a brisk wind put out to sea some ship which by brutus 's order be constantly cruise near the port have espy he weigh anchor and pursue he but of these the ship on board of which he be persevere itself and continue its flight and by the aid of the wind get out of sight : the other two affright by the approach of we galley put back again into the harbor the massilian convey they arm and engine out of the town as they be order : bring they ship out of the port and dock and deliver up the money in they treasury when these affair be despatch caesar spare the town more out of regard to they renown and antiquity than to any claim they could lay to he favor leave two legion in garrison there send the rest to italy and set out himself for rome xxiii -- about the same time caius curio have sail from sicily to africa and from the first despise the force of publius attius varus transport only two of the four legion which he have receive from caesar and five hundred horse and have spend two day and three night on the voyage arrive at a place call aquilarium which be about twenty-two mile distant from clupea and in the summer season have a convenient harbor and be enclose by two project promontory lucius caesar the son who be wait he arrival near clupea with ten ship which have be take near utica in a war with the pirate and which publius attius have have repair for this war frighten at the number of we ship flee the sea and run he three-decked covered galley on the nearest shore leave she there and make he escape by land to adrumetum caius considius longus with a garrison of one legion guard this town the rest of caesar 's fleet after he flight retire to adrumetum marcus rufus the quaestor pursue he with twelve ship which curio have bring from sicily as convoy to the merchantman and see a ship leave on the shore he bring she off by a tow rope and return with he fleet to curio xxiv -- curio detach marcus before with the fleet to utica and march thither with he army have advance two day he come to the river bagrada and there leave caius caninius rebilus the lieutenant with the legion and go forward himself with the horse to view the cornelian camp because that be reckon a very eligible position for encamp it be a straight ridge project into the sea steep and rough on both side but the ascent be more gentle on that part which lie opposite utica it be not more than a mile distant from utica in a direct line but on this road there be a spring to which the sea come up and overflow a extensive morass be thereby form and if a person would avoid it he must make a circuit of six mile to reach the town xxv -- have examine this place curio get a view of varus 's camp join the wall and town at the gate call bellica well fortify by its natural situation on one side by the town itself on the other by a theater which be before the town the approach to the town be render difficult and narrow by the very extensive out-building of that structure at the same time he observe the road very full of carriage and cattle which they be convey from the country into the town on the sudden alarm he send he cavalry after they to plunder they and get the spoil and at the same time varus have detach as a guard for they six hundred numidian horse and four hundred foot which king juba have send to utica as auxiliary a few day before there be a friendship subsist between he -lrb- juba 's -rrb- father and pompey and a feud between he and curio because he when a tribune of the people have propose a law in which he endeavor to make public property of the kingdom of juba the horse engage but the numidian be not able to stand we first charge but a hundred and twenty be kill the rest retreat into they camp near the town in the meantime on the arrival of he men-of-war curio order proclamation to be make to the merchant ship which lay at anchor before utica in number about two hundred that he would treat as enemy all that do not set sail immediately for the cornelian camp as soon as the proclamation be make in a instant they all weigh anchor and leave utica and repair to the place command they this circumstance furnish the army with plenty of everything xxvi -- after these transaction curio return to he camp at bagrada and by a general shout of the whole army be salute imperator the next day he lead he army to utica and encamp near the town before the work of the camp be finish the horse upon guard bring he word that a large supply of horse and foot send by king juba be on they march to utica and at the same time a cloud of dust be observe and in a moment the front of the line be in sight curio surprise at the suddenness of the affair send on the horse to receive they first charge and detain they he immediately call off he legion from the work and put they in battle array the horse begin the battle : and before the legion could be completely marshal and take they ground the king 's entire force be throw into disorder and confusion because they have march without any order and be under no apprehension betake themselves to flight : almost all the enemy 's horse be safe because they make a speedy retreat into the town along the shore caesar 's soldier slay a great number of they infantry xxvii -- the next night two marsian centurion with twenty-two man belong to the company desert from curio 's camp to attius varus they whether they utter the sentiment which they really entertain or wish to gratify varus -lrb- for what we wish we readily give credit to and what we think ourselves we hope be the opinion of other man -rrb- assure he that the mind of the whole army be disaffected to curio that it be very expedient that the army should be bring in view of each other and a opportunity of a conference be give induce by they opinion varus the next day lead he troops out of the camp : curio do so in like manner and with only one small valley between they each draw up he force xxviii -- in varus 's army there be one sextus quintilius varus who as we have mention before be at corfinium when caesar give he he liberty he go over to africa now curio have transport to africa those legion which caesar have receive under he command a short time before at corfinium : so that the officer and company be still the same except the change of a few centurion quintilius make this a pretext for address they begin to go round curio 's line and to entreat the soldier not to lose all recollection of the oath which they take first to domitius and to he they quaestor nor bear arm against those who have share the same fortune and endure the same hardship in a siege nor fight for those by whom they have be opprobriously call deserter to this he add a few word by way of encouragement what they might expect from he own liberality if they should follow he and attius on the delivery of this speech no intimation of they future conduct be give by curio 's army and thus both general lead back they troops to they camp xxix -- however a great and general fear spread through curio 's camp for it be soon increase by the various discourse of man for every one form a opinion of he own and to what he have hear from other add he own apprehension when this have spread from a single author to several person and be hand from one another there appear to be many author for such sentiment as these : -lrb- that it be a civil war that they be man and therefore that it be lawful for they to act freely and follow which party they please these be the legion which a short time before have belong to the enemy for the custom of offer free town to those who join the opposite party have change caesar 's kindness for the harshest expression of the soldier in general do not proceed from the marsus and pelignus as those which pass in the tent the night before and some of they fellow soldier hear they with displeasure some addition be also make to they by those who wish to be think more zealous in they duty -rrb- xxx -- for these reason have call a council curio begin to deliberate on the general welfare there be some opinion which advise by all mean a attempt to be make and a attack on varus 's camp for when such sentiment prevail among the soldier they think idleness be improper in short they say that it be better bravely to try the hazard of war in a battle than to be desert and surround by they own troops and force to submit to the greatest cruelty there be some who give they opinion that they ought to withdraw at the third watch to the cornelian camp that by a longer interval of time the soldier might be bring to a proper way of thinking and also that if any misfortune should befall they they might have a safer and readier retreat to sicily from the great number of they ship xxxi -- curio censure both measure say that the one be as deficient in spirit as the other exceed in it : that the latter advise a shameful flight and the former recommend we to engage at a great disadvantage for on what say he can we rely that we can storm a camp fortify both by nature and art or indeed what advantage do we gain if we give over the assault after have suffer considerable loss as if success do not acquire for a general the affection of he army and misfortune they hatred but what do a change of camp imply but a shameful flight and universal despair and the alienation of the army for neither ought the obedient to suspect that they be distrust nor the insolent to know that we fear they because we fear augment the licentiousness of the latter and diminish the zeal of the former but if say he we be convince of the truth of the report of the disaffection of the army -lrb- which i indeed be confident be either altogether groundless or at least less than they be suppose to be -rrb- how much better to conceal and hide we suspicion of it than by we conduct confirm it ought not the defect of a army to be as carefully conceal as the wound in we body lest we should increase the enemy 's hope but they moreover advise we to set out at midnight in order i suppose that those who attempt to do wrong may have a fairer opportunity for conduct of this kind be restrain either by shame or fear to the display of which the night be most adverse wherefore i be neither so rash as to give my opinion that we ought to attack they camp without hope of succeed nor so influence by fear as to despond : and i imagine that every expedient ought first to be try and i be in a great degree confident that i shall form the same opinion as yourselve on this matter xxxii -- have break up the council he call the soldier together and remind they what advantage caesar have derive from they zeal at corfinium how by they good office and influence he have bring over a great part of italy to he interest for say he all the municipal town afterwards imitate you and you conduct nor be it without reason that caesar judge so favourably and the enemy so harshly of you for pompey though beat in no engagement yet be oblige to shift he ground and leave italy from the precedent establish by you conduct caesar commit I whom he consider he dearest friend and the province of sicily and africa without which he be not able to protect rome or italy to you protection there be some here present who encourage you to revolt from we for what can they wish for more than at once to ruin we and to involve you in a heinous crime or what baser opinion could they in they resentment entertain of you than that you would betray those who acknowledge themselves indebted to you for everything and put yourselve in the power of those who think they have be ruin by you have you not hear of caesar 's exploit in spain that he route two army conquer two general recover two province and effect all this within forty day after he come in sight of the enemy can those who be not able to stand against he whilst they be uninjured resist he when they be ruin will you who take part with caesar whilst victory be uncertain take part with the conquered enemy when the fortune of the war be decide and when you ought to reap the reward of you service for they say that they have be desert and betray by you and remind you of a former oath but do you desert lucius domitius or do lucius domitius desert you do he not when you be ready to submit to the greatest difficulty cast you off do he not without you privacy endeavor to effect he own escape when you be betray by he be you not preserve by caesar 's generosity and how could he think you bind by you oath to he when after have throw up the ensign of power and abdicate he government he become a private person and a captive in another 's power a new obligation be leave upon you that you should disregard the oath by which you be at present bind and have respect only to that which be invalidate by the surrender of you general and he diminution of rank but i suppose although you be please with caesar you be offend with I however i shall not boast of my service to you which still be inferior to my own wish or you expectation but however soldier have ever look for the reward of labor at the conclusion of a war and what the issue of it be likely to be not even you can doubt but why should i omit to mention my own diligence and good fortune and to what a happy crisis affair be now arrive be you sorry that i transport the army safe and entire without the loss of a single ship that on my arrival in the very first attack i route the enemy 's fleet that twice in two day i defeat the enemy 's horse that i carry out of the very harbor and bay two hundred of the enemy 's victualler and reduce they to that situation that they can receive no supplies either by land or sea will you divorce yourselve from this fortune and these general and prefer the disgrace of corfinium the defeat of italy the surrender of both spain and the prestige of the african war i for my part wish to be call a soldier of caesar 's you honor I with the title of imperator if you repent you bounty i give it back to you restore to I my former name that you may not appear to have confer the honor on I as a reproach xxxiii -- the soldier be affect by this oration frequently attempt to interrupt he whilst he be speak so that they appear to bear with excessive anguish the suspicion of treachery and when he be leave the assembly they unanimously beseech he to be of good spirit and not hesitate to engage the enemy and put they fidelity and courage to a trial as the wish and opinion of all be change by this act curio with the general consent determine whenever opportunity offer to hazard a battle the next day he lead out he force and range they in order of battle on the same ground where they have be post the precede day nor do attius varus hesitate to draw out he man that if any occasion should offer either to tamper with we man or to engage on equal term he might not miss the opportunity xxxiv-there lay between the two army a valley as already mention not very deep but of a difficult and steep ascent each be wait till the enemy 's force should to attempt to pass it that they might engage with the advantage of the ground at the same time on the left wing the entire cavalry of publius attius and several light-armed infantry intermix with they be perceive descend into the valley against they curio detach he cavalry and two cohort of the marrucinus whose first charge the enemy 's horse be unable to stand but set spur to they horse flee back to they friend : the light-infantry be desert by those who have come out along with they be surround and cut to piece by we man varus 's whole army face that way see they man flee and cut down upon which rebilus one of caesar 's lieutenant whom curio have bring with he from sicily know that he have great experience in military matter cry out you see the enemy be daunt curio why do you hesitate to take advantage of the opportunity curio have merely express this that the soldier should keep in mind the profession which they have make to he the day before then order they to follow he and run far before they all the valley be so difficult of ascent that the foremost man could not struggle up it unless assist by those behind but the mind of attius 's soldier be prepossess with fear and the flight and slaughter of they man never think of oppose we and they all imagine that they be already surround by we horse and therefore before a dart could be throw or we man come near they varus 's whole army turn they back and retreat to they camp xxxv-in this flight one fabius a pelignian and common soldier in curio 's army pursue the enemy 's rear with a loud voice shout to varus by he name and often call he so that he seem to be one of he soldier who wish to speak to he and give he advice when varus after be repeatedly call stop and look at he and inquire who he be and what he want he make a blow with he sword at he naked shoulder and be very near killing varus but he escape the danger by raise he shield to ward off the blow fabius be surround by the soldier near he and cut to piece and by the multitude and crowd of those that flee the gate of the camp be throng and the passage stop and a greater number perish in that place without a stroke than in the battle and flight nor be we far from drive they from this camp and some of they run straightway to the town without halt but both the nature of the ground and the strength of the fortification prevent we access to the camp for curio 's soldier march out to battle be without those thing which be requisite for storm a camp curio therefore lead he army back to the camp with all he troops safe except fabius of the enemy about six hundred be kill and a thousand wound all of whom after curio 's return and several more under pretext of they wound but in fact through fear withdraw from the camp into the town which varus perceive and know the terror of he army leave a trumpeter in he camp and a few tent for show at the third watch lead back he army quietly into the town xxxvi -- the next day curio resolve to besiege utica and to draw line about it in the town there be a multitude of people ignorant of war owe to the length of the peace some of they utican very well incline to caesar for he favor to they the roman population be compose of person differ widely in they sentiment the terror occasion by former battle be very great and therefore they openly talk of surrender and argue with attius that he should not suffer the fortune of they all to be ruin by he obstinacy whilst these thing be in agitation courier who have be send forward arrive from king juba with the intelligence that he be on he march with considerable force and encourage they to protect and defend they city a circumstance which greatly comfort they desponding heart xxxvii -- the same intelligence be bring to curio but for some time he could not give credit to it because he have so great confidence in he own good fortune and at this time caesar 's success in spain be announce in africa by message and letter be elate by all these thing he imagine that the king would not dare to attempt anything against he but when he find out from undoubted authority that he force be less than twenty mile distant from utica abandon he work he retire to the cornelian camp here he begin to lay in corn and wood and to fortify he camp and immediately despatch order to sicily that he two legion and the remainder of he cavalry should be send to he he camp be well adapt for protract a war from the nature and strength of the situation from its proximity to the sea and the abundance of water and salt of which a great quantity have be store up from the neighbouring salt-pits timber could not fail he from the number of tree nor corn with which the land abound wherefore with the general consent curio determine to wait for the rest of he force and protract the war xxxviii -- this plan be settle and he conduct approve of he be inform by some deserter from the town that juba have stay behind in he own kingdom be call home by a neighbouring war and a dispute with the people of lepti and that sabura he commander-in-chief who have be send with a small force be draw near to utica curio rashly believe this information alter he design and resolve to hazard a battle he youth he spirit he former good fortune and confidence of success contribute much to confirm this resolution induce by these motive early in the night he send all he cavalry to the enemy 's camp near the river bagrada of which sabura of whom we have already speak be the commander but the king be come after they with all he force and be post at a distance of six mile behind sabura the horse that be send perform they march that night and attack the enemy unaware and unexpectedly for the numidian after the usual barbarous custom encamp here and there without any regularity the cavalry have attack they when sink in sleep and disperse kill a great number of they many be frightened and run away after which the horse return to curio and bring some prisoner with they xxxix -- curio have set out at the fourth watch with all he force except five cohort which he leave to guard the camp have advance six mile he meet the horse hear what have happen and inquire from the captive who command the camp at bagrada they reply sabura through eagerness to perform he journey he neglect to make further inquiry but look back to the company next he do not you see soldier say he that the answer of the prisoner correspond with the account of the deserter that the king be not with he and that he send only a small force which be not able to withstand a few horse hasten then to spoil to glory that we may now begin to think of rewarding you and return you thanks the achievement of the horse be great in themselves especially if they small number be compare with the vast host of numidian however the account be enlarged by themselves as man be naturally incline to boast of they own merit besides many spoil be produce the man and horse that be take be bring into they sight that they might imagine that every moment of time which intervene be a delay to they conquest by this mean the hope of curio be second by the ardor of the soldier he order the horse to follow he and hasten he march that he might attack they as soon as possible while in consternation after they flight but the horse fatigue by the expedition of the precede night be not able to keep up with he but fall behind in different place even this do not abate curio 's hope xl -- juba be inform by sabura of the battle in the night send to he relief two thousand spanish and gallic horse which he be accustom to keep near he to guard he person and that part of he infantry on which he have the greatest dependence and he himself follow slowly after with the rest of he force and forty elephant suspect that as curio have send he horse before he himself would follow they sabura draw up he army both horse and foot and command they to give way gradually and retreat through the pretence of fear that when it be necessary he would give they the signal for battle and such order as he find circumstance require curio as he idea of they present behavior be calculate to confirm he former hope imagine that the enemy be run away and lead he army from the rise grounds down to the plain xli -- and when he have advance from this place about sixteen mile he army be exhaust with the fatigue he halt sabura give he man the signal marshal he army and begin to go around he rank and encourage they but he make use of the foot only for show and send the horse to the charge : curio be not deficient in skill and encourage he man to rest all they hope in they valor neither be the soldier though wearied nor the horse though few and exhaust with fatigue deficient in ardor to engage and courage : but the latter be in number but two hundred : the rest have drop behind on the march wherever they charge they force the enemy to give ground but they be not able to pursue they far when they flee or to press they horse too severely besides the enemy 's cavalry begin to surround we on both wing and to trample down we rear when any cohort run forward out of the line the numidian be fresh by they speed avoid we charge and surround ours when they attempt to return to they post and cut they off from the main body so that it do not appear safe either to keep they ground and maintain they rank or to issue from the line and run the risk the enemy 's troops be frequently reinforce by assistance send from juba strength begin to fail we man through fatigue and those who have be wound could neither quit the field nor retire to a place of safety because the whole field be surround by the enemy 's cavalry therefore despair of they own safety as man usually do in the last moment of they life they either lament they unhappy death or recommend they parent to the survivor if fortune should save any from the impending danger all be full of fear and grief xlii -- when curio perceive that in the general consternation neither he exhortation nor entreaty be attend to imagine that the only hope of escape in they deplorable situation be to gain the nearest hill he order the color to be bear that way but a party of horse that have be send by sabura have already get possession of they now indeed we man be reduce to extreme despair : and some of they be kill by the cavalry in attempt to escape : some fall to the ground unhurt cneius domitius commander of the cavalry standing round curio with a small party of horse urge curio to endeavor to escape by flight and to hasten to he camp and assure he that he would not forsake he but curio declare that he would never more appear in caesar 's sight after lose the army which have be commit by caesar to he charge and accordingly fight till he be kill very few of the horse escape from that battle but those who have stay behind to refresh they horse have perceive at a distance the defeat of the whole army retire in safety to they camp xliii -- the soldier be all kill to a man marcus rufus the quaestor who be leave behind in the camp by curio have get intelligence of these thing encourage he man not to be dishearten they beg and entreat to be transport to sicily he consent and order the master of the ship to have all the boat bring close to the shore early in the evening but so great be the terror in general that some say that juba 's force be march up other that varus be hasten with he legion and that they already see the dust raise by they come of which not one circumstance have happen : other suspect that the enemy 's fleet would immediately be upon they therefore in the general consternation every man consult he own safety those who be on board of the fleet be in a hurry to set sail and they flight hasten the master of the ship of burden a few small fishing boat attend they duty and he order but as the shore be crowd so great be the struggle to determine who of such a vast number should first get on board that some of the vessel sink with the weight of the multitude and the fear of the rest delay they from come to the shore xliv -- from which circumstance it happen that a few foot and aged man that could prevail either through interest or pity or who be able to swim to the ship be take on board and land safe in sicily the rest of the troops send they centurion as deputy to varus at night and surrender themselves to he but juba the next day have spy they cohort before the town claim they as he booty and order a great part of they to be put to the sword a few he select and send home to he own realm although varus complain that he honor be insult by juba yet he dare not oppose he : juba ride on horseback into the town attend by several senator amongst whom be servius sulpicius and licinius damasippus and in a few day arrange and order what he would have do in utica and in a few day more return to he own kingdom with all he force book iii i -- julius caesar hold the election as dictator be himself appoint consul with publius servilius for this be the year in which it be permit by the law that he should be choose consul this business be end as credit be begin to fail in italy and the debt could not be pay he determine that arbitrator should be appoint : and that they should make a estimate of the possession and property -lrb- of the debtor -rrb- how much they be worth before the war and that they should be hand over in payment to the creditor this he think the most likely method to remove and abate the apprehension of a abolition of debt the usual consequence of civil war and dissension and to support the credit of the debtor he likewise restore to they former condition -lrb- the praetor and tribune first submit the question to the people -rrb- some person condemn for bribery at the election by virtue of pompey 's law at the time when pompey keep he legion quarter in the city -lrb- these trial be finish in a single day one judge hear the merit and another pronounce the sentence -rrb- because they have offer they service to he in the beginning of the civil war if he choose to accept they set the same value on they as if he have accept they because they have put themselves in he power for he have determine that they ought to be restore rather by the judgment of the people than appear admit to it by he bounty : that he might neither appear ungrateful in repay a obligation nor arrogant in deprive the people of they prerogative of exercise this bounty ii -- in accomplish these thing and celebrate the latin festival and hold all the election he spend eleven day and have resign the dictatorship set out from the city and go to brundisium where he have order twelve legion and all he cavalry to meet he but he scarcely find as many ship as would be sufficient to transport fifteen thousand legionary soldier and five hundred horse this -lrb- the scarcity of shipping -rrb- be the only thing that prevent caesar from put a speedy conclusion to the war and even these troops embark very short of they number because several have fall in so many war in gaul and the long march from spain have lessen they number very much and a severe autumn in apulium and the district about brundisium after the very wholesome country of spain and gaul have impair the health of the whole army iii -- pompey have get a year 's respite to provide force during which he be not engage in war nor employ by a enemy have collect a numerous fleet from asia and the cyclade from corcyra athen pontus bithynium syrium cilicium phoenicium and egypt and have give direction that a great number should be build in every other place he have exact a large sum of money from asia syria and all the king dynast tetrarch and free state of achaium and have oblige the corporation of those province of which he himself have the government to count down to he a large sum iv -- he have make up nine legion of roman citizen five from italy which he have bring with he one veteran legion from sicily which be compose of two he call the gemellum one from crete and macedonium of veteran who have be discharge by they former general and have settle in those province two from asia which have be levy by the activity of lentulus besides he have distribute among he legion a considerable number by way of recruit from thessaly boeotium achaium and epirus : with he legion he also intermix the soldier take from caius antonius besides these he expect two legion from syrium with scipio from crete lacedaemon pontus syrium and other state he get about three thousand archer six cohort of slinger two thousand mercenary soldier and seven thousand horse six hundred of which deiotarus have bring from gaul ariobarzane five hundred from cappadocium cotus have give he about the same number from thrace and have send he son sadali with they from macedonium there be two hundred of extraordinary valor command by rascipoli five hundred gaul and german gabinius 's troops from alexandrium whom aulus gabinius have leave with king ptolemy to guard he person pompey the son have bring in he fleet eight hundred whom he have raise among he own and he shepherd ' slave tarcundarius castor and donilaus have give three hundred from gallograecium : one of these come himself the other send he son two hundred be send from syrium by comagenus antiochus whom pompey reward amply the most of they be archer to these be add dardanian and bessian some of they mercenary other procure by power and influence : also macedonian thessalian and troops from other nation and state which complete the number which we mention before v -- he have lay in vast quantity of corn from thessaly asia egypt crete cyrene and other country he have resolve to fix he winter quarter at dyrrachium apollonium and the other sea-port to hinder caesar from pass the sea : and for this purpose have station he fleet along the sea-coast the egyptian fleet be command by pompey the son : the asiatic by decimus laelius and caius triarius : the syrian by caius cassius : the rhodian by caius marcellus in conjunction with caius coponius and the liburnian and achaian by scribonius libo and marcus octavius but marcus bibulus be appoint commander-in-chief of the whole maritime department and regulate every matter the chief direction rest upon he vi -- when caesar come to brundisium he make a speech to the soldier : that since they be now almost arrive at the termination of they toil and danger they should patiently submit to leave they slave and baggage in italy and to embark without luggage that a greater number of man might be put on board : that they might expect everything from victory and he liberality they cry out with one voice he might give what order he please that they would cheerfully fulfil they he accordingly set sail the fourth day of January with seven legion on board as already remark the next day he reach land between the ceraunian rock and other dangerous place meet with a safe road for he shipping to ride in and dread all other port which he imagine be in possession of the enemy he land he man at a place call pharsalus without the loss of a single vessel vii -- lucretius vespillo and minutius rufus be at oricum with eighteen asiatic ship which be give into they charge by the order of decimus laelius : marcus bibulus at corcyra with a hundred and ten ship but they have not the confidence to dare to move out of the harbor though caesar have bring only twelve ship as a convoy only four of which have deck nor do bibulus he fleet be disorder and he seaman disperse come up in time : for caesar be see at the continent before any account whatsoever of he approach have reach those region viii -- caesar have land he soldier send back he ship the same night to brundisium to transport the rest of he legion and cavalry the charge of this business be commit to lieutenant fufius kalenus with order to be expeditious in transport the legion but the ship have put to sea too late and not have take advantage of the night breeze fall a sacrifice on they return for bibulus at corcyra be inform of caesar 's approach hope to fall in with some part of we ship with they cargo but find they empty and have take about thirty vent on they he rage at he own remissness and set they all on fire : and with the same flame he destroy the mariner and master of the vessel hope by the severity of the punishment to deter the rest have accomplish this affair he fill all the harbor and shore from salona to oricum with he fleet have dispose he guard with great care he lay on board himself in the depth of winter decline no fatigue or duty and not wait for reinforcement in hope that he might come within caesar 's reach ix -- but after the departure of the liburnian fleet marcus octavius sail from illyricum with what ship he have to salona and have spirit up the dalmatian and other barbarous nation he draw issa off from its connection with caesar but not be able to prevail with the council of salona either by promise or menace he resolve to storm the town but it be well fortify by its natural situation and a hill the roman citizen build wooden tower the better to secure it but when they be unable to resist on account of the smallness of they number be weaken by several wound they stoop to the last resource and set at liberty all the slave old enough to bear arm and cut the hair off the woman 's head make rope for they engine octavius be inform of they determination surround the town with five encampment and begin to press they at once with a siege and storm they be determine to endure every hardship and they greatest distress be the want of corn they therefore send deputy to caesar and beg a supply from he all other inconvenience they bear by they own resource as well as they could : and after a long interval when the length of the siege have make octavius 's troops more remiss than usual have get a opportunity at noon when the enemy be disperse they dispose they wife and child on the wall to keep up the appearance of they usual attention and form themselves into one body with the slave whom they have lately enfranchise they make a attack on octavius 's nearest camp and have force that attack the second with the same fury and then the third and the fourth and then the other and beat they from they all : and have kill a great number oblige the rest and octavius himself to fly for refuge to they ship this put a end to the blockade winter be now approach and octavius despairing of capture the town after sustain such considerable loss withdraw to pompey to dyrrachium x -- we have mention that vibullius rufus a officer of pompey 's have fall twice into caesar 's power first at corfinium and afterwards in spain caesar think he a proper person on account of he favor confer on he to send with proposal to pompey : and he know that he have a influence over pompey this be the substance of he proposal : that it be the duty of both to put a end to they obstinacy and forbear hostility and not tempt fortune any further that sufficient loss have be suffer on both side to serve as a lesson and instruction to they to render they apprehensive of future calamity by pompey in have be drive out of italy and have lose sicily sardinia and the two spain and one hundred and thirty cohort of roman citizen in italy and spain : by himself in the death of curio and the loss of so great a army in africa and the surrender of he soldier in corcyra wherefore they should have pity on themselves and the republic : for from they own misfortune they have sufficient experience of what fortune can effect in war that this be the only time to treat of peace when each have confidence in he own strength and both seem on a equal footing since if fortune show ever so little favor to either he who think himself superior would not submit to term of accommodation nor would he be content with a equal division when he might expect to obtain the whole that as they could not agree before the term of peace ought to be submit to the senate and people in rome that in the meantime it ought to content the republic and themselves if they both immediately take oath in a public assembly that they would disband they force within the three follow day that have divest themselves of the arm and auxiliary on which they place they present confidence they must both of necessity acquiesce in the decision of the people and senate to give pompey the fuller assurance of he intention he would dismiss all he force on land even he garrison xi -- vibullius have receive this commission from caesar think it no less necessary to give pompey notice of caesar 's sudden approach that he might adopt such plan as the circumstance require than to inform he of caesar 's message and therefore continue he journey by night as well as by day and take fresh horse for despatch he post away to pompey to inform he that caesar be march towards he with all he force pompey be at this time in candavium and be on he march from macedonium to he winter quarter in apollonium and dyrrachium but surprise at the unexpected news he determine to go to apollonium by speedy march to prevent caesar from become master of all the maritime state but as soon as caesar have land he troops he set off the same day for oricum : when he arrive there lucius torquatus who be governor of the town by pompey 's appointment and have a garrison of parthinian in it endeavor to shut the gate and defend the town and order the greek to man the wall and to take arm but as they refuse to fight against the power of the roman people and as the citizen make a spontaneous attempt to admit caesar despairing of any assistance he throw open the gate and surrender himself and the town to caesar and be preserve safe from injury by he xii -- have take oricum caesar march without make any delay to apollonium staberius the governor hearing of he approach begin to bring water into the citadel and to fortify it and to demand hostage of the town 's people but they refuse to give any or to shut they gate against the consul or to take upon they to judge contrary to what all italy and the roman people have judge as soon as he know they inclination he make he escape privately the inhabitant of apollonium send ambassador to caesar and give he admission into they town they example be follow by the inhabitant of bulli amantium and the other neighbouring state and all epirus : and they send ambassador to caesar and promise to obey he command xiii -- but pompey have receive information of the transaction at oricum and apollonium begin to be alarm for dyrrachium and endeavor to reach it march day and night as soon as it be say that caesar be approach such a panic fall upon pompey 's army because in he haste he have make no distinction between night and day and have march without intermission that they almost every man desert they color in epirus and the neighbouring country several throw down they arm and they march have the appearance of a flight but when pompey have halt near dyrrachium and have give order for measure out the ground for he camp he army even yet continue in they fright labienus first step forward and swear that he would never desert he and would share whatever fate fortune should assign to he the other lieutenant take the same oath and the tribune and centurion follow they example : and the whole army swear in like manner caesar find the road to dyrrachium already in the possession of pompey be in no great haste but encamp by the river apsus in the territory of apollonium that the state which have deserve he support might be certain of protection from he out-guard and fort and there he resolve to wait the arrival of he other legion from italy and to winter in tent pompey do the same and pitch he camp on the other side of the river apsus collect there all he troops and auxiliary xiv -- kalenus have put the legion and cavalry on board at brundisium as caesar have direct he as far as the number of he ship allow weigh anchor : and have sail a little distance from port receive a letter from caesar in which he be inform that all the port and the whole shore be occupy by the enemy 's fleet : on receive this information he return into the harbor and recall all the vessel one of they which continue the voyage and do not obey kalenus 's command because it carry no troops but be private property bear away for oricum and be take by bibulus who spare neither slave nor free man nor even child but put all to the sword thus the safety of the whole army depend on a very short space of time and a great casualty xv -- bibulus as have be observe before lay with he fleet near oricum and as he debar caesar of the liberty of the sea and harbor so he be deprive of all intercourse with the country by land for the whole shore be occupy by party dispose in different place by caesar and he be not allow to get either wood or water or even anchor near the land he be reduce to great difficulty and distressed with extreme scarcity of every necessary insomuch that he be oblige to bring in transport from corcyra not only provision but even wood and water and it once happen that meeting with violent storm they be force to catch the dew by night which fall on the hide that cover they deck yet all these difficulty they bear patiently and without repine and think they ought not to leave the shore and harbor free from blockade but when they be suffer under the distress which i have mention and libo have join bibulus they both call from on ship-board to marcus acilius and statius marcus the lieutenant one of whom command the town the other the guard on the coast that they wish to speak to caesar on affair of importance if permission should be grant they they add something further to strengthen the impression that they intend to treat about a accommodation in the meantime they request a truce and obtain it from they for what they propose seem to be of importance and it be well know that caesar desire it above all thing and it be imagine that some advantage would be derive from bibulus 's proposal xvi -- caesar have set out with one legion to gain possession of the more remote state and to provide corn of which he have but a small quantity be at this time at buthrotum opposite to corcyra there receive acilius and marcus 's letter inform he of libo 's and bibulus 's demand he leave he legion behind he and return himself to oricum when he arrive they be invite to a conference libo come and make a apology for bibulus that he be a man of strong passion and have a private quarrel against caesar contract when he be aedile and praetor that for this reason he have avoid the conference lest affair of the utmost importance and advantage might be impede by the warmth of he temper that it now be and ever have be pompey 's most earnest wish that they should be reconcile and lay down they arm but they be not authorize to treat on that subject because they resign the whole management of the war and all other matter to pompey by order of the council but when they be acquaint with caesar 's demand they would transmit they to pompey who would conclude all of himself by they persuasion in the meantime let the truce be continue till the messenger could return from he and let no injury be do on either side to this he add a few word of the cause for which they fight and of he own force and resource xvii -- to this caesar do not then think proper to make any reply nor do we now think it worth recording but caesar require that he should be allow to send commissioner to pompey who should suffer no personal injury and that either they should grant it or should take he commissioner in charge and convey they to pompey that as to the truce the war in its present state be so divide that they by they fleet deprive he of he shipping and auxiliary while he prevent they from the use of the land and fresh water and if they wish that this restraint should be remove from they they should relinquish they blockade of the sea but if they retain the one he in like manner would retain the other that nevertheless the treaty of accommodation might still be carry on though these point be not concede and that they need not be a impediment to it they would neither receive caesar 's commissioner nor guarantee they safety but refer the whole to pompey they urge and struggle eagerly to gain the one point respect a truce but when caesar perceive that they have propose the conference merely to avoid present danger and distress but that they offer no hope or term of peace he apply he thought to the prosecution of the war xviii -- bibulus be prevent from landing for several day and be seize with a violent distemper from the cold and fatigue as he could neither be cure on board nor be willing to desert the charge which he have take upon he be unable to bear up against the violence of the disease on he death the sole command devolve on no single individual but each admiral manage he own division separately and at he own discretion vibullius as soon as the alarm which caesar 's unexpected arrival have raise be over begin again to deliver caesar 's message in the presence of libo lucius lucceius and theophane to whom pompey use to communicate he most confidential secret he have scarcely enter on the subject when pompey interrupt he and forbid he to proceed what need say he have i of life or rome if the world shall think i enjoy they by the bounty of caesar a opinion which can never be remove whilst it shall be think that i have be bring back by he to italy from which i set out after the conclusion of the war caesar be inform of these expression by some person who be present at the conversation he attempt however by other means to bring about a negotiation of peace xix -- between pompey 's and caesar 's camp there be only the river apsus and the soldier frequently converse with each other and by a private arrangement among themselves no weapon be throw during they conference caesar send publius vatinius one of he lieutenant to the bank of the river to make such proposal as should appear most conducive to peace and to cry out frequently with a loud voice -lrb- asking -rrb- be citizen permit to send deputy to citizen to treat of peace a concession which have be make even to fugitive on the pyrenean mountain and to robber especially when by so do they would prevent citizen from fight against citizen have speak much in humble language as become a man plead for he own and the general safety and be listen to with silence by the soldier of both army he receive a answer from the enemy 's party that aulus varro propose come the next day to a conference and that deputy from both side might come without danger and explain they wish and accordingly a fixed time be appoint for the interview when the deputy meet the next day a great multitude from both side assemble and the expectation of every person concern this subject be raise very high and they mind seem to be eagerly dispose for peace titus labienus walk forward from the crowd and in submissive term begin to speak of peace and to argue with vatinius but they conversation be suddenly interrupt by dart throw from all side from which vatinius escape by be protect by the arm of the soldier however several be wound and among they cornelius balbus marcus plotius and lucius tiburtius centurion and some private hereupon labienus exclaimed forbear then to speak any more about a accommodation for we can have no peace unless we carry caesar 's head back with we xx -- at the same time in rome marcus caelius rufus one of the praetor have undertake the cause of the debtor on enter into he office fix he tribunal near the bench of caius trebonius the city praetor and promise if any person appeal to he in regard to the valuation and payment of debt make by arbitration as appoint by caesar when in rome that he would relieve they but it happen from the justice of trebonius 's decree and he humanity -lrb- for he think that in such dangerous time justice should be administer with moderation and compassion -rrb- that not one could be find who would offer himself the first to lodge a appeal for to plead poverty to complain of he own private calamity or the general distress of the time or to assert the difficulty of set the goods to sale be the behavior of a man even of a moderate temper but to retain they possession entire and at the same time acknowledge themselves in debt what sort of spirit and what impudence would it not have argue therefore nobody be find so unreasonable as to make such demand but caelius prove more severe to those very person for whose advantage it have be design and start from this beginning in order that he might not appear to have engage in so dishonourable a affair without effect something he promulgate a law that all debt should be discharge in six equal payment of six month each without interest xxi -- when servilius the consul and the other magistrate oppose he and he himself effect less than he expect in order to raise the passion of the people he drop it and promulgate two other one by which he remit the annual rent of the house to the tenant the other a act of insolvency : upon which the mob make a assault on caius trebonius and have wound several person drive he from he tribunal the consul servilius inform the senate of he proceedings who pass a decree that caelius should be remove from the management of the republic upon this decree the consul forbid he the senate and when he be attempt to harangue the people turn he out of the rostrum sting with the ignominy and with resentment he pretend in public that he would go to caesar but privately send messenger to milo who have murder clodius and have be condemn for it and have invite he into italy because he have engage the remains of the gladiator to he interest by make they supple present he join he and send he to thurinum to tamper with the shepherd when he himself be on he road to casilinum at the same time that he military standard and arm be seize at capua he slave see at naple and the design of betray the town discover : he plot be reveal and capua shut against he be apprehensive of danger because the roman citizen reside there have arm themselves and think he ought to be treat as a enemy to the state he abandon he first design and change he route xxii -- milo in the meantime despatch letter to the free town purport that he act as he do by the order and command of pompey convey to he by bibulus : and he endeavor to engage in he interest all person whom he imagine be under difficulty by reason of they debt but not be able to prevail with they he set at liberty some slave from the work-house and begin to assault cosa in the district of thurinum there have receive a blow of a stone throw from the wall of the town which be command by quintus pedius with one legion he die of it and caelius have set out as he pretend for caesar go to thurii where he be put to death as he be tamper with some of the freeman of the town and be offer money to caesar 's gallic and spanish horse which he have send there to strengthen the garrison and thus these mighty beginning which have embroil italy and keep the magistrate employ find a speedy and happy issue xxiii -- libo have sail from oricum with a fleet of fifty ship which he command come to brundisium and seize a island which lie opposite to the harbor judge it better to guard that place which be we only pass to sea than to keep all the shore and port block up by a fleet by he sudden arrival he fall in with some of we transport and set they on fire and carry off one laden with corn he strike great terror into we man and have in the night land a party of soldier and archer he beat we guard of horse from they station and gain so much by the advantage of situation that he despatch letter to pompey that if he please he might order the rest of the ship to be haul upon shore and repair for that with he own fleet he could prevent caesar from receive he auxiliary xxiv -- antonius be at this time at brundisium and rely on the valor of he troops cover about sixty of the long-boat belong to the men-of-war with penthouse and bulwark of hurdle and put on board they select soldier and dispose they separately along the shore : and under the pretext of keep the seaman in exercise he order two three-banked galley which he have build at brundisium to row to the mouth of the port when libo see they advance boldly towards he he send five four-banked galley against they in hope of intercept they when these come near we ship we veteran soldier retreat within the harbor the enemy urge by they eagerness to capture they pursue they unguardedly for instantly the boat of antonius on a certain signal row with great violence from all part against the enemy and at the first charge take one of the four-banked galley with the seaman and marine and force the rest to flee disgracefully in addition to this loss they be prevent from get water by the horse which antonius have dispose along the sea-coast libo vex at the distress and disgrace depart from brundisium and abandon the blockade xxv -- several month have now elapse and winter be almost go and caesar 's legion and shipping be not come to he from brundisium and he imagine that some opportunity have be neglect for the wind have at least be often favourable and he think that he must trust to they at last and the longer it be defer the more eager be those who command pompey 's fleet to guard the coast and be more confident of prevent we get assistance : they receive frequent reproof from pompey by letter that as they have not prevent caesar 's arrival at the first they should at least stop the remainder of he army : and they be expect that the season for transport troops would become more unfavourable every day as the wind grow calmer caesar feeling some trouble on this account write in severe term to he officer at brundisium -lrb- and give they order -rrb- that as soon as they find the wind to answer they should not let the opportunity of set sail pass by if they be even to steer they course to the shore of apollonium : because there they might run they ship on ground that these part principally be leave unguarded by the enemy 's fleet because they dare not venture too far from the harbor xxvi -- they -lrb- he officer -rrb- exert boldness and courage aid by the instruction of marcus antonius and fufius kalenus and animated by the soldier strongly encourage they and decline no danger for caesar 's safety have get a southerly wind weigh anchor and the next day be carry past apollonium and dyrrachium and be see from the continent quintus coponius who command the rhodian fleet at dyrrachium put out of the port with he ship and when they have almost come up with we in consequence of the breeze die away the south wind spring up afresh and rescue we however he do not desist from he attempt but hope by the labor and perseverance of he seaman to be able to bear up against the violence of the storm and although we be carry beyond dyrrachium by the violence of the wind he nevertheless continue to chase we we man take advantage of fortune 's kindness for they be still afraid of be attack by the enemy 's fleet if the wind abate have come near a port call nymphaeum about three mile beyond lissus put into it -lrb- this port be protect from a south-west wind but be not secure against a south wind -rrb- and think less danger be to be apprehend from the storm than from the enemy but as soon as they be within the port the south wind which have blow for two day by extraordinary good luck veer round to the south-west xxvii -- here one might observe the sudden turn of fortune we who a moment before be alarm for ourselves be safely lodge in a very secure harbor : and they who have threaten ruin to we fleet be force to be uneasy on they own account : and thus by a change of circumstance the storm protect we ship and damage the rhodian fleet to such a degree that all they deck ship sixteen in number founder without exception and be wreck : and of the prodigious number of seaman and soldier some lose they life by be dash against the rock other be take by we man : but caesar send they all safe home xxviii -- two of we ship that have not keep up with the rest be overtake by the night and not know what port the rest have make to come to a anchor opposite lissus otacilius crassus who command pompey 's fleet detach after they several barge and small craft and attempt to take they at the same time he treat with they about capitulate and promise they they life if they would surrender one of they carry two hundred and twenty recruit the other be man with somewhat less than two hundred veteran here it might be see what security man derive from a resolute spirit for the recruit frighten at the number of vessel and fatigue with the rolling of the sea and with sea-sickness surrender to otacilius after have first receive he oath that the enemy would not injure they but as soon as they be bring before he contrary to the obligation of he oath they be inhumanly put to death in he presence but the soldier of the veteran legion who have also struggle not only with the inclemency of the weather but by labor at the pump think it they duty to remit nothing of they former valor : and have protracted the beginning of the night in settle the term under pretence of surrender they oblige the pilot to run the ship aground : and have get a convenient place on the shore they spend the rest of the night there and at daybreak when otacilius have send against they a party of the horse who guard that part of the coast to the number of four hundred besides some armed man who have follow they from the garrison they make a brave defense and have kill some of they retreat in safety to we army xxix -- after this action the roman citizen who reside at lissus a town which caesar have before assign they and have carefully fortify receive antony into they town and give he every assistance otacilius apprehensive for he own safety escape out of the town and go to pompey all he force whose number amount to three veteran legion and one of recruit and about eight hundred horse be land antony send most of he ship back to italy to transport the remainder of the soldier and horse the ponton which be a sort of gallic ship he leave at lissus with this object that if pompey imagine italy defenceless should transport he army thither -lrb- and this notion be spread among the common people -rrb- caesar might have some means of pursue he and he send messenger to he with great despatch to inform he in what part of the country he have land he army and what number of troops he have bring over with he xxx -- caesar and pompey receive this intelligence almost at the same time for they have see the ship sail past apollonium and dyrrachium they direct they march after they by land but at first they be ignorant to what part they have be carry but when they be inform of it they each adopt a different plan caesar to form a junction with antonius as soon as possible pompey to oppose antonius 's force on they march to caesar and if possible to fall upon they unexpectedly from ambush and the same day they both lead out they army from they winter encampment along the river apsus pompey privately by night caesar openly by day but caesar have to march a longer circuit up the river to find a ford pompey 's route be easy because he be not oblige to cross the river he advance rapidly and by force march against antonius and be inform of he approach choose a convenient situation where he post he force and keep he man close within camp and forbid fire to be kindle that he arrival might be the more secret a account of this be immediately carry to antonius by the greek he despatch messenger to caesar and confine himself in he camp for one day the next day caesar come up with he on learn he arrival pompey to prevent he be hem in between two army quit he position and go with all he force to asparagium in the territory of dyrrachium and there encamp in a convenient situation xxxi -- during these time scipio though he have sustain some loss near mount amanus have assume to himself the title of imperator after which he demand large sum of money from the state and prince he have also exact from the tax-gatherer two year ' rent that they owe and enjoin they to lend he the amount of the next year and demand a supply of horse from the whole province when they be collect leave behind he he neighbouring enemy the parthian -lrb- who shortly before have kill marcus crassus the imperator and have keep marcus bibulus besiege -rrb- he draw he legion and cavalry out of syrium and when he come into the province which be under great anxiety and fear of the parthian war and hear some declaration of the soldier that they would march against a enemy if he would lead they on but would never bear arm against a countryman and consul he draw off he legion to winter quarter to pergamus and the most wealthy city and make they rich present : and in order to attach they more firmly to he interest permit they to plunder the city xxxii -- in the meantime the money which have be demand from the province at large be most rigorously exact besides many new impost of different kind be devise to gratify he avarice a tax of so much a head be lay on every slave and child column door corn soldier sailor arm engine and carriage be make subject to a duty wherever a name could be find for anything it be deem a sufficient reason for levy money on it officer be appoint to collect it not only in the city but in almost every village and fort : and whosoever of they act with the greatest rigor and inhumanity be esteem the best man and best citizen the province be overrun with bailiff and officer and crowd with overseer and tax-gatherer who besides the duty impose exact a gratuity for themselves for they assert that be expel from they own home and country they stand in need of every necessary endeavoring by a plausible pretence to color the most infamous conduct to this be add the most exorbitant interest as usually happen in time of war the whole sum be call in on which occasion they allege that the delay of a single day be a donation therefore in those two year the debt of the province be double : but notwithstanding tax be exact not only from the roman citizen but from every corporation and every state and they say that these be loan exact by the senate 's decree the tax of the ensue year be demand beforehand as a loan from the collector as on they first appointment xxxiii -- moreover scipio order the money formerly lodge in the temple of diana at ephesus to be take out with the statue of that goddess which remain there when scipio come to the temple letter be deliver to he from pompey in the presence of several senator whom he have call upon to attend he -lrb- inform he -rrb- that caesar have cross the sea with he legion that scipio should hasten to he with he army and postpone all other business as soon as he receive the letter he dismiss he attendant and begin to prepare for he journey to macedonium and a few day after set out this circumstance save the money at ephesus xxxiv -- caesar have effect a junction with antonius 's army and have draw he legion out of oricum which he have leave there to guard the coast think he ought to sound the inclination of the province and march farther into the country and when ambassador come to he from thessaly and aetolium to engage that the state in those country would obey he order if he send a garrison to protect they he despatch lucius cassius longinus with the twenty-seventh a legion compose of young soldier and two hundred horse to thessaly : and caius calvisius sabinus with five cohort and a small party of horse into aetolium he recommend they to be especially careful to provide corn because those region be nearest to he he order cneius domitius calvinus to march into macedonium with two legion the eleventh and twelfth and five hundred horse from which province menedemus the principal man of those region on that side which be call the free have come as ambassador assure he of the most devoted affection of all he subject xxxv -- of these calvisius on he first arrival in aetolium be very kindly receive dislodge the enemy 's garrison in calydon and naupactus and make himself master of the whole country cassius go to thessaly with he legion as there be two faction there he find the citizen divide in they inclination hegasaretus a man of established power favor pompey 's interest petreius a young man of a most noble family warmly support caesar with he own and he friend ' influence xxxvi -- at the same time domitius arrive in macedonium : and when numerous embassy have begin to wait on he from many of the state news be bring that scipio be approach with he legion which occasion various opinion and report for in strange event rumor generally go before without make any delay in any part of macedonium he march with great haste against domitius and when he be come within about twenty mile of he wheel on a sudden towards cassius longinus in thessaly he effect this with such celerity that news of he march and arrival come together for to render he march expeditious he leave the baggage of he legion behind he at the river haliacmon which divide macedonium from thessaly under the care of marcus favonius with a guard of eight cohort and order he to build a strong fort there at the same time cotus 's cavalry which use to infest the neighborhood of macedonium fly to attack cassius 's camp at which cassius be alarm and have receive information of scipio 's approach and see the horse which he imagine to be scipio 's he betake himself to the mountain that environ thessaly and thence begin to make he route towards ambracium but when scipio be hasten to pursue he despatch overtake he from favonius that domitius be march against he with he legion and that he could not maintain the garrison over which he be appoint without scipio 's assistance on receipt of these despatch scipio change he design and he route desist from he pursuit of cassius and hasten to relieve favonius accordingly continue he march day and night he come to he so opportunely that the dust raise by domitius 's army and scipio 's advanced guard be observe at the same instant thus the vigilance of domitius save cassius and the expedition of scipio favonius xxxvii -- scipio have stay for two day in he camp along the river haliacmon which run between he and domitius 's camp on the third day at dawn lead he army across a ford and have make a regular encampment the day follow draw up he force in front of he camp domitius think he ought not to show any reluctance but should draw out he force and hazard a battle but as there be a plain six mile in breadth between the two camp he post he army before scipio 's camp while the latter persevere in not quit he entrenchment however domitius with difficulty restrain he man and prevent they begin a battle the more so as a rivulet with steep bank join scipio 's camp retard the progress of we man when scipio perceive the eagerness and alacrity of we troops to engage suspect that he should be oblige the next day either to fight against he inclination or to incur great disgrace by keep within he camp though he have come with high expectation yet by advance rashly make a shameful end and at night cross the river without even give the signal for break up the camp and return to the ground from which he come and there encamp near the river on a elevated situation after a few day he place a party of horse in ambush in the night where we man have usually go to forage for several day before and when quintus varus commander of domitius 's horse come there as usual they suddenly rush from they ambush but we man bravely support they charge and return quickly every man to he own rank and in they turn make a general charge on the enemy : and have kill about eighty of they and put the rest to flight retreat to they camp with the loss of only two man xxxviii -- after these transaction domitius hope to allure scipio to a battle pretend to be oblige to change he position through want of corn and have give the signal for decamp advanced about three mile and post he army and cavalry in a convenient place conceal from the enemy 's view scipio be in readiness to pursue he detach he cavalry and a considerable number of light infantry to explore domitius 's route when they have march a short way and they foremost troops be within reach of we ambush they suspicion be raise by the neighing of the horse they begin to retreat : and the rest who follow they observe with what speed they retreat make a halt we man perceive that the enemy have discover they plot and think it in vain to wait for any more have get two troops in they power intercept they among they be marcus opimius general of the horse but he make he escape : they either kill or take prisoner all the rest of these two troops and bring they to domitius xxxix -- caesar have draw he garrison out of the sea-port as before mention leave three cohort at oricum to protect the town and commit to they the charge of he ship of war which he have transport from italy acilius as lieutenant-general have the charge of this duty and the command of the town he draw the ship into the inner part of the harbor behind the town and fasten they to the shore and sink a merchant-ship in the mouth of the harbor to block it up and near it he fix another at anchor on which he raise a turret and face it to the entrance of the port and fill it with soldier and order they to keep guard against any sudden attack xl -- cneius pompey 's son who command the egyptian fleet have get intelligence of these thing come to oricum and weigh up the ship that have be sink with a windlass and by strain at it with several rope and attack the other which have be place by acilius to watch the port with several ship on which he have raise very high turret so that fight as it be from a eminence and send fresh man constantly to relieve the fatigued and at the same time attempt the town on all side by land with ladder and he fleet in order to divide the force of he enemy he overpower we man by fatigue and the immense number of dart and take the ship have beat off the man who be put on board to defend it who however make they escape in small boat and at the same time he seize a natural mole on the opposite side which almost form a island over against the town he carry over land into the inner part of the harbor four galley by put roller under they and drive they on with lever then attack on both side the ship of war which be moor to the shore and be not man he carry off four of they and set the rest on fire after despatch this business he leave decimus laelius whom he have take away from the command of the asiatic fleet to hinder provision from be bring into the town from bibli and amantium and go himself to lissus where he attack thirty merchantman leave within the port by antonius and set they on fire he attempt to storm lissus but be delay three day by the vigorous defense of the roman citizen who belong to that district and of the soldier which caesar have send to keep garrison there and have lose a few man in the assault he return without effect he object xli -- as soon as caesar hear that pompey be at asparagium he set out for that place with he army and have take the capital of the parthinian on he march where there be a garrison of pompey 's he reach pompey in macedonium on the third day and encamp beside he and the day follow have draw out all he force before he camp he offer pompey battle but perceive that he keep within he trench he lead he army back to he camp and thought of pursue some other plan accordingly the day follow he set out with all he force by a long circuit through a difficult and narrow road to dyrrachium hope either that pompey would be compel to follow he to dyrrachium or that he communication with it might be cut off because he have deposit there all he provision and mat -lrb- ` e -rrb- riel of war and so it happen for pompey at first not know he design because he imagine he have take a route in a different direction from that country think that the scarcity of provision have oblige he to shift he quarter but have afterwards get true intelligence from he scout he decamp the day follow hope to prevent he by take a shorter road which caesar suspect might happen encourage he troops to submit cheerfully to the fatigue and have halt a very small part of the night he arrive early in the morning at dyrrachium when the van of pompey 's army be visible at a distance and there he encamp xlii -- pompey be cut off from dyrrachium as he be unable to effect he purpose take a new resolution and entrenched himself strongly on a rise ground which be call petra where ship of a small size can come in and be sheltered from some wind here he order a part of he men-of-war to attend he and corn and provision to be bring from asia and from all the country of which he keep possession caesar imagine that the war would be protracted to too great a length and despairing of he convoy from italy because all the coast be guard with great diligence by pompey 's adherent and because he own fleet which he have build during the winter in sicily gaul and italy be detain send lucius canuleius into epirus to procure corn and because these country be too remote he fix granary in certain place and regulate the carriage of the corn for the neighbouring state he likewise give direction that search should be make for whatever corn be in lissus the country of the parthinus and all the place of strength the quantity be very small both from the nature of the land -lrb- for the country be rough and mountainous and the people commonly import what grain they use -rrb- and because pompey have foresee what would happen and some day before have plunder the parthinus and have ravage and dig up they house carry off all the corn which he collect by means of he horse xliii -- caesar on be inform of these transaction pursue measure suggest by the nature of the country for round pompey 's camp there be several high and rough hill these he first of all occupy with guard and raise strong fort on they then draw a fortification from one fort to another as the nature of each position allow he begin to draw a line of circumvallation round pompey with these view as he have but a small quantity of corn and pompey be strong in cavalry that he might furnish he army with corn and other necessaries from all side with less danger : secondly to prevent pompey from forage and thereby render he horse ineffectual in the operation of the war and thirdly to lessen he reputation on which he see he depend greatly among foreign nation when a report should have spread throughout the world that he be blockade by caesar and dare not hazard a battle xliv -- neither be pompey willing to leave the sea and dyrrachium because he have lodge he mat -lrb- ` e -rrb- riel there he weapon arm and engine and supply he army with corn from it by he ship : nor be he able to put a stop to caesar 's work without hazard a battle which at that time he have determine not to do nothing be leave but to adopt the last resource namely to possess himself of as many hill as he could and cover as great a extent of country as possible with he troops and divide caesar 's force as much as possible and so it happen : for have raise twenty-four fort and take in a compass of fifteen mile he get forage in this space and within this circuit there be several field lately sow in which the cattle might feed in the meantime and as we man who have complete they work by draw line of communication from one fort to another be afraid that pompey 's man would sally out from some part and attack we in the rear so the enemy be make a continued fortification in a circuit within ours to prevent we from break in on any side or surround they on the rear but they complete they work first both because they have a greater number of man and because they have a smaller compass to enclose when caesar attempt to gain any place though pompey have resolve not to oppose he with he whole force or to come to a general engagement yet he detach to particular place slinger and archer with which he army abound and several of we man be wound and fill with great dread of the arrow and almost all the soldier make coat or covering for themselves of hair cloth tarpaulin or raw hide to defend they against the weapon xlv -- in seize the post each exert he utmost power : caesar to confine pompey within as narrow a compass as possible pompey to occupy as many hill as he could in as large a circuit as possible and several skirmish be fight in consequence of it in one of these when caesar 's ninth legion have gain a certain post and have begin to fortify it pompey possess himself of a hill near to and opposite the same place and endeavor to annoy the man while at work and as the approach on one side be almost level he first surround it with archer and slinger and afterwards by detach a strong party of light infantry and use he engine he stop we work : and it be no easy matter for we man at once to defend themselves and to proceed with they fortification when caesar perceive that he troops be wound from all side he determine to retreat and give up the post he retreat be down a precipice on which account they push on with more spirit and would not allow we to retire because they imagine that we resign the place through fear it be report that pompey say that day in triumph to he friend about he that he would consent to be account a general of no experience if caesar 's legion effect a retreat without considerable loss from that ground into which they have rashly advanced xlvi -- caesar be uneasy about the retreat of he soldier order hurdle to be carry to the further side of the hill and to be place opposite to the enemy and behind they a trench of a moderate breadth to be sink by he soldier under shelter of the hurdle : and the ground to be make as difficult as possible he himself disposed slinger in convenient place to cover we man in they retreat these thing be complete he order he legion to file off pompey 's man insultingly and boldly pursued and chase we level the hurdle that be throw up in the front of we work in order to pass over the trench which as soon as caesar perceive be afraid that he man would appear not to retreat but to be repulse and that greater loss might be sustain when he man be almost half way down the hill he encourage they by antonius who command that legion order the signal of battle to be sound and a charge to be make on the enemy the soldier of the ninth legion suddenly close they file throw they javelin and advance impetuously from the low ground up the steep drive pompey 's man precipitately before they and oblige they to turn they back but they retreat be greatly impede by the hurdle that lay in a long line before they and the pallisado which be in they way and the trench that be sink but we man be contented to retreat without injury have kill several of the enemy and lose but five of they own very quietly retire and have seize some other hill somewhat on this side of that place complete they fortification xlvii -- this method of conduct a war be new and unusual as well on account of the number of fort the extent and greatness of the work and the manner of attack and defense as on account of other circumstance for all who have attempt to besiege any person have attack the enemy when they be frightened or weak or after a defeat or have be keep in fear of some attack when they themselves have have a superior force both of foot and horse besides the usual design of a siege be to cut off the enemy 's supplies on the contrary caesar with a inferior force be enclose troops sound and unhurt and who have abundance of all thing for there arrive every day a prodigious number of ship which bring they provision : nor could the wind blow from any point that would not be favourable to some of they whereas caesar have consume all the corn far and near be in very great distress but he soldier bear all with uncommon patience for they remember that they lay under the same difficulty last year in spain and yet by labor and patience have conclude a dangerous war they recollect too that they have suffer a alarming scarcity at alesium and a much greater at avaricum and yet have return victorious over mighty nation they refuse neither barley nor pulse when offer they and they hold in great esteem cattle of which they get great quantity from epirus xlviii -- there be a sort of root call chara discover by the troops which serve under valerius this they mix up with milk and it greatly contribute to relieve they want they make it into a sort of bread they have great plenty of it : loaf make of this when pompey 's man upbraid ours with want they frequently throw among they to damp they hope xlix -- the corn be now begin to ripen and they hope support they want as they be confident of have abundance in a short time and there be frequently hear declaration of the soldier on guard in discourse with each other that they would rather live on the bark of the tree than let pompey escape from they hand for they be often tell by deserter that they could scarcely maintain they horse and that they other cattle be dead : that they themselves be not in good health from they confinement within so narrow a compass from the noisome smell the number of carcass and the constant fatigue to they be man unaccustomed to work and labor under a great want of water for caesar have either turn the course of all the river and stream which run to the sea or have dam they up with strong work and as the country be mountainous and the valley narrow at the bottom he enclose they with pile sink in the ground and heap up mould against they to keep in the water they be therefore oblige to search for low and marshy grounds and to sink well and they have this labor in addition to they daily work and even these spring be at a considerable distance from some of they post and soon dry up with the heat but caesar 's army enjoy perfect health and abundance of water and have plenty of all sort of provision except corn and they have a prospect of better time approach and see greater hope lay before they by the ripening of the grain l -- in this new kind of war new method of manage it be invent by both general pompey 's man perceive by we fire at night at what part of the work we cohort be on guard come silently upon they discharge they arrow at random among the whole multitude and instantly retire to they camp : as a remedy against which we man be teach by experience to light they fire in one place and keep guard in another \* \* \* \* \* li -- in the meantime publius syllum whom caesar at he departure have leave governor of he camp come up with two legion to assist the cohort upon whose arrival pompey 's force be easily repulse nor do they stand the sight and charge of we man and the foremost fall the rest turn they back and quit the field but syllum call we man in from the pursuit lest they ardor should carry they too far but most people imagine that if he have consent to a vigorous pursuit the war might have be end that day he conduct however do not appear to deserve censure for the duty of a lieutenant-general and of a commander-in-chief be very different the one be bind to act entirely accord to he instruction the other to regulate he conduct without control as occasion require syllum be depute by caesar to take care of the camp and have rescue he man be satisfy with that and do not desire to hazard a battle -lrb- although this circumstance might probably have have a successful issue -rrb- that he might not be think to have assume the part of the general one circumstance lay the pompeian under great difficulty in make good a retreat : for they have advance from disadvantageous ground and be post on the top of a hill if they attempt to retire down the steep they dread the pursuit of we man from the rise ground and there be but a short time till sunset : for in hope of complete the business they have protracted the battle almost till night take therefore measure suit to they exigency and to the shortness of the time pompey possess himself of a eminence at such a distance from we fort that no weapon discharge from a engine could reach he here he take up a position and fortify it and keep all he force there lii -- at the same time there be engagement in two other place for pompey have attack several fort at once in order to divide we force that no relief might be send from the neighbouring post in one place volcatius tullus sustain the charge of a legion with three cohort and beat they off the field in another the german have sally over we fortification slew several of the enemy and retreat safe to we camp liii -- thus six engagement have happen in one day three at dyrrachium and three at the fortification when a computation be make of the number of slay we find that about two thousand fall on pompey 's side several of they volunteer veteran and centurion among they be valerius the son of lucius flaccus who as praetor have formerly have the government of asia and six military standard be take of we man not more than twenty be miss in all the action but in the fort not a single soldier escape without a wound and in one cohort four centurion lose they eye and be desirous to produce testimony of the fatigue they undergo and the danger they sustain they count to caesar about thirty thousand arrow which have be throw into the fort and in the shield of the centurion scaeva which be bring to he be find two hundred and thirty hole in reward for this man 's service both to himself and the republic caesar present to he two hundred thousand piece of copper money and declare he promote from the eighth to the first centurion for it appear that the fort have be in a great measure save by he exertion and he afterwards very amply reward the cohort with double pay corn clothing and other military honor liv -- pompey have make great addition to he work in the night the follow day build turret and have carry he work fifteen foot high face that part of he camp with mantlet and after a interval of five day take advantage of a second cloudy night he barricade all the gate of he camp to hinder a pursuit and about midnight quietly march off he army and retreat to he old fortification lv -- aetolium acarnanium and amphilochi be reduce as we have relate by cassius longinus and calvisius sabinus caesar think he ought to attempt the conquest of achaium and to advance farther into the country accordingly he detach fufius thither and order quintus sabinus and cassius to join he with they cohort upon notice of they approach rutilius lupus who command in achaium under pompey begin to fortify the isthmus to prevent fufius from come into achaium kalenus recover delphus thebe and orchomenus by a voluntary submission of those state some he subdue by force the rest he endeavor to win over to caesar 's interest by send deputy round to they in these thing principally fufius be employ lvi -- every day afterwards caesar draw up he army on a level ground and offer pompey battle and lead he legion almost close to pompey 's camp and he front line be at no greater distance from the rampart than that no weapon from they engine could reach it but pompey to save he credit and reputation with the world draw out he legion but so close to he camp that he rear line might touch the rampart and that he whole army when draw up might be protect by the dart discharge from it lvii -- whilst these thing be go forward in achaium and at dyrrachium and when it be certainly know that scipio be arrive in macedonium caesar never lose sight of he first intention send clodius to he a intimate friend to both whom caesar on the introduction and recommendation of pompey have admit into the number of he acquaintance to this man he give letter and instruction to pompey the substance of which be as follow : that he have make every effort towards peace and imputed the ill success of those effort to the fault of those whom he have employ to conduct those negotiation : because they be afraid to carry he proposal to pompey at a improper time that scipio have such authority that he could not only freely explain what conduct meet he approbation but even in some degree enforce he advice and govern he -lrb- pompey -rrb- if he persist in error that he command a army independent of pompey so that besides he authority he have strength to compel and if he do so all man would be indebted to he for the quiet of italy the peace of the province and the preservation of the empire these proposal clodius make to he and for some day at the first appear to have meet with a favourable reception but afterwards be not admit to a audience for scipio be reprimand by favonius as we find afterwards when the war be end and the negotiation have miscarry clodius return to caesar lviii -- caesar that he might the more easily keep pompey 's horse enclose within dyrrachium and prevent they from forage fortify the two narrow pass already mention with strong work and erect fort at they pompey perceive that he derive no advantage from he cavalry after a few day have they convey back to he camp by sea fodder be so exceedingly scarce that he be oblige to feed he horse upon leaf strip off the tree or the tender root of reed pound for the corn which have be sow within the line be already consume and they would be oblige to supply themselves with fodder from corcyra and acarnanium over a long tract of sea and as the quantity of that fall short to increase it by mix barley with it and by these method support they cavalry but when not only the barley and fodder in these part be consume and the herb cut away when the leaf too be not to be find on the tree the horse be almost starve pompey think he ought to make some attempt by a sally lix -- in the number of caesar 's cavalry be two allobrogian brother name roscillus and aegus the son of abducillus who for several year possess the chief power in he own state man of singular valor whose gallant service caesar have find very useful in all he war in gaul to they for these reason he have commit the office of greatest honor in they own country and take care to have they choose into the senate at a unusual age and have bestow on they land take from the enemy and large pecuniary reward and from be needy have make they affluent they valor have not only procure they caesar 's esteem but they be beloved by the whole army but presume on caesar 's friendship and elate with the arrogance natural to a foolish and barbarous people they despise they countryman defraud they cavalry of they pay and apply all the plunder to they own use displeased at this conduct they soldier go in a body to caesar and openly complain of they ill usage and to they other charge add that false muster be give in to caesar and the surcharge pay apply to they own use lx -- caesar not think it a proper time to call they to account and willing to pardon many fault on account of they valor defer the whole matter and give they a private rebuke for have make a traffic of they troops and advise they to expect everything from he friendship and by he past favor to measure they future hope this however give they great offence and make they contemptible in the eye of the whole army of this they become sensible as well from the reproach of other as from the judgment of they own mind and a consciousness of guilt prompt then by shame and perhaps imagine that they be not liberate from trial but reserve to a future day they resolve to break off from we to put they fortune to a new hazard and to make trial of new connection and have confer with a few of they client to whom they could venture to entrust so base a action they first attempt to assassinate caius volusenus general of the horse -lrb- as be discover at the end of the war -rrb- that they might appear to have flee to pompey after confer a important service on he but when that appear too difficult to put in execution and no opportunity offer to accomplish it they borrow all the money they could as if they design to make satisfaction and restitution for what they have defraud : and have purchase a great number of horse they desert to pompey along with those whom they have engage in they plot lxi -- as they be person nobly descend and of liberal education and have come with a great retinue and several cattle and be reckon man of courage and have be in great esteem with caesar and as it be a new and uncommon event pompey carry they round all he work and make a ostentatious show of they for till that day not a soldier either horse or foot have desert from caesar to pompey though there be desertion almost every day from pompey to caesar : but more commonly among the soldier levy in epirus and aetolium and in those country which be in caesar 's possession but the brother have be acquaint with all thing either what be incomplete in we work or what appear to the best judge of military matter to be deficient the particular time the distance of place and the various attention of the guard accord to the different temper and character of the officer who command the different post give a exact account of all to pompey lxii -- upon receive this intelligence pompey who have already form the design of attempt a sally as before mention order the soldier to make ozier covering for they helmet and to provide fascine these thing be prepare he embark on board small boat and row galley by night a considerable number of light infantry and archer with all they fascine and immediately after midnight he march sixty cohort draft from the greater camp and the outpost to that part of we work which extend towards the sea and be at the farthest distance from caesar 's greater camp to the same place he send the ship which he have freight with the fascine and light-armed troops and all the ship of war that lay at dyrrachium and to each he give particular instruction : at this part of the line caesar have post lentulus marcellinus the quaestor with the ninth legion and as he be not in a good state of health fulvius costhumus be send to assist he in the command lxiii -- at this place front the enemy there be a ditch fifteen foot wide and a rampart ten foot high and the top of the rampart be ten foot in breadth at a interval of six hundred foot from that there be another rampart turn the contrary way with the work lower for some day before caesar apprehend that we man might be surround by sea have make a double rampart there that if he should be attack on both side he might have the means in defend himself but the extent of the line and the incessant labor for so many day because he have enclose a circuit of seventeen mile with he work do not allow time to finish they therefore the transverse rampart which should make a communication between the other two be not yet complete this circumstance be know to pompey be tell to he by the allobrogian deserter and prove of great disadvantage to we for when we cohort of the ninth legion be on guard by the sea-side pompey 's army arrive suddenly by break of day and they approach be a surprise to we man and at the same time the soldier that come by sea cast they dart on the front rampart and the ditch be fill with fascine : and the legionary soldier terrify those that defend the inner rampart by apply the scale ladder and by engine and weapon of all sort and a vast multitude of archer pour round upon they from every side besides the covering of ozier which they have lay over they helmet be a great security to they against the blow of stone which be the only weapon that we soldier have and therefore when we man be oppress in every manner and be scarcely able to make resistance the defect in we work be observe and pompey 's soldier landing between the two rampart where the work be unfinished attack we man in the rear and have beat they from both side of the fortification oblige they to flee lxiv -- marcellinus be inform of this disorder detach some cohort to the relief of we man who see they flee from the camp be neither able to persuade they to rally at they approach nor themselves to sustain the enemy 's charge and in like manner whatever additional assistance be send be infect by the fear of the defeat and increase the terror and danger for retreat be prevent by the multitude of the fugitive in that battle when the eagle-bearer be dangerously wound and begin to grow weak have get sight of we horse he say to they this eagle have i defend with the greatest care for many year at the hazard of my life and now in my last moment restore it to caesar with the same fidelity do not i conjure you suffer a dishonor to be sustain in the field which never before happen to caesar 's army but deliver it safe into he hand by this accident the eagle be preserved but all the centurion of the first cohort be kill except the principal lxv -- and now the pompeian after great havoc of we troops be approach marcellinus 's camp and have strike no small terror into the rest of the cohort when marcus antonius who command the nearest fort be inform of what have happen be observe descend from the rise ground with twelve cohort he arrival check the pompeian and encourage we man to recover from they extreme affright and shortly after caesar have get notice by the smoke from all the fort which be the usual signal on such occasion draft off some cohort from the outpost and go to the scene of action and have there learn the loss he have sustain and perceive that pompey have force we work and have encamp along the coast so that he be at liberty to forage and have a communication with he shipping he alter he plan for conduct the war as he design have not succeed and order a strong encampment to be make near pompey lxvi -- when this work be finish caesar 's scout observe that some cohort which to they appear like a legion be retire behind the wood and be on they march to the old camp the situation of the two camp be as follow : a few day before when caesar 's ninth legion have oppose a party of pompey 's troops and be endeavor to enclose they caesar 's troops form a camp in that place this camp join a certain wood and be not above four hundred pace distant from the sea afterwards change he design for certain reason caesar remove he camp to a small distance beyond that place and after a few day pompey take possession of it and add more extensive work leave the inner rampart standing as he intend to keep several legion there by this mean the lesser camp include within the greater answer the purpose of a fort and citadel he have also carry a entrenchment from the left angle of the camp to the river about four hundred pace that he soldier might have more liberty and less danger in fetch water but he too change he design for reason not necessary to be mention abandon the place in this condition the camp remain for several day the work be all entire lxvii -- caesar 's scout bring he word that the standard of a legion be carry to this place that the same thing be see he be assure by those in the higher fort this place be half a mile distant from pompey 's new camp caesar hope to surprise this legion and anxious to repair the loss sustain that day leave two cohort employ in the work to make a appearance of entrench himself and by a different route as privately as he could with he other cohort amount to thirty-three among which be the ninth legion which have lose so many centurion and whose private be greatly reduce in number he march in two line against pompey 's legion and he lesser camp nor do this first opinion deceive he for he reach the place before pompey could have notice of it and though the work be strong yet have make the attack with the left wing which he command in person he oblige the pompeian to quit the rampart in disorder a barricade have be raise before the gate at which a short contest be maintain we man endeavor to force they way in and the enemy to defend the camp titus pulcio by whose mean we have relate that caius antonius 's army be betray defend they with singular courage but the valor of we man prevail and have cut down the barricade they first force the greater camp and after that the fort which be enclose within it : and as the legion on its repulse have retire to this they slew several defend themselves there lxviii -- but fortune who exert a powerful influence as well in other matter as especially in war effect great change from trifling cause as happen at this time for the cohort on caesar 's right wing through ignorance of the place follow the direction of that rampart which run along from the camp to the river whilst they be in search of a gate and imagine that it belong to the camp but when they find that it lead to the river and that nobody oppose they they immediately climb over the rampart and be follow by all we cavalry lxix -- in the meantime pompey by the great delay which this occasion be inform of what have happen march with the fifth legion which he call away from they work to support he party and at the same time he cavalry be advance up to ours and a army in order of battle be see at a distance by we man who have take possession of the camp and the face of affair be suddenly change for pompey 's legion encourage by the hope of speedy support attempt to make a stand at the decuman gate and make a bold charge on we man caesar 's cavalry who have mount the rampart by a narrow breach be apprehensive of they retreat be the first to flee the right wing which have be separate from the left observe the terror of the cavalry to prevent they be overpower within the line be endeavor to retreat by the same way as they burst in and most of they lest they should be engage in the narrow pass throw themselves down a rampart ten foot high into the trench and the first be trodden to death the rest procure they safety and escape over they body the soldier of the left wing perceive from the rampart that pompey be advance and they own friend flee be afraid that they should be enclose between the two rampart as they have a enemy both within and without strove to secure they retreat the same way they come all be disorder consternation and flight insomuch that when caesar lay hold of the color of those who be run away and desire they to stand some leave they horse behind and continue to run in the same manner other through fear even throw away they color nor do a single man face about lxx -- in this calamity the follow favourable circumstance occur to prevent the ruin of we whole army viz that pompey suspect a ambuscade -lrb- because as i suppose the success have far exceed he hope as he have see he man a moment before flee from the camp -rrb- dare not for some time approach the fortification and that he horse be retard from pursue because the pass and gate be in possession of caesar 's soldier thus a trifling circumstance prove of great importance to each party for the rampart draw from the camp to the river interrupt the progress and certainty of caesar 's victory after he have force pompey 's camp the same thing by retard the rapidity of the enemy 's pursuit preserve we army lxxi -- in the two action of this day caesar lose nine hundred and sixty rank and file several roman knight of distinction felgina tuticanus gallus a senator 's son caius felgina from placentium aulus gravius from puteoli marcus sacrativir from capua and thirty-two military tribune and centurion but the greatest part of all these perish without a wound be trodden to death in the trench on the rampart and bank of the river by reason of the terror and flight of they own man pompey after this battle be salute imperator this title he retain and allow himself to be address by it afterwards but neither in he letter to the senate nor in the fasce do he use the laurel as a mark of honor but labienus have obtain he consent that the prisoner should be deliver up to he have they all bring out as it appear to make a show of they and that pompey might place a greater confidence in he who be a deserter and call they fellow soldier and ask they in the most insulting manner whether it be usual with veteran to flee order they to be put to death in the sight of the whole army lxxii-pompey 's party be so elated with confidence and spirit at this success that they think no more of the method of conduct the war but think that they be already conqueror they do not consider that the smallness of we number and the disadvantage of the place and the confine nature of the ground occasion by they have first possess themselves of the camp and the double danger both from within and without the fortification and the separation of the army into two part so that the one could not give relief to the other be the cause of we defeat they do not consider in addition that the contest be not decide by a vigorous attack nor a regular battle and that we man have suffer greater loss from they number and want of room than they have sustain from the enemy in fine they do not reflect on the common casualty of war how trifling cause either from groundless suspicion sudden affright or religious scruple have oftentimes be productive of considerable loss how often a army have be unsuccessful either by the misconduct of the general or the oversight of a tribune but as if they have prove victorious by they valor and as if no change could ever take place they publish the success of the day throughout the world by report and letter lxxiii -- caesar disappointed in he first intention resolve to change the whole plan of he operation accordingly he at once call in all out-post give over the siege and collect he army into one place address he soldier and encourage they not to be trouble at what have happen nor to be dismay at it but to weigh they many successful engagement against one disappointment and that too a trifling one that they ought to be grateful to fortune through whose favor they have recover italy without the effusion of blood through whose favor they have subdue the two spain though protect by a most warlike people under the command of the most skilful and experienced general : through whose favor they have reduce to submission the neighbouring state that abound with corn : in fine that they ought to remember with what success they have be all transport safe through blockade fleet of the enemy which possess not only the port but even the coast : that if all they attempt be not crown with success the defect of fortune must be supply by industry and whatever loss have be sustained ought to be attribute rather to she caprice than to any fault in he : that he have choose a safe ground for the engagement that he have possess himself of the enemy 's camp that he have beat they out and overcome they when they offer resistance but whether they own terror or some mistake or whether fortune herself have interrupt a victory almost secure and certain they ought all now to use they utmost effort to repair by they valor the loss which have be incur if they do so they misfortune would turn to they advantage as it happen at gergovium and those who fear to face the enemy would be the first to offer themselves to battle lxxiv -- have conclude he speech he disgrace some standard-bearer and reduce they to the rank for the whole army be seize with such grief at they loss and with such a ardent desire of repair they disgrace that not a man require the command of he tribune or centurion but they impose each on himself severer labor than usual as a punishment and at the same time be so inflamed with eagerness to meet the enemy that the officer of the first rank sensibly affect at they entreaty be of opinion that they ought to continue in they present post and commit they fate to the hazard of a battle but on the other hand caesar could not place sufficient confidence in man so lately throw into consternation and think he ought to allow they time to recover they dejected spirit and have abandon he work he be apprehensive of be distressed for want of corn lxxv -- accordingly suffer no time to intervene but what be necessary for a proper attention to be pay to the sick and wound he send on all he baggage privately in the beginning of the night from he camp to apollonium and order they not to halt till they have perform they journey and he detach one legion with they as a convoy this affair be conclude have retain only two legion in he camp he march the rest of he army out at three o'clock in the morning by several gate and send they forward by the same route and in a short space after that the military practice might be preserve and he march know as late as possible he order the signal for decamp to be give and set out immediately and follow the rear of he own army he be soon out of sight of the camp nor do pompey as soon as he have notice of he design make any delay to pursue he but with a view to surprise they whilst encumber with baggage on they march and not yet recover from they fright he lead he army out of he camp and send he cavalry on to retard we rear but be not able to come up with they because caesar have get far before he and march without baggage but when we reach the river genusus the bank be steep they horse overtake we rear and detain they by bring they to action to oppose whom caesar send he horse and intermix with they about four hundred of he advanced light troops who attack they horse with such success that have route they all and kill several they return without any loss to the main body lxxvi -- have perform the exact march which he have propose that day and have lead he army over the river genusus caesar post himself in he old camp opposite asparagium and keep he soldier close within the entrenchment and order the horse who have be send out under pretence of forage to retire immediately into the camp through the decuman gate pompey in like manner have complete the same day 's march take post in he old camp at asparagium and he soldier as they have no work -lrb- the fortification be entire -rrb- make long excursion some to collect wood and forage other invite by the nearness of the former camp lay up they arm in they tent and quit the entrenchment in order to bring what they have leave behind they because the design of march be adopt in a hurry they have leave a considerable part of they waggon and luggage behind be thus incapable of pursue as caesar have foresee about noon he give the signal for march lead out he army and double that day 's march he advance eight mile beyond pompey 's camp who could not pursue he because he troops be disperse lxxvii -- the next day caesar send he baggage forward early in the night and march off himself immediately after the fourth watch : that if he should be under the necessity of risk a engagement he might meet a sudden attack with a army free from incumbrance he do so for several day successively by which mean he be enable to effect he march over the deepest river and through the most intricate road without any loss for pompey after the first day 's delay and the fatigue which he endure for some day in vain though he exert himself by force march and be anxious to overtake we who have get the start of he on the fourth day desist from the pursuit and determine to follow other measure lxxviii -- caesar be oblige to go to apollonium to lodge he wounded pay he army confirm he friend and leave garrison in the town but for these matter he allow no more time than be necessary for a person in haste and be apprehensive for domitius lest he should be surprise by pompey 's arrival he hasten with all speed and earnestness to join he for he plan the operation of the whole campaign on these principle : that if pompey should march after he he would be draw off from the sea and from those force which he have provide in dyrrachium and separate from he corn and magazine and be oblige to carry on the war on equal term but if he cross over into italy caesar have effect a junction with domitius would march through illyricum to the relief of italy but if he endeavor to storm apollonium and oricum and exclude he from the whole coast he hope by besiege scipio to oblige he of necessity to come to he assistance accordingly caesar despatch courier write to domitius and acquaint he with he wish on the subject : and have station a garrison of four cohort at apollonium one at lissus and three at oricum besides those who be sick of they wound he set forward on he march through epirus and acarnanium pompey also guess at caesar 's design determine to hasten to scipio that if caesar should march in that direction he might be ready to relieve he but that if caesar should be unwilling to quit the sea-coast and corcyra because he expect legion and cavalry from italy he himself might fall on domitius with all he force lxxix -- for these reason each of they study despatch that he might succor he friend and not miss a opportunity of surprising he enemy but caesar 's engagement at apolloma have carry he aside from the direct road pompey have take the short road to macedonia through candavium to this be add another unexpected disadvantage that domitius who for several day have be encamp opposite scipio have quit that post for the sake of provision and have march to heraclea sentica a city subject to candavium so that fortune herself seem to throw he in pompey 's way of this caesar be ignorant up to this time letter likewise be send by pompey through all the province and state with a account of the action at dyrrachium very much enlarged and exaggerate beyond the real fact a rumor have be circulate that caesar have be defeat and force to flee and have lose almost all he force these report have make the road dangerous and draw off some state from he alliance : whence it happen that the messenger despatch by caesar by several different road to domitius and by domitius to caesar be not able by any means to accomplish they journey but the allobroge who be in the retinue of aegus and roscillus and who have desert to pompey have meet on the road a scout party of domitius either from old acquaintance because they have serve together in gaul or elate with vain glory give they a account of all that have happen and inform they of caesar 's departure and pompey 's arrival domitius who be scarce four hour ' march distant have get intelligence from these by the courtesy of the enemy avoid the danger and meet caesar come to join he at aeginium a town on the confines of and opposite to thessaly lxxx -- the two army be unite caesar march to gomphus which be the first town of thessaly on the road from epirus now the thessalian a few month before have of themselves send ambassador to caesar offer he the free use of everything in they power and request a garrison for they protection but the report already speak of of the battle at dyrrachium which it have exaggerate in many particulars have arrive before he in consequence of which androsthene the praetor of thessaly as he prefer to be the companion of pompey 's victory rather than caesar 's associate in he misfortune collect all the people both slave and freeman from the country into the town and shut the gate and despatch messenger to scipio and pompey to come to he relief that he could depend on the strength of the town if succor be speedily send but that it could not withstand a long siege scipio as soon as he receive advice of the departure of the army from dyrrachium have march with he legion to larissa : pompey be not yet arrive near thessaly caesar have fortify he camp order scale ladder and pent-house to be make for a sudden assault and hurdle to be provide as soon as they be ready he exhort he soldier and tell they of what advantage it would be to assist they with all sort of necessaries if they make themselves master of a rich and plentiful town : and at the same time to strike terror into other state by the example of this and to effect this with speed before auxiliary could arrive accordingly take advantage of the unusual ardor of the soldier he begin he assault on the town at a little after three o'clock on the very day on which he arrive and take it though defend with very high wall before sunset and give it up to he army to plunder and immediately decamp from before it and march to metropolis with such rapidity as to outstrip any messenger or rumor of the taking of gomphus lxxxi -- the inhabitant of metropolis at first influence by the same rumor follow the same measure shut the gate and man they wall but when they be make acquaint with the fate of the city of gomphus by some prisoner whom caesar have order to be bring up to the wall they throw open they gate as he preserve they with the greatest care there be not a state in thessaly -lrb- except larissa which be awed by a strong army of scipio 's -rrb- but on compare the fate of the inhabitant of metropolis with the severe treatment of gomphus give admission to caesar and obey he order have choose a position convenient for procure corn which be now almost ripe on the ground he determine there to wait pompey 's arrival and to make it the center of all he warlike operation lxxxii -- pompey arrive in thessaly a few day after and have harangue the combined army return thanks to he own man and exhort scipio 's soldier that as the victory be now secure they should endeavor to merit a part of the reward and booty and receive all the legion into one camp he share he honor with scipio order the trumpet to be sound at he tent and a pavilion to be erect for he the force of pompey be thus augmented and two such powerful army unite they former expectation be confirm and they hope of victory so much increase that whatever time intervene be consider as so much delay to they return into italy : and whenever pompey act with slowness and caution they use to exclaim that it be the business only of a single day but that he have a passion for power and be delighted in have person of consular and praetorian rank in the number of he slave and they now begin to dispute openly about reward and priesthood and disposed of the consulate for several year to come other put in they claim for the house and property of all who be in caesar 's camp and in that council there be a warm debate whether lucius hirrus who have be send by pompey against the parthian should be admit a candidate for the praetorship in he absence at the next election he friend implore pompey 's honor to fulfil the engagement which he have make to he at he departure that he might not seem deceive through he authority : whilst other embark in equal labor and danger plead that no individual ought to have a preference before all the rest lxxxiii -- already domitius scipio and lentulus spinthur in they daily quarrel about caesar 's priesthood openly abused each other in the most scurrilous language lentulus urge the respect due to he age domitius boast he interest in the city and he dignity and scipio presuming on he alliance with pompey attius rufus charge lucius afranius before pompey with betray the army in the action that happen in spain and lucius domitius declare in the council that it be he wish that when the war should be end three billet should be give to all the senator who have take part with they in the war and that they should pass sentence on every single person who have stay behind at rome or who have be within pompey 's garrison and have not contribute they assistance in the military operation that by the first billet they should-have power to acquit by the second to pass sentence of death and by the third to impose a pecuniary fine in short pompey 's whole army talk of nothing but the honor or sum of money which be to be they reward or of vengeance on they enemy and never consider how they be to defeat they enemy but in what manner they should use they victory lxxxiv -- corn be provide and he soldier refresh and a sufficient time have elapse since the engagement at dyrrachium when caesar think he have sufficiently sound the disposition of he troops he think that he ought to try whether pompey have any intention or inclination to come to a battle accordingly he lead he troops out of the camp and range they in order of battle at first on they own ground and at a small distance from pompey 's camp : but afterwards for several day in succession he advance from he own camp and lead they up to the hill on which pompey 's troops be post which conduct inspire he army every day with fresh courage however he adhere to he former purpose respect he cavalry for as he be by many degree inferior in number he select the youngest and most active of the advanced guard and desire they to fight intermix with the horse and they by constant practice acquire experience in this kind of battle by these mean it be bring to pass that a thousand of he horse would dare even on open ground to stand against seven thousand of pompey 's if occasion require and would not be much terrify by they number for even on one of those day he be successful in a cavalry action and kill one of the two allobrogian who have desert to pompey as we before observe and several other lxxxv -- pompey because he be encamp on a hill draw up he army at the very foot of it ever in expectation as may be conjecture that caesar would expose himself to this disadvantageous situation caesar see no likelihood of be able to bring pompey to a action judge it the most expedient method of conduct the war to decamp from that post and to be always in motion : with this hope that by shift he camp and remove from place to place he might be more conveniently supply with corn and also that by be in motion he might get some opportunity of force they to battle and might by constant march harass pompey 's army which be not accustom to fatigue these matter be settle when the signal for march be give and the tent strike it be observe that shortly before contrary to he daily practice pompey 's army have advance farther than usual from he entrenchment so that it appear possible to come to a action on equal ground then caesar address himself to he soldier when they be at the gate of the camp ready to march out we must defer say he we march at present and set we thought on battle which have be we constant wish let we then meet the foe with resolute soul we shall not hereafter easily find such a opportunity he immediately march out at the head of he troops lxxxvi -- pompey also as be afterward know at the unanimous solicitation of he friend have determine to try the fate of a battle for he have even declare in council a few day before that before the battalion come to battle caesar 's army would be put to the rout when most people express they surprise at it i know say he that i promise a thing almost incredible but hear the plan on which i proceed that you may march to battle with more confidence and resolution i have persuade we cavalry and they have engage to execute it as soon as the two army have meet to attack caesar 's right wing on the flank and enclose they army on the rear throw they into disorder and put they to the rout before we shall throw a weapon against the enemy by this mean we shall put a end to the war without endanger the legion and almost without a blow nor be this a difficult matter as we far outnumber they in cavalry at the same time he give they notice to be ready for battle on the day follow and since the opportunity which they have so often wish for be now arrive not to disappoint the opinion generally entertain of they experience and valor lxxxvii -- after he labienus speak as well to express he contempt of caesar 's force as to extol pompey 's scheme with the highest encomium think not pompey say he that this be the army which conquer gaul and germany i be present at all those battle and do not speak at random on a subject to which i be a stranger : a very small part of that army now remain great number lose they life as must necessarily happen in so many battle many fall victim to the autumnal pestilence in italy many return home and many be leave behind on the continent have you not hear that the cohort at brundisium be compose of invalid the force which you now behold have be recruit by levy lately make in hither spain and the greater part from the colony beyond the po moreover the flower of the force perish in the two engagement at dyrrachium have so say he take a oath never to return to he camp unless victorious and he encourage the rest to do the like pompey applaud he proposal and take the same oath nor do any person present hesitate to take it after this have pass in the council they break up full of hope and joy and in imagination anticipate victory because they think that in a matter of such importance no groundless assertion could be make by a general of such experience lxxxviii -- when caesar have approach near pompey 's camp he observe that he army be draw up in the follow manner : -- on the left wing be the two legion deliver over by caesar at the beginning of the dispute in compliance with the senate 's decree one of which be call the first the other the third here pompey command in person scipio with the syrian legion command the center the cilician legion in conjunction with the spanish cohort which we say be bring over by afranius be dispose on the right wing these pompey consider he steadiest troops the rest he have intersperse between the center and the wing and he have a hundred and ten complete cohort these amount to forty-five thousand man he have besides two cohort of volunteer who have receive favor from he in former war flock to he standard : these be disperse through he whole army the seven remain cohort he have dispose to protect he camp and the neighbouring fort he right wing be secure by a river with steep bank for which reason he place all he cavalry archer and slinger on he left wing lxxxix -- caesar observe he former custom have place the tenth legion on the right the ninth on the left although it be very much weaken by the battle at dyrrachium he place the eighth legion so close to the ninth as to almost make one of the two and order they to support one another he draw up on the field eighty cohort make a total of twenty-two thousand man he leave two cohort to guard the camp he give the command of the left wing to antonius of the right to p sullum and of the center to cn domitius : he himself take he post opposite pompey at the same time fear from the disposition of the enemy which we have previously mention lest he right wing might be surround by they numerous cavalry he rapidly draft a single cohort from each of the legion compose the third line form of they a fourth line and oppose they to pompey 's cavalry and acquaint they with he wish admonish they that the success of that day depend on they courage at the same time he order the third line and the entire army not to charge without he command : that he would give the signal whenever he wish they to do so xc -- when he be exhort he army to battle accord to the military custom and speak to they of the favor that they have constantly receive from he he take especial care to remind they that he could call he soldier to witness the earnestness with which he have seek peace the effort that he have make by vatinius to gain a conference -lrb- with labienus -rrb- and likewise by claudius to treat with scipio in what manner he have exert himself at oricum to gain permission from libo to send ambassador that he have be always reluctant to shed the blood of he soldier and do not wish to deprive the republic of one or other of she army after deliver this speech he give by a trumpet the signal to he soldier who be eagerly demand it and be very impatient for the onset xci -- there be in caesar 's army a volunteer of the name of crastinus who the year before have be first centurion of the tenth legion a man of pre-eminent bravery he when the signal be give say follow I my old comrade and display such exertion in behalf of you general as you have determine to do : this be we last battle and when it shall be win he will recover he dignity and we we liberty at the same time he look back to caesar and say general i will act in such a manner to-day that you will feel grateful tome living or dead after utter these word he charge first on the right wing and about one hundred and twenty choose volunteer of the same century follow xcii -- there be so much space leave between the two line as suffice for the onset of the hostile army : but pompey have order he soldier to await caesar 's attack and not to advance from they position or suffer they line to be put into disorder and he be say to have do this by the advice of caius triarius that the impetuosity of the charge of caesar 's soldier might be check and they line break and that pompey 's troops remain in they rank might attack they while in disorder and he think that the javelin would fall with less force if the soldier be keep in they ground than if they meet they in they course at the same time he trust that caesar 's soldier after run over double the usual ground would become weary and exhaust by the fatigue but to I pompey seem to have act without sufficient reason : for there be a certain impetuosity of spirit and a alacrity implant by nature in the heart of all man which be inflamed by a desire to meet the foe this a general should endeavor not to repress but to increase nor be it a vain institution of we ancestor that the trumpet should sound on all side and a general shout be raise by which they imagine that the enemy be strike with terror and they own army inspire with courage xciii -- but we man when the signal be give rush forward with they javelin ready to be launch but perceive that pompey 's man do not run to meet they charge have acquire experience by custom and be practice in former battle they of they own accord repress they speed and halt almost midway that they might not come up with the enemy when they strength be exhaust and after a short respite they again renew they course and throw they javelin and instantly draw they sword as caesar have order they nor do pompey 's man fail in this crisis for they receive we javelin stand we charge and maintain they rank : and have launch they javelin have recourse to they sword at the same time pompey 's horse accord to they order rush out at once from he left wing and he whole host of archer pour after they we cavalry do not withstand they charge : but give ground a little upon which pompey 's horse press they more vigorously and begin to file off in troops and flank we army when caesar perceive this he give the signal to he fourth line which he have form of the six cohort they instantly rush forward and charge pompey 's horse with such fury that not a man of they stand but all wheeling about not only quit they post but gallop forward to seek a refuge in the highest mountain by they retreat the archer and slinger be leave destitute and defenceless be all cut to piece the cohort pursue they success wheel about upon pompey 's left wing whilst he infantry still continue to make battle and attack they in the rear xciv -- at the same time caesar order he third line to advance which till then have not be engage but have keep they post thus new and fresh troops have come to the assistance of the fatigue and other have make a attack on they rear pompey 's man be not able to maintain they ground but all flee nor be caesar deceive in he opinion that the victory as he have declare in he speech to he soldier must have its beginning from those six cohort which he have place as a fourth line to oppose the horse for by they the cavalry be route by they the archer and slinger be cut to piece by they the left wing of pompey 's army be surround and oblige to be the first to flee but when pompey see he cavalry route and that part of he army on which he repose he greatest hope throw into confusion despairing of the rest he quit the field and retreat straightway on horseback to he camp and call to the centurion whom he have place to guard the praetorian gate with a loud voice that the soldier might hear : secure the camp say he defend it with diligence if any danger should threaten it i will visit the other gate and encourage the guard of the camp have thus say he retire into he tent in utter despair yet anxiously wait the issue xcv -- caesar have force the pompeian to flee into they entrenchment and think that he ought not to allow they any respite to recover from they fright exhort he soldier to take advantage of fortune 's kindness and to attack the camp though they be fatigue by the intense heat for the battle have continue till mid-day yet be prepare to undergo any labor they cheerfully obey he command the camp be bravely defend by the cohort which have be leave to guard it but with much more spirit by the thracian and foreign auxiliary for the soldier who have flee for refuge to it from the field of battle affright and exhaust by fatigue have throw away they arm and military standard have they thought more engage on they further escape than on the defense of the camp nor could the troops who be post on the battlements long withstand the immense number of we dart but faint under they wound quit the place and under the conduct of they centurion and tribune flee without stop to the high mountain which join the camp xcvi -- in pompey 's camp you might see arbor in which table be lay a large quantity of plate set out the floor of the tent cover with fresh sod the tent of lucius lentulus and other shaded with ivy and many other thing which be proof of excessive luxury and a confidence of victory so that it might readily be infer that they have no apprehension of the issue of the day as they indulge themselves in unnecessary pleasure and yet upbraid with luxury caesar 's army distressed and suffer troops who have always be in want of common necessaries pompey as soon as we man have force the trench mount he horse and strip off he general 's habit go hastily out of the back gate of the camp and gallop with all speed to larissa nor do he stop there but with the same despatch collect a few of he fly troops and halt neither day nor night he arrive at the sea-side attend by only thirty horse and go on board a victualling barque often complain as we have be tell that he have be so deceive in he expectation that he be almost persuade that he have be betray by those from whom he have expect victory as they begin the flight xcvii -- caesar have possess himself of pompey 's camp urge he soldier not to be too intent on plunder and lose the opportunity of complete they conquest have obtain they consent he begin to draw line round the mountain the pompeian distrust the position as there be no water on the mountain abandon it and all begin to retreat towards larissa which caesar perceive divide he troops and order part of he legion to remain in pompey 's camp send back a part to he own camp and take four legion with he go by a shorter road to intercept the enemy : and have march six mile draw up he army but the pompeian observe this take post on a mountain whose foot be wash by a river caesar have encourage he troops though they be greatly exhaust by incessant labor the whole day and night be now approach by throw up work cut off the communication between the river and the mountain that the enemy might not get water in the night as soon as the work be finish they send ambassador to treat about a capitulation a few senator who have espouse that party make they escape by night xcviii -- at break of day caesar order all those who have take post on the mountain to come down from the higher grounds into the plain and pile they arm when they do this without refusal and with outstretched arm prostrate themselves on the ground with tear implore he mercy : he comfort they and bid they rise and have speak a few word of he own clemency to alleviate they fear he pardon they all and give order to he soldier that no injury should be do to they and nothing take from they have use this diligence he order the legion in he camp to come and meet he and those which be with he to take they turn of rest and go back to the camp and the same day go to larissa xcix -- in that battle no more than two hundred private be miss but caesar lose about thirty centurion valiant officer crastinus also of whom mention be make before fight most courageously lose he life by the wound of a sword in the mouth nor be that false which he declare when march to battle : for caesar entertain the highest opinion of he behavior in that battle and think he highly deserving of he approbation of pompey 's army there fall about fifteen thousand but upward of twenty-four thousand be make prisoner : for even the cohort which be station in the fort surrender to sylla several other take shelter in the neighbouring state one hundred and eighty stand of color and nine eagle be bring to caesar lucius domitius flee from the camp to the mountain he strength be exhaust by fatigue be kill by the horse c -- about this time decimus laelius arrive with he fleet at brundisium and in the same manner as libo have do before possess himself of a island opposite the harbor of brundisium in like manner valimus who be then governor of brundisium with a few deck barque endeavor to entice laelius 's fleet and take one five-benched galley and two smaller vessel that have venture farther than the rest into a narrow part of the harbor : and likewise dispose the horse along the shore strive to prevent the enemy from procure fresh water but laelius have choose a more convenient season of the year for he expedition supply himself with water bring in transport from corcyra and dyrrachium and be not deter from he purpose and till he have receive advice of the battle in thessaly he could not be force either by the disgrace of lose he ship or by the want of necessaries to quit the port and island ci -- much about the same time cassius arrive in sicily with a fleet of syrian phoenician and cilician : and as caesar 's fleet be divide into two part publius sulpicius the praetor command one division at vibo near the strait pomponius the other at messana cassius get into messana with he fleet before pomponius have notice of he arrival and have find he in disorder without guard or discipline and the wind be high and favourable he fill several transport with fir pitch and tow and other combustible and send they against pomponius 's fleet and set fire to all he ship thirty-five in number twenty of which be arm with beak : and this action strike such terror that though there be a legion in garrison at messana the town with difficulty hold out and have not the news of caesar 's victory be bring at that instant by the horse station along the coast it be generally imagine that it would have be lose but the town be maintain till the news arrive very opportunely and cassius set sail from thence to attack sulpicius 's fleet at vibo and we ship be moor to the land to strike the same terror he act in the same manner as before the wind be favourable he send into the port about forty ship provide with combustible and the flame catch on both side five ship be burn to ash and when the fire begin to spread wider by the violence of the wind the soldier of the veteran legion who have be leave to guard the fleet be consider as invalid could not endure the disgrace but of themselves go on board the ship and weigh anchor and have attack cassius 's fleet capture two five-banked galley in one of which be cassius himself but he make he escape by take to a boat two three-banked galley be take besides intelligence be shortly after receive of the action in thessaly so well authenticate that the pompeian themselves give credit to it for they have hitherto believe it a fiction of caesar 's lieutenant and friend upon which intelligence cassius depart with he fleet from that coast cii -- caesar think he ought to postpone all business and pursue pompey whithersoever he should retreat that he might not be able to provide fresh force and renew the war he therefore march on every day as far as he cavalry be able to advance and order one legion to follow he by shorter journey a proclamation be issue by pompey at amphipoli that all the young man of that province grecian and roman citizen should take the military oath but whether he issue it with a intention of prevent suspicion and to conceal as long as possible he design of flee farther or to endeavor to keep possession of macedonium by new levy if nobody pursue he it be impossible to judge he lay at anchor one night and call together he friend in amphipoli and collect a sum of money for he necessary expense upon advice of caesar 's approach set sail from that place and arrive in a few day at mitylene here he be detain two day and have add a few galley to he fleet he go to cilicium and thence to cyprus there he be inform that by the consent of all the inhabitant of antioch and roman citizen who trade there the castle have be seize to shut he out of the town and that messenger have be despatch to all those who be report to have take refuge in the neighbouring state that they should not come to antioch that if they do that it would be attend with imminent danger to they life the same thing have happen to lucius lentulus who have be consul the year before and to publius lentulus a consular senator and to several other at rhode who have follow pompey in he flight and arrive at the island be not admit into the town or port and have receive a message to leave that neighborhood set sail much against they will for the rumor of caesar 's approach have now reach those state ciii -- pompey be inform of these proceedings lay aside he design of go to syrium and have take the public money from the farmer of the revenue and borrow more from some private friend and have put on board he ship a large quantity of brass for military purpose and two thousand armed man whom he partly select from the slave of the tax farmer and partly collect from the merchant and such person as each of he friend think fit on this occasion he sail for pelusium it happen that king ptolemy a minor be there with a considerable army engage in war with he sister cleopatra whom a few month before by the assistance of he relation and friend he have expel from the kingdom and she camp lay at a small distance from he to he pompey apply to be permit to take refuge in alexandrium and to be protect in he calamity by he powerful assistance in consideration of the friendship and amity which have subsist between he father and he but pompey 's deputy have execute they commission begin to converse with less restraint with the king 's troops and to advise they to act with friendship to pompey and not to think meanly of he bad fortune in ptolemy 's army be several of pompey 's soldier of whom gabinius have receive the command in syrium and have bring they over to alexandrium and at the conclusion of the war have leave with ptolemy the father of the young king civ -- the king 's friend who be regent of the kingdom during the minority be inform of these thing either induce by fear as they afterwards declare lest pompey should corrupt the king 's army and seize on alexandrium and egypt or despise he bad fortune as in adversity friend commonly change to enemy in public give a favourable answer to he deputy and desire he to come to the king but secretly lay a plot against he and despatch achilla captain of the king 's guard a man of singular boldness and lucius septimius a military tribune to assassinate he be kindly address by they and delude by a acquaintance with septimius because in the war with the pirate the latter have command a company under he he embark in a small boat with a few attendant and be there murder by achilla and septimius in like manner lucius lentulus be seize by the king 's order and put to death in prison cv -- when caesar arrive in asia he find that titus ampius have attempt to remove the money from the temple of diana at ephesus and for this purpose have convene all the senator in the province that he might have they to attest the sum but be interrupt by caesar 's arrival and have make he escape thus on two occasion caesar save the money of ephesus it be also remark at eli in the temple of minerva upon calculate and enumerate the day that on the very day on which caesar have gain he battle the image of victory which be place before minerva and face she statue turn about towards the portal and entrance of the temple and the same day at antioch in syrium such a shout of a army and sound of trumpet be twice hear that the citizen run in arm to the wall the same thing happen at ptolemai a sound of drum too be hear at pergamus in the private and retired part of the temple into which none but the priest be allow admission and which the greek call adyta -lrb- the inaccessible -rrb- and likewise at tralle in the temple of victory in which there stand a statue consecrate to caesar a palm-tree at that time be show that have sprout up from the pavement through the joint of the stone and shoot up above the roof cvi -- after a few day ' delay in asia caesar have hear that pompey have be see in cyprus and conjecturing that he have direct he course into egypt on account of he connection with that kingdom set out for alexandrium with two legion -lrb- one of which he order to follow he from thessaly the other he call in from achaium from fufius the lieutenant-general -rrb- and with eight hundred horse ten ship of war from rhode and a few from asia these legion amount but to three thousand two hundred man the rest disable by wound receive in various battle by fatigue and the length of they march could not follow he but caesar rely on the fame of he exploit do not hesitate to set forward with a feeble force and think that he would be secure in any place at alexandrium he be inform of the death of pompey : and at he landing there hear a cry among the soldier whom the king have leave to garrison the town and see a crowd gathering towards he because the fasce be carry before he for this the whole multitude think a infringement of the king 's dignity though this tumult be appease frequent disturbance be raise for several day successively by crowd of the populace and a great many of he soldier be kill in all part of the city cvil -- have observe this he order other legion to be bring to he from asia which he have make up out of pompey 's soldier for he be himself detain against he will by the etesian wind which be totally unfavourable to person on a voyage from alexandrium in the meantime consider that the dispute of the prince belong to the jurisdiction of the roman people and of he as consul and that it be a duty more incumbent on he as in he former consulate a league have be make with ptolemy the late king under sanction both of a law and a decree of the senate he signify that it be he pleasure that king ptolemy and he sister cleopatra should disband they army and decide they dispute in he presence by justice rather than by the sword cviii -- a eunuch name pothinus the boy 's tutor be regent of the kingdom on account of he youthfulness he at first begin to complain amongst he friend and to express he indignation that the king should be summon to plead he cause : but afterwards have prevail on some of those whom he have make acquaint with he view to join he he secretly call the army away from pelusium to alexandrium and appoint achilla already speak of commander-in-chief of the force he he encourage and animated by promise both in he own and the king 's name and instruct he both by letter and message how he should act by the will of ptolemy the father the elder of he two son and the more advanced in year of he two daughter be declare he heir and for the more effectual performance of he intention in the same will he conjure the roman people by all the god and by the league which he have enter into at rome to see he will execute one of the copy of he will be convey to rome by he ambassador to be deposit in the treasury but the public trouble prevent it it be lodge with pompey : another be leave seal up and keep at alexandrium cix -- whilst these thing be debate before caesar and he be very anxious to settle the royal dispute as a common friend and arbitrator news be bring on a sudden that the king 's army and all he cavalry be on they march to alexandrium caesar 's force be by no means so strong that he could trust to they if he have occasion to hazard a battle without the town he only resource be to keep within the town in the most convenient place and get information of achilla 's design however he order he soldier to repair to they arm and advise the king to send some of he friend who have the greatest influence as deputy to achilla and to signify he royal pleasure dioscoride and serapion the person send by he who have both be ambassador at rome and have be in great esteem with ptolemy the father go to achilla but as soon as they appear in he presence without hear they or learn the occasion of they come he order they to be seize and put to death one of they after receive a wound be take up and carry off by he attendant as dead : the other be kill on the spot upon this caesar take care to secure the king 's person both suppose that the king 's name would have great influence with he subject and to give the war the appearance of the scheme of a few desperate man rather than of have be begin by the king 's consent cx -- the force under achilla do not seem despicable either for number spirit or military experience for he have twenty thousand man under arm they consist partly of gabinius 's soldier who be now become habituate to the licentious mode of live at alexandrium and have forget the name and discipline of the roman people and have marry wife there by whom the greatest part of they have child to these be add a collection of highwayman and free-booter from syrium
