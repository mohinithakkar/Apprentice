produce by cornell university the atlantic monthly a magazine of literature art and politics vol ii -- November 1858 -- no xiii railway-engineering in the united state -lrb- 1 -rrb- though we country can boast of no watt brindley smeaton rennie telford brunel stephenson or fairbairn and lack such experimenter as tredgold barlow hodgkinson and clark yet we have we evan and fulton we whistler latrobe roeble haupt ellet adam and morri -- engineer who yield to none in professional skill and whose work will bear comparison with the best of that of great britain or the continent and if america do not show a thame tunnel a conway or menaus tubular bridge or a monster steamer yet she have a railroad-bridge of eight hundred foot clear span hang two hundred and fifty foot above one of the wildest river in the world -- locomotive engine climb the alleghany at a ascent of five hundred foot per mile -- and twenty-five thousand mile of railroad employ upward of five thousand locomotive and eighty thousand car cost over a thousand million of dollar and transport annually one hundred and thirty million of passenger and thirty million ton of freight -- and all this in a manner peculiarly adapt to we country both financially and mechanically in england the amount of money bear a high proportion to the amount of territory in america the reverse be the case and the engineer of the two country quickly recognize the fact : for we find we railroad cost from thirty thousand to forty thousand dollar per mile -- while in england to surmount much easier natural obstacle the cost vary from seventy-five to one hundred thousand dollar per mile the cost of railroad transport will probably never be so low as carriage by water -- that be natural water-communication because the river or ocean be give to man complete and ready for use need no repair and with no interest to pay upon construction capital indeed it be just begin to be see all over the country that the public have both expect and receive too much accommodation from the company man be perfectly willing to pay five dollar for ride a hundred mile in a stage-coach but give they a nicely warm ventilate cushion and furnished car and carry they four or five time faster with double the comfort and they expect to pay only half-price -- as a friend of the writer once remark why of course we ought not to pay so much when we a 'n' t half so long go -- as if when they pay they fare they not only bargain for transport from one place to another but for the luxury of sit in a crowded coach a certain number of hour it would be hard to show a satisfactory basis for such a establishment of toll we need not wonder at the unprofitableness of many of we road when we consider that the relative cost of transport be -- by stage one cent by railroad two and seven-twelfth and the relative charge -- by stage five cent by railroad three cent and the comparative profit as five less one to three less two and seven-twelfth or as _ four _ to _ five-twelfths _ or as _ nine and six-tenth to one _ america have it be true a grander system of natural water-communication than any other land except brazil but for all that there be really but a small part of the area either of the alleghany coal and iron field or of the granary of the mississippus valley reach even by we matchless river a certain strip or band of country border the water-course be serve by they both as regard export and import just as much be serve wherever we build a railroad in fact whenever we lay a road across a state whether it connect the west directly with the east or only with some central commercial point in the west just so often do we open to market a band of country as long as the road and thirty forty or fifty mile wide -- the width depend very much upon the cost of transport over such road and as the charge be much less upon a railroad than upon a common road the distance from the road from which produce may be bring be much greater with the former than with the latter the actual determination of the width of the band be a simple problem when the commercial nature of the country be know the people of the great valley have not be slow where nature have deny they the natural to make for themselves artificial river of iron these railroad be more completely adapt to the physical character of the western state than would be any other mode of communication the work of construction be oftentimes very light little more be necessary for a railway across the prairie of the west -lrb- generally -rrb- than a couple of ditch twenty or thirty foot apart the material take therefrom be throw into the intermediate space thus form the surface which support the crossty the sill or sleeper and the rail indeed the double operation of ditch and embank be in some case perform by a single machine -lrb- a nondescript affair in appearance half-way between a threshing-machine and a hundred-and-twenty-pound field-piece -rrb- draw by six eight or ten pair of ox it be even probable that in a great many case the common road would cost more than the railway in the great central basin of america as the rich alluvial soil when wet in spring or fall be almost impassable and lack of stone and timber prevent the construction of artificial road the influence of the railroad upon the western farm-land be quickly see by the follow figure extract from a lately publish work on railroad construction _ table show the effect of railroad transport upon the value of grain in the market of chicago illinois _ wheat corn carry by carry by carry by carry by railroad wagon railroad wagon at market $ 4950 4950 2560 2560 carry 10 m 4925 4800 2425 2326 do 50 m 4875 4200 2400 1725 do 100 m 4800 3450 2325 975 do 150 m 4725 2700 2250 225 do 200 m 4650 1950 2175 000 do 300 m 4500 450 2025 000 do 330 m 4455 000 1980 000 thus a ton of corn carry two hundred mile cost by wagon transport more than it bring at market -- while move by railroad it be worth $ 2175 also wheat will not bear wagon transport of 330 mile -- while move that distance by railroad it be worth $ 4455 per ton the social effect of railroad be see and feel by those who live in the neighborhood of large city the unhealthy density of population be prevent by enable man to live five ten or fifteen mile away from the city and yet do business therein the extent of this diffusion be as the square of the speed of transport to illustrate if a person walk four mile a hour and be allow one hour for pass from he home to he place of business he can live four mile from he work the area therefore which may be live in be the circle of which the radius be four mile the diameter eight mile and the area 501\/4 square mile if by horse he can go eight mile a hour the diameter of the circle become sixteen mile and the area 201 square mile finally if by railroad he go thirty mile a hour the diameter become sixty mile and the area 2827 square mile in the case of railroad as of other labor-saving -lrb- and labor-producing -rrb- contrivance the innovation have be loudly decry but though it do render some class of labor useless and throw out of employment some person it create new labor for more than the old and give much more than it take away twenty year of experience show that the diminish cost of transport by railroad invariably augment the amount of commerce transact and in a much larger ratio than the reduction of cost it be estimate by dr lardner that three hundred thousand horse work daily in stage would be require to perform the passenger-traffic alone which take place in england during the year 1848 regard the safety of railroad-travelling though the papers teem with awful calamity from collision and other cause yet so great be the number of person who use the new mode of transport that travel by railroad be really about one hundred time safer than by stage the mortality upon english road be for one year observe : -- one person kill for each sixty-five million transport in america for the same time one in forty-one million if we should try to reason from the rate of past railway-growth as to what the future be to be we should soon be lose in figure thus in the united state -- in 1829 there be 3 mile in 1830 41 mile in 1840 2167 mile in 1850 7355 mile in 1856 23242 mile thus from 1830 to 1840 the rate be as 2167\/41 or 53 nearly from 1840 to 1850 7355\/2167 or 3 nearly and from 1850 to 1856 23242 \/ 7355 or 3 nearly and from 1850 to 1860 we may suppose the rate will be about 4 the rate be probably now at its permanent maximum take the whole country together -- the increase in new england have nearly cease while west of the mississippus it have not reach its average among the larger and more important road and connect system in we country may be name the new york and erie railroad -- connect the city of new york with lake erie at dunkirk -lrb- and by the road 's diverge from its western terminus with all place west and south as the bill say -rrb- -- cross the shawangunk mountain through the valley of the neversink up the delaware down the susquehanna and through the rich west of the empire state the pennsylvanium central road : from philadelphium through lancaster to harrisburg on the susquehanna up the junia and down the western slope of the alleghany through rock-cut gallery and over numberless bridge reach at last the bluff where smoky pittsburg see the ohio start on its noble course the baltimore and ohio railroad : from baltimore in maryland to wheeling and parkersburg on the ohio -- cross the lowland to the washington junction thence up the patapsco down the monocacy to the potomac up to harper 's ferry where the potomac and the shenandoah chafe the rocky base of the romantic little town perch high above wind up the north branch to cumberland -- the terminus of the chesapeake and ohio canal and of the great national turnpike to the west for which will ' creek open so grand a gate at the narrow -- to piedmont the foot and altamont the summit through savage valley and crabtree gorge across the glade from which the water flow east to the chesapeake bay and west to the gulf of mexico down saltlick creek and up the slope of cheat river and laurel hill till river dwindle to creek creek to rill and rill lose themselves on the flank of mountain which bar the passage of everything except the railroad thence through tunnel of rock and tunnel of iron descend tygart 's valley to the monongahelum and thence through a varied but less rugged country to moundsville twelve mile below wheeling on the ohio river these be we three great road where engineering skill have triumph over natural obstacle we have another class of great line to which the obstacle be not so much mechanical as financial -- the physical difficulty be quite secondary such be the trunk line from the east to the west -- through buffalo erie and cleveland to toledo and detroit and from detroit to chicago rock island burlington quincy and st loui from pittsburg wheeling and parkersburg on the ohio to cleveland columbus cincinnatus indianapoli louisville and st loui and from cleveland through columbus to cincinnatus and from cincinnatus to the northwest in progress also may be notice road run west from st loui hannibal and burlington on the mississippus all tend towards some point in kansa from which the great pacific road the crowning effort of american railway-engineering may be suppose to take its departure for californium and oregon the chief point of difference between the english and the american engineer be that the former defy all opposition from river and mountain maintain he line straight and level fight nature at every point care neither for height nor depth rock nor torrent build he matchless road through the snowy wood of canada or over the sandy plain of egypt with as much unconcern as among the pleasant field of hertford or surrey and span with equal ease the thame the severn the st lawrence and the nile the word fail impossible can not be do he know not and when all other means of find a firm base whereon to build he bridge and viaduct fail he put in a foundation of golden guinea and silver dollar which always give success on the other hand the american engineer always respectful -lrb- though none the less determine -rrb- in the presence of natural obstacle to he progress bow politely to the oppose mountain-range and bowing pass around the base say as he look back you see friend we need have no hard feeling -- the world be large enough for thee and I to the broad-sweeping river he gently hint nearer you source you be not so big and as i turn out for the mountain why should i not for the river till mountain and river alike aghast at the bold pigmy look in silent wonder at the thunder train which shoulder aside granite hill and trample river beneath its foot but if nature corner he between rock heavenward pile on the one hand and roar torrent on the other whether to pass be require a bridge or a tunnel we find either or both design and build in a manner which can not be better he be well aware that the director like rather to see short column of figure on they treasurer 's book than to read record of great mechanical triumph in they engineer 's report of the whole expense of build a railroad where the country be to any considerable degree break the reduction of the natural surface to the required form for the road that be the earthwork or otherwise the excavation and embankment amount to from thirty to seventy per cent of the whole cost here then be certainly a important element on which the engineer be to show he ability let we look a little at it even at the risk of be dry it be by no means necessary to reduce the natural surface of the country to a level or horizontal line if it be so there would be a end to all railroad except on some of the western prairie this be not however at first know indeed those who be second to understand the matter deny the possibility of move a locomotive even on a level by apply power to the wheel because it be say the wheel would slip round on the smooth iron rail and the engine remain at rest but lo when the experiment be try it be find that the wheel not only have sufficient bite or adhesion upon the rail to prevent slip and give a forward motion to the engine but that a number of car might be attach and also move this point gain the objector advance a step but again come to a stand and say if you can move a train on a level that be all -- you can not go up hill but trial prove that easy incline -lrb- call grade -rrb- could be surmount -- say rise ten foot for each mile in length the objector take another step but again put down they heavy square-toed foot and say there be not you satisfied you can go over grade of twenty foot per mile but no more -- so do not try and here english engineer stop -- twenty foot be consider a pretty stiff grade meanwhile the american engineer whistler and latrobe the one deal with the berkshire mountain in massachusett the other with the alleghany in virginium find that not only be grade of ten and of twenty foot admissible but where nature require it incline of forty sixty eighty and even one hundred foot per mile -- it be only remember the while that just as the steepness of the grade be augmented the power must be increase this discovery when properly use be of immense advantage but in the hand of those who do not understand the nice relation which exist between the mechanical and the financial element of the question as govern by the speed and weight of train and by the fund at the company 's disposal be very liable to be a great injury to the prospects of a road or even its ruin it be urge at one time that the best road would have the grade undulate from one end to the other -- so that the momentum acquire in one descent would carry the train almost over the succeed ascent and that very little steam-power would be need this idea would have place at least to a certain extent if the whole momentum be allow to accumulate during the descent but even suppose there would be no danger from acquire so great a speed a mechanical difficulty be bring to light at once namely that the resistance of the atmosphere to the motion of the train increase nearly if not quite as the square of the speed so that after the train on the descent acquire a certain speed a regular motion be obtain by the balance of momentum and resistance -- whence a fall great enough to produce this regular speed would be advantageous but no more on the other hand the extra power require to draw the train up the grade much overbalance the gain by gravity in go down here then we have the two extreme : first spending more money than the expect traffic will warrant to cut down hill and fill up valley and second introduce grade so steep that the amount of traffic do not authorize the use of engine heavy enough to work they the direction of the traffic to a certain extent determine the rate and direction of the incline thus the reading railroad from philadelphium up the schuylkill to reading and thence to pottsville be employ entirely in the transport of coal from the lehigh coal-field to tide-water in philadelphium and it be a very economically operate road consider the large amount of ascent encounter because the load go down hill and the weight of the train be limit only by the number of empty car that the engine can take back this adoption of steep incline may be consider as a american idea entirely and to it many of we large road owe they success the western railroad of massachusett ascend from springfield to pittsfield for a part of the way at 83 foot per mile the new york and erie railroad have grade of 60 foot per mile the baltimore and ohio climb the alleghany on incline of 116 foot per mile the virginium central road cross the blue ridge by grade of 250 and 295 foot per mile and the ridge through which the kingwood tunnel be bore upon the baltimore and ohio railroad be surmount temporarily by grade of 500 foot per mile up which each single car be draw by a powerful locomotive another element of which american engineer have freely avail themselves be curvature more power be require to draw a train of car around a curved track than upon a straight line in england the radius of curvature be limit to half a mile or thereabout the english railway-carriage be place on three axle all of which be fix to the body of the vehicle the passage of curve of even a large diameter be thus attend by considerable wear and strain but in america the car which be much longer than those upon english road be place upon a pintle or pin at each end which pin be bear upon the center of a four-wheeled truck -- by which arrangement the wheel may conform to the line of the rail while the body of the car be unaffected this simple contrivance permit the use of curve which would otherwise be entirely impracticable thus we find curve of one thousand foot radius upon we road over which the train be run at very considerable speed while in one remarkable instance -lrb- on the virginium central railroad before name -rrb- we find the extreme minimum of 234 foot such a track do not admit of high speed and its very use imply the existence of natural obstacle which prevent the acquirement of great velocity in fine the use which the engineer make of grade and curve when the physical nature of the country and the nature and amount of the traffic expect be know may be take as a pretty sure index of he real professional standing and sometimes as a index of the moral man as when for example he steepen he grade to suit the contractor 's idea of mechanic -- in other word to save work not less in the construction of bridge and viaduct than in the preparation of the road-bed proper do the american engineering faculty display itself timber of the best quality may be find in almost every part of the country and nowhere in the world have the design and building of wooden bridge be carry to such perfection and such extent as in the united state we speak here of structure build by such engineer as haupt adam and latrobe -- and not of those work wretched alike in design and execution which so often become the cause of what be call terrible catastrophe and lamentable accident but which be in reality the just criticism of natural mechanical law upon the ignorance of pretended engineer among the finest specimen of timberwork in america be the cascade bridge upon the new york and erie railroad design and build by mr adam consist of one immense timber-arch have natural abutment in the rocky shore of the creek -- the second edition of the bridge generally upon the same road by mr mccallum which replace those originally build during the construction of the road -- these hardly need to be take down by other exertion than they own -- the bridge from one end to the other of the pennsylvanium central road by mr haupt -- the baltimore and ohio arch-brace bridge by mr latrobe -- and the genessee high bridge -lrb- not a bridge by the way but a trestle -rrb- near portageville by mr seymor which be eight hundred foot long and carry the road two hundred and thirty foot above the river have wooden trestle -lrb- post and brickwork -rrb- one hundred and ninety foot high seventy-five foot wide at base and twenty-five foot at top and carry above all a bridge fourteen foot high contain the timber of two hundred and fifty acre of land and sixty ton of iron bolt cost only $ 140000 and build in the short time of eighteen month this structure if replace by a earth embankment would cost half a million of dollar and could not be build in less than five year by the ordinary mode of proceeding -lrb- 2 -rrb- further the interest for so long a time on the large amount of money require to build the embankment at the high rate of railroad interest would nearly if not quite suffice to build the wooden structure again we wooden bridge of the average span cost about thirty-five dollar per lineal foot let we compare this with the cost of iron bridge on the english tubular plan the span be the same and the pier therefore leave out of the comparison suppose that a road have in all one mile in length of bridge make due allowance for the difference in value of labor in england and america the cost per lineal foot of the iron tubular bridge could not be less -lrb- for the average span of 150 foot -rrb- than three hundred dollar 5280 foot by $ 35 be $ 18480000 5280 foot by 300 be $ 158400000 the six per cent interest on the first be $ 1108800 the six per cent interest on the second be $ 9504000 and the difference be $ 8395200 or nearly enough to rebuild the wooden bridge once in two year and ten year be the shortest time that a good wooden bridge should last the reader may wonder why such structure as the bridge over the susquehanna at columbium which consist of twenty-nine arch each two hundred foot span the whole water-way be a mile long and many other bridge span large river and have a impose appearance be not refer to in this place the reason be this : _ large _ bridge be by no mean always _ great _ bridge nor do they require as some seem to think skill proportion to they length there be many structure of this kind in america of twenty twenty-five or thirty span where the same mechanical blunder be repeat over and over again in each span so that the longer they be and the more they cost the worse they be it do not follow because newspaper say magnificent bridge two million foot of timber eighty or one hundred ton of iron cost half a million that there be any merit about either the bridge or its builder as one span be so be the whole and a bridge fifty foot long and cost only a few hundred may show more engineering skill than the largest and most costly viaduct in america few bridge require more knowledge of mechanic and of material than mr haupt 's little trussed girder on the pennsylvanium central road -- consist of a single piece of timber truss with a single rod under each rail of the track again as regard american iron bridge the same result be find to a great extent thus mr roeble 's niagara railroad suspension-bridge cost four hundred thousand dollar while a boiler-plate iron bridge upon the tubular system would cost for the same span about four million dollar even if it be practicable to raise a tubular bridge in one piece over niagara river at the site of the suspension bridge strength and durability _ with the utmost economy _ seem to have be attain by mr wendel bollman superintendent of the road-department of the baltimore and ohio railroad -- the minute detail of construction be so skilfully arrange that change of temperature oftentimes so fatal to bridge of metal have no hurtful effect whatever and here again be see the distinctive american feature of adaptation or accommodation even in the smallest detail mr bollman do not get savage and say monsieur heat and cold i can get iron enough out of the alleghany to resist all the power you can bring against I -- but only observe go on heat and cold i be not go to deal directly with you but indirectly by means of a agent which will render harmless you most violent effort -- or in other word he interpose a short link of iron between the principal member of he bridge which absorb entirely all undue strain it be not to be suppose from what have precede that the american engineer do not know how to spend money because he get along with so little and accomplish so much when occasion require he be lavish of he dollar and see no longer expense but only the object to be accomplished witness for example the kingwood tunnel on the baltimore and ohio railroad where for a great distance the lining or protect arch inside be of heavy rib of cast iron -- make the cost of that mile of road embrace the tunnel about a million of dollar nor will the traveller who observe the construction of the new york and erie railroad up the delaware valley of the pennsylvanium central down the west slope of the alleghany or of the baltimore and ohio down the slope of cheat river think for a moment that the american engineer grudge money where it be really need stone bridge so rarely occur upon the road of america that they hardly need remark the starucca viaduct by mr adam upon the new york and erie railroad and the viaduct over the patapsco near the junction of the washington branch with the main stem of the baltimore and ohio railroad show that we engineer be not at all behind those of europe in this branch of engineering from the civil let we pass to the mechanical department of railroad engineering this latter embrace all the machinery both fix and roll locomotive and car come under the latter -- and the shop-machine lathe planer and boring-machine forge cut punch rolling and shear engine pump and pumping-engine for the water-station turn-table and the like under the former of this branch little except the design and working of the locomotive power need to be mention as affect the prosperity of the road machine-shops engine-house and such apparatus differ but slightly upon different road but the form and dimension of the locomotive engine should depend upon the nature of the traffic and upon the physical character of the road and that most intimately -- so much indeed that the adjustment of the grade and curvature must determine the power form and whole construction of the engine this be a fact but little appreciate by the manager of we road when the engineer have complete the road-bed proper include the bridge and masonry he be consider as do with and as the succeed superintendent of machinery be not at that time generally appoint the duty of obtain the necessary locomotive power devolve upon the president or contractor or some other person who know nothing whatever of the requirement of the road and as he generally go to some particular friend perhaps even a associate he of course take such a pattern of engine as the latter build -- and the consequence be that not one out of fifty of we road have steam-power in any way adapt to the duty it be call upon to perform there be no nicer problem connect with the establishment of a railroad than have give the grade the nature of the traffic and the fuel to be use to obtain therefrom by pure mechanical and chemical law the dimension complete for the locomotive which shall effect the transport of train in the most economical manner and there be no problem that until quite lately have be more totally neglect -lrb- 3 -rrb- of the whole cost of work a railroad about one third be chargeable to the locomotive department from which it be plain that the most proper adaptation be well worth the careful attention of the engineer though it be generally consider that the proper person to select the locomotive power can be none other than a practical machinist and though he would doubtless select the best workmanship yet if not acquaint with the general principle of locomotion and aware of the character of the road and of the expect traffic and able to judge -lrb- not by so-called experience but by real knowledge -rrb- he may get machinery totally unfit for the work require of it indeed american civil engineer ought to qualify themselves to equip the road they build for none other be so well acquaint with the road as those who from a thorough knowledge of the matter have establish the grade and the curvature the difference between adaptation and non-adaptation will plainly be see by the comparison below the railway from boston to albany may be divide into four section of which the several length and corresponding maximum grade be as tabulated length in mile steepest grade boston to worcester 44 30 worcester to springfield 541\/2 50 springfield to pittsfield 52 83 pittsfield to albany 431\/2 45 a load of five hundred ton upon a grade of thirty foot per mile require of the locomotive a drawing-power of 11500 lb upon a 50 foot grade 15500 lb upon a 83 foot grade 22500 lb upon a 45 foot grade 14500 lb now if the engine be all alike -lrb- as they be very nearly -rrb- and each be able to exert a drawing-power of five thousand pound to move a load of five hundred ton from boston to albany we need as follow : b to w -- 11500\/5000 or 2 engine w to s -- 15500\/5000 or 3 engine s to p -- 22500\/5000 or 5 engine p to a -- 14500\/5000 or 3 engine from which the whole number of mile run by engine for one whole trip would be -- b to w 44 mile by 2 engine or 88 w to s 541\/2 mile by 3 engine or 1631\/2 s to p 52 mile by 5 engine or 260 p to a 491\/2 mile by 3 engine or 1481\/2 ______ and the sum 660 now suppose that by make the engine for the several division strong in proportion to the resistance encounter upon these division one engine only be employ upon each we mileage become b to w 44 by 1 or 44 w to s 541\/2 by 1 or 541\/2 s to p 52 by 1 or 52 p to a 49 by 1 or 491\/2 _____ and the sum 200 mile and the saving of mile run be therefore 660 less 200 or 460 and if 500 ton pass over the road daily the annual saving of mileage become 460 by 313 or 143980 or 70 per cent of the whole the actual cost for freight-locomotive per ton per mile run during the year end sept 30 1855 be 384\/1000 of a cent and the above 143980 mile save multiply by this fraction amount to $ 55288 per annum the actual expense of work the power will not of course show the whole 70 per cent of save as heavy and strong engine cost more at first and cost more to operate than lighter one but the figure show the effect of correct adaptation if we call the saving 50 per cent only of the mileage we have then -lrb- as the locomotive power consume 30\/100 of the whole cost of operating -rrb- 50\/100 of 30\/100 or 15\/100 of the whole cost of work the road and this by simply know how to adapt the machinery to the requirement so very slight be the point of difference between a good and a bad engine that they often escape the eye of those whose business it be to deal with such work it be not the brass and steel and bright metal and elaborate painting that make the really good and serviceable engine -- but the length breadth and depth of its furnace the knowledge of proportion show in its design and the mechanical skill exhibit in the fitting of its part the apparently complex portion be really very simple in action while the apparently simple part be those where the greatest knowledge be require any man of ordinary mechanical acquirement can design and arrange the general form -- the whole mass of crank piston connecting-rods pump and the various lever for work the engine but to find the correct dimension of the inner part of the boiler and of the valve-gearing by which the movement of the steam be govern require a very considerable knowledge of the chemistry of combustion of practical geometry and of the physical property of steam so nice indeed be the valve-adjustment of the locomotive as depend upon the work it have to do whether fast or slow light or heavy that a single eighth of a inch too much or too little will so affect its power as to entirely unfit it for do its duty with any degree of economy when a single man take the general charge of five hundred mile of railroad upon which the annual pay-roll be a million of dollar and which employ over two hundred locomotive and three thousand car earn five million dollar a year -- a road which cost thirty-three million have five mile in length of bridge and over four hundred building -- it be plain that the system of operation must be somewhat elaborate and so it be indeed so complete be the organization and management of _ employées _ upon the new york and erie railroad that the general superintendent at he office can at any moment tell within a mile where each car or engine be what it be do the contents of the car the consignor and consignee the time at which it arrive and leave each station -lrb- the _ actual _ time not the time when it _ should _ arrive -rrb- and be thus able to correct all error almost at the moment of commission and in reality to completely control the road the great regulator upon long line of railroad be the electric telegraph which connect all part of the road and enable one person to keep as it be he eye on the whole road at once a single-track railroad say mr mccallum may be render more safe and efficient by a proper use of the telegraph than a double-track railroad without -- as the double-tracks commonly obviate collision which occur between train move in _ opposite _ direction whilst the telegraph may be use effectually in prevent they between train move either in _ opposite _ direction or in the _ same _ direction and it be a well-established fact deduce from the history of railroad both in europe and in this country that collision from train move in the _ same _ direction have prove by far the most fatal and disastrous and should be the most carefully guard against from the admirable report of mr mccallum above refer to we take the following : -- collision between fast and slow train move in the same direction be prevent by the follow rule : ` the conductor of a slow train will report himself to the superintendent of division immediately on arrival at a station where by the time-table he should be overtake by a faster train and he shall not leave that station until the fast train pass without special order from the superintendent of division ' a slow train under such circumstance may at the discretion of the division superintendent be direct to proceed he be fully apprise of the position of the delay train can readily form a opinion as to the propriety of do so and thus while the delay train be permit to run without regard to the slow one the latter can be keep entirely out of its way the passing-place for train be fix and determine with order positive and define that neither shall proceed beyond that point until after the arrival of the other whereas in the absence of the telegraph conductor be govern by general rule and they individual understanding of the same -- which rule be generally to the effect that in case of detention the train arrive first at the regular passing-place shall after wait a few moment _ proceed cautiously _ -lrb- expect to meet the other train which be generally run as much faster to make up lose time as the cautious train be slower -rrb- until they have meet and pass the one fail to reach the half-way point between station be require to back -- a dangerous expedient always -- a example of which operation be furnish at the disaster on the camden and amboy railroad near burlington the delay train further be subject to the same rule in regard to all other train of the same class it may meet thus pursue its hazardous and uncertain progress during the entire trip the follow table show the rate and direction of subordination for a first-class railroad :

immediate superior only _ each officer must have authority with the approval of the general superintendent to appoint all _ employee _ for whose act he be responsible and to dismiss any one when in he judgment the interest of the company demand it fast travel be one of the most dangerous as well as one of the most expensive luxury connect with the railroad system few company in america have any idea what they express-train cost they indeed the proper means of obtain quick transport be not at all understand it be not by force the train at a excessively high speed but by reduce the number of stop a train run four hundred mile and stop once in fifty minute -- each stop include come to rest and start be five minute -- to pass over the whole distance in eight hour must run fifty-five mile per hour stop once in twenty minute sixty-three mile per hour and stop once in ten minute eighty-six mile per hour the proportion in which the working expense be distribute under the several head be nearly as follow : -- management 7 road-repair 16 locomotive 35 car 38 sundry 4 ____ in all 100 and the percentage of increase due to fast travel to be apply to the several item of expense with the result increase in total expense this : -- management 7 increase by 0 per cent be 00 road-repair 16 do 27 do 43 locomotive 35 do 30 do 105 car 38 do 10 do 38 sundry 4 do 0 do 00 ____ ____ 100 and the whole increase 186 the cause of accident beyond the control of passenger be -- collision by opposition collision by overtake derailment by switch misplace derailment by obstacle on the track breakage of machinery failure of bridge fire explosion those cause which be aggravate by fast travel be the first second fifth and sixth the effect of all be worse at high than at low velocity the proportion of accident due to each of these cause take at random from one hundred case on english road -lrb- american report do not detail such information with accuracy -rrb- be -- collision 56 56 breakage of machinery 18 18 failure of road 14 14 misplace switch 5 obstacle on rail 6 boiler explosion 1 __ ___ 88 100 eighty-eight per cent be from those cause which be aggravate by increase of speed and if we suppose the amount of aggravation to augment as the speed the danger of travel be eighty-eight per cent greater by a fast than by a slow train these be the direct evil of high speed there be also indirect evil which be full as bad all train in motion at the same time within a certain distance of the express must be keep wait with steam up or drive at extra velocity to keep out of the way where the time-table be so arrange as to call for speed nearly equal to the full capacity of the engine it be very obvious that the risk of failure in make time must be much greater than at reduce rate and when they do occur the effort make to gain the time must be correspondingly greater and uncertain a single example will be sufficient to show this a train whose prescribe rate of speed be thirty mile per hour have lose five minute of time and be require to gain it in order to meet and pass a oppose train at a station ten mile distant must necessarily increase its speed to forty mile per hour and a train whose prescribe rate of speed be forty mile per hour under similar circumstance must increase its speed to sixty mile per hour in the former case it would probably be accomplish whilst in the latter it would more probably result in failure -- or if successful it would be so at fearful risk of accident however true it may be that many of we large road be well some of they admirably manage it be none the less a fact that the greater portion be direct in a manner far from satisfactory -- many indeed be subject to the combined influence of ignorance and recklessness many people wonder at the bad financial state of the american railroad the wonder be to those who understand the way in which they be manage that they should be worth anything at all it be useless to disguise the fact say a writer in one of we railroad-papers that the great body of we railroad-director be entirely unfit for they position they be personally a very respectable class of man -lrb- schuylerism and tuckermanism except -rrb- -- man who after have pass through they active business-life successfully and after retirement be in the mind of some eminently fit to adorn a director 's chair never be there a greater mistake what be want for a railway-director be a active clear-headed man who have not outlive he term of activity we want railway-director who know how to reduce the operating-expense per mile and not man who oppose they bigoted ignorance to everything like change or improvement who can see no difference between science and abstract idea it would seem that the only question to be ask with regard to the fitness of a man for be a director be -- be he rich and respectable if he have these quality and be pretty stupid withal he be in a fair line for election we tell we railway-reader that if they desire to make they property valuable and rescue it from become a byword and a reproach they have get to elect man of a entirely different stamp -- man of practical experience in the best sense of the term who have intelligence enough to know and apply all those vital reform upon which depend the future success of they undertaking -- the man of the workshop the track and the locomotive and we shall yet see the more intelligent of they take the place at the director ' board of the retire merchant physician and other respectable gentleman who now lend only the name of they respectability to perpetuate a system of folly that have reduce we railroad-management below contempt as at present constitute we board be a very showy but very useless piece of mechanism the member attend at meeting when they feel just like it and sign they name to document and statement which have be prepare for they by other without much knowledge of what the contents be they other duty consist chiefly in ride over they own and connect road free of charge why should railway-director work for nothing for the stockholder ah messr stockholder you little know in reality how fat a salary you director make to themselves by nice little commission by patronize they favorite builder of locomotive and car and by buy the thousand and one patent that be so urgently recommend do you carry you broken watch to a blacksmith or to a stone-mason to be mend neither we think why then do you leave the management of a work which engineer machinist carpenter mason and man of almost every trade have spend time and care upon to build to the respectable merchant lawyer or banker who think the best road that which have the softest cushion and the most comfortable seat on which to ride railroad-building remark a late writer -lrb- mr whiton -rrb- may be divide into three period -- the first the _ introductory _ in which road be a sort of experimental enterprise where the man who labor expect to be pay for they time or money and be willing to wait a reasonable time for the expected profit second the _ speculative _ period when man be possess with a unhealthy desire for fortune-making and not content to wait the natural harvest of the seed sown depart from the sound and honest principle of construction and management try at first by all sort of pretence and misrepresentation to conceal and last by legislation to counterbalance the result of they ignorance and of they insane desire railroad be compare as a investment to bank and it be even suppose that the more they cost the more they would divide and tunnel rock-cut and viaduct be then as much seek after as they be now avoid shrewd and intelligent business-man who have make for themselves fortune embrace these ridiculous opinion and seem at once upon take hold of railroad-enterprise to lose whatever of common sense they before might have possess and even at the present day these same man have not the manly honesty to acknowledge they error but endeavor to cover they up with greater -- the third period be that of _ reaction _ which embrace the present time to a person unacquainted with the management of railroad to see a body of man no one of whom have ever before have anything to do with mechanical operation assemble to decide upon the relative merit of the different plan of bridge or of locomotive or car upon the best means of reduce the working-expense of a machine of whose component part they have not the slightest idea of the most complicated and elaborate piece of mechanism that man have ever design might at first seem absurd but custom have make it right it be generally suppose that the moment a man be he lawyer doctor or merchant be choose director in a railroad enterprise immediately he become possess of all knowledge of mechanic finance and commerce but judge from past experience it appear in reality that he leave behind at such time whatever common sense he perchance possess before otherwise why do he not follow the same correct business-rule when manage the property of other as when he accumulate he own a man who should show as much carelessness and ignorance when operate for himself as railway-director do when operate for other would be consider as a fit subject for a insane asylum when railroad be build where they be need at the time they be want in a country able to support they by permanent investor and not by speculator and be well make by good engineer and well manage by competent man whose interest be really connect with the success of the enterprise then they will pay and be railroad indeed but so long as money be obtain on false pretence to be play for by state and wall street gambler on the one hand and ravenous contractor on the other hand they will be what they be -- worthless monument of extravagance and folly experience keep a dear school say poor richard but fool will learn in no other let not the reader think for a single moment that we have no appreciation of the labor of a de witt clinton or of a livingston -- that we at all underrate the service of the eastern capitalist who render available the public-land grant of the west whether to build ship-canal or railroad we have the highest respect for that talent without which we western land would still be leave to the buffalo and the deer and the gold and silver of europe would remain on the other side of the atlantic these capitalist be the mainspring of the system but we should no more apply they energy and skill to the detailed operation of so mechanical a structure as a railroad than we should attach the mainspring of a watch to the hand directly without the intermediate connect chain and wheel not less incompetent for the construction of railway than be the director for the management of the complete road be at least one half of the so-called engineer in america oblige to complete no course of education to pass no examination they be at once let loose upon the country whenever they feel like it to build what go by the name of railroad and bridge but be in reality trap in which to lose both life and money indeed any man -lrb- in the united state -rrb- who have carry a rod or chain be call a engineer while the correct definition be a man who have first a thorough knowledge of mechanic mathematics and chemistry -- second the knowledge necessary for apply these science to the art -- and last the knowledge requisite to the correct adaptation of such art to the want of man but more than all that experience which be get only from continual practice we have such a class of engineer and to they we owe what of fame we have in the engineering world second come another grade man who commence as subordinate without any preparatory knowledge but with natural genius and a intuitive knowledge of mechanic need only to have they idea generalize to see the bearing of they special knowledge upon the whole in order to rank high in the profession third a class who lack both natural and acquire knowledge and whose only recommendation be that they be always for sale to the highest bidder whether he be president director or contractor sometimes work nominally for the company but really for the contractor -- or in some case so debased be this class of person for both contractor and company openly of late year this prostitution of mongrel engineer have have place to a alarming extent let we hope that the old professional pride and better still a love of truth and honesty for they own sake may yet triumph and place real engineer high above the dead level to which ignorance and pretence and venality have degrade the profession -lrb- footnote 1 : _ handbook of railroad construction _ for the use of american

in view of what she have do but she be resolve and calm it be everything to she that night when she lay down to rest to know that the same roof that cover she be also spread above the prisoner and all the joy of youth pass into forgetfulness as she think and vow to herself concern the future it seem perhaps a state of thing involve no consequence this sympathy that elizabeth have share with the gardener sandy when the prisoner 's eye gaze on they from he window or turn towards they while he walk in the garden but sandy say to himself when she tell he that they be to have laval 's place in the prison _ it take she _ -- neither do it seem incredible to he when she assure he that the new house be like home he honestly believe that with the child -- child he consider she -- all thing be possible what he have lack and miss so long that the restoration have a charm of novelty about it add to its own excellency be now the prisoner 's portion good manners kind and courteous voice greet eye and ear once more as in the day of joan laval a woman be now sometimes in attendance on the prisoner but in not one particular do pauline montier resemble joan laval she call herself a soldier 's wife and be exact and brave accordingly she be thoughtful of she husband 's charge and when she pause in she effort for he comfort and content it be because she have exhaust the means within she reach but not she wit in devise the effect be soon manifest the prisoner receive this care and sympathy as he might have receive the ministration of angel the attendance be almost entirely confine to montier and he wife but now and then elizabeth also could serve he she serve he with she heart with unobtrusive zeal that be exhaustless as the zeal of love unobserved she watch as well as wait on he and oh how jealous and impatient of time and authority do she become she pity know no limit it beam from she eye speak through she voice be unceasing in activity he be to she a romance terrible and sweet a romance that have more abundant fascination than the world could show beside she go up to he room one morning carry he breakfast she father have be order to the barracks and she mother be not well the service therefore fall upon she the prisoner do not seem to heed she when she enter at least he give no sign until she approach he and even then be not the first to speak go to the window she eye follow he to the garden below it look well this morning she say pleasantly yes -- but i have see prettier he answer where she ask so quickly that manuel almost smile as he look at she before he answer he know why she speak thus and be not offend by the compassion of she sympathy in my own home elizabeth he answer be not you _ ever _ go back to it sir she ask hurriedly he do not reply will not you ever see it again she persist banishment -- a prisoner for life say he for the first time explain to any person he dread sentence elizabeth montier quietly ponder the word thus speak if you have you freedom say she would you go back to you own country -- you breakfast be cool sir manuel look at she -- she bear he scrutiny with composure -- then he come to the table sit down and break he bread before he answer this bold speaking yes say he at length a honorable man be bind to keep he honor clean mine have be blacken by some false accusation i owe it to all who ever believe in I to clear it if i can and besides you home be there yes oh if you would only tell I about it i do not want to know for anybody else -- only for you do you leave many behind that -- that loved you mr manuel yes say the prisoner -- but he say no more this answer be sufficient with it elizabeth walk away from the table where he sit and take she stand by the window by-and-by she say speaking low but with firm accent -- i be sorry i ask you anything about it but i will never speak of it again i hear it be for religion but i know you could not hurt the truth they say you fight against the church then i believe the church be wrong i be not afraid to say it i want you to understand of course i can not do anything for you only i be so in hope that i could you must not be angry with I sir for hope that the integrity of nature that speak in these word come to the hearer 's heart with wondrous power and freshness he look at elizabeth she be gaze full on he and lofty be the bearing of the girl she have set she own fear and all danger and suspicion at defiance in these word partly he see and understand and he answer -- i be not angry you surprise I i know you be not curious on you own account but you can do nothing for I i do fight against the church but not any church that you know i fight against a intolerant organization boundless superstition shameful idolatry because it be make a slave and a criminal of the world -- you can do nothing for I nothing no dear child nothing be it because you think i be a child that you say so asked elizabeth i be not a child i know you must be innocent i will do anything for you that any one can do try I the prisoner look again at the pleader truly she be not a child it be not in childhood to be nerve by such courage and such longing as be in she speech as that speech be endorse by she bear he thought toward she seem to change in this look can you write elizabeth ask he i can write she answer proudly stand forward like a young brave eager for order i can write my father teach I you might write -- a letter she ask breathless yes he pause and consider then continue -- you might write to -- you might write to my friend and tell she about the garden and how i be now allow to walk in it -- and about you father and you mother -- about yourself too anything that will make this place seem pleasant to she you know the pleasant side of foray -- give she that yes be she you mother no you sister sir no elizabeth she and i be to have be marry oh sir -- and you in foray -- in a prison -- so far away wide apart as death could put we and shall i let you write to she yes we will triumph over this death and this grave by I -- yes -- i will tell she -- it shall surely be by I say elizabeth in a low voice then tell she -- you will be able i know to think of a great deal that be comforting i should not remember it i be afraid if i could write the letter tell she what fine music i have you can say something too about the garden as i say you can speak of the view from this window see it be very fine you can tell she -- yes you can tell she now that i be well elizabeth oh sir can i tell she you be well yes -- yes -- say so besides it be true but you must add that i have no hope now of we meeting in this world she can bear it for she be strong like you she too be a soldier 's daughter if you will say those thing i will tell you she name that shall be we secret in this speech he tone be altogether that of one who take the place of a comforter yes say elizabeth calm and attentive it be quite impossible that she should so mistake as to allow the knowledge that be quicken she perception into pain to appear you must tell she about yourself say he again what shall i say there be nothing about myself to tell mr manuel be there not that would be strange tell she what music you like best to hear you father play she will understand you by that tell she anything -- she will not call it a trifle what if she answer you in the same mood should we call it foolish if she tell we she thought and the event that take place daily in she quiet life you can tell she what song you love to sing and if she do not know they she will learn they elizabeth tell she how much it comfort I to hear you sing tell she that if she have pray some light might shine on I from heaven she prayer be answer for it be true you serve I like a angel and i see it all tell she she must love you for my sake -- though there be no need to tell she -- do you see i see tell she i remember -- there he falter he could say no more yes say elizabeth i will -- i will tell she everything mr manuel -- everything that it would comfort she to hear she have write letter now and then great pride montier and pauline take in they daughter 's skilful use of pen and ink and pencil -- for elizabeth could sketch as well as write there be nothing new or strange therefore in she address this conversation to a spirit but also there be nothing easy in this task though she have the mighty theme of faithful love to dwell upon and love 's wondrous inspiration to enlighten she labor the description to be give of island scenery be such as she have give more than once in write to she distant unknown relative she need vary only slightly from what she have write before when she give report of she own daily life she be always eloquent when talk about the flower or she father 's music but this she have undertake be not a repetition of what she have do before with painful anxiety she scrutinize she word she thought she feeling the work be a labor of love the loving best know what anguish they labor sometimes cost they the pain of this letter be not fairly understand by she who endure it -- it could not be share why be she so cautious why in she caution lurk so much of fear perhaps she might have answer if question by one she trust that further intrusion of herself than should serve as a veil for the really important information she have to convey would be cruel intrusion but there be a very different reason it have to do with the sudden revelation make to herself when she father weep at the prisoner 's hard fate -- a revelation that terrify she and influence every succeed movement it have to do with the illumination that come when manuel tell she the sad secret of he heart -- with that moment when she stand up stronger in love than in fear stronger in devotion than in pride strong for self-sacrifice like one who bear a charmed life pierce to the heart and never so capable as then more than once do elizabeth rewrite that letter more than once in the progress to its completion do she break away from the strange task that have evidence of strangeness or of labor to seek in the garden or with she needle or in the society of father or mother deliverance from the trouble that disturb she in the toil of many a argument with she heart and conscience be she catch but even through she doubting of the work she have engage to perform she persevere in its continuance till the letter be ready for address it be surely right to aid and comfort by such aid one so unfortunate as this prisoner yet she parent must not be implicate by such transaction therefore they must be keep in ignorance that if blame fall anywhere it might not fall on they so she satisfy she conscience -- love will not calculate coldly but it be less easy to satisfy she heart she have live but sixteen year she look to she youth as to a protector while it rebuke she she lean upon it while daily she take to herself the part of womanhood its duty and its dignity he have call she a child she call herself a child she be careful to let this estimate of herself appear in that letter and in what she undertake she be entirely successful madeline desperier would be sure to read it as the letter of a child when all be do elizabeth repeat to manuel the substance of this letter he praise it jealous scrutiny would find it difficult to lay its finger on a passage and condemn the writer for evade the law concern the prisoner when she sign and seal the letter address it and carry it away with she to mail he be satisfied he praise be sweet to the girl who have earn it no sooner be this work off she hand than another engage she with a purpose prompt may-be by she angel certainly by no human word and unshared by any human intelligence elizabeth begin to make a sketch of the island as see from manuel 's prison-window she make the sketch from memory correct it by observation when occasion call she to the prisoner 's room at length she bring the sheet of paper on which this sketch be draw to manuel and lay it before he she do this without any accompany word of explanation in the foreground be the garden stretch up the slope of the hill towards the top where the fort-wall begin beyond fort barracks settlement -- and still beyond the sea the island of foray as thus represent appear like many other view on paper very please and attractive nature be not responsible for sin and suffer that she should veil she glory wherever these may choose to pitch they tent the prisoner take the drawing from the table where she have lay it and scan it closely you have leave out my house say he there be no room for it she answer true he understand she do you know whom this be for mr manuel whom be it for elizabeth for madeline be it a pretty view really for she elizabeth surely she eye shall look on the same view as yours the fort flag sea-wall burial-ground ocean barracks garden -- it be well do -- now i will tell you of the place where it will find she he pause a moment ere he begin that description he look at the quiet figure of the child for whom he dare recall the past she stand with fold hand so fair so young the sight be a refreshment and a strange assurance always to he weary eye and weary heart never do she look so lovely to he as now when he be about to speak again to she of he life 's love for another it be once a magnificent estate he begin oh be she a grand lady break from elizabeth yes a grand lady you speak well reply manuel with a smile the estate be once ten time as large as this island town and village be build over the land now but the old house stand as it have stand through ten generation there she live if she stand by the library-window today she can see the church build by she great-grandfather and the little town of desperier which have in he day a population of tenantry she can see the pond and the park and a garden where there be hothouse and grapery and conservatory and wind walk where you might walk all day and find something new to surprise and delight you at every turn there be a tower that command a view of fifty mile in one direction the old house be full of treasure she be mistress of all -- the only representative of a long line of noble man and beautiful woman who have dispense magnificent hospitality there the last time i see she elizabeth she be stand in the library a woman so beautiful and so strong you would not have think that trouble could approach she it come through I i open those ancient gate for the black train -- i who love no mortal as i love she but i lose she in my fight for truth shall i complain she heart be with mine in that struggle can not truth comfort she she be not lose to you sir -- you be not lose to she cried elizabeth in a voice as strong as break sometimes through die agony i know say he more gently he thought be not the same as hers he be take refuge in that future which remain to the loving when this life wholly fail in hope you shall go back to that old place sir you shall -- you two -- shall forget all this the prisoner smile to hear she -- a sad smile yet a sweet smile too he do not despise the comfort she would give he nor resent she presumptuous speech as when i dream sometimes say he gently -- or in some pleasant vision yes that be true elizabeth i have be back and i shall go again vehemently now she break forth it be love defy the whole universe if the whole universe oppose itself to the sovereign rights of love the divine strength and the divine courage of love -- you shall go on board some vessel a passenger you shall see with you own eye you hand shall be free to gather the sweetest rise that -- ever blossom in the world for you mr manuel do not look so doubt -- do not smile so be i not in earnest do you not hear I as god life and as i live i will do what i promise why what do you think i be here for wonder doubt if he hear aright manuel look at elizabeth the painful kindly smile the incredulity have disappear from he face the power and confidence of she word seem to persuade he that at least she purpose seriously and be not utter mere wish it might be the enthusiasm and generosity of a child that inspire she speech but its determination and gravity of utterance demand at least a respectful hearing what do you mean elizabeth he ask i mean that i will go home and explain and you shall be set free he shake he head there be nothing to be explain say he i be not here by mistake i be very clearly guilty if there be guilt in do what i be accuse of the heart of those who condemn I must be change and they eye open or i shall never be set free god choose humble agent she say humbly david slew goliath and he be but a lad he will open the way for I and by I change the heart of those who condemn and by I open they eye therefore i shall go -- i shall surely go ah mr manuel give I the picture it be all that you shall have of the island of foray please almighty god when these door be all open for you and you hand be free sir and we tell you to come for the vessel be wait she go out from the room while these word take solemn possession of the place she lock the door behind she -- no requirement of law be to be neglect or withstand she make he a prisoner whom she would set free -- and from this interview she go away not to solitude and the formation of secret plan but as become the daughter of adolphus and pauline montier she go quietly with that repose of manner which distinguish she through almost every event back to she mother 's chamber there stand adolphus montier drummer to the regiment jailer to the prisoner father of elizabeth -- loving man whichever way you look at he he have he french horn in he hand and be about to raise it to he lip in a moment more a blast would have ring through the house for adolphus be in one of he tempestuously happy mood but he daughter 's entrance arrest he purpose say rather the expression of she face perform that feat he see likewise the paper which she carry the pencil sketch -- and he follow she with he eye when she cross the room and place it on the mantel under the engraving of the city of fatherland this act take the parent to the fireplace for discussion and criticism of they daughter 's work and of the two home now bring into contrast connection but you have leave out the prison be the comment of adolphus i be glad of that say pauline but it be part of the island it ought to be leave out though maintain he wife where would you keep _ he _ then ask adolphus a broad smile spreading over he face he know well enough what the answer would be i would set he adrift be pauline 's reply speak without the least pretence of caution hush say she husband but that be because he be the jailer he laugh outright close on this admonition and ask elizabeth if she expect he to make a frame for this picture to hang opposite chalon no she answer i be go to take it with I where now ask the parent in one breath oh home -- chalon this reply seem to merit some consideration by the way the eye of adolphus and pauline regard they child they do not understand she -- she meaning be deeper than she utterance to chalon repeat adolphus quietly home say pauline -- it be almost the sweetest word she know almost the easiest of utterance you have promise I a hundred time that i should go do you mean it may i go you wish I to see the old place and the old people but the old place be change and the old people be die soon if i go to chalon it will not be you chalon i shall see dumb with wonder adolphus and pauline look at one another to be sure they have do they best in order to excite in the breast of elizabeth such love of country as be worthy of they child and such curiosity about locality as would constrain she to cherish some reverent regard for the place of they birth the home of they youthful love but _ never _ have they imagine the possibility of she project a pilgrimage in that direction except under they guidance they could hardly imagine it now often they have talk over every step of that journey they would one day make together the progress be as familiar to elizabeth as it could be make by the description of another but that they have succeed in so awake the feeling of they child that she should seriously propose make the pilgrimage alone pass they comprehension you know say adolphus with a shrug you father be a officer and he can not now leave he post be you go to take you mother along with you he say these word at a venture not certain of he ground he be not keep in suspense long my mother must not leave you answer elizabeth greatly agitate and yet speak strongly as one whose will exceed she emotion then you go alone ask adolphus shortly he could not understand she and be thoroughly vex that he could not mystery be not for he what be the matter be it the prison wife he turn to pauline but as he look at she he perplexity seem to increase as do he impatience also wife and daughter evidently be not in league against he she the mother of he child share he anxiety and doubt tear be in she eye and he have only be impatient -- she have pass so quickly to a apprehension that be grievous adolphus stand the image of dismay those three so entirely one seem to have be thrust apart by a resistless evil fate who have some malignant purpose to serve not now for the first time do pauline see that the young face before she be pale and grave with a gravity once unknown to it it might be that for the first time she be ask herself outright if this prison-life be to serve elizabeth as it have serve the wife of laval -- but not for the first time be she now visit by a foreboding that point to this fear it be the prison say she elizabeth be it so be this house go to be the death of you ask montier abruptly -- refer the point with stern authority to the last person who would be likely to acknowledge the danger of which he speak if you think _ so _ papa and mamma i must give up the voyage just to prove that you be mistaken answer she look at she adolphus say pauline remember what she be a year ago she be not the same now i can see it strange if i could not young people be different from old i think this place would never seem like home to I but i find out my mistake i know you would say adolphus quickly of course it be the place for I on the prisoner 's account i hate the prison just the same though but if i be mistake so be elizabeth she think it would seem like home to she -- it never have it never will but i do not think there be a chance of we be keep here long by poor mr manuel adolphus i be for elizabeth 's go home colonel farel and he lady be get ready to go in the next vessel say adolphus as if in a sleep or as though he power of speech oppose and defy he in its activity -- so bewildered do he look at he wife and daughter oh then may i go it be only out and back i will not be long away then we shall all go some day together and never never return that be my wish say pauline be not it yours adolphus yes and this answer be give by a man who be neither asleep nor bewildered but by one who have put himself out of sight and be think only of other adolphus have not be as blind as pauline must have suppose he when she bid he remember what they daughter be a year ago he too have see that the bloom be fading from she face and by many a device he have strive to divert the gravity descend upon she from take possession of she pauline 's word revive every fear every anxiety he have feel for they child generous as impetuous he see now only one thing to be do one result to be accomplish elizabeth must sail in the next vessel and he be not the man to know another quiet moment till that vessel hove in sight that be he way why hesitate a twelvemonth when a moment suffice for a decision and the good and happiness of other be concern in the decide and it be not merely he way as have be make sufficiently apparent -- it be he wife 's way and he daughter 's yet fain would pauline have enter now upon a discussion of what remain to be do she could have go on from this point at which they suddenly find themselves stand so wistfully she would have make in advance every needful preparation and arrangement for elizabeth up to the time of she return but adolphus be in no mood for this he must go and see colonel farel he say by way of excuse -- and he must see the doctor it would have be a dangerous experiment have pauline persist in the endeavor to discover how much he could endure montier feel that he be not fit for family deliberation now and wisely make he escape from it i know say pauline when she and she child be leave together i know why it be the best thing in the world for you to go on this voyage -- but -- i do not know how you come by the sudden wish to go -- or if it be sudden elizabeth no demand -- no confidence require -- not a request even to enter into any secret counsel with she child but that child see the relation in which she stand to the loving woman by she side whose eye be gaze into she eye whose love be seek to fathom she heart and she answer humbly and with confidence -- i be go to you old home my mother -- and to see if it be true that manuel be to die here in this abhor prison it be my secret -- it be my errand i trust you for you love I oh love I my mother and trust I i dare not live i can not endure my freedom while he be wear out he life in a prison be i ill have it worn I to see he this year past die by inch i be glad of it -- i be proud of it now i will see if there be any pity or justice among ruler pauline montier be confound by this outbreak she have expect no such word as this she hear it terrify she for she be a loving woman and she think she hear in the voice of she daughter the voice of a woman who love -- the impassioned daring voice of one whom love incite to action such as sober reason never would attempt she repent already the word she have speak to she husband she have no power then could not prevail then or the misgiving which send adolphus weep into the wood and not in search of doctor or colonel would have draw he back to she side and against they love and they authority this girl have not prevail a question tremble on she lip but how should she ask it of she child she could not ask it of she child -- but as woman of woman the simplest and the shortest speech be best and far away be curiosity and authority elizabeth do you love this prisoner the answer do not linger he be die -- a noble man perish unrighteously oh my mother in that land there be a lady wait to know why the arm of the lord so long delay he shall not die a prisoner she love he -- _ he love she _ i will give they to each other only keep he alive till i come my child why do you weep -- but elizabeth so speak bow to the floor by she mother 's side and weep with she and the tender arm maternal clasp she close and the girl do not see when she mother 's eye look upward nor do she hear when she mother 's voice say with a saint 's entreaty and a lover 's faith o savior that night elizabeth go for the tray which she father have leave in the prisoner 's room when he carry he he supper no danger that adolphus would stand to gossip now with any man for a moment he heart be sore at the prospect of he daughter 's departure at the prospect of actual separation every feature of which state of be he distinctly anticipate and yet he would have scorn himself have he throw in the way anything like the shadow of a impediment to she departure from foray so far from that he be already do everything in act and think by which that go might be make more certain and immediate elizabeth find the prisoner sit before he untasted supper she go up the room at a rapid pace strength do not come of fasting say she as she glance at the table appetite do not come of torpor be the reply speak almost as quickly he seem to be echo she tone she look at he surprise so much energy of speech she have not expect of he and never before have hear i must wait for the tray say she and she take she usual stand by the window eat something to please my mother -- she will be so trouble at this he take he spoon and taste the porridge which have grow cold in the dish before he now as she stand there wait a curious state of mind be that through which elizabeth pass when he answer she greet it be with less apparent weariness less exhibition of sad indifference to all thing than usual -- with some animation indeed not at all as one speak who be dead to every hope and with this utterance which on any other day would have lighten the burden elizabeth bear a new darkening of the spirit of heaviness seem to fall upon she she know that by she he must have come to -- whatever hopefulness he have and she would give he freedom that she might see he face no more there be no crucifixion without pain it be never with a light heart that man or woman attend he or she own immolation there be awful terror in the triumph of the divine human nature if indeed _ suttee _ be noiseless superstition and force have stifle the voice of the widow and therefore the word which elizabeth only by a effort restrain as she cross the prison-threshold could come from she now by effort only if she have find he droop despair utterly cast down -- no hinderance then to a full utterance of the heroic purpose which death alone could dampen or defeat but now some strength seem in himself -- and liberty would give he to other of whom he could not think as quietly as he could think of she could she then better afford to weep than to rejoice with he before he have push away the table and its contents before time constrain she to speak she say -- i promise you something mr manuel you remember what i may go tomorrow so tell I -- how shall i serve you best tell I now something may happen and i wish my work to be clear the prisoner start from the table at these word he hastily approach the quiet speaker he face brighten not more by hope than by wonder admiration what do you mean -- tomorrow i be wait elizabeth colonel farel and he lady be go home he have leave of absence i have speak to my father and mother i have tell my mother everything she know that i be go to visit you relation as well as hers tell I how i shall find they tell I what i must do you shall have freedom if woman can ask or man can give it she have advance a single step towards he in thus speak she stand now with hand fold quiet wait he answer noble girl he begin then he pause full of reverence be he gaze do not praise -- direct I she say hurriedly i know what i shall say but to whom shall i say it -- yes i will find she whom you love i will carry balm across the sea to heal she breaking heart _ i _ will join together whom -- here for a instant she hesitate then begin again -- whom god have join whom man dare separate direct I sir and there she stand wait who sigh behold she no pusillanimity there but on the very height of danger which none other than the bravest could have gain dauntless and safe let she stand and fight she battle so strong yet so defenceless so conspicuous for purpose and position there the arrow rain upon she -- yet not one be poison to the power of hurt she sacred life listen elizabeth while he speak of _ she _ deeply can he voice grave every word of direction not one wilt thou lose choose of the few from among the many call go woman to love and hero to endure -- yea if thou must as gentle and dauntless martyr to die before the stronghold thou wouldst summon to surrender later in the day the prisoner hear elizabeth singing as not rarely he hear she -- for know that the sound of she voice be pleasant to he and that its cheerfulness cheer he she have the habit of frequent with she song that part of the house in which he room be the prisoner hear she singing later in the day and thank she for the grace but do not catch the word whose sound sweep past he it be a ancient hymn she sing -- one that she often sing and that she sing it this day of all day i copy here the first verse : -- sing my tongue the glorious battle with complete victory rife and above the cross 's trophy tell the triumph of the strife how the world 's redeemer conquer _ by surrender of he life _ \* \* \* \* \* the drummer 's daughter have cross the sea -- have land on the shore of fatherland she have even part from she fellow-voyager at the station whence the coach shall take she on to chalon that venerable town and well-beloved where the life whence she own spring be bear and blended she be in the land of wonder of meadow vineyard garden lake and river and of cattle feed on a thousand hill -- among the grave of million of man among the work of hero and of martyr in the land of mighty town of palace of master and of slave where a great king be build the great palace which shall witness century hence the dire humiliation of he race of all the crowd and company that hurry to and fro from one end of the land to the other elizabeth seek only two person it be not to she father 's native town that she be draw by the superior attraction she pass chalon in the moonlight when the coach stop at the inn-door for a change of horse she keep she place -- she act not with the quicker beating of she heart she look about she as they drive through the silent street -- out on the moonlit landscape when they have pass the border of the town she see the church-tower and the old building and the river whose winding she have hear describe so often by the voice that once talk of love all along its border chalon be dear to she she look back with tearful longing when the driver hurry on he horse as they pass into the open country but she have no right to wait on she own pleasure -- to verify she parent ' calculation when they talk together by the fireside in foray of she journey through fatherland no -- each sunrise appoint he one more day of imprisonment and exile every sunset leave he to one more night of cruel dream which morning shall deride and while this can be say what have chalon or any other spot on earth that it should lure she into rest the higher power sometimes convey they message and do they work after a prosaic fashion it be no uncommon thing for a young girl in neat raiment to stand wait admittance before the door of the château desperier hospitality be call upon in those day not so often perhaps as benevolence and for its charity the chateau have a reputation far and wide the expectation of the poor perish only in fruition there into the library of this ancient mansion elizabeth montier be usher by the old gray servant there she might wait the return of he mistress at what hour the return should be anticipate he could not undertake to say he counsel to the stranger be that she have better return at a later hour but when elizabeth say it be impossible that she have come from a great distance to see the lady of the place and must await she return _ there _ he lead she without further parley to the library and leave she and from its lofty window at she leisure she might now look down upon the prospect prisoner manuel have describe when she cross the threshold of that room she know where she be leave alone she look around she there he once have stand there he have part from madeline desperier from that last interview he have go forth to long captivity she stand by the lofty narrow window to see what he have see when stand before they -- that town the ancient desperier lay out for he tenant in the ancient day -- the church the pond the park -- the garden so vast and so astonishing for beauty the gazer scarce believe she eye and she remember bed of flower under a prison-wall and who that day look on they he have say that the mistress of this grand domain be a soldier 's daughter he have say that she be a grand lady a soldier 's daughter have come here to hold a interview with she a drummer 's daughter a girl from out the barracks and the prison of foray be here -- a strange light so strange that it seem not natural break from these reflection of elizabeth and illuminate the library it fall on the great bookcase that be fill from floor to ceiling with book which cost a fortune on the great easy-chairs black with age on picture and on bust on the old writing-stand the more modern centre-table pile with newspaper and pamphlet on the curious clock that tell the hour with a silverey voice it fall too on a portrait that do not often greet the gaze even of such as find access into that room -- a portrait of he for whose sake she be here have compass land and sea when she first see the picture she be sit in one of the chair beside the table -- she eye have take cognizance of everything but that -- and of that become aware so strangely that she could not at first persuade herself of the nature of the mystery that take such hold of she and possess she so wholly a proud and glorious vision it rise up before she emerge from the shadow of the alcove where it stand this be not manuel not the wan prisoner of foray -- but she heart need none to tell she it be the hero who have love the lady of this château in the splendor of he manhood she see it and see nothing more -- the prescience of she soul be satisfy as he be she behold he now -- be it safe for she to sit there gaze at that likeness the old servant who now and then walk up and down the hall perceive that the stranger be sit quiet with she eye generally in one direction be satisfy that she should prove so patient with this long delay in he mistress 's return he know not what occupy she eye or thought -- fancy may-be that she be numbering the book of the library or engage in some equally divert occupation at last come madeline learning from the servant in the hall that a young person wait she return and have wait half the day with a patience that be evidently proof against time the lady proceed at once to the library elizabeth who hear the arrival and the approach arise and stand wait the meeting in she hand she hold a paper scroll the drawing of foray which she have bring to aid she in this interview it be indeed a royal person upon whom the eye of the drummer 's daughter fall -- a person whose dignity and grace hold at a distance even those whom they attract nothing short of reverence could have dictate the movement of any noble mind that have to do with she she be the sister of mercy whom the whole country round about know for the most righteous desperier of they all the noble line be end nobly in she pure and lofty and most gracious womanhood she be the star of society if the sweet influence might only be bind -- no comet no fiery splendor of intellect or passion but a pure light that would still shine through all paling and enter with its own distinct ray into the last absorption she approach to meet she guest with a kind and frank expression of regret that she should have be keep wait so long behold she remember he strong even through she sense of impotence elizabeth unrolled the pencilling of foray the moment during which she be thus occupy pass in silence then she look up and speak with the coldness in which she embarrassment and emotion seek disguise i come here with a message -- on a errand say she and i have come so far that find myself really in this house i do not like to leave it again till i have see the lady i seek i know that it would give you pain if you could know the whole tell I the whole be the reply speak with evident and encouraging approval of the stranger 's mode of address and the lady sit down in the great chair on one side of the table be seat tell I you wish it be to serve you say elizabeth a little proudly i have not come to ask favor for myself or mine i come across the sea for you and he she speak now with vehemence and as she speak glance at the portrait in the alcove quickly the eye of madeline desperier follow hers how have this stranger manage to discover what be so securely hide from the observation of ordinary eye she do not even suspect the light which have illumine that dim recess and make it brighter to the gazer than the bright garden even this be foray say elizabeth expose now the token that would instantly make all plain and equal between they i should have send it to you madam when i write but there be more to be do -- and so i come i be elizabeth montier i be a soldier 's daughter so he say be you the lady 's answer be not at first by speech she arise swiftly as light move she move and bring she guest up to the window of the shadowy room well she scan the face of elizabeth truth she murmur it be you that write you be truth you speak it blessing on you blessing descend upon you from all the saint and hero who have move and suffer here do you come from he -- stephen cordier how proudly and how tenderly she speak that name to hear she soothe the heart of elizabeth montier -- soothe she and make she strong be that he name she ask point to the portrait we call he manuel she pause a moment but not for a answer before madeline could speak she go on -- if you can hear I i will tell you of he and why i be here tell I all i can bear to hear anything that you can endure to tell you be he friend i claim you for mine too you come to find I speak this be the utterance of a calm self-knowledge by what she have endure the woman know what she could yet endure without pause elizabeth now speak without interruption the lady listen -- listen while this young stranger tell the life of the past month in which he be concern -- of the garden where she work and he walk -- of she father the musician -- of they old home near the barracks and the new home in the prison -- of the day when he first tell she of he country and he love -- how for he she have write the letter repeat oftentimes in the narration the very word he have use -- of he gesture he look -- she be thoughtful of all how strangely intelligent in all she communication ah if it be eager love that hearken it be thoughtful love that speak the story as she tell it be brief but the voice never falter in tell the tale and the eye of elizabeth with constant scrutiny be upon she listener she be satisfy when have say all she pause and have now no further fear for she own heart 's integrity or of the listener 's constancy a long silence follow she speech at length say mlle desperier -- i see it all you be god 's messenger from that other world i have believe too little you be truer and wiser than i lead I dear child shall we go to foray i will sail with you tomorrow if you say so better a prison with he than all this freedom so alone he must be set free first say elizabeth the manner of she speak she look as well as she tone might almost have be take for a rebuke madeline might pardon that i have say so she answer mildly i have try to move heaven and earth i be but a feeble woman still it be a consolation to know that i have do everything my wit or my love could devise and not stop at what look like extravagance or indelicacy what further elizabeth the man who be now in power and through whom alone the king can be reach will grant he liberty -- _ he will _ at a price that would take away its value from he what be that price my life he want I for he wife -- a purchase you perceive elizabeth montier do not heed the scorn and bitterness of these word as mlle desperier speak they the blood in she vein seem turn to fire -- it sweep through she body and brain like the flood of a volcano -- and she think she who know the prisoner 's life and all that captivity be to he -- coward and selfish that will not instantly give up she life for he a very dismal satisfaction that the woman he love best should so prove unworthy of he the horror of that satisfaction its humiliation and its pain sufficiently attest to the poor girl who endure it that she soul 's integrity remain secure as if for a personal conflict with a enemy she start to she foot it must not be she exclaim and far from suspect to whom the word be address to what the speaker close she eye rebuke she pure heart the lady answer -- then unless he outlive this tyranny of power he will die a prisoner elizabeth i will go with you to he i can die with he god certainly do not require I to stay here longer for he have send you to I he have send I for _ he _ exclaim elizabeth i be here to make he free she do not add if i be you my life for he but again in spite of she she think it and a terrible strength of pride possess she at that moment speak on be the eager tremulous response you be here to set he free god know but at least i believe wholly in you what will you do elizabeth go to the officer tomorrow tell he everything that be to be tell if he be human -- that be what i doubt he know what petition i present and cause to be present to he predecessor you i -- who but i do you think i have be idle or that i have leave anything undo that i could think to do child the sun have never rise on I since i see he last they say i be dead to the world but they who say it know not how terribly true they word be shall i tell _ you _ how many time when the weary day have come to a end i have say in the morning i would make that loathsome bargain with general saterge and in the morning god 's grace as i believe have alone prevent I do you think that it be because i love myself better than he that i have not buy he freedom at this price it be because i know he -- because i be sure that liberty at such price would be worthless to he i can not torture he with the belief that i be unfaithful nor suffer he to look on I as a sacrifice we can endure what god allow trust I you have do so bravely you be yourself so true believe in I i be really no coward i be not a selfish woman forgive I say elizabeth most humbly she pride have leave she defenceless in its flight if there be not now the true brave generous woman to lift and proclaim herself from the humiliation of she mistake alas for she the woman be there -- ready and true -- be there humble yet resolute she speak -- and in she speaking be the triumph of a spirit that should never again surrender its stronghold of peace you must direct I madam show I how i shall find this minister i will speak then as god 's servant speak of old -- trust in he if the man will not hear I then i will conduct you to foray you shall see mr manuel you can live -- with we my mother 's heart be kind and my father be a soldier we shall all love to serve you let we take courage they can not prevent we here you could endure exile for he exile ah how do you shame I all these year i might have -- no say elizabeth hurriedly never till now you could not the way be not open till this day love too must have its servant i be yours and he i trust in god in he time he have open he own way by mlle desperier 's management elizabeth without difficulty obtain audience the next day of the chief ministerial power of the realm i shall attempt no pictorial description of that interview the man of authority know best how often woman come into they presence burden with prayer for the pardon of those who have justly or unjustly fall under the displeasure of the power that be from high station and low love draw its noblest and most courageous witness and the ear of the official be not always deaf the case of stephen cordier be of sufficient importance to come under discussion before the govern power as often as that power undergo a change in person or policy twice petition in he behalf have be present -- once by the lady of château desperier in person -- petition that be in themselves the proudest praise of he the greatest honor that could be confer upon he they have fall powerless to the ground the old man statesman and soldier now hold office have before he come to this position know the interest and the kind of interest take by madeline desperier in the petition present volunteer he name to the last document mention though with due deference to the fashion of the world the price at which it be to be procure -- she hand he name have just the weight that would have make the other more honorable name successful in they plead what sort of success be to be expect now that he occupy the passage to royalty elizabeth montier cross the threshold of the apartment where the old warrior and statesman sit amongst book and papers without dismay ruling by pen and voice as confident in himself when he take up these weapon as in the former time of sword and powder he practice be to receive all petitioner -- all should have audience but he make short work of business never be affair dispatch with more celerity seldom with less conscience at a glance he keen eye read to he own satisfaction the state of every case -- and he come to he own conclusion he requirement be that the petitioner should be self-possessed and brief -- which requisition hint by the doorkeeper and reiterate by the general himself have not always precisely the effect intend the fault be not in mlle desperier that she have prove so unsuccessful in she petition as have be make sufficiently clear general saterge have find in stephen cordier a powerful antagonist in action he have move to power through the very path which stephen cordier have attempt to lay waste he uphold the faith against which cordier have preach a crusade the old warrior regard the young thinker as a personal enemy it be hardly probable that he would very energetically strive to procure the reversal of a hard sentence in behalf of such a man as adolphus montier 's daughter come into he presence she have not the bearing common to such as appear there with intent to plead for the life or liberty of those they love a sense of the sacredness of she mission be upon she she have cry to god and she believe that he have hear she where do the possibility of such faith end time would fail I to tell of gideon and of barak and of samson and of jephthah of david also and of samuel and of the prophet who through faith subdue kingdom work righteousness obtain promise stop the mouth of lion quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness be make strong wax valiant in fight turn to flight the army of the alien woman receive they dead raise to life again and other be tortured not accept deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and other have trial of cruel mocking and scourging yea moreover of bond and imprisonment they be stone they be sawn asunder be tempt be slay with the sword they wander about in sheep-skin and goat-skin be destitute afflict tormented _ and these all have obtain a good report through faith receive not the promise _ she have consider well what she would do and say and do not forget and be not confound when she stand before the old man know she time have come calm and strong because so bent on accomplish she purpose and so conscious of she past secret weakness of she suspicion and cruel judgment as if she would here atone for it she take stern vengeance of herself general saterge recognize at one glance the evidence of a strong and determine spirit when she have cross the room and stand before he he request she to be seat -- and it be the first time that he have make such request of such visitor decline the civility elizabeth stand and tell she errand she have come across the ocean she say to plead the cause of a poor prisoner who be die under sentence of the law she pause a moment have make this statement and be answer by a nod prisoner often die without reprieve he seem to be aware this cold civility warm the petitioner 's speech she mother would have be satisfied madeline desperier would have be overwhelm with grief and horror to have hear this young girl 's testimony in regard to prison-life the old man as he listen sigh unconsciously -- for not every nerve in he be string to cruelty to one of he restless career what image of life more dreadful could have be present than be in this testimony to be shut away from human society so many year patient resign receive the few comfort yet allow he -- to live on pure in spirit lofty in think hope still in god and man the old warrior in self-defence because she bring the case too vividly the life too forcibly before he break through the word she be speak interrupt she who be this person he ask stephen cordier be the answer without hesitation even proudly she speak it she have compel he to ask the name and who be you he ask and if he feel displeasure as if he sympathy of which he be so chary have be steal from he he do not allow it to appear elizabeth montier she reply that be no answer what be a name if it convey no meaning to my mind i be the daughter of adolphus and pauline montier my father be a drummer in the military band of foray he be also present keeper of the prison where stephen cordier be confine very well do he know you errand here he do not he let I come to this country -- it be he native land and my mother 's -- he let I come because in he heart he have always love he country and he have never be able to return we be to have come back together but there be a opportunity for I i dare not wait so i be here -- and for nothing sir but this man 's liberty those last word she speak seem to quicken the thought of general saterge he draw himself up still more erect in he chair he eye be on elizabeth with the will to scan she heart of heart he speak -- what be this man to you she pause a moment and she too have a think she could play a game for life she look at the old man hesitate answer -- he be everything just let I understand you and he look upon she as if _ he _ might touch she secret do you love cordier i love he she answer with exceed dignity evident truthfulness do i understand you he say again -- what be you to he everything she again reply with perfect confidence and faith be she not liberty and the joy of life to he if liberty and joy be ever to be he portion they must come through she so she believe and thus answer do he love you yes you speak with great assurance i know the man better i be afraid then he voice and manner change he be sentence justice pass that sentence -- to reverse it be the work of imbecility speak no more it be not in man to grant what you ask he be try she in she last stronghold -- prove she in she last depth be this you answer she ask and indeed after what have just pass between they it do seem incredible the old man bow he seem now impassible he be stern and hard as rock he believe that he have wellnigh be deceive -- and deception practice successfully on he would have disgrace he in he own eye forever he believe what he would not trust he lip to utter that this applicant be madeline desperier 's agent when he bow and do not answer a fear come down upon elizabeth that almost take away she power of speech that it do not quite deprive she of that power render it so much the more terrible for the anguish of its emphasis do woman kneel to you when they ask the pardon of those they love say she with a paling face what shall i do to move you what have i not do i trust that have come so far on such a errand it must be that god be my leader be i mistaken or dare you withstand god tell I -- you be a old man -- have you no pity have you never have a sorrow can you not see that i never could have come here to plead for a bad man 's life must i go back to see he die madam you be stand where i can not come to argue with you pity and justice have they respective duty to perform oftentimes pity may be exercise and the claim of justice waive in the case of the man you plead for it be simply impossible he have rise in displeasure to pronounce these final word when that word impossible smite she as a sword he touch a spring in the table a bell sound elizabeth go forth -- the audience be over she go not with tear but self-possessed imperious in mien strong in despair come into the presence of madeline desperier it be not needful that she should speak to make know the result of she audience have you learn when the vessel sail be she first question it be she reply to the lady 's glance -- a glance for which there be no attendant word in all the language tomorrow elizabeth be you ready i will be then i will give you to he i promise that too i can fulfill that at least you must not think the prison-wall too dreary my mother -- i understand elizabeth and they sail on the morrow no delay for wander among the meadow of the pleasant town for gossip with the man and woman who be in childhood playmate of she father and she mother no stroll along lovely river-banks chalon have nothing for elizabeth only one green nook of all the world have anything for she -- a island in the sea -- a prison on that island -- and there work to do worthy of gabriel but -- wonder of wonder paul and sila sing song in they prison and the jailer hear they then there come a earthquake who be he that find he cell-door open suddenly and a messenger from out the court of heaven there to guide he step history be full of marvellous record i add this to those the eleventh hour go always freight with the weightiest event on board the vessel that carry elizabeth and she charge back to foray go a messenger commission of the king he take from court to prison the partial pardon of cordier liberty but banishment henceforth stephen cordier should be constrain to faithfulness towards he new love doom to perpetual exile he should be tempt by no late loyalty to madeline desperier the new act of he drama should have nought to do with she justice forever rascal that he be accord to the word of general saterge it be rascality which the general could pardon he have gain many a victory in desperate strife -- now one other the last and most

he mistress the faëry queen of edmund spenser be before we -- a vast and glittering mausoleum in which the purpose of the constructor have long be entomb we fear without hope of a happy resurrection nevertheless into this splendid ruin hieroglyph with the most brilliant image the modern mind have yet conceive we be about to dig -- not with the impious desire of drag forth the intellectual tenant now in the fourth century of its everlasting repose but haply to discover in the outer chamber and passage of the pyramid some relic of the individual architect he family and mode of life in fact we be anxious to make the acquaintance of mistress spenser and introduce she to the american public a slight sketch of the poet 's life up to the period of he marriage may afford we some clue to the quarter from which he select he bride we shall therefore give what be know of he in the fewest possible word edmund spenser by family be english and by birth a cockney in he prothalamion he thus plead guilty to the chime of bow-bell in he infant ear : -- at length they all to merrie london come to merrie london my most kindly nurse that to I give this life 's first native source though from another place i take my name and house of ancient fame at what time of he life he become connect with ireland be very uncertain it be probably early at or about the time of sir henry sidney 's vice-royalty or in the interval between that and the lieutenancy of lord gray de wilton there be a mr spenser actively and confidentially employ by the irish government and that this may have be the poet be from collateral circumstance far from improbable spenser be the friend and _ protégé _ of sir philip sidney -lrb- son of the before-named sir henry -rrb- and of he uncle the earl of leicester lord gray de wilton be by marriage connect with both and live with they on term of the closest intimacy social literary and political in choose a officer then for so important a post as that of secretary whom would the one select or the other more confidently recommend than a young man of genius know to all the party and who already have some knowledge and experience of irish affair be this as it may we know that in 1580 spenser then in he twenty-seventh year accompany lord gray de wilton into ireland as secretary and that he have be there before in some official capacity not undistinguished be evidence by the fact that the lord justice previously to he arrival speak of he as have many way deserve some consideration from she majesty we do not care to inquire into the peculiar service for which he be so speedily favor with a large grant of land forfeit by the desmond such official transaction we fear would reflect little credit on the poet no doubt he be a good man -- accord to the morality of he age and if he do suggest the poisoning of a few thousand human being of all age and both sex -lrb- some go so far as to allege that he fervid imagination contemplate the utter extermination of the race -rrb- he merely act up to the opinion prevalent in the time and polished court of good queen bess the being be mere irishry -- a stumbling-block in the path of british civilization and therefore to be remove _ per fa et nefas _ spenser take up he residence on the forfeit land in cork there marry and rear a family which inherit he estate that he subsequently die in england be as mere a casualty as that by which swift be bear in ireland certain it be that the greater and the better portion of he work in prose and verse be compose during he residence in the land of he adoption thus in the sonnet append to the faëry queen the poem on which he celebrity rest he address this earl of ormond : -- receive most noble lord a single taste of the wilde fruit which savage soyle have breed which bee through long war leave almost waste with brutish barbarisme be overspr again address himself to he patron lord gray he say -- rude rime the which a rustick nurse do weave in savage soyle far from parnasso mount several other of the finest production of he brain owe they birth to the savage soyle of ireland he description of the country he dialogue on irish affair he amorettus and colin clout 's come home again belong confessedly to this category have discover thus much about the poet we now strike out in a new direction in search of he better half upon this point unfortunately there hang a mist -- not impenetrable as we conceive but yet impenetrate -- a secret to which the give clue have be neglect and which remain to the present day the opprobrium of a careless biography the fact and the date of he marriage in ireland be obtain from he own writings but further than that she name be elizabeth -- a fact record by himself -- the lady of he choice remain unknown she maiden name and family mere trifle these to be sure -- but interesting in a antiquarian point of view -- and valuable perhaps should the inquiry hereafter lead some more than usually acute bookworm into the real mystery and mean the main drift of that inexplicable faëry queen one difficulty in the matter be that edmund appear to have be a susceptible subject he be twice attack with the tender malady and record in glowing number he passion for two mistress one he call _ rosalinde _ and celebrate in the shepherd 's calendar the other _ elizabeth _ to whom he be undoubtedly marry be the theme of admiration in he amorettus rosalinde be he early love elizabeth the passion of he maturer year when six-and-twenty hopeless of rosalinde he wind up he philomel complaining of she cruelty by a formal commission to he friend gabriel harvey -lrb- _ hobbinoll _ -rrb- to declare he suit at a end : -- adieu good hobbinoll that be so true tell rosalinde she colin bid adieu it take he fourteen year -- surely a sufficient time -- to recover from this disappointment for he be in he forty-first year when in he sixtieth sonnet he represent himself as have be then one year enamored of elizabeth : -- so since the winged god he planet cleare begin in I to move one yeare be spend the which doth longer unto I appear than all those fourty which my life outwent that rosalinde be not as have be somewhat rashly conjecture the poetic name of elizabeth be conclusively establish by a poem write between 1591 and 1595 in which he speak of some insurmountable barrier between they why she he might not love -lrb- 1 -rrb- the wife he love and the mistress between whose love and he there exist such a barrier could not have be the same person it be evident but who this fair and false rosalinde be though know to many of he contemporary have become a mystery that she be a real personage be place beyond cavil by ek the ostensible editor of the shepherd 's calendar and he have give we a clue to she name if we have but the wit to follow it now ek we more than shrewdly suspect to have be either spenser himself or he friend gabriel harvey or both together two more egregious self-laudator be not to be find in the range of english literature : spenser lose no opportunity of puff colin clout and harvey be openly charge by thoma nash with have forge commendatory epistle and sonnet in he own praise under the name of _ thorius _ etc ek therefore must be consider as pretty high authority and what say ek why this : rosalinde be also a feigned name which be well order will bewray the verie name of he love and mistresse by well order the feigned name ek undoubtedly mean dispose or arrange the letter of which it be compose in some form of anagram or metagram -- a species of wit much cultivate by the most celebrated poet of the time spenser include and not deem beneath the dignity of the learn camden to expound a few example of this alchemy of wit as camden call it will reconcile we modern notion of the -lrb- greek : to trepon -rrb- with the puerile ingenuity think graceful at that unripe period of we literature by some of the most accomplished writer and reader of the day let we take a extravagant instance sir philip sidney have abridge he own name into _ phil sid _ anagrammatize it into _ philiside _ refining still further he translate _ sid _ the abridgment of _ sidus _ into -lrb- greek : astron -rrb- and retain the _ phil _ as derive from -lrb- greek : philo -rrb- he construct for himself another pseudonym and adopt the poetical name of _ astrophil _ feeling moreover that the lady rich celebrate in he sonnet be the loadstar of he affection he designate she in conformity with he own assumed name _ stellum _ christopher marlow 's name be transmute into _ wormal _ and the royal elizabetha be frequently address as _ ah-te-basile _ doctor thoma lodge author of rosalinde or euphue he golden legacy -lrb- which shakspeare dramatize into as you like it -rrb- have anagrammatize he own name into _ golde _ -- and that of der into _ ringde _ the author of dolarney 's primrose be a doctor _ raynolde _ john hind in he eliosto libidinoso transmute he own name into _ dinchin _ matthew roydon become _ donroy _ and shakspeare even do not scruple to alchemize the resolute john or john florio into the pedantic _ holoferne _ of love 's labor 's lose a thousand such fantastic instance of trifle with the letter might be quote and even so late as the reign of queen anne we find this foolish wit indulge the cynical swift -lrb- 2 -rrb- stoop to change miss ware into _ varina _ esther -lrb- _ quasus _ aster a star -rrb- johnson be know as _ stellum _ essy van-homrigh figure as _ vanessa _ while cadenus by a easy change of syllable be resolve into _ decanus _ or the dean himself _ in propriâ personâ _ and canonical in the shepherd 's calendar the very poem in which spenser 's unknown mistress figure as rosalinde the poet have alchemize grindal archbishop of canterbury into _ algrind _ and make ellmor bishop of london _ morell _ -lrb- it be to be hope he be so before -rrb- by merely transpose the letter what wonder then if comply with a art so general and convenient he should be find contrive in the case of both he mistress at once to reveal he passion and conceal the name of he enslaver from the public gaze the prolific hint of ek set the commentator at work -- but hitherto without success the author of the life prefix to church 's edition conjecture rise linde -- forsooth because it appear from fuller 's worthy that in the reign of henry the sixth -- only eight reign too early for the birth of we rural beauty -- there be one john linde a resident in the county of kent not satisfy with this conjecture malone suggest that she may have be a eliza horden -- the _ z _ change accord to camden 's rule into _ s _ and the aspirate sink malone 's foundation for this theory be that one thoma horden be a contemporary of john linde aforesaid and reside in the same county both these conjecture be absurd and unsupported by any collateral evidence to have give they the remotest air of probability the critic should have prove some acquaintance or connection between the party respectively -- some courtship or contiguity of residence which might have bring the young people within the ordinary sphere of attraction wrong as they be in they conclusion the search of these commentator be in the right direction the anagram well-ordered will undoubtedly bewray the secret let we try if we may not follow it with better success _ rosalinde _ read anagrammatically into rise daniel for accord to camden a letter may be double or reject or contrariwise if the sense fall aptly we thus get rid of the redundant _ e _ and have a perfect anagram now spenser have a intimate and beloved friend and brother-poet name samuel daniel author of many tragedy and comedy a eight-canto poem call the civil war of england a vision of twelve goddess a prose history of england and musa a defense of rhyme spenser allude to he poetic genius with high praise in he colin clout this daniel have a sister name rise who be marry in due time to a friend of she brother 's -- not indeed to spenser but to a scholar whose eccentricity have leave such durable track behind they that we can trace he mark through many passage of spenser 's love complaint otherwise unintelligible the supposition that rise daniel be rosalinde satisfy every requisite and present a solution of the mystery the anagram be perfect the poet 's acquaintance with the brother naturally throw he into contact with the sister while the circumstance of she marriage with another justify the complaint of infidelity and account for the insurmountable barrier that be a living husband daniel be the early _ protégé _ of the pembroke family as be spenser of the house of leicester the youthful poet must often have meet in the company of they mutual friend sir philip sidney -- for the countess of pembroke be the sidney 's sister pembroke 's mother celebrate by ben jonson and consequently niece as sir philip be nephew of robert dudley earl of leicester rise and edmund be thus throw together under circumstance every way favorable to the development of love in a breast so susceptible as that of the passionate shepherd other circumstance in the life of rise daniel correspond so strikingly with those attribute to rosalinde as strongly to corroborate the foregone conclusion rosalinde after have give encouragement to she enamored shepherd faithlessly and finally desert he in favor of a rival this be evident throughout the shepherd 's calendar the first eclogue reveal he passion : -- i love thilk lass -lrb- alas why do i love -rrb- and be forlorne -lrb- alas why be i lorn -rrb- she deign not my good will but doth reprove and of my rural music holdeth scorn she scorn however may have mean no more than the natural coyness of a maiden whom the learn upton somewhat drolly designate as a skittish female -lrb- 3 -rrb- indeed spenser must have think so himself and with reason for she continue to receive he present the kid the cracknel and the early fruit send through he friend hobbinoll -lrb- gabriel harvey -rrb- we hear of no alteration of he circumstance until we reach the sixth eclogue in which the progress and utter disappointment of he suit be distinctly and bitterly complain of this eclogue say the editorial ek be wholly vow to the complain of colin 's ill-success in love for be -lrb- as be aforesaid -rrb- enamoured of a country lass rosalinde and have -lrb- as it seemeth -rrb- find place in she heart he lamenteth to he dear friend hobbinoll that he be now forsake unfaithfully and in he stead _ menalca _ another shepherd receive disloyally : and this be the whole argument of the eclogue in fact she break she plighted vow to colin clout transfer she heart to menalca and let she hand accompany it now from this and the precede circumstance the inference appear inevitable that at or about the time of the composition of this sixth eclogue the rosalinde therein celebrate be marry or engage to be marry to the person denounce as menalca whether the ante-nuptial course of rise daniel correspond with the faithlessness ascribe to rosalinda we confess we have no documentary evidence to show : but this much be certain that rise be marry to a intimate friend of she brother 's and from the characteristic record of he by spenser we shall presently prove that that friend the husband of rosalinde be no other than the treacherous rival denounce as menalca in the shepherd 's calendar who then be menalcas amongst the distinguished friend of samuel daniel be a man of much celebrity in he day -- the redoubted or as he choose to call himself the resolute john florio -lrb- shakspeare 's _ holoferne _ -rrb- this gentleman a italian by descent be bear in london in the same year with spenser and be a class-fellow with daniel at oxford he be the author of many work well receive by the public -- as he first fruit second fruit garden of recreation and so forth also of a excellent italian and english dictionary style a world of word -- the basis of all anglo-italian dictionary since publish he be a good french scholar as be prove by he translation of montaigne and write some verse highly prize by elizabeth and she successor jame i indeed he general learning and accomplishment recommend he to both court and on the accession of jame he be appoint classical tutor to prince henry and reader of french and italian to the royal consort anne of denmark he be also a gentleman of the privy chamber and clerk of the closet to he majesty and finally it be chiefly through he influence that samuel daniel be appoint gentleman extraordinary and groom of the privy chamber to queen anne long prior to this prosperous estate however he skill as a linguist have recommend he to the patronage and intimacy of many of the chief nobility of elizabeth 's court and at a early period of he life we find he engage as be he friend daniel as tutor to some of the most illustrious family -- such as pembroke dudley essex southampton etc -lrb- 4 -rrb- all which together with he friendship for daniel must need have bring he into the acquaintance of edmund spenser the friend of sidney and he relative he be also on the most friendly term with gabriel harvey and a warm admirer -lrb- as he work attest -rrb- of the genius of daniel we have thus gather we _ dramati persona _ the party most essentially interested in spenser 's unlucky passion into one familiar group of rise daniel 's marriage with the resolute john florio there be no manner of question it be record by anthony á wood in he athenæ oxoniens acknowledge by samuel daniel in the commendatory verse prefix to florio 's world of word and she be affectionately remember in florio 's will as he beloved wife rise -lrb- 5 -rrb- thus if not spenser 's rosalinde she be undoubtedly a rosalinde to john florio we shall now proceed to gather some further particle of evidence to add they cumulative weight to the mass of slender probability with which we be endeavor to sustain we conjecture spenser 's rosalinde have at least a smattering of the italian samuel daniel be a italian scholar for he whole system of versification be found on that model spenser too be well acquaint with the language for long before any english version of tasso 's gerusalemme have appear he have translate many passage which occur in the faëry queen from that poem and -- without any public acknowledgment that we can find trace of -- appropriate they to himself -lrb- 6 -rrb- what more natural than that rise should have share she brother 's pleasant study and in company with he and spenser accept the tuition of john florio the identity of florio 's wife and rosalinde may be fairly infer from some circumstance consequent upon the lady 's marriage and otherwise connect with she fortune which appear to be shadow forth with great acrimony in the faëry queen where the rosalinde of the shepherd 's calendar appear before we again under the assume name of _ mirabellum _ lest the ascription of these circumstance to particular party may be imputed to prejudice or prepossession for a favorite theory we shall state they on the authority of commentator and biographer who never even dream of the view of the case we be now endeavor to establish the learn upton in he preface to the faëry queen be lead to observe the striking coincidence the absolute similarity of character between spenser 's rosalinde and he mirabellum if the ` faëry queen ' quoth he be a moral allegory with historical allusion to we poet 's time one might be apt to think that in a poem write on so extensive a plan the cruel rosalinde would be in some way or other typically introduce and methink i see she plainly characterize in mirabellum perhaps too she expression be the same that be give to mirabella -- ` the _ free lady _ ' ` she be bear free ' etc -lrb- 7 -rrb- we be now come say mr gl craik by far the most acute and sagacious of all the commentator on spenser to a very remarkable passage have thus dispose of turpin the poet suddenly address he reader say -- ` but turn we back now to that _ lady free _ whom late we leave ride upon a ass lead by a _ carle and fool _ which by she side do pass ' this be the ` fair maiden clothe in mourning weed ' who it may be remember be meet as related at the beginning of the precede canto by timia and serena there however she be represent as attend only by a _ fool _ what make this episode especially interesting be the conjecture that have be throw out and which seem intrinsically probable that the ` lady ' be spenser 's own rosalinde by whom he have be jilt or at least reject more than a quarter of a century before he unforgetting resentment be suppose to have take this revenge so far with mr upton and mr craik we heartily concur as to the identity of rosalinde and mirabellum and feel confident that a perusal and comparison of the episode of mirabellum with the whole story of rosalinde will leave every candid and intelligent reader no choice but to come to the same conclusion : we shall now collate the attribute assign in common to those two impersonation in they maiden state and note the correspondence both be of humble birth -- rosalinde be describe in the shepherd 's calendar as the widow 's daughter of the glen she low origin and present exalted position be frequently allude to -- she beauty she haughtiness and love of liberty mirabellum be thus describe in book vi faëry queen canto vii : -- she be a lady of great dignity and lift up to honorable place famous through all the land of faërie : though of mean parentage and kindred base yet deck with wondrous gift of nature 's grace but she thereof grow proud and insolent and scorn they all that lore unto she mean she be bear free not bind to any wight of rosalinde we hear in colin clout that she ambition be so high in think as she herself in place and that she loatheth each lowly thing with lofty eye she beauty too be dwell upon as a thing celestial -- she humble family allude to -- the boast freedom of she heart and upon rosalinde and mirabellum a affectation of the demigoddessship which turn they head be equally charge in all essential characteristic they be twin cherry grow on one stalk of rise daniel 's life so little be know particularly during she unmarried year that we be unable to fasten upon she the unamiable quality of the allegorical beauty we assume to be she representative but if we can identify she married fortune with theirs -- then in addition to the congruity already mention we can have no hesitation in impute to _ she _ the disposition which bring down upon _ they _ so bitterly and relentlessly the poetic justice of the disappointed shepherd we may thus dispose of they in brief mirabellum 's lot be severe she be marry -lrb- if we rightly interpret the language of the allegory -rrb- to a _ fool _ -- that be to say to a very absurd and ridiculous person under whose conduct she be expose to the whip and scorn the disdain and bitter retaliation natural to the union of a beautiful and accomplished though vain and haughty woman with a very eccentric irritable and bombastic humorist rosalinde be marry -- with no better fate we fear -- to the vain and treacherous menalca and rise daniel become the wife of the resolute john florio we shall commence with the substantial character and see how they history fall in with the fortune attribute to the allegorical rise daniel 's husband maugre he celebrity and place of dignity and profit be beset with temper and oddity which expose he more perhaps than any man of he time to the ridicule of contemporary wit and poet he be at least in he literary career jealous envious irritable vain pedantic and bombastical petulant and quarrelsome -- ever on the watch for a affront and always in the attitude of a fretful porcupine with a quill point in every direction against real or supposititious enemy in such a state of mental alarm and physical vaporing do he live that he seem to have proclaim a promiscuous war against all gainsayer -- that be the literary world and for the better assurance to they of he indomitable valor and to himself of indemnity from disturbance he adopt a formidable prefix to he name and to any bill warrant quittance or obligation to every address prelude preface -lrb- 8 -rrb- introduction or farewell accompany any of he numerous work he subscribe himself the resolute -- resolute john florio conduct so absurd couple with some personal defect and a character so petulantly vainglorious expose the resolute to the bitter sarcasm of contemporary writer accordingly we find he through life encompass by a host of tormentor and present he _ chevaux-de-frise _ of quill against they at all and every point in the epistle dedicatory to the second edition of he dictionary we find he engage _ morsu et unguibus _ with a swarm of literary hornet against whom he inveigh as sea-dog -- land-critic -- monster of man if not beast rather than man -- whose tooth be cannibal ' -- they tongue adder ' fork -- they lip asp ' poison -- they eye basilisk ' -- they breath the breath of a grave -- they word like sword of turk which strive which shall dive deepest into the christian lie before they of a verity we may say that john florio be sadly exercise when he pen this pungent paragraph he then fall foul of the player who -- to use the technical phrase of the day -- stage he with no small success with this common cry of cur in general and with _ one poet _ and _ one piece _ of say poet 's handiwork in particular he enter into mortal combat with such vehement individuality as enable we at a glance to detect the offence and the offender he say let aristophane and he comedian make play and scour they mouth on socrate these very mouth they make to vilify shall be the means to amplify he virtue etc and here say doctor warburton shakspeare be so clearly mark out as not to be mistaken this opinion be fortify by the concurrence of farmer steeven reid malone knight collier and hunter and from the additional light throw upon this subject by they combined intelligence no doubt seem to exist that holoferne the pedantic schoolmaster in love 's labor 's lose have he prototype in john florio the resolute florio accord to farmer give the first affront by assert that ` the play they play in england be neither right comedy nor tragedy but representation of history without any decorum ' we know that shakspeare must of he own personal knowledge of the man have be qualify to paint he character for while the great dramatist be the early and intimate friend of the earl of southampton the petulant lexicographer boast of have for year be domesticate in the pay and patronage of that munificent patron of letter warburton think it be from the ferocity of he temper that shakspeare choose for he the name which rabelai give to he pedant of thubal holoferne be the matter worth argue we should say it be rather from the proclivity with which -lrb- accord to camden 's rule -rrb- the abbreviated latin name johne florio or floreo fall into holoferne rabelai and anagrammatism may divide the slender glory of the product between they but neither shakspeare 's satire nor florio 's absurdity be comprehend within this single character subsequent examination of the text of love 's labor 's lose have enable the critic to satisfy themselves that the part of _ don adnano de armado _ the phantastical courtier be devise to exhibit another phase in the character of the resolute italian in holoferne we have the pedantic tutor in don adriano a lively picture of a ridiculous lover and pompous retainer of the court by a fine dramatic touch shakspeare have make each describe the other in such a way that the portrait might stand for the speaker himself and thus establish a dual-identity thus armado describe holoferne say that be all one my fair sweet honey monarch for i protest the schoolmaster be exceed fantastical -- too too vain -- too too vain but we will put it as they say to _ fortuna della guerra _ -- whilst holoferne not behind he counterpart in self-esteem see in the other the defect which he can not detect in himself _ novi hominem tanquam te _ quoth he -- he humor be lofty he discourse peremptory he tongue file he eye ambitious he gait majestical and he general behavior vain ridiculous and thrasonical he be too pick too spruce too affect too odd as it be too peregrinate as i may call it he draweth out the thread of he verbosity finer than the staple of he argument i abhor such fanatical phantasm etc should further proof be need that florio holoferne and armado form a dramatic trinity in unity we can find it in the personal appearance of the italian there be something amiss with the _ face _ of the resolute which could not escape the observation of he friend much less he enemy a friend and former pupil of he own -- sir wm cornwalli speaking in high praise of florio 's translation of montaigne observe -- it be do by a fellow less behold to nature for he fortune than to wit yet lesser for he _ face _ than he fortune the truth be he look more like a good fellow than a wise man and yet he be wise beyond either he fortune or education -lrb- 9 -rrb- it be certain then that behave like a fool in some thing he look very like a fool in other be it not a remarkable coincidence that both he suppose dramatic counterpart have the same peculiarity when armado tell the ` country lass ' he be woo that he will ` tell she wonder ' she exclaim -- ` skittish female ' that she be -- ` what with that _ face _ ' and when holoferne nettle with the ridicule shower on he abortive impersonation of juda maccabaeus say ' i will not be put out of countenance ' -- byron reply ` because thou hast no face ' the indignant pedant justify and point to he physiognomy inquire ` what be this ' whereupon the waggish courtier proceed to define it : it be ' a cittern-head ' ` the head of a bodkin ' ' a death 's - face in a ring ' ` the face of a old roman coin scarce see ' and so forth the satire here embody be of a nature too personal to be consider the mere work of a riotous fancy it be a trait individualize and particularise the person at whom the more general satire be aim and couple with the infirmity of the victim 's moral nature it fasten upon poor florio identity with the brace of coxcomb such satire may be censure as ungenerous we can not help that -- _ litera scripta manet _ -- and we can not rail the seal from the bond such attack be the general if not universal practice of the age in which shakspeare flourish and we have no right to blame he for not be as far in advance of he age morally as he be intellectually a notorious instance of a personal attack under various character in one play be to be find in ben jonson 's bartholomew fair wherein he boast of have under the character of lanthorn leatherhead the puppet-showman and adam overdo satirize the celebrated inigo jone -- by all he title and whole style at once of tireman montebank and justice jone it be probably to confront and outface aristophane and he comedian and to abrogate the scurrility of the sea-dog and land-critic that we resolute lexicographer prefix to the enlarged edition of he dictionary and to he translation of montaigne he portrait or effigy engrave by hole this portrait would to a person unapprised of any peculiarity in the original present apparently little or nothing to justify the remark of cornwalli but make due allowance for the address if not the flattery of a skilful painter it be hardly possible for the observer aware of the blemish not to detect in the short and close-curled fell of hair the wild stare eye the contour of the visage -- which expand from the narrow and wrinkled forehead into cheek-bone of more than scottish amplitude suddenly contract to a pointed chin render still more acute by a short peaked beard -- not to detect in this lozenge-shaped visnomy and its air at once haggard and grotesque trait that not only bear out the remark of he pupil but the raillery also of the court wit in shakespeare 's dramatic satire whatever happiness rise daniel may have have in the domestic virtue of she lord he relation with the world he temper eccentricity and personal appearance could have give she little that he be a attach and affectionate husband he last will and testament give touch _ post-mortem _ evidence let we return to the fortune of the faithless rosalinde it appear she marry menalca -- the treacherous friend and rival of the passionate shepherd who then be menalcas or why be this name specially select by we poet to designate the man he dislike the pastoral name menalca be obviously and pointedly enough adopt from the eclogue of virgil in which by compare the fifteenth line of the second with the sixty-sixth of the third we shall find he be the rival who -lrb- to use the expression of spenser -rrb- by treachery do underfong the affection of the beautiful alexi from he enamored master in this respect the name would well fit florio who from he intimacy with the daniel and they friend could not but have know the passion of the poet and the encouragement at one time give he by he fickle mistress again there be at this time prevalent a french conceit -- import as camden tell we from calai and so well like by the english although most ridiculous that learn or unlearned he be nobody that could not hammer out of he name a invention by this wit-craft and _ picture _ it accordingly whereupon he add who do not busy he braine to hammer he devise out of this forge -lrb- 10 -rrb- this wit-craft be the _ rebus _ florio 's rebus or device then be a flower we have specimen of he fondness for this nomenclative punning subscribe to he portrait : -- floret adhue et adhue florebit : floreat ultra florius ha specie floridus -- optat aman and it be with evident allusion to this conceit that he name he several work he first fruit second fruit garden of recreation and so forth spenser do not miss the occasion of reduce this figurative flower to a worthless weed : -- go tell the las she flower have wox a weed in the precede stanza we find this weed distinctly identify as menalca : -- and thou menalcas that by treachery didst underfong my lass to wax so light another reason for dub florio _ menalca _ may be find in the character and quality ascribe to the treacherous shepherd by virgil he be not without talent for in one of the eclogue he bear he part in the poetical contention with credit but he be unfaithful and fraudulent in he amours envious quarrelsome scurrilous and a braggart and he _ face _ be remarkable for its dark italian hue -- _ quamvi ille fuscus _ etc compare with the undoubted character of john florio as already exhibit that of menalca so correspond as to justify its appropriation to the rival of spenser there be a further peculiarity in the name itself which render its application to john florio at once pointed and pregnant with the happiest ridicule florio rejoice in the absurd prefix of resolute now menalca be a compound of two greek word -lrb- -lrb- greek : meno -rrb- and -lrb- greek : ulkm -rrb- -rrb- fully expressive of this idea and frequently use together in the sense of resolution by the best classical authority -- thus -lrb- greek : meno d'ulkmd te lathpsmat -rrb- -lrb- 11 -rrb- again in liddell and scott 's greek-english lexicon -lrb- greek : meno -rrb- in composition be say to bear always a collateral notion of _ resolve _ and firmness and here we have the very _ notion _ express by the very word we want menalca be the appropriate and expressive _ nom de guerre _ of the resolute every unprejudiced reader will admit that in emblem name character and appearance john florio and menalca be allegorically identical and it follow as a consequence that rosalinde marry to the same person as rise daniel be one and the same with she anagrammatic synonyme -- and that she sorrow and joy arise out of the conduct of she husband must have have the same condition have identify rosalinde with rise daniel it may be think that nothing further of interest with respect to either party remain which could lead we into further detail -- but spenser himself have choose under another personification to follow the married life of this lady and revenge himself upon the treachery of she husband we should lose a opportunity both of interpret he work and of form a correct estimate of he character if we neglect to pursue with he the fortune of mirabellum like she type and prototype we find that she have to suffer those mortification which a good wife can not but experience on witness the scorn disdain and enmity which follow the perversity of a wayward husband such at least we understand to be the meaning of those allegorical passage in which as a punishment for she cruelty and pride she be commit by the legal decree of cupid to the custody and conduct of scorn and disdain we meet with she for the first time as : a fair maiden clothe in mourning weed upon a mangy jade unmeetly set and a leud fool she leading thorough dry and wet again she be : ride upon a ass lead by a carle and fool which by she side do pass these companion treat she with great contempt and cruelty the carle abuse she : with all the evil term and cruel mean that he could make and eke that angry fool which follow she with curse hand uncleane whipping she horse do with he smarting-tool oft whip she dainty self and much augment she dool all this of course be to be understand allegorically the _ carle _ and _ fool _ -- the former name disdain the latter scorn -- be doubtless -lrb- as in the case of holoferne and armado -rrb- the double representative of the same person by the ass on which she ride be signify we suppose the ridiculous position to which marriage have reduce she haughty beauty the taunt and scourge be metaphorically the wound of injured self-respect the carle himself be extravagantly and most resolutely paint as a monster in nature -- stern terrible fear no living wight -- he look dreadful -- he eye fiery and roll from leave to right in search of foeman worthy of he steel he stride with the stateliness of a crane and at every step rise on tiptoe he dress and aspect resemble those of the moor of malabar and remind we forcibly of the swarthy menalca indeed if we compare this serio-comic exaggeration of the carle with the purely comic picture of don armado give by holoferne we shall see at a glance that both depict the same object of ridicule that mirabellum be link in wedlock to this angry fool be nowhere more clearly depict than in the passage where prince arthur have come to she rescue be prepare to put she tormentor to death until he sword be arrest by the shriek and entreaty of the unhappy lady that he life may be spare for she sake : -- stay stay sir knight for love of god abstain from that unware you weetlesse do intend slay not that carle though worthy to be slay for more on he doth than himself depend : my life will by he death have lamentable end this be the language of a virtuous wife whom neither the absurdity of a vainglorious husband nor the whip and scorn of the time to which he conduct necessarily expose she can detach from she duty and affection assume then that the circumstance of this allegory identify mirabellum with rosalinde and rosalinde with rise daniel and in like manner the fool and carle with menalca and john florio have we not here a thrice-told tale agree so completely in all essential particulars as to leave no room for doubt of its original application to the early love-adventure in which the poet be disappointed and these point settle though intrinsically of trivial value become of the highest interest as strong corroboration of the personal import of all the allegorical character introduce into the work of spenser thus in the shepherd 's calendar the confidant of the lover be hobbinoll or gabriel harvey and in the faëry queen the adventurer who come to mirabellum 's relief be prince arthur sir timia and serena the well-known allegorical impersonation of spenser 's special friend the earl of leicester sir walter raleigh and elizabeth throckmorton to whom sir walter be marry be not these consideration add to the several circumstance and coincidence already detail conclusive of the personal and domestic nature of the history convey in both the poetical vehicle and do they not amount to a moral demonstration that in assign the character and adventure of mirabellum and rosalinde to the sister of samuel daniel the wife of john florio we have give no unfaithful account of the first fickle mistress of edmund spenser -- we shall next ascertain the name and history of he wife from the internal evidence leave behind he in he work part ii -- spenser 's wife the second passion of we poet have have birth in savage soyle far from parnasso mount be more barren of literary gossip and adventure and may therefore we trust be compress into narrow limit the chief evidence on which we shall have to rely in this case must be of a similar nature with the former -- not that we shall have to interpret allegory but the true reading of a anagram for we may set out on we pursuit assure that accord to the poetical alchemy of he age spenser do not fail to screen he second _ innamora _ under the same quintessential cloud of wit as he first and that we shall find in he homage some _ sobriquet _ the right order of which -lrb- as in the former case -rrb- will bewray the verie name of he love and mistresse on this point however he biography and biographer have hitherto preserved absolute silence they tell we he be marry and have several child by he wife but of the name the rank or the country of the lady they confess they ignorance todd inform we that he marry a person of very inferior rank to himself -- a country lass -- and he quote the faëry queen to prove he assertion : -- for certe she be but a country lass it be true those word occur in the passage cite by the commentator from the faëry queen most probably they refer to the person in dispute but she be no more a country lass in the ordinary acceptation of the phrase than be spenser himself -lrb- clerk of the council of munster -rrb- a shepherd 's boy have mr todd consult that portion of we poet 's work especially devote to record this passion its progress and issue he would have find she be a lady whose rank be rather disparaged than otherwise by sort with edmund spenser albeit he blood be noble : -- to all those happy blessing which you have with plenteous hand by heaven upon you throw this one disparagement they to you give that you you love lend to so mean a one _ amorettus _ sonnet lxvi spenser devoted two entire poem expressly to this passion -- to wit the amorettus describe its vicissitude and the epithalamion or marriage song in which he celebrate its consummation there be many allusion to it also in the faëry queen and colin clout 's come home again and from these source we propose to supply the name the lineage and residence of the happy fair she be undoubtedly a person of rank and blood residing in the poet 's vicinage and be so describe in many of the sonnet she be constantly address as a lady enjoy the respect and the elegancy if not the luxury of she condition -- well-educated accomplish in the art of design and embroidery -- at whose father 's house the poet be no infrequent visitor she residence or that of she family could not have be far from kilcolman castle and be seat most probably on the bank of the mullum -lrb- spenser 's favorite stream -rrb- a tributary of the blackwater which empty into the sea at youghal for she be see for the first time in the faëry queen as the love of colin clout -lrb- spenser -rrb- dancing among the nymph and grace -- herself a fourth grace -- on a mountain-top the description of which exactly correspond with all he other description of he beloved mole -- a mountain which nearly overhang he castle -lrb- 12 -rrb- and undoubtedly the bridesmaid and companion who attend she at the hymeneal altar be the nymph of mullum and of the river of the forest green and of the sea that neighbor to she near -- a localization which would fix she family mansion somewhere between kilcolman castle and the prosperous seaport town of youghal -- but somewhat nearer to the former this limit we inquiry within the narrow range of the land border the mullum water but we poet we believe do not stop with these ambiguous indication of she birthplace and family he have promise she to immortalize the triumph of he passion and to leave to all posterity a monument of the rare wonderment of the lady 's beauty -lrb- 13 -rrb- he have go farther and in three several sonnet -lrb- 14 -rrb- vow to eternize she name -- you glorious name in golden monument -- after he own fashion and to the best of he ability we have no right then to doubt that he fulfil he promise and if we can fix upon any distinctive appellation or epithet address to she common to the several poem which professedly reveal he passion and solvable into the name of a person whose residence and circumstance correspond with those ascribe to the lady by she worshipper may we not most reasonably conclude that we have at length discover the long-lost secret to begin with the beginning -- the amorettus here she be a _ angel _ in all mood and tense the leaf line and rhyme be teach that when they behold that _ angel 's _ bless look they shall seek she to please alone -lrb- 15 -rrb- in a subsequent sonnet she be a : _ angel _ come to lead frail mind to rest in chaste desire on heavenly beauty bind -lrb- 16 -rrb- again the poet deny that the glorious portrait of that _ angel 's _ face can be express by any art by pen or pencil -lrb- 17 -rrb- again she be of the brood of _ angel _ heavenly bear -lrb- 18 -rrb- and yet again she be divine and bear of heavenly seed -lrb- 19 -rrb- once more we be bid go visit she in she chaste bower of rest accompany with _ angel-like _ delight -lrb- 20 -rrb- turn we next to the epithalamion and here the same cuckoo-note be repeat _ usque ad nauseam _ we be tell that to look upon she we should ween some _ angel _ she have be -lrb- 21 -rrb- even she bridesmaid -lrb- she sister probably -rrb- be think to be _ angel _ and address they the bridegroom say sing ye sweet _ angel _ alleluya sing -lrb- 22 -rrb- finally in colin clout 's come home again the poet very dexterously evade the royal anger of elizabeth sure to be arouse by the preference of any beauty to she own to deceive the queen -- to whom in gratitude for past favor and mayhap with a lively appreciation of other yet to come he be offer up homage -- he describe she majesty by the very same imagery he have elsewhere employ to depict he lady-love and ostensibly apply to the royal elizabeth the amatory term which be covertly mean for a elizabeth of he own -- between whom and she royal type he either see or affect to see a personal resemblance here we find she place by the poet : amongst the seat of _ angel _ heavenly work much like a _ angel _ in all form and fashion the metaphoric ` angel ' of enamored swain be at once so trite and obvious that both the invention and vocabulary of the lover who abide by it so perpetually must have be poor and narrow beyond anything we can conceive of spenser 's fecundity of language and imagery if we sit down content to imagine that no more be mean by its recurrence than meet the eye we be satisfied that this title or simile -- call it what you will -- be the key-word of the mystery and we must now look around the neighborhood of the mullum for a family-surname out of which this angel can be extract by the alchemy of wit on consult the great record of munster vol vi we find a family reside in the neighborhood of kilcolman castle whose name and circumstance correspond exactly with all the requirement of we angel-ic theory the nagle be a very ancient and respectable family whose principal seat be in the northern part of the county of cork and the adjoining border of the county of waterford there seem to have be two race of they distinguish by the color of they hair into the red nagle and the black nagle and of the former the lord or chieftain of the tribe reside at moneanymmy a ancient preceptory of the knight of st john beautifully seat on the bank of the mullum where it disembogue its tribute into the blackwater on its passage to cappoquin and youghal and at a convenient distance from spenser 's kilcolman elizabeth nagle belong to the _ red _ branch of the family we shall find no difficulty in accounting for she alleged resemblance to queen elizabeth the proprietor of moneanymmy strictly contemporaneous with spenser be john nagle whose son david die in the city of dublin in 1637 it be therefore but fair to suppose that in 1593 -lrb- the year of spenser 's marriage -rrb- this david might have have a sister of marriageable age for he himself by he marriage with ellen roche of ballyhowly have a daughter ellen who in due time be marry to sylvanus the eldest son of edmund spenser if we supposition be correct therefore ellen and sylvanus be link by the double bond of cousinhood and matrimony unfortunately for we spenserian inquiry however the full and regular pedigree of these nagle commence only with david whose marriage and the issue thereof be record at large in irish book of heraldry whereas the precede generation to a remote antiquity be merely notify by the bare name of the son and heir as they succeed to the inheritance john nagle may have have a daughter marriageable at the time of spenser 's marriage and she may have marry the poet -- and do we be convince -- even though she family belong to the romish persuasion and the bridegroom to the protestant church to this untoward circumstance -- the difference in religion -- there be curious reference make in a remarkable passage of the amorettus which seem not only to indicate the name of she family but to screen the poet himself from the penalty denounce against protestant who intermarry with roman catholic in the sixty-first sonnet the lady be say to be : divinely work and of the _ brood of angel _ heavenly bear and with the _ crew of bless saint _ upbrought each of which do she with they gift adorn here we have distinctly she _ birth _ and _ education _ each assign to a different source she be of the brood or family of anagrammatic angel -- otherwise nagle but have be upbrought or instruct by person whom spenser denominate saint or orthodox protestant for spenser be by party and profession a puritan and the puritan be saint -- to such as choose to accept they own account of the matter but there may be a yet deeper mean a anagrammatic appropriateness in this phrase crew of bless saint the nagle of moneanymmy have intermarry frequently with the st leger of doneraile and thus such a close intimacy be establish between the family as to warrant the supposition that a child of the one house might have be rear amongst the member of the other elizabeth spenser -lrb- bear nagle -rrb- may not unlikely have be educate by the puritan st leger the name st leger as camden remark be a compound name derive from the german _ leodigar _ or _ leger _ signify the gatherer of the people verstigan also give it the same translation as originate from _ leod _ _ lud _ or _ luyd _ which he say mean folk or people -lrb- 23 -rrb- therefore st leger seem to signify a folk a gather a legion or crew of saint a holy crowd or crew -- which may have be the quibble extort by spenser 's alchemy of wit from the upbringing of elizabeth nagle he wife he call she with marked emphasis he sweet _ saint _ he sovereign _ saint _ and in the epithalamion the temple-gate be call on to : receive this _ saint _ with honor due in pray to the god for a large posterity he place he request on the ground that from the earth -lrb- which may they long possess with lasting happiness -rrb- up to you haughty palace may mount of bless _ saint _ for to increase the count there be yet another solution beside the anagrammatic one for the name of angel so sedulously apply by the poet to he beloved the nagle family accord to heraldry be divide into three branch distinguish by peculiarity of surname the southern branch sign themselves nagle -- the meath or midland branch nangle -- while the connaught or western shoot rejoice in the more euphonious cognomen of _ costello _ let the herald account for these variation we take they as we find they the letter n as we be inform accord to the genius of the irish tongue be nothing more than a prefix set _ euphoniæ gratiâ _ before the radical name itself when commence with a vowel thus the n'angle of ireland be the angle whose heroic deed be duly record in the list of the battle of hasting they go over to ireland with strongbow one branch assume -lrb- can the herald tell we why -rrb- the name of costello -- another become n'angle and the southern shoot dwarf down they heavenly origin into prosaic nagle the well-known punning exclamation of pope gregory on observe the fairness and beauty of some english child -- non anglus sed angeli forent si essent christianus -- may have set the fervid brain of spenser on fire and suggest the divine origin of she he love between elizabeth de angelis -- the pun of gregory -- and elizabeth de angulo -- the latter be the derivation of herald and lawyer -- what poet could hesitate a moment we task be do we think we have establish we case by anagram elizabeth nagle make a perfect _ angel _ by heraldry and a pontifical pun the n'angle of the county of meath be _ angel _ in indefeasible succession elizabeth belong to the red branch of she family and therefore must have resemble the royal elizabeth she be bring up among the crew of saint in the st leger family and finally she place of residence correspond with that depict by the passionate shepherd as the home of he second mistress we think we have satisfy all the requirement of reasonable conviction and confidently await the verdict of that select few who may feel interest in this purely literary investigation guide by the rule of anagram here lay down and illustrate some future commentator more deeply verse in the history and scandal of the

and slender pittance a package of envelope now and then a few lead pencil a box of steel pen a slate pencil to a school-boy be all its sale almost the last regular customer have secede to the hendrik book bazaar and periodical emporium -- a pert rival that with multifarious new-fangled trick of attractiveness flash its plate-glass eye and turn up its gilded nose at miss wimple from the other side of the way but miss wimple 's proud and honorable fund for the relief of the shop by no means fall off as she have anticipate she expert and nimble needle be in steady demand by all the folk of hendrik who have fine sewing to give out she earnings from this source be considerable and severely stint herself in the very necessaries of life by a strained ingenuity of economy to which the skimp delaine -- turn and alter to the utter exhaustion of the cleverest dressmaker 's invention and magically rejuvenate as though again and again dip in the fountain of perpetual youth -- bear conclusive testimony she bravely reinforce she fund from time to time miss wimple 's repast be neither frequent nor sumptuous all the delicacy of the season hardly find they way to she table and in she bleak little nest for it be now winter a thin and scanty shawl but coldly do the office of a blanket but miss wimple partook of she tea and dry toast with a cheerful heart and shiver in she nest with illustrious patience -- regale by satisfied honor and warm by the smile of courage and of hope between simon and herself negotiation rest where we leave they last only there be now a heartier welcome for he when he come and often a sparkling smile that seem to say he have wait well and not in vain she hope -- a smile that to the eye of he healthy spirit be a earnest of the rose-star 's reappearance it be only behind the rusty skimped delaine as behind a cloud he visit be not so rare as before nor always upon business he linger sometimes and sometimes have _ he _ way one night simon be outrageously rebellious he have cheat sally of half a hour and spend it in rank mutiny he compare the rose-star to the remotest of the asteroid as see through lord rosse 's telescope and institute facetious comparison between miss wimple 's honorable fund and the national debt of england it be near closing-time miss wimple say now simon _ will _ you go -- she have say that three time already some one enter o ho miss wimple snatch away she hand : -- now go or never come again simon glance at the visitor -- a woman -- a stranger evidently and poor -- a beggar most likely or one of those wander jew of womankind who homeless goalless hopeless tramp tramp tramp unresting till they die she have almost burst in quite startling miss wimple but now she stand by the glass case with avert face and shabby shawl draw suspiciously about she and wait to be notice peer meanwhile through the little window into the dark street good-night little sally say simon put up you bar and so put up my bar now there be a fine speech for you -- if my name be philip withers you would call it poetry the strange woman actually stamp with she foot twice and move a step nearer to the window miss wimple take it for a gesture of impatience and at once arise to accost she simon eye she curiously and somewhat suspiciously as he pass but take she attire for he clue he think he recognize one of a class with whom miss wimple be accustom to cope successfully so he take he leave unconcerned miss wimple approach the stranger what will you have she ask but the woman only follow simon with she eye not heed the question do you hear I repeat she i say what will you have madam by that time simon have disappear among the distant shadow of the street the woman turn suddenly and confront miss wimple look at I she say miss wimple look and see a pale and haggard almost fierce face that have once be fair -- one that she might she fancy have meet somewhere before you seem to have suffer -- to suffer now what can i do for you look at I i see you be very wretched and you be not always as you be now you be cold be you hungry also i too be very poor but i will do all i can i will warm you and give you food the woman walk to where the bright camphene lamp hang and stand under it now look at I miss wimple i have look enough desperation on a young woman 's face be not a pleasant sight to see if you have a secret best keep it i have to deal only with you weariness you hunger and you half-frozen limb if i can do nothing for those you must go -- merciful heaven miss madeline splurge yes -- now hide I quick or some one will be come and warm I and feed I or i shall surely die on you hand not another word say miss wimple -- ask no question utter no exclamation of surprise but straightway run and close the window put up the bar adjust the shutter in the glass door and screw they down next she take madeline 's hand and lead she up the narrow staircase to the nest seat she in the little yankee rocking-chair and wrap she in the scanty fade shawl that serve for a coverlet then she run quickly down into the cellar and with a hammer break in piece a old packing-box -- it be a brave achievement for she tender hand back to the nest again with the stick -- madeline sleep in the chair poor heart miss wimple make a fire in she little stove and when some water be hot she rouse she guest with a kiss silently languidly and with closed eye madeline yield herself to the kind office of she gentle nurse who bath she face and neck she hand and foot and dress she hair and when that be do she place a pillow under the wanderer 's head and with another kiss dismiss she to sleep again then she prepare tea and toast and run down to the street return quickly with some fresh egg and a morsel of golden butter wherefrom she prepare a toothsome supper the fragrance of which presently arouse the famished sufferer so that she open she eye feebly and smile and kiss miss wimple 's hand when she come to draw she nearer to the table then madeline eat -- not heartily but enough to comfort she and very soon she head fall back upon the pillow and she would have sleep in the chair again hold miss wimple 's hand but miss wimple arise and take the sheet from the cot and have warm they by the fire make up the bed afresh -- a most smooth sweet and comfortable nest and raise madeline in she arm support she still sleep head upon she shoulder she very tenderly and skilfully remove she garment all coarse and torn soil and damp and clothe she afresh in pure night-clothes of she own but first -- for madeline begin to shiver and she tooth have chatter slightly -- miss wimple untie she own warm petticoat of quilted silk that for comfort and for decency have be she best friend through the hard winter -- wherefore it be most dearly prize and ingeniously save -- and put it upon madeline whom then she lead almost carry she as one may lead a worn-out and already slumber child to the nest and lay she gently there draw the cover snugly about she and spread the faithful shawl over all and all the while not a word have be speak by either -- with one it be the silence of pious carefulness -- with the other of newly-found safety and perfect rest then miss wimple place the lamp on the floor behind the door feed the stove with fresh stick and with she foot on the little iron hearth and she head rest on she knee think there all night all night poor madeline 's slumber be break by incoherent muttering convulsive start and more than once a fearful cry and when the day dawn she suddenly sit erect stare wildly about she and rave a fierce though brief fever have seize she she be delirious and know not where she be when miss wimple would have soothe she tenderly caress and promise she a sister 's kindness and protection -- a home safely guard from intrusion -- madeline assail she savagely bid she be off with she smooth treachery she pretty lie ` sister ' -- devil do i not know what a hell you ` home ' be -- and as for ` safety ' shall i seek that among snake oh i be sick of all of you -- have i not tell you so a hundred time -- sick with the contempt i feel for you and weary of you stupid trick madeline say miss wimple look at I here -- touch my face my dress do you not know I now do you not see that i be not you mother nor josephine nor adelaide but only sally wimple little miss wimple of the bookstore what harm could i do you -- how could i offend or hurt you look I in the eye i say and know I and be calm see this be my chamber -- this be my bed below be the little shop -- the athenæum you remember we be alone in the house there be no one to hear or see you come to I -- do you not -- over the long weary road through the darkness and the bitter cold for warmth and food for rest and safety and i have hide you away and watch by you look around you -- look through that window do you not know those tree the mulberry by the athenæum -- they be bare now but you have see they so before a dozen winter look at this face -- look at this dress -- look at this dress -- ah now you know all about it -- ` little miss wimple ' of course and this shall be you home and you be safe here when miss wimple begin to speak she stand somewhat off from the bed for madeline with a gesture full of hate and close-set lip that look dangerous have thrust she back but as she proceed with she calm and clear appeal madeline be arrest in the very movement of spring from the bed in a attitude worth a painter 's eye half-sit half-reclining support by she right arm which rigidly extend be plant pillar-like in the bed -- with she left hand toss aside the bed-clothes -- she knee draw up as for the instant of step out upon the floor -- she right shoulder bare round and white thrust from the night-dress which in the restlessness of she distraction have burst its chaste fastening bestow a chance glimpse of a most proud and beauteous bosom -- a glimpse but dimly catch through the thick brown mesh of she dishevelled hair so now with impatient eye and eager lip she rest and listen and when miss wimple say -- i have hide you away and watch by you the fierce look be soften to one of pitiful reflection and recollection and at the word look at this dress ah now you know all about it -- ` little miss wimple ' of course she sit up and stretch forth she arm beseechingly and in a moment be sob helplessly on sally 's neck a little while miss wimple still and thoughtful hold she so that she soul 's bitterness might pour itself out in wholesome tear then she gently stroke the tangled brown hair and say -- sit close beside I now and lean upon my bosom and tell I all -- where you have be and how you have fare and what you would have I do with a brave effort madeline control herself and reply firmly though with avert face you remember dear miss wimple we last interview i insulted you then miss wimple make no sign madeline blush -- brow neck and bosom -- crimson and then i tell you that i believe in you as i believe in little else in this world or the next and i say that if in my hour of shame and outcasting i could implore the help of any human be i would come to you before all other i have come you think I rave then and pity I because you do not understand presently you will understand and you will still pity I -- but with a difference i flee away that very night you recollect -- flee from my self-contempt from the sickening scorn i feel for they -- for _ he _ there be agony in the effort with which she utter that last word she name no name but with a sort of desperation raise she head and look miss wimple in the face in the quick sensitive glance they interchange at that moment the omission be supply though my flight be premeditated i take with I no clothes save those i wear but i have conceal on my person every jewel and trinket i possess with these -- for i readily convert they into money -- i purchase a safe asylum in a obscure but decent family whose poverty do not afford they the indulgence of a scrupulous fastidiousness or impertinent curiosity it be enough for they straitened conscience that i have the manners and the purse of a lady -- they ask no question which might cost they a profitable boarder the only one they could accommodate in they poor way i have no fear that any hue-and-cry would be raise for I i have leave behind I two who would prevent that -- in that my worst foe be my best friend if i have any relative who care for I enough to pursue I i rejoice in at least one sister on whose cunning if not good sense i could rely to convince they of the futility of such effort -- one _ friend _ whose fear would be ingenious and busy to put the best-laid chase at fault so i lay conceal and safe till the time come when i have to purchase pity help and precious secrecy my discreet host could furnish those extra but they be poor and such luxury be expensive in new york -- it be not long before my last dollar be go i have be ill -- _ ill _ miss wimple -- and every way cripple i could not if the work have offer itself to I have earn more then my last trinket be go i have pawn whatever i could spare from the hard exigency of live for i be no coward -- i do not wish to die -- i have challenge my fate and would meet it i have even change with the woman of the house the silk dress i wear and my fine linen for the mean rag you cleanse I of last night -- that they might pay themselves so and when all be expend and the last trick try that pride honor and modesty could wink at i come away in the night leave no unsettled score behind I but i see my own resource sink fast i know i must presently be debtor to some one for protection aid and counsel i remember you -- and that i have say i could beg of

she wilful way may not if she be strong and truly proud retrace she step to fall in at last -- though last of all the straggler -- with the happy procession of honor woman -- of woman who have do the best they could and bear they burden bravely miss wimple sit on the side of the bed she chin rest on she clasped hand she gaze fix vacantly on the floor -- poor baby dead -- thank god be all she say

word to say for myself and as she speak miss wimple go to she little bureau and unlock a drawer draw from it a miniature rosewood cabinet unlock that again she take something out which as she return to resume she seat beside madeline be hide in she hand miss splurge say miss wimple the night on which you disappear so strangely from this place i have be visit a sick friend on the other side of the river and return home at a late hour -- that be about nine o'clock perhaps as i enter the covered bridge i hear the voice of a lady and a gentleman in excited conversation madeline become deadly pale but she do not speak utter no exclamation -- only a slight movement of she eyebrow express eagerness as she turn more attentively to miss wimple who proceed as though unconscious of any trace of emotion in she companion the voice of the gentleman be familiar to I the lady 's i do not at first recognize -- something have change its quality suppose themselves alone -- for it be plain they have not hear I approach and enter the bridge -- they be incautious they word reach I distinctly i might have retrace my step and wait till they have go but the moon be shine brightly and the night be very still -- in a pause of they conversation they might have hear or see I i choose to _ spare _ they that so i fall back into a corner where the shadow be deepest and remain quite quiet until they go away i have tell you that i hear they word but i do not understand they then -- now i do madeline bow she head miss wimple seem not to observe that but continue in the same quiet even tone : -- when they have go i find lie in the moonlight near the bridge -- this miss wimple hold out the little pocket-book madeline start make a quick movement as though to snatch the book but check herself with a effort and say with stern composure -- well well say miss wimple there it be and it be yours it contain a card for the safety of which you be once concern it have remain as safe from that hour to this -- not only from my curiosity but that of all other be they friend or foe of yours -- as though you have keep it hidden in you bosom and defend it with you tooth and nail _ on my honor _ in these last word and only then miss wimple show that she could remember a insult and avenge it -- in she own way she drop the pocket-book into the lap of madeline who without a word place it in she bosom and now my poor madeline say miss wimple we will speak no more of these thing i beg you to understand I clearly -- and miss wimple suddenly alter she tone -- we must not recur to this subject you will remain with I until we shall have decide what be best for we to do you be quite safe in this house that you be ever here need not be know hereafter unless you honor or you happiness should require that we divulge it i must go now and open the shop and when i return to you we will speak if you please of other thing _ but miss wimple 's hoop -- will you never come to that or be it you intention to ` omit the part of hamlet by particular request _ ' slowly and fairly -- we come to it now chapter iv when the neat and modest little mistress of the hendrik athenæum and circulate library descend to open the shop and take down the bar all she sense of delicacy be shock and she be bring to shame for she meek skirt miss the generous support of the quilted silk petticoat cling about she mortified extremity in thin and limp dejection it be plain to miss wimple that she look poverty-stricken -- a aspect most dreadful to the poor and upon which the brother and sister of penury who by hook or by crook contrive to keep up appearance for the nonce have no mercy today she think caller will delight I not nor customer neither but miss wimple be in a peculiarly provoke predicament and for such there be ever a malignant star -- caller and customer drop in one after another all day as they have rarely come before -- as though indeed she most spiteful enemy have get wind of the petticoat affair and send they to plague she that day miss wimple have recourse to as much painfully ingenious dodge behind the low counter as though she have a cloven foot to hide when evening come she could have sit down -- if she have be any other plague woman in the world but sally wimple -- and have a good cry it be bitter weather and she have shiver much -- she do not mind that but to look poverty-stricken no she do not cry _ outside _ but it be a narrow escape in she trouble she eye wander around the shop beseechingly and lo she behold in the window a timely hooped skirt -- a daring speculation wherein she have lately invest in consideration of the grow importance of she millinery department and straightway miss wimple go and take the hoop and offer it up for a pride-offering in the stead of she delicacy that be so dear to she it be a thing of touching artlessness to do only so cunning-simple a soul as sally wimple could ever have think of it she sit up late that night engage in compromise with she prejudice by draw out the whalebone one by one from the albonus shave they down with a piece of glass very thin and tuck they -- until all they loud defiance be subdue and for miss wimple 's hoop it might be tenderly deprecate that it be nothing to speak of such a _ leetle _ one the sacrifice be make and let we hope not merely figuratively accept by he to whom _ prejudice _ may arise today a offering not less honor than be the blood of ram in the hour when abraham lay he first-born on a altar in the thicket of jehovah-jireh if any challenge the probability of this incident and cavil at the chance that miss wimple 's necessity could under any circumstance bring forth such a invention i hope i have only to remind they that that brave angel have become straitened to a point whereat she have neither material from which to erect another quilted petticoat nor the means of procure it even if she could spare the time necessary to the making of one -- which she could not be now closely occupy between the engagement of she hire needle and the newly-found care that charity have impose upon she but however the probability may appear miss wimple 's hoop be a shaved-whalebone fact and the quilted petticoat would never have be miss but for the officious scrutiny of the eye and the provoke prating of the tongue of a sophisticated few who marvel greatly at the pliancy and the perfect set of miss wimple 's albonus -- and that demure little prig too who would have think it as for simon blount he be quick to perceive the new experience to which the skimp delaine have be introduce and at first it disturb and embarrass he but he light elastic temper soon recover its careless buoyancy with a sly smile at what he consider a oddity newly discover in the character of he prim sweetheart oh it be all right of course he think sally know what she be about but it be very funny and so if this strange disturbing of the established order of thing in the kingdom of wimple have rest with the exaltation of the hoop that body politic would presently have be reduce to tranquillity no doubt and the all-agogness of hendrik would have come quietly to nought like any other popular flutter follow upon a new thing under the sun but in a romantic cause the conscientiousness of miss wimple for all she seeming matter-of-fact take on a quality of chivalry and she display a quixotism most tiltfully disposed toward any windmill of conventional propriety that might plant itself in the way by which she beauteous and distressed damsel be to escape so before all the decency of hendrik have recover from the shock of the hoop she throw they into a new and worse conniption by a even more daring innovation upon they good easy notion of she for the next thing she do be -- a basque and flounce thus it happen : -- madeline have become quite another madeline -- say a magdalen rather -- under the gentle discipline of she admirable angel she wonted distraction have subside into a pensive sadness which manifest itself in many a grateful graceful tenderness toward that glorifier of the skimped delaine she have observe the hoop at once and greet it with a solitary smile accept it for a happy sign and a token for she have recognize simon blount when she turn into the shop that night out of the darkness and the cold and with the alert intelligence of a woman even so self-absorbed as she be then have construe he gallant good-night she think she understand miss wimple 's hoop because she have not discover the poetry in miss wimple 's quilted petticoat they have not speak of those thing again delicacy be the law for those two and to do they best and thankfully bravely accept the first deliverance heaven might send they be they religion like two micawber of faith hope and charity they wait for something to turn up miss wimple invest a daily three-cent piece in a new york paper and diligently con the want before the marriage and death -- extraordinary woman a opening have but to show itself and miss wimple be ready to fling she character into the breach for the benefit of she magdalen strong-minded woman at last it come a gentleman who have recently lose he wife want a house-keeper and governess for he two little girl -- the office to be unite in the person of a lady by birth education and association to such a liberal salary would be give and in case she should be in straitened circumstance a reasonable advance would be make to enable the lady to assume at once the position of a respected member of he family the very place now what do that dashing miss wimple-quixote -- of such be the kingdom of heaven -- but sit down and pour she enormous little heart out in a letter to a person she have never see or hear of -- tell he everything but name and locality and appeal with a inspiration to he divine spark there be no doubt that for that occasion only providence send a advertiser to the tribune to justify the large faith of pity in skimped delaine for the word of hope and love that miss wimple let fall unstudied from the heart fall upon a genial mind and lo -- it raise a sister from the dust it save a soul from death the gentleman -- the nobleman -- thank he unknown correspondent whose hand he would esteem it a honor to touch for the opportunity she have afford he to do good in a graceful way mr morri -lrb- miss wimple have write : let we know this poor lady as ` mr morris ' a childless widow -rrb- should be most welcome to he house she need never be aware that the sad passage of she history have come to he knowledge and by all over whom he exercise authority or influence she _ sorrow _ should be reverence he take the liberty to inclose a check which mr morri would have the goodness to regard as a small advance on she salary she would make whatever preparation she might deem necessary at she perfect leisure he would be happy to see she as soon as it should be quite agreeable to she to come once more with all he heart he thank the admirable lady who have in so remarkable a manner distinguish he by she noble impulse of confidence it would be he dearest duty hereafter to deserve it and he give he address : lawrence osgood fourteenth st new york it be evident that the necessary preparation for madeline 's appearance in this new _ rôle _ could not be make in hendrik miss wimple be distressingly sensitive for the safety of she _ protégée _ from scandalous discovery even she herself could not expend any considerable portion of mr osgood 's advance without arouse surmise and provoke dangerous prying besides how should she get the money for the check -- to whom dare she confess herself in possession of it of course _ there _ be a conclusive impossibility nevertheless something must be do at once to put madeline at least in travel trim for the thing of which -- to use she own sensitive expression -- miss wimple have cleanse she when she come be out of the question it be as true of this poor young lady in she trunkless plight as of any dishevelled marius in crinoline who sit down and weep among the brand-new ruin of a carthage of satin lawn and lace that she have nothing to wear so miss wimple encourage by the happy success of the hoop stratagem forthwith begin to cast about she and for the present mr osgood 's letter and the check be hush up in she bosom now miss wimple and madeline splurge be example of how much we view of a person 's character have to do with we notion of he or she stature or carriage all hendrik speak of the demure heroine of the skimped delaine as _ little _ miss wimple and madeline though the youngest of the sister be universally know as miss splurge -- as it be awfully yet miss wimple and madeline be almost exactly of a size by any measurement and miss wimple 's clothes be a sweet fit for madeline the petticoat experiment have discover that so the skimped delaine miss wimple think must be promote to the proud person of the handsome madeline and something must be find to take its place now among store of respectable family-rubbish scrupulously save by half a graveyard-full of female relation -- for the women-folk of the wimple have be ever note for they thrift -- a certain quaint garment have come down to sally from she great-grandmother it be a black silken wonder wherewith no doubt that traditionally dear delightful creature be wont to astonish the street in the day of she vanity and frivolous vexation of spirit a generous expanse of cape pertain to it and it be cut much shorter behind than before in order to display to advantage the pert red heel whereon that antique wimple aforetime exalted herself with some trifling alteration say miss wimple to herself this will do nicely for I and my delaine -- which be not so very bad after all -- a little cleaning will do wonder for it -- will look sweetly appropriate on the widow morri while she outfit be make in new york so miss wimple let down the dress behind by piece it in the back just below the waist and from the generous cape she make a basque to hide the alteration and some stain like iron-mould on the skirt she cover with three flounce make of some fine crape that be leave from she mother 's funeral _ but by you leave where be this ` silken wonder ' when you unhandy heroine be cast about she for a substitute for the quilted petticoat _ anywhere but in she mind of the _ round-aboutness _ of she directness you have have example enough already nothing could be more romantic than she simplest reality and that which would seem most out-of-the-way to another woman be often handiest to she so when you ask I why do not sally wimple sooner think of she great-grandmother 's dress my easiest answer be because she _ be _ sally wimple when miss wimple first put on the new dress in madeline 's presence madeline smile again for she think she understand and miss wimple smile also for she know no one could understand then miss wimple break the news to madeline by tell she that a old friend of she father 's a wealthy mr osgood of new york be in want of a governess for he two daughter and have write to she on the subject -- -lrb- a not very improbable story for madeline could not but be aware that in the conscientious and proud little bookseller be the making of a very respectable jane eyre under favorable circumstance -rrb- -- whereupon she have take the liberty to recommend a clever and accomplished friend of she own one mr morri a widow -- of course that be you madeline -- and mr osgood have accordingly do she the honor to offer the place to mr morri and with characteristic consideration and delicacy have inclose a check by way of a advance on she salary which would be liberal to defray the expense of a outfit -- and there it be he write to she miss wimple say be a circumstance as strange as it be fortunate for in fact she have personally but a very slight acquaintance with he and be quite sure she should not recognize he if she be to see he now -- as for he little girl she have never see they nor even hear they name but mr osgood 's character be of the very highest and she rejoice that madeline would have so honorable influential and generous a protector who have give he word that she should be receive and entertain with the consideration due to a superior and esteemed friend -lrb- never mind miss wimple 's white lie my dear there be no danger that they will be find fill the blank place in the recording angel 's book leave where he tear blot out my uncle toby 's oath and in a purely worldly point of view too those touching offering to mercy be safe enough for when miss wimple promise madeline that she would find mr osgood a singularly discreet person who would be sure not to annoy she with impertinent curiosity it be not say by way of a hint -- she well know that from the moment the proud and jealous madeline depart across the threshold of the hendrik athenæum and circulate library she would set a close and solemn seal upon she heart and upon she lip and the old familiar face and place would be to she as the thing that memory be a silent widow for nevertheless in write to mr osgood to acknowledge the receipt of the check and to thank he that cunning miss wimple take the precaution to put he in possession of as much of _ she _ personality as would serve he purpose in case of accident and provide for the chance of a shock to he suspicious and vigilant governess -rrb- madeline receive miss wimple 's extraordinary good news with the silence of one bewildered nor even when she have come fully to appreciate all the beauty and the joy of it do she give audible expression to she gratitude she be too proud -- or rather say too religious -- to subject the divine emotion to the vulgar ordeal of word she only kiss miss wimple 's hand and mutely lay they on she bosom then miss wimple array she _ protégée _ in the skimp delaine for which the trifling alteration and the little cleaning _ have _ do wonder -- and madeline be as it be clothe on with chastity and miss wimple be jubilant over the charming effect and go on in a manner surprising to behold first she kiss madeline and then she kiss the dress and she tell madeline in a small torrent of triumph what a tremendous fellow of a skimped delaine it be -- how cheap and how _ dear _ it be -- what remarkable power of endurance it have display and with what force and versatility of character it have adapt itself to every new alteration or trim -- and how she be so use to its way and it to hers that she be almost ready to believe it could get on she by itself -- and how she feel sure it be expressly manufacture to do good in the world -- until she have so glorified the lowly skimped delaine that madeline begin to feel in it like a queen whose benignant star have forever exalt she above the vulgar sensation of have nothing to wear now madeline be quite ready to depart on she pilgrimage of penitence but almost at the parting hour a circumstance occur which grievously alarm miss wimple and so rouse the devil whereof madeline have be but just now possess that it stir within she chapter v the nest look out upon the street by two front window that be immediately over the sign of the hendrik athenæum and circulate library there be also a small side-window afford a view of a bit of yard quite private and pleasant in its season with a oval patch of grass some hollyhock a grape-vine train over a pretty structure of lattice to form a sort of summer-house and a martin-box in a decidedly original church-pattern mount on a tall white pole of course the scene be cheerless and unsightly now lumpy brown patch of earth show through the unequally melting snow where the grass-plot should have be a few naked and ugly stick be all the promise of the hollyhock ' yellow glory the bare grape-vine show on the dingy lattice like a tangled mesh of weather-stained rope and there be no bird in last year 's nest to make the martin-box look social this little window be madeline 's chosen seat and hither she bring sometimes a book but more frequently a portion of miss wimple 's work from the millinery department and wholesomely employ she mind skilfully she finger here she could look out upon the earth and sky and enjoy unspied the sympathy of they desolation -- never daring to think of all the maddening memory that lay under the front window : those she have never once approach never even turn she eye towards miss wimple have observe that but on the day of the installation of the basque and the flounce and the promotion of the skimp delaine late in the afternoon the twilight -lrb- fall as madeline sit at the side-window gazing vacantly down upon the forlornness of the little yard and miss wimple stand at the front window gaze as abstractedly down upon the hard pitiless coldness of the street -rrb- -- the thought of both intent on the _ must _ of they parting on the morrow and the _ how _ of madeline 's go -- suddenly madeline leave she safe seat and come and lean upon miss wimple 's shoulder look over it into the street only a minute half a minute but -- surely the enemy tempt she -- too long for ere miss wimple quick as she be to take the alarm could turn and lead she away madeline 's vigilant fierce glance have catch sight of he -lrb- alack philip withers -rrb- and ashen-pale with part lip and suspend breath and wide blaze eye she stand root there and stare at he but miss wimple drag she away just in time -- no he have not see she -- and for a brief space the two woman stand together near the bed in the corner farthest from the window and miss wimple hold madeline 's face close down upon she own shoulder and press she hand commandingly and whisper hush so they stand in silence -- no cry no word escape and when presently madeline with a long heart-heaved sigh raise she head and look miss wimple in the face there be blood on she lip and blood be on miss wimple 's dress yea the basque and flounce disguise be raggedly rent at the shoulder then madeline go and lay down upon the bed and turn she face to the wall -- and there be no noise and miss wimple cover the blood and the rent on she shoulder with she mother 's lace cape -- the familiar companion of the skimped delaine -- and go down into the shop when miss wimple have put up the bar ascend to the nest to join madeline in the little cot -- madeline sleep quietly enough but a trace of blood with all its sad story be on she lip and a linger frown of pain on she brow very carefully not to disturb she miss wimple lay down by she side but not to sleep -- she thought be anxiously busy with the morrow in the morning when miss wimple awake she eye meet the eye of madeline no longer fierce and wild but full of patience and tender gratitude the brave magdalen lean on she elbow in the bed have be watch miss wimple as she sleep she poor heart fairly oppressed with its thankfulness to god and to he save minister when miss wimple open she eye madeline bent over she and kiss she on the forehead and miss wimple smile then both arise and put on they garment -- madeline the skimped delaine and miss wimple the flounce oh the grotesque pathos of that exchange -- and madeline do not remark with what haste and a certain awkward bashfulness miss wimple retire to a far corner and cover she shoulder with the lace cape all that day the two woman be very still -- the approach hour of parting be not advert to between they but the low tone in which they speak of other and lesser thing show that it be first of all in they thought and on they heart to the latest moment they merely _ understand each other _ the car go from the branch station at ten o'clock it be nine when miss wimple release from its old-fashioned bandbox -- as naturally as if it have be all along agree upon between they and not as be truly the case utterly forget until then -- she well-saved and but little used bonnet of black straw and put it on madeline 's head kiss she as a mother do she child as she tie the bow under she chin and she take from the bed the faithful shawl and draw it snugly tenderly around madeline 's shoulder -- madeline only blush to resist to remonstrate she well know have be in vain there have be some exchange of character you perceive no less than of costume and now where shall we put those ask miss wimple holding in she hand mr osgood 's check and a trifle of ready money for the immediate need of the journey madeline reply by silently draw from she bosom the little pocket-book and hand it to she friend who open it in a matter-of-course way that be full of delicacy and -- no doubt accidentally and innocently as to any trick of pretty sentiment -- deposit the check and the bank-note beside that card and now it be time to part miss wimple take up the dim chamber-lamp and lead madeline down the stair -- both silent calm : those be not cry woman as they enter the shop miss wimple immediately set down the lamp on the nearest end of the counter and go with madeline straight to the door whither its slender ray hardly reach and where the blood-spot and the rent on she shoulder might not be notice -- or at least not clearly define then with a business-like ah i have forget -- admirably feign -- she hastily remove the shawl from madeline 's shoulder and the lace cape from she own and she put the lace cape on madeline and cover it with the shawl this time madeline shrink and would have forbid the charitable surprise but miss wimple move as though to open the door and say -- madeline in mind and heart and soul do you feel ready yes then go -- believe in god and yourself and do the best you can and madeline say -- and you also must believe in I and pray for I be patient with I and wait if the time should ever come when i can comfort you with god 's help i will hasten to you wherever you may be and they kiss each other and both say god bless you so madeline depart quickly and presently be lose in the shadow beyond the shop-lamp -lrb- next morning when sally wimple go to take down the bar she neighbor be astonish for it be already report and believe that she have be see go from the athenæum to the ten o'clock train the night before -rrb- then miss wimple close the door and go back to she room where she sit down on the bed and have a good cry which be a great comfort when after that she arise and standing before the glass to undress herself perceive the blood-stain and the rent she straightway go and bring she work-basket and seat herself under the dim lamp without fear or hesitation cut down the dress _ low-neck _ -- there -- then she lay down in the bed and sleep sweetly with a smile on she face ah cunning artless sally wimple no wonder the dash directness of you character have ever by you neighbor be mistake for simplicity the thing which be easiest for you to do be ever the hardest thing for you to bear in the morning this new godiva of hendrik -- not less to be honor than she of coventry in all she undergo and overcome -- descend to she shop clothe on with chastity and then she dreadful trial begin i claim for she even more merit than the pure heart of the world have accord to she namesake who : take the tax away and build herself a everlasting name by as much as she task be harder herself more helpless and she reward less like she of coventry leave alone the passion of she mind as wind from all the compass shift and blow make war upon each other for a hour till pity win she say to the world -- if this woman pay you tax she die and the world mock -- you would not let you little finger ache for such as this but i would die say she -- and more -- i will bear you mocking and you hiss oh ay ay ay you talk say the world but we have see already she have no herald to send forth and bid he cry with sound of trumpet all the hard condition no palfrey await she wrapt in purple blazon with armorial gold for she indeed the little wide-mouthed head upon the spout have cunning eye to see the blind wall be full of chink and hole and overhead fantastic gable stare she have she low churl she peeping tom -- compact of thankless earth who bore moral auger-hole in fear and spy she nudeness be more complete than hers of coventry by as much as ridicule be more ruthless than coarse curiosity not merely the delicacy of she inmost bower but all the protection of she forlornness she expose naked to the town to take that tax away and when it be remove she could not hope to build herself a everlasting name ah no godiva of hendrik may not live in any city 's ancient legend this poor story must be all she monument let we lay the cap-stone then \* \* \* \* \* all the anger of scorn in hendrik be point at miss wimple all the sharp tongue of hendrik hiss at she and she good name fall at once into the portion of the vilest weed simon blount saw and hear and he soul be sorely trouble like all _ true _ love loyal and vigilant he love for sally be clear-sighted and sagacious infatuation be either gross passion or pretence -- the flash and bogus jewelry of the heart but true love though its eye may ache with the see see ever sharply all beautiful example teach that the blindness of love be not a parable but a imposture and simon see that sally be in a false position -- false to herself and to he for she deny he that confidence which he have a right to share share as he do all the scandal and the scorn and in that she be unconsciously unjust she deny herself the aid and comfort of he tender counsel and he approbation the protection of he understanding and believe when for he to understand and believe be for she to be safe and bold for even the pride of sally wimple overdo could become arrogance even she disinterestedness intemperately indulge in could take on the form of selfishness simon go to sally and say : tell I what all this mean but sally weak now in she very strength say : nothing let my way be my own way still i alone be answerable for they be ` believe and wait ' so hard to do i do not send for you then simon conceive a tremendous _ coup de coeur _ a daring one enough as woman go -- woman of such stuff as the sally wimple of this world be make of he say i will try the old trick the foolish old trick that i always despise but which must have something sound in it after all since it have serve the turn through all time of people in my predicament so simon go over -lrb- not with he heart -- trust he -- but with he leg -rrb- to adelaide splurge miss wimple never guess see he go and make no sign though she heart fairly crack : he will return one day she think if it be too late then so much the better for he perhaps of adelaide the town have begin some time since to say that she have tire of philip withers -- that she do not appreciate he could not understand he -- he be too deep for she foolish town she have only find he out and learn to hate he as fiercely as she despise he unutterably she have truly love the man and she shrewd heart have play the detective for he madeline secret for such a fouché a slighter clue would have suffice to lead to the conviction of so besot a traitor than many a incautious hint of he and many a tale-telling vaunt of he irresistible egotism afford she for like all the weak wretch of he sort there be not a more bungling lout to try the patience of a clever man than philip withers when he game lay between he safety and he vanity to adelaide 's hand simon blount come timely and well-trained at once she set he on withers as one would hie on a good dog at a thief and it be not long before she have the pleasure of see the chase bring to the ground withers have hear of a graceful neck and white dimpled shoulder at the athenæum so accomplish a connoisseur as he must not let they pass unappreciated so he hasten to discharge he duty to æsthetic society by honor they with he admiration and exalt patronage on any transparent pretext -- the more transparent the better he think for the proprietress of the white shoulder and the bewitching shape who no doubt understand -- he drop in often at the little bookstore to begin with a how-do and conclude with a _ au revoir _ -- the ineffable puppy upon whose vicious vanity the cold still statuesque scorn of miss wimple be grandly lose at last at the splurge house one evening in the presence of adelaide and simon he be betray by he egotism into boast by insinuation of certain success at the circulate library most damaging to miss wimple 's reputation for understanding and good taste he be in she book he say a accordant glance pass between adelaide and simon when withers retire simon follow he and under adelaide 's window and under she eye he box the ear of philip the debonair after that mr withers be discreeter but miss wimple 's trial be not yet at its worst the low-necked dress have be as unseasonable as the substitution of the hooped skirt for the quilted petticoat be imprudent before madeline have be go a week she contract as be to be fear a heavy cold which within a month assume a chronic bronchial form attend with alarming symptom the extreme dejection of spirit consequent upon she persecute loneliness have predispose she to disease in the first place and aggravate its character when it come at last she fall dangerously ill and with the closing of the shop -- for she could hire no one to attend in it -- come poverty in its most dreadful form but for the charity of she kind physician who send a servant-girl a mere child to nurse she and daily keep she supply with proper nourishment from he own house she would so it seem to she have die of neglect and starvation yet better she think to depart even so than linger on when such linger tax the patience and the faith beyond the loftiest example of religion miss wimple be too stout-hearted to cry for death though she feel that have live with heroism she could at least die with presence of mind she wait with a composure that have a strange quality of pride in she new york home mr morri the governess be as happy as she dare to feel in mr osgood 's family she have find all thing as miss wimple have promise treat with studious deference and consideration not unmixed with affection she enjoy for she secret thought the most privileged privacy she brave gratitude be superior to the distress a weaker woman might have suffer from the necessity of make mr osgood unreservedly acquaint with she story in order to enlist he aid to procure tiding of miss wimple whose safety health and happiness be now far dearer to she than she own she do tell he all and have reason to thank god for the courage that make it a possible even a easy thing for she to do she truly

she would in no case write _ first _ in truth miss wimple foresee she own various suffering and seek to spare madeline some cruel pang and herself the hard trial of disingenuous correspondence -rrb- and mr osgood would have start at once for hendrik where he be not personally know to any one to procure tiding of miss wimple and allay the anxiety of mr morri have madeline not find that very day

ever since the athenæum be close he have hang anxiously about the place frequently drop in upon the neighbor to ask -- quite by-the-byishly and by chance it seem to they -- after the health of miss wimple and sometimes he waylay the little servant as she pass to and fro between the bookstore and the doctor 's residence and ply she with question on such occasion he be sure to make the little maid the depository of certain silver secret which forthwith she reveal to miss wimple in the shape of whole basketful of comfortable stuff from the doctor adelaide have give the hint for this letter call

happy guess though simon know it not -- and though he accept she suggestion it amaze he let we lift the curtain now on the last a extraordinary _ tableau _ in the wimple nest a strange company be meet at the bidding of madeline splurge who couch a flash lance for the life and the honor of she benefactress proudly condescendingly haughtily superior to the least sparing of herself -- as one who stoop at the bidding of duty -- she have tell she story from first to last omit nothing with head erect pale lip and flash eye -- with a pass flush perhaps at the more shameful passage but with no falter no dodge no self-excusing no beseech -- scornfully when she speak of home and the beginning of the end -- redly hatefully wickedly dangerous when philip withers come on the scene -- with tremulous lip and the low tone of gratitude 's most move eloquence for the story of miss wimple and she sublimely simple sacrifice -- modestly and with grateful deference at the mention of mr osgood and he rare chivalry then take from she bosom a small morocco pocket-book and from the pocket-book a card she say -- and now to toss that _ thing _ to the goose of hendrik read that slowly distinctly that all may hear -- and she place the card in simon 's hand who run he eye over it for a moment then stand up and read : -- madeline -- for god 's sake be merciful be reasonable i will comply with you hardest term -- i will share all i possess with you -lrb- adelaide smile -rrb- -- i will even marry you after a time but do not i implore you in you recklessness involve I in you unnecessary ruin do not fling I under the playful foot of that ingenious shrew adelaide meet I at the bridge tonight in memory of we dear old love pw when simon have read the card he let it fall on the floor with a gesture of disgust and without look at withers who slink pitifully wilt into a corner return to he place on a low stool where he resume he former attitude hold the hand of sally wimple who now with closed eye recline on madeline 's bosom -- that bosom that be for she weariness the type of the complete rest that crown and bless a brave struggle -- of that all-for-the-best-ness that come of the heart 's clearings-up only adelaide break the silence with she gaze fix full on withers and a triumphant sneer crowning she happy lip she utter one word by way of chorus -- joseph at that word a faint flush flit athwart the cheek of madeline and she move as if uneasy but she do not speak again nor turn she eye to any face but miss wimple 's josephine splurge be there but perceive no opening that she could fill to advantage with a delightful quotation and have no pickle at hand whereto she might give all she mind she support a graceful silence with back hair and a attitude mr splurge be there -- and that be all not clearly understand what she be call upon to say or do under the circumstance nor prepared to take the responsibility of say or do anything without be call upon she say and do nothing at all mr splurge who have have some experience in that wise have never be of so little consequence before near the head of the bed he look direct toward miss wimple with a expression of benevolent solicitude sit a gentleman of middle age rather handsome he hair incline to gray he attire fine but studiously simple mr morris he say may i be permit to speak a word here surely mr osgood then lady and gentleman since doubtless we understand each other by this time i think it advisable that we retire and leave miss wimple to much-needed repose all arise and pass out mr splurge lead the

voluminous that it can hardly maintain the popularity to which its subject entitle it he must be a bold man and to some degree forgetful of the brevity of life who for any ordinary purpose of information or amusement undertake to read these huge octavo true the theme be somewhat extend jefferson 's life be a protracted and busy one he take a leading part in complicated transaction and promulgate doctrine which can not be summarily discuss but the author 's prolixity have not grow out of the extent of he theme alone he be both diffuse and digressive he introduce much irrelevant matter and tell everything in a round-about-way by a judicious exercise of the art of elimination and compression we think that all which illustrate the subject might have be comprise in one volume much smaller than the smallest of these but mr randall 's most serious fault arise from he desire to be think a fine writer without make long extract it be impossible to give any conception of the absurdity into which this childish ambition have lead he the trope and metaphor the tawdry tinsel the common trick of feeble rhetorician be reproduce here as if they be the highest result of rhetorical art the display be often amusing thus in describe mr john adams mr randall say : she lofty lineament carry a trace of the puritan severity they be those of the helm minerva and not of the cestus-girdled venus we do not mention this in order to justify a strain of captious criticism but to ask mr randall in all seriousness how it be possible for he to associate a staid and sensible new england matron with venus and minerva what would he say of a writer who should gravely tell we that washington 's feature be those of the cloud-compelling jupiter not of mar slayer of man -- and that franklin 's countenance resemble that of the wily ulyss not that of the far-ruling agamemnon we might fill this paper with passage like the one we have quote what be the use of this kind of write it do not convey any meaning there be no beauty in it it increase the size and price of book it corrupt the taste of the young be offensive to person of good sense and mortify to those who take pride in the literary reputation of they country it be the bane of we literature many of we prose-writer constantly put language upon paper the use of which in ordinary life would be receive by a court as evidence of insanity if they do so for display they take the readiest course to defeat they purpose there be nothing so fascinating as simplicity and earnestness a writer who have a object and go right on to accomplish it will compel the attention of he reader but it seem that in art as well as in moral and politics the plainest truth be the last to be understand we make these stricture with reluctance this biography in many respects be valuable and mr randall might easily have make it interesting he have a subject worthy of any pen and a abundance of new material he do not lack skill he unstudied passage though never elegant be well enough he be industrious though we must dissent from some of he conclusion he be entitle to the praise of be accurate and be free from prejudice -- except that amiable prejudice which have be well call the _ lue boswelliana _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- he delineation of famous personage though mark by the fault of which we have speak show quite unusual perception of character he have a thorough appreciation of jefferson 's noblest characteristic and a honorable sympathy with the philosophy of which jefferson be a teacher -lrb- footnote 1 : _ the life of thoma jefferson _ by henry s randall ll d in three volume new york : derby & jackson 1858 -rrb- with resource and qualification like these he might have produce a biography which the country would have receive with gratitude and which would have confer a enviable reputation upon he as it be through he neglect of a few wholesome rule which he must have learn when a school-boy the year of labor he have spend over this book will go for nothing and the hope he have build upon it will be disappoint there be much conflict of opinion as to the character of jefferson and the value of he service we doubt whether there be another person in we history as to whom there still exist so strong a feeling of dislike on the one hand and of admiration on the other by some he be regard as a theorist and a demagogue who for selfish purpose oppose the purest patriot and disseminate doctrine which will pervert we institution and destroy we social fabric by other he be revere as the philosopher who first assert the rights of man and the statesman who first define the function of we government and demonstrate the principle upon which it should he administer he detractor and admirer both bear witness to the extent and permanency of he influence he see all the phase of we national life he assist in the struggle for liberty and in the contest which give form to that liberty -- while it be he happy fortune to inaugurate the system by which with occasional deviation the republic for more than fifty year have be govern he hear the discussion of the stamp act and the debate on the admission of missourus he share in the dispute which the establishment of the constitution produce and live to witness the outbreak of the quarrel which now threaten the existence of the constitution he influence be feel through the whole of this long period nor be it confine to affair alone he take part in all the intellectual action of he countryman he be a adept in science a ingenious mechanic and a contributor to literature he stimulate adventure and be the judicious patron of architecture and the fine art more than any man of he day to the labor of a practical statesman he bring a mind discipline by a liberal philosophy and he adorn the most exalted station with the graceful fame of learning and polite accomplishment it be impossible for we to touch every point of he great career it be difficult to dwell upon a single point without be seduce into a discussion too extend for these page we may however be permit in a rapid manner to present mr jefferson in some of those relation which seem to we to throw the strongest light upon he character and teaching peter jefferson the father of thoma be a notable man he parent be poor and in early life he go into the backwoods of virginium as a surveyor he be describe as a person of great stature and strength he mind be equally robust he be a natural mathematician and be remarkable for hardihood and perseverance he temper be equable but he passion be strong and he anger terrible in youth he education have be neglect but by the wise employment of he leisure he obtain considerable reputation for learn throughout the rude region where he live this huge man with gigantic strength and fierce passion be say to have be endow with tender sympathy and to have have a scholar 's love for shakspeare and addison social distinction be strictly observe at that day but peter jefferson break through they and marry a daughter of the randolph family thoma the third child and oldest son of this marriage be bear at shadwell he father 's estate on the 2d of April 1743 the characteristic of the sire descend to the son the physical attribute in milder and the intellectual in more active form like many man of he class peter jefferson have perhaps a undue sense of the obstacle he have encounter through lack of education and be careful to provide for that of he child as soon as possible thoma be send to school and when nine year old under the tuition of a scottish clergyman he be introduce to the study of latin greek and french he father die when he be fourteen year old leave a considerable estate and particular direction that thoma should receive a thorough classical training the executor have some doubt as to whether it would be prudent to send the lad to college in obedience to the paternal request whereupon thoma address he in a little argument which be a curious exhibition of the proclivity of he mind in the mathematical manner which afterwards become common with he he urge that at home he would lose one fourth of he time on account of the company which be attract by he presence and that entertaining so many guest would be a heavier charge upon the estate than the expense of he residence at williamsburg the young disputant prevail and in 1760 he be send to william and mary college he remain there two year he acquirement during this time though probably not so great as mr randall would have we believe must have be large he have equal aptitude for the classic and mathematics in the latter he proficiency be remarkable and he always retain he taste for it though never a critical classical scholar he could read latin with ease he be conversant with french and have some familiarity with greek in later life he study anglo-saxon and italian but jefferson terminate he collegiate course with a possession far more valuable than all the learning he could gather in the narrow curriculum of a colonial college study have excite in he that eager thirst for knowledge which be a appetite of the mind almost as unconquerable as the appetite of the body after leave college he remain at williamsburg and enter the office of mr wyeth a leader at the virginia bar williamsburg be the capital and the center of the most refined society of the province franci fauquier be governor he be a englishman of distinguished family who have lose a large property in a single night 's play and have take the appointment to virginium to repair he fortune to some of the vice and most of the accomplishment of a man of the world he add fine talent and many solid attainment he be withal a skilful musician and a fascinating conversationist mr wyeth and dr small professor of mathematics at the college be in the habit of dine with the governor at stated time for the purpose of conversation jefferson though not yet twenty year old be admit to these party fauquier organize a musical society and jefferson who play upon the violin belong to this likewise in these association the young student acquire the easy courtesy and conversational art which afterwards greatly contribute to he success and distinguish he even among the gentleman of pari he life between twenty and thirty be judiciously employ a closer student could hardly have be find at edinburgh or heidelberg he pursue he profession persistently and in addition make incursion into the field of _ belles-lettres _ and political and physical science he early conceive a prejudice against metaphysical speculation which be never remove we can not believe that he partiality for romance be much greater he undoubtedly have that appreciation of the value of this department of letter which every man of sense have and include it within the circle of he reading because it contain much desirable knowledge the severest criticism which can be make upon he taste for poetry be convey by the statement that when young he admire ossian and when old admire moore he summer be spend at shadwell the responsible charge of a large estate rest upon he and he introduce into he affair and study the extraordinary system which through life he carry into all matter great or small he commence keep a garden-book which with interruption cause by absence be continue until he be eighty-one year old it contain memorandum of vegetable phenomenon and statement of all kind of information in any way affect the economy of horticulture he likewise keep a farm-book he account be note without the loss of a day through he entire life and every item of personal expense be separately state we often find entry like these : 11 d pay to the barber -- 4 d for whet penknife -- and 1 put in the church-box on the 4th of July 1776 we find : -- pd sparhawk for a thermometer # 3 15 -- pd for 7 pr woman 's glove 27 -- give in charity 1 6d he meteorological register inform we that at 6 o'clock be of the same memorable day the mercury stand 68 ° above at noon at 76 ° and at 9 pm at 73-1\/2 ° entry be regularly make in this register three time a day separate book be keep for special account like the expense of the presidential mansion in addition he make minute record of observation in natural history and a curious statement of the vegetable market of washington during a period of eight year wherein the earliest and latest appearance of each article within the whole eight year be note this table mention _ thirty-seven _ different article and be compile during he presidency he make a collection of the vocabulary of fifty indian language and two collocation of those passage in the new testament which contain the doctrine of jesus one of these entitle the life and moral of jesus of nazareth be a octavo volume with a complete index the text be write out in greek latin french and english and place in parallel column mr randall make a long argument to defend jefferson from the common imputation that a man who be so fond of detail could not have have much capacity for higher effort it be hardly worth while to expose a delusion which be so apparent especially in the case of jefferson man be often see with great aptitude for the accumulation of fact and none for the comprehension of principle such man though never great be always useful but the most useless and unfortunate organization be that quite common one where a speculative mind be find which have not sufficient energy to lay hold of detail these philosopher as the foolish call they be the ingenious contriver of the impracticable reform the crazy enterprise and the numberless panacea for all human ill which be constantly urge upon the public and which under the name of progress be the most serious obstacle to progress both faculty be necessary to one who undertake high and useful action mr jefferson be a philosopher because he be a constant and accurate observer he be correct in he generalization because he be so in matter of detail he career at the bar be short the acquisition of a science like the law be a easy task for a mind so ingenious and active as he he have no talent as a advocate but be at once successful in the more retired and not less difficult department of the profession during seven year ' practice he income average three thousand dollar a year -- a large sum then and no mean reward at the present day when twenty-nine year old he marry mr martha skelton a young and childless widow of great beauty in relation to this affair a pleasant anecdote be tell mr jefferson have a number of rival two of these gentleman meet one evening in the drawing-room of mr skelton 's house while wait for she to enter they hear she singing in a adjoining room and jefferson play a accompaniment upon the violin there be something in the burden of the air and in the expression with which the performer render it which convey unpleasant suggestion and the two suitor after listen awhile depart without see the lady the inevitable account-book mention the sum pay to the clergyman fiddler and servant on the occasion of the marriage he wife 's fortune as he inform we double he own and place he in a position of pecuniary independence he soon abandon he profession and thenceforward he career be a public one he enter political life at the time when it first become evident that a war with england must occur and throw himself into the extreme party he be admirably fit for success in a legislative body he talent be deliberative rather than executive he have no power in debate but he possess quality which we believe be more uniformly influential in a public assemblage -- tact industry a conciliatory disposition and systematic habit of thought he be always familiar with the detail of legislation the majority of the member of a legislature can seldom know much about its business those question which excite popular attention and become party test be inquire into but most matter attract no attention and be not party test only a few man of great industry and rare power be familiar with these in the british house of common it be say there be not more than thirty or forty such member in either branch of we congress the proportion be no larger it be a great power to know that which other find it necessary to know and if to this information one add good judgment and a persuasive intellect he influence will be almost unbounded young as he be no one could approach jefferson without see that he have read and think much while most of he comrade in virginium have be waste they youth in horse-racing and cock-fighting he have be a enthusiastic student of book and nature upon all subject likely to excite inquiry he knowledge be full and precise and he opinion those of a sagacious and philosophic mind he manners be attractive he never engage in dispute he express himself freely to those who seek he society for information or a intelligent comparison of opinion but he lip be close in the presence of a disputant the patience with which he listen to other and the modest candor with which he express himself usually disarm the contention when they do not he go no farther if he view be false he do not wish they to prevail if they be true he feel certain that sooner or later they would prevail a temperament like this might have place a less firm man under the imputation of disingenuousness but such a imputation could not rest upon he no one be in doubt as to he opinion he generally anticipate inquiry and select he ground before other see that action would be necessary there be capable lawyer and man of wide experience in we revolutionary legislature but there be no one whose influence be more powerful and feel upon a greater variety of subject than that of jefferson he might however have possess all of these characteristic and enjoy the consideration among he fellow-legislator which they confer without be well know to the public if he have not unite to they the ability to write elegant and forcible english the circumstance of the time make literary talent unusually valuable the daily press have drive the essayist out of the political field but for several generation elaborate disquisition upon politics have be usual in england in this regard pamphlet then occupy the place of we newspaper bolingbroke swift johnson and burke all the serious and some of the gay writer acquire repute by this kind of effort neither be the speech of lead man circulate then as at present at the time of the revolution a oration never reach those who do not hear it this give a great advantage to the writer the pamphlet of oti and thoma paine be read by multitude who never hear a word of the eloquence of henry and adam a high standard of taste have be create and success in political dissertation be difficult but when obtain it be of proportionate value and the source of wide and permanent influence jefferson find a function require much the same talent with that of the pamphleteer but possess some advantage over it the only means which the continental congress and the colonial legislature have of communicate with they constituent and the mother country be by formal address these document be argument upon public question possess the force which a argument always have when it be the expression of great number of mind a audience be certain at home they be sure to be read and in england they attract the attention of every one connect with affair jefferson 's literary talent be soon discover one successful performance in the virginium house of delegate establish a reputation which the declaration of independence have make immortal in every point of view jefferson be entitle to a high place in american literature as a mere rhetorician he have few equal as a political writer not more than two or three a adherence to logical form and the use of mathematical illustration be he most noticeable fault but they be not find in he more elaborate performance he have the supreme merit of perfect clearness naturalness and grace of expression though never eloquent he sometimes rise to a earnest and dignified declamation not infrequently he have achieve the highest success and clothed valuable thought in language so appropriate that the phrase have pass into the national vocabulary and become popular catchword he first inaugural address contain more of those expression which be daily hear in we political discussion than any other american composition there have be some speculation as to how it be possible for a gentleman with no other discipline than that afford by a colonial establishment to obtain a mastery over so difficult a art there be little reason for surprise jefferson 's training have be good he be familiar with the best model above all nature have give he the quality which with the requisite knowledge insure literary success -- good sense good taste and a ear sensitive to the melody of prose we do not propose to follow jefferson throughout he political career as to he revolutionary service there be little difference of opinion he course during the administration of washington and adam have give occasion to most of the criticism which he have encounter we will direct we attention chiefly to that period of he life he appear then as the leader of a party which be intent upon carry certain principle into operation and for a comprehension of he conduct a examination of those principle be necessary mr randall would have do a good service if he have make a brief analysis of jefferson 's political system it afford a fine theme and be much need because jefferson himself leave no systematic exposition of he doctrine they must be seek for through a large number of state papers and a voluminous correspondence like all public man he have be misrepresent both by opponent and adherent there be a vague impression abroad that he enunciate certain liberal theory that he be a ardent philanthropist and that he opinion be those which have prevail among the modern french philosopher but the boundary of he system do not seem to be well define in the public mind he theory of politics may with sufficient accuracy be say to be embrace in the follow proposition : -- first all man be politically equal second a representative government upon the basis of universal suffrage be the direct result of that equality and the surest means of preserve it third the sphere of government be limited and its action must be confine to that sphere the first proposition be contain in the statement which occur in the declaration of independence that all man be create equal this remark have be severely criticize and we think there have be much confusion as to its meaning jefferson could not have intend to say that all man be equal in the sense of be alike such a assertion would be absurd undoubtedly he recognize as every one must the infinite diversity and disparity of intellectual and physical quality he be speak of man in he social relation and in the same sentence he qualify the general assertion by particularize the respects as to which the quality exist -- say that man be endow by they creator with certain unalienable rights that among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the equality of which he speak do not consist in equal endowment but in equal rights -- in the right of each man to the enjoyment of he individual gift whatever they may be the proposition that a representative government upon the basis of universal suffrage be the direct result of man 's equality and the surest means of preserve it open a wide field for discussion into which we will not enter it be not peculiar to jefferson we must however remark that he do not hold the extreme opinion upon this subject which have be attribute to he he think that popular institution could be establish and the elective franchise safely make universal only in a intelligent and virtuous community in france he advise la fayette and barnave to be contented with a constitutional monarchy when the south american state rebel and clay and many other statesman be enrapture with the prospect of a continent of republic jefferson declare that they be not prepare for republican government and could not maintain they at the same time he be very far from think as some of we modern writer do that man can become fit for freedom by remain slave the third proposition that the sphere of government be limited and its action should be confine to that sphere be the one to the illustration of which mr jefferson specially devoted himself upon he service in this respect rest he claim to consideration as a political philosopher it have be the custom to think that the government be the only source of honor it be still look upon as the source of the highest honor by barbarian the monarch be deify in many civilized country of we own time king be say to rule by special favor of the deity no one stand erect no loud word be speak in they presence and indeed everywhere they be approach with a reverence so great that more could hardly be show to god himself this homage be not give on account of eminent personal attribute these person be well understand to be often mean in mind and meaner in moral the same feeling be show towards other high official to be in the public service be eagerly coveted such employment attract the finest mind and be most munificently reward it be so in this country we be accustom to confer upon official character honor which we would refuse to a shakspeare or a newton yet it be well know that while the comprehension and elucidation of the great law which govern society be a labor which will task the strength of the strongest in ordinary time affair may be and generally be quite acceptably administer by man of no marked intellectual superiority it be not necessary to say that the sentiment must be wrong which lead we to such strange error -- which obliterate the broadest distinction and persuade we to give to feebleness and vice reward which should be give to genius and virtue alone for the wisest purpose the creator have plant within we a instinctive disposition to revere the illustrious of we kind to win that admiration be the most powerful incentive to action -- it be the ardent desire of passionate nature the sweet incense of popular applause be more delicious than wine to the sens of man deservedly obtain it heal every wound and soothe all pain nay the mere hope of it will steel he against every danger and sustain he amidst disease penury neglect and oppression to bestow this reverence be a pleasure hardly less exquisite while we commune with the intellect and contemplate the virtue of the great some portion of they exceed light descend upon we they aspiring spirit enter we breast and raise we to higher level but to yield we homage to those who do not deserve it be to pervert a pure and noble instinct we can not worship the degrade except by sink to lower depths of degradation when one consider that the admit function of government have be almost without limit this mistaken sentiment be not to be wonder at why should not they who be able to provide for every want of the body or soul be revere as superior being government have establish creed and set bound to science they have be the censor of literature and hold man in slavery they have tell the citizen how many meal to eat how many prayer to say how to wear he beard and in what manner to educate he child there be no action so trivial no concern so important nor any sentiment so secret that the govern power have not interfere with and seek to control it this system have invariably fail constantly come in contact with each man 's sense of individuality it have be the prolific source of revolution despotism the ruin of state the extirpation of race -- and in its mildest form where life have be preserve everything which make life desirable have be destroy in most country this system still exist to a great degree nor be there any country whence it be entirely eradicate see the constant and uniform occurrence of these evil mr jefferson be lead to believe that they be not cause by a remediable imperfection in the exist system but by radical defect he conclude that they be produce by a attempt on the part of government to do what it could not -- that the power of government be limit by absolute and inherent law like those which limit the strength of man -- and that there be certain function belong to government in go beyond which it not only fail of its purpose but do positive harm in this view the definition of these function become a task of great difficulty and involve the whole science of politics we can not follow he entire line of argument and without detail there be danger that we statement will not be sufficiently qualify he general theory however be simple and be draw from he first proposition as to the equal rights of man he hold that the object of society be the preservation of these great rights since experience teach we that however incompetent we may be to decide upon the interest of other we be able to regulate we own this social purpose will be best accomplish by leave to each one all the liberty consistent with the general safety security be the only common object should be the sole duty of the common agent the government be confine to the performance of this negative duty it must not exercise its power except when necessary the inquiry be it necessary not be it advantageous be the test to be apply to every measure the rigid application of this rule exclude the state from any interference with commerce and industry -- from all matter of religion and opinion -- and limit its financial operation to provide in the most direct manner for its own support but it be to be notice that it be consistent with this scheme and indeed the fruit of it that in the sphere which it do occupy the government should be absolute mr jefferson form the governmental machinery in strict accordance with this principle as many measure be necessary for one portion of a community and not for another he insist that local affair should be place in the hand of local authority the integrity of he system depend not only upon the limitation of the govern power in a general sense but as well upon the division and dispersion of it the principal exception which jefferson make be in respect of education but accord to he view this can hardly be regard as a exception the general safety depend so directly upon that recognition of mutual rights which be not to be find except among intelligent man that he advise the establishment not only of common school but likewise of college and school of art to those who object that this system would limit the action and decrease the splendor of a nation jefferson reply that its effect be quite the reverse in proportion as a government assume the duty which ought to be perform by the citizen it act as a check upon individual and national development under a despotism culture must be confine to a few nor can there be much variety of effort and production under a government which be confine to its proper field the talent of each man may be freely use and he will not be force into relation for which he be unsuited the absurd prejudice that public employment be the most honorable will pass away the man of letter and the man of science the poet the artist and the inventor the financier the navigator the merchant every one who perform beneficial service and display great quality will be reward every one who be conscious that he possess such quality will be stimulate to strive for that reward this universal action will give birth to all the thing which adorn a state social disturbance will excite investigation and evil which government have never be able to reach may be remove competition will make the accumulation of large estate difficult property will be equalize but no motive to effort destroy science will be encourage every day will add to the number of those contrivance which facilitate labor increase production lessen distance and raise man from the degradation of a existence wholly occupy with provide for he physical want under these elastic law religion philanthropy art learn the social amenity the domestic influence all humanize agent will have opportunity and work harmoniously for the advancement of the race it will be see that mr jefferson 's political system be that which in the language of the modern school be call individual theory it have be say that it be base upon too favorable a estimate of human character and that he obtain it from the french philosopher it seem to we that the reproach of utopian opinion may more justly be throw upon he opponent the latter do not escape the evil from which they fly they proceed upon the belief that man be unfit for self-government but since every government be one of man if he can not control himself how shall he rule over other whatever may be say about the superiority of man of genius it be certain that there never have exist a intellect capable of provide for all the minute and vary necessity of each individual among many million the history of legislation show that the best-disciplined mind find it difficult to devise a single statute affect a single interest which will be precise in its term and equal in its operation these railer at the majority of they kind seem to expect in the minority a greater than human perfection mr jefferson proceed upon a mere moderate estimate of the ability and a more just appreciation of the weakness of man it be _ because _ we be easily lead astray and blind by passion that he think we unfit to govern other and that we should limit we effort to self-government he confidence in man be no greater than that which be the foundation of christianity the whole christian scheme be one of the broadest democracy the most important truth be there submit to the general judgment and conscience of mankind with no other recommendation than they value and the force of the evidence by which they be attest can it be say that we be not fit to decide upon a tax yet be fit to decide we fate for all the mysterious future if jefferson be a enthusiast every clergyman who call he bearer to repentance must be mad he do have confidence in he fellow -- he do believe that we be not helpless slave of sin that the evil which afflict we be not inevitable -- and that we have power to lead life of justice and virtue who will accuse he because of this confidence the charge of french principle originate in a political contest it be true in the narrow application which it have at first but false in that which be afterwards give to it there be a marked distinction between he and the politician of france rousseau perhaps the ablest certainly the most popular of those who precede the revolution be a example the _ contrat social _ constantly carry the idea that the government be the seat of all power and the source of all national action no suggestion be make that there be individual function with which the state can not interfere to advantage the same opinion prevail among the encyclopedist and economist they be announce by the gironde and the mountain and practically carry out by robespierre and barra the girondist make cautious approach towards federalism but one look in vain through the speech of vergniaud for a intimation of individualism the modern _ doctrinaire _ have retain the same principle legitimist imperialist republican socialist and communist be all in favor of a centralized and unlimited government the last two class wish to exercise the govern power upon the minutest detail of life -- to establish public bath shop theater dwelling to control the amusement and direct the occupation of the citizen and to divide he social status by law comte himself whose general system might be expect to lead he to a different conclusion outdo they all and propose to prescribe creed establish fast feast and form of worship and even to name those who shall receive divine honor there be no trace here of that scrupulous regard for personal independence and that invincible distrust of governmental action which characterize jefferson it be true he and the gallic writer agree upon certain fundamental proposition but they be peculiar neither to he nor they some of the same principle be announce by locke and beccarium by hobbe who maintain the omnipotence of the state and by grotius who insist upon the divine right of king to agree with another upon certain matter do not make one he disciple no one mistake the doctrine of paul for those of mohammed because both teach the immortality of the soul to confound jefferson with rousseau or condorcet be about as reasonable as to confound luther with loyolum or ricardo with jeremy bentham although we deny that jefferson be indebted to france for he political system it can not be claim that he be the author of it he himself use to assert that the scheme of a limited and decentralized government be produce by the event which cause the settlement of the country and the subsequent union of the colony the emigration to america be stimulate by the great protestant and catholic dispute which occupy europe nearly two century and during which time the original thirteen colony be found the sentiment of religious freedom be the active principle of all the alliance war intrigue and adventure of that stormy period the rights of conscience be maintain in defiance of the rack and the stake they be stubbornly assert in regard to the smallest matter line of separation so fine as hardly to be perceptible be defend to the last the catholic be not more irreconcilably oppose to the protestant than the lutheran to the quaker or the puritan to the baptist man who differ merely about the meaning of a single passage of scripture think each other unfit to sit at the same table the immigrant be exile by the condition under which they act as be from the defeat party and as be among those whom defeat do not subdue they must have have the enthusiasm of they time in its most earnest form each man come here intent upon he right to worship god in he own way _ that _ he could never forget it have be impress upon he by everything which can affect the understanding or touch the heart of man -- by the memory of success and defeat -- by he own suffering and the martyrdom of he brethren -- by bunyan 's fable and by milton 's song but they do not lack bigotry they be as ready to persecute those who differ with they here as they have be at home the last and greatest social truth that the surest way of protect we own liberty be by respect those of other be force upon the colonist so general have be the stimulant to emigration that every european sect and party be represent in america hither come calvinist and lutheran cavalier and roundhead conformist and non-conformist the precise quaker and the elegant huguenot those who flee from the tyranny of loui and those who flee from the tyranny of charle worshipper of the virgin and man who believe that to kneel before a crucifix be as idolatrous as to kneel before the seven-headed idol of hindostan these sect and party be so equally balanced that toleration become a necessity see that they could not oppress man be lead to think oppression wrong and toleration be exalt to a virtue the theocratic spirit which prevail at first pass away and the great principle be establish that government have nothing to do with religion it do not require much penetration to discover that a government which have unlimited power over the person and property of the citizen will not long respect the scruple of he conscience religious liberty give birth to political freedom the separation of the settlement from each other even in the same establishment make local provision necessary for defense and for the transaction of local business and lead to the division of the government when unite action be necessary the colony do not attempt to reconcile they difference they make a union for those purpose which be common to all the general principle which be assert during the revolution be logical necessity of that event it be a rebellion against a unjust exercise of power why unjust for no other reason than because the american have a equal right with englishman to govern themselves but that right must be one which be common to all man the rebel know this they do not follow burke through he labored argument to prove that the measure of the british ministry be inexpedient they could not defend they conduct before the world upon the narrow ground of a violation of the relation between a dependency and its mother country those relation be not understand and such a defense would not have be listen to they appeal at once to the law of god and for they justification address those universal human instinct which give we we idea of national and individual freedom the declaration that man be create equal excited no surprise _ then _ they believe it without a thought that it have enter the mind of a fantastic recluse in the retirement of _ l'hermitage _ and in obedience to that belief they sever the tie of tradition and kindred expose they home and the life of those whose life be dearer to they than they own to the rage of civil war and place all they hope for and everything they love upon the perilous hazard of the sword at such a time jefferson be lead to the pursuit of politics he be not in the situation of one who in disgust at the misery which surround he retire to he study and from the impulse of a kind heart the dream of poet and the speculation of philosopher fashion a society in which there be neither envy anger ambition nor avarice but where amid arcadian joy all man live in peace and happiness he be compel to think because he have need to act -- to make real law for real society to do this he do not meditate upon human frailty and perfectibility he do not attempt to frame institution carefully graduate to suit the dissimilar disposition faculty and desire of man in the spirit with which he have observe the phenomenon of nature in order to discover the law which produce they he inspect the social phenomenon of he country to learn the law by which it might be govern he study the process by which a few hamlet hastily build upon a savage shore have grow into powerful community -- by which the heir to century of bitter recollection have be make to forget the jealousy of race the enmity of party the bad hatred of sect and unite into one brotherhood for the accomplishment of a common and noble purpose he take man as he find he and believe he could govern himself because he have do so he endeavor to give symmetry to the system which be already establish it be not strange that in this way he arrive at rule of policy and assist to put in operation a government more perfectly adapt to we want more nicely adjust to we strength and we weakness give freer opportunity to individual effort and more firmly establish national prosperity better able to resist sedition or foreign assault than any which painful toil have create or the imagination of the benevolent conceive from the day of plato to those of fourier in we next number we shall allude to certain question raise by mr randall 's book connect with the early politics of the country and we shall likewise undertake the more please task of describe the domestic life and the character of jefferson \* \* \* \* \* a prisoner of war rügen be a small island and its chief town be name rügen also they be both part of prussium as they be in 1807 when prussium and france be at war at that time herr grosshet be burgomaster and a very important burgomaster it should be understand -- take in proof thereof herr grosshet 's own opinion on the subject accord to the same high authority the burgomaster be also wondrously sharp and the consequence of the burgomaster 's sharpness be that a amount of smuggling go on in the town which be simply audacious none know better than the burgomaster that the smuggling be audacious scarcely a shopkeeper he know but laugh to he nose but he dignity be so great and he have make the central authority believe so strongly in he that he could not lay a complaint and the consequence of _ that _ be that though the townspeople laugh at they mayor they would not have part with he on any account not a soul in the town but know of the smuggling -- not a soul who publicly be in the least aware of that illegality bertha as she be commonly call do not positively belong to the town but she have live in it for sixteen year -- at the beginning of which time a very great commotion be create by she discovery at the age of three sit stare on the sea-beach she be adopt by the town generally for there be kind heart in it -- as most town have for that matter but she be specially adopt by frau klass who take she home and straightway rear she under the name of bertha -- for the reason that she have once have a daughter with that name the new bertha in time meet with a proposal from a flaxen-haired young sailor name daniel who leave rügen the next day with a considerably lighten heart when the foundling have reach nineteen three thing have happen : -- dan have be away three year and the town have give he up forever bertha 's mother be no more and bertha rather find it she duty to submit to be marry to the most odious of he sex jodoque by name -- a man who be detest by no one more heartily than by bertha herself i say bertha find it she duty to be marry and thus : -- frau klass call jodoque she nephew and try to justify a testament in bertha 's favor by suggest to she the compensation to she nephew of marry he thus frau klass try to follow both she inclination and she duty and die serenely at a great age -- assure bertha with she last breath that daniel must be dead and that jodoque be a admirable youth when know and not at all poor so bertha come into possession of a little farm and a little house _ she _ try to reconcile duty with inclination by suggest to jodoque the propriety of wait and he _ have _ wait till he begin to question the probability of he ever enter upon the tenancy of he late aunt 's farm but bertha at last yield a consent and the entire town ever bear in mind its universal parentage of bertha determine to go to great length of rejoice on the wedding-day and the burgomaster a fool and a good man be certainly not indifferent i have say france and prussium be at war at this time and indeed there be a score of young french prisoner at the fort -- or rather nineteen for one get away the very day before that mention as bertha 's wedding-day two hour after he escape he be kiss the hand of bertha herself who have promise he she protection and hidden he in frau klass 's own dark room bertha have serve the young frenchman -- who shall be call max -- with he breakfast and be sit in she porch wonder about a good many thing when herr jodoque arrive she be think how she should get the prisoner away -- what would be say of she if find out -- how decidedly odious jodoque be -- how handsome the frenchman be -- and how she think he be better-looking even than daniel the sailor who have be away three year so herr jodoque come up to the door of the little cottage bring with he a basket jodoque believe in the burgomaster as a grand man and though nobody know better than jodoque that he be not very clever he rather try in manner to imitate the important mayor it be and be the custom in rügen for the bridegroom to make a present in a fancy basket to the bride and that the town might not talk jodoque bring _ he _ bride a basket though it be not particularly large nor be it particularly heavy here be a inventory of its contents which with itself jodoque lay down with considerable effect : -- _ imprimi _ -- one piece of cloth on the use of which jodoque give a essay _ item _ -- three card of knitting-wool for mitten _ item _ and _ fini _ -- one white rabbit the skin of which jodoque suggest would make he a cap good say bertha -- jodoque she add my angel you know madame kurrig 's at the very other end of the town go there go there angel -- why the silver teapot -- _ my _ sil -- my aunt 's silver teapot just so -- madame kurrig -- have get it -- i go -- my aunt 's silver teapot he run down the little road towards the silver teapot -- for indeed madame kurrig do not bear a superior character -- but he have not proceed far when he come upon the burgomaster who be in great tribulation only nineteen prisoner be at the fort and the governor have send down a rather imperative message to the mayor who reply that he loyal town could not conceal a fugitive meet with such a answer as he have never receive before in all he life it be a deplorable fact that he and the town be recommend to go to a place a visit to which the burgomaster at least hope he should not be compel to make the burgomaster be in the habit of ask people 's opinion and never listen to they answer and he now ask jodoque what he be to do jodoque suggest that the mayor could not want advice the mayor admit there be something in that -- but still a word be a word thing in fact be in a pretty state for the burgomaster now he have to do with the escape of a french prisoner and this be the case the french be off the town and at that time the french have the luck to be generally sure in the matter of victory now if the french take the town and learn that the burgomaster have take a frenchman -lrb- for the burgomaster feel sure he could recover the runaway if he choose -rrb- the burgomaster would perform that _ pa seul _ upon the ambient air which be far from a pleasant feat while if the french do _ not _ take the town and it be bring home to he that he have neglect the duty of he office he would lose the position of burgomaster and be a degraded man jodoque sadly want to reach madame kurrig 's but the burgomaster sadly want help -- though he would not confess it openly -- so he hook himself on to jodoque and utter this sentence -- and this detest smuggler too -- the effect of which be that jodoque become utterly pale and tremble violently this behavior the burgomaster attribute to he own proper presence and ask himself -- could he survive degradation no better the tight-rope performance so he make up he mind to recapture the miss frenchman he meantime be a blithe courageous young midshipman be gayly chatter with he protectress there he be laugh at she good-naturedly as she tremble for he sake and chatter broken german as best he could wealth be a good thing and health a better but surely high spirited hope be worth more than the philosopher 's stone no mademoiselle -- i could bear the dark room no longer better a hour in the light of you blue eye than a age in that dark room still -- nevertheless -- it be dangerous to leave the room the burgomaster -- can not see all the way here from the town besides if he could you presence would dazzle he and i should be safe so you can trust you secret with I -- a woman i would trust it with two woman -- three -- for with every disclosure there would be a fear the less that i should be find you can not comprehend that -- now consider la i can not how good you be how would they punish you if they learn the truth oh a good heart -- i do think i have a good heart -- do not weigh this way and that when there be a good action to be do and do for the sake of a poor stranger stranger nonsense i meet you -- you be in misfortune therefore we be old friend and a old friend may surely lend a room to she old friend and you name they call I bertha and you be single if you ask I that question a hour hence i shall say ` no ' no -- the only harsh word you have use why harsh well shut up in a dark room you have you thought to yourself and you think and think and think again and you always think of the same thing and then -- then you wake up and there be a end to you dream and how do you know i have not dream -- the clothes i get for you fit you well you look a german ah you make a grimace so you be go to be marry in one hour -- less five minute ah which way be i to go straight back into the house nonsense -- i should compromise you the house be mine surely i may do as i like with it and when may i reach the coast when the night reach we good -- and -- and good-bye well -- yes -- good-bye i suppose -- and -- and promise I one thing i do promise do not look at he he whom my husband -- who be come he be so handsome oh magnificent good-bye good-bye here he run back into the dark room while bertha who be a spoilt child if the truth may be tell pull moodily at one of the two long black plait of hair she wear and it must be set down sad as it be that see jodoque come up the road to claim she accompany by a sailorly-looking personage she go in and shut the door with a deal of vigor the sailorly-looking personage be young broad-chested handsome and have not be in that part of prussium for some six year jodoque prompt to sudden hospitality have offer the sailorly personage a seat at he marriage dinner-table and he with a great laugh accept the invitation he stroll leisurely on by the side of the bridegroom until he hear the bride 's name when behold the effect produce for he start back and at first show sign of choke he informant however after a awkward stare he move on again they soon come up to the door and jodoque be wonder why he bride do not open it wide to he when a bright stout little woman dress out in she best come trip through the garden-gate through which the two have just pass this little woman 's name be doome -- nobody know why she be call doome but everybody call she doome all over the little town good morning gentleman god preserve you jodoque good morning bertha -- for here the door open as she open and appear at the door the sailor look hard at she but she do not start as she return he look _ he _ think all woman be alike and forget but if this broad-chested sailor could have see he own blue jacket of six year before perhaps it would have be a good argument to induce he to pardon bertha 's forgetfulness good day miss say he and brush he cap from he head the same explanation touch the sailor 's presence be then give to bertha that i have give to you -- give as the whole party be welcome into the plain little house by its very far from plain mistress do you remember face mistress say the sailor to doome yes friend sailor do you remember they for six year la no woman can remember for six year say doome i think _ you _ could mistress say the sailor and thereupon the stout little doome blush and curtsy meanwhile the bride be think of the young frenchman and how she could keep she secret with half the town at the house and about it as there would be in another half-hour she think more of the young stranger every moment and especially when she gaze upon she future -- which seem to grow more disagreeable each time she look at it the young sailor keep he eye away from bertha -- who set to work draw a huge mug of beer in which piece of hospitality jodoque hoveringly help she -- and address himself to doome say -- do you know i be nearly snap up by a shark some month ago with a sympathetic shudder the little woman reply the shark be doubly cruel -- who could -- who could take out of the world so -- so fine a young man ah i wish he have wish he have yes -- he tooth would not have be half so sharp as the tooth bite away at my heart now dear have you ever have a lover here the little woman laugh outright a lover she could have honestly answer yes if the handsome sailor have ask she if she have have several score _ a _ lover indeed ah well suppose you only have one when you be a poor girl and he leave you what then oh i would kill he first and cry myself dead afterwards well _ my _ sweetheart have go from I what what -- give _ you _ up for _ any one _ yes and -- and -- i do not think he be my master -- unless it be in dollar ah -- and who save you from the shark a young french officer -- bless he he harpoon my sealy friend and find a friend for life -- though it a 'n' t much a poor sailor-fellow can do for a officer and though we be at war with the french i would be hang sooner than fire at he ship here bertha assist by jodoque set the big jug down upon the table with a bang and here too something fall down in a neighboring room -- precisely as though a person journey in a dark chamber have upset a heavy wooden chair the noise send doome right into the sailor 's arm and also send jodoque right behind bertha who turn pale there be some one in the room say jodoque no no say bertha -- ` tis poor aunt 's room no one go there it be only the rat -- that be all -- only the rat for a stranger the sailor show a great deal of curiosity for he turn very red and say suppose you look and see oh no no never mind ` tis only rat no one ever go into that room my dear dear guardian die in that room yes mistress say the sailor but rat do not throw down chair and table no surely no say jodoque and if the house be mine say the sailor suit the action to the word why i would go up to the door like this -- and i would put my hand on the latch and click it should go -- and -- bertha run up to the door too lay she hand upon the sailor 's arm and draw he away as he quite willingly let she indeed he tremble and look pleadingly at she as she touch he and he murmur to himself six year make a good deal of change you a guest have no right to touch that door if i be you husband i should have surely -- but you be not yes but this honest man here be as good as you husband no no say the other three and jodoque but for presence of mind might have overthrow the big jug of beer no -- for truly i be not go to marry jodoque not go to marry I not go to marry he -- why as sure as you call I doome there be the townsfolk and the musician and the good father and the burgomaster all with they face already turn this way i would wager these new ribbon of mine let they all come to send they back again no to witness my marriage and who be the bridegroom somebody all of you have forget no say doome i never forget a soul do you remember the poor sailor-boy daniel i never see he say doome no friend sailor you need not squeeze my hand -- i never do see he well he have grow a man and have come home then say jodoque i suppose _ i _ may go home come home -- where _ be _ he -- still my sailor friend i can not tell why you should tremble yes he have come home and if he will have I i will marry he and he 'll have a good wife bertha say the sailor and he make a movement as though about to run to the girl but little doome too impulsive to think about the fräulein grundeus enthusiastically clasp the arm of she friend 's eulogizer yes -- marry he -- and at this moment he be in that room and now any one of you may open the door open the door -- i 'll smash the door say the sailor roughly push the girl away from he so daniel be there be he well let he come he run up to the door throw it open and there stand just within be the young french prisoner of war good morning all he say you be daniel be you say the sailor draw the other forward to the light you be daniel be you he drag he near the window and look quickly at he then he turn pale himself and wring he hand yes say he yes -- it _ be _ daniel himself -- the very daniel ah so much the better say doome daniel the _ very _ daniel say bertha faintly and turn paler yet i know you comrade say the sailor aside -- i know you you be the french officer who have escape but i be down in you log for a lump of gratitude and so you be daniel when a fellow save you from a shark perhaps you 'll be as willing to give he you name and why be i to take you name to give it to bertha there give it to bertha yes sign the contract which the burgomaster have in he pocket sign it as daniel -- ` tis you only chance and when you be go i have pay my debt and do not let we cross each other again you give I my life but that be no reason you should rob I of my wife rob you of you wife yes of bertha who love I six year ago why she have barely know I six hour true but she love you six time as much as she do the memory of daniel but i do not care for she beyond gratitude for shelter I from pursuit oh she have enough love for two of you well to I one wife or another -- and she be a nice girl -- and friend daniel where shall we go we -- who my wife and i say the other laugh you comrade i will manage for you but you wife will stop here stop here why you do not suppose i can give up the good girl i have love for the six year i have be roll over the sea ` tis true she do not remember I and think I dead but when she learn the truth all the old love will come back and she will like I none the less for aid you the burgomaster who shall be in the plot shall marry you to _ my wife _ -- and when you be go god speed you the burgomaster will set all that right as he can and bertha and i will often talk in we seaside cot of the french officer that we save here doome interrupt the dialogue for she could not conquer she curiosity farther so she come up and compliment the french officer -lrb- who be to be call daniel -rrb- on he marriage to be sure he have almost forget german for as bertha say he have leave home almost before he could speak like a man and have be in the french service -- and so there it be no doubt now he have come back to germany he would soon learn german again and speak it like a native -- eh friend sailor what little one i do not hear you the little one not dissatisfy at that term flounce round and then give a little scream -- for all the neighbor with the burgomaster at they head be approach the little house when they arrive and the change of husband be announce not a neighbor but frame a little mental history -- and indeed jodoque cut rather a ridiculous figure as for the burgomaster -- who know the real daniel have discourse with he about the french fleet ride off the island that very morning -- he dignity prevent he from suddenly spoil matter before he could sufficiently recover himself from the blow which he dignity have receive daniel come up to he and say these two word -- you neck what do you mean young man suppose the french take rügen well suppose they do and suppose you have cause the recapture of a french officer i have not the least idea that i have cause a recapture but suppose so well and if he be hung and if the french take the place you would be hang too what do you mean young man that man over there be the french officer who have escape good gracious I yes and you must suppose he to be I marry he to bertha and help he to escape to the french fleet no -- on the faith of a burgomaster no -- on the word of a german no but you neck i do not care the french may not take the place and the french may who 'll be the wiser burgomaster my conscience young sailor and you 'll save a man oh dear dear dear here the best table for the burgomaster the handsomest chair for the burgomaster make a good pen for the burgomaster oh dear dear dear the burgomaster then in the homely german fashion ask the usual question fill up the marriage-contract and then hand the pen to the bride she tremble rather as she put she name to the paper but not so much as the young sailor as for the frenchman he hesitate before he put he name down -- and when he have do so he fling the pen away as though he have do wrong one hour after that these two young people be marry in the village church the little village festivity which follow need not be dwell upon but imagine the summer-evening come and daniel and the french officer steal down to the rocky beach the young sailor show a deal of doubtful feeling as he see the tearful energy with which little bertha part with she make-believe husband and when little doome who have be let into all the secret except the one that daniel keep to himself -- namely that he be daniel -- when little doome creep up to condole with he on the hard case of the newly-married pair it must be say that he push she away quite roughly soon the two man reach the shore daniel instinctively go to a little cove where he know of old a boat would be -- and as darkness come on the plashing of a couple of oar sound near the little cove where the boat have be mind comrade i have pay my debt you may be take and you run you chance though if you get to you ship you know one gun _ as you promise you wife _ fire eastward all right daniel you will like I as well as ever daniel in a few day no comrade there be a woman between we so the french officer go on he venturesome pull of a couple of mile to the french fleet and the sailor return to the little cottage where be sit bertha and doome the latter for he cleverness and perhaps good look have begin to consider the sailor as worth far more than those sixty youth who have cause she to laugh when he refer to only one of they but it be a deplorable fact that while doome welcome daniel back with a great deal of heartiness fräulein bertha rather look upon he as cruel for what need be there that she husband should have go he could have hide till the french take the place and then he would have be free for love conflict with patriotism woefully and though nobody could be more grateful than bertha for the good service daniel have do she yet somehow she could not be over-pleased with he she thank he however very warmly but it be doome who set the chair for he and doome who get the beer for he and doome who propose the sailor 's solace of a pipe as the pipe be light by that young woman bertha get up to leave the room where be you go bertha into the garden my head ache and she go out i think doome -- they call you doome do not they and a tidy name too -- i think doome bertha do not like pipe _ i _ think the smell of a pipe delicious and what do you think of this pipe oh _ i _ think it a beautiful pipe hum -- so you have lot of lover well -- i have a few ah -- do _ they _ smoke yes -- some of they you queer little doome -- be any of they rich oh i do not care a bit for money and what be they -- farmer i should not like to marry a farmer i suppose bertha have sit down i do not hear she step no -- i should not like to marry a farmer -- farmer be such quiet people do not you marry a sailor law sailor-friend -lrb- _ i _ do not know you name -rrb- why why because if he go away for six year you would forget he and that be what fritz say no mr fritz i should _ not _ forget he -- but i should not let he go away for six year but suppose the king order he then the king do not deserve to have a wife and yet he have so much the worse bertha must have sit down you know i do not think i care for one of my lover i think i could give they all up -- yes every one -- if i meet with anybody that i could love yes and then suppose he do not care for you as doome have never consider the probability of any such situation its suggestion rather startle she she hold she tongue while daniel puffed gravely soon bertha come slowly into the room i think he ought to have get there by this time do not you sir he be name fritz bertha -- call he fritz do not you think he ought to be there by this time mr fritz surely mistress you will soon hear the cannon -- ` tis not more than two mile and he leave the shore a good hour ago so she go up to the window i suppose mistress if he do not come back for six year you would forget he -- would not you she be so lose in thought that she do not answer so doome take the answer upon herself you be very hard upon we woman fritz -- mr fritz no of course she would not forget he no wife ever forget she husband why do you think i should forget you fritz -- mr fritz -- if you be my husband and if you go away for six year there be woman and woman doome fräulein doome -- ah -- hark at this moment the sound of a cannon-shot sweep over the little cottage and daniel run to the window and put he hand out to feel the breeze declare that it be fire east-ward now bertha be at the window and as the sailor speak he look into she face she quickly put she arm round he neck in the german fashion kiss he gratefully and say you good good man he kiss she in turn and look eagerly at she -- but she do not recognize he though he kiss she in precisely the manner of six year ago he sit down again and again smoke -- and as in the most heroic poem people eat and drink and as anne boleyn would have think it hard to starve while she trial be go on surely as this be only the chronicle of people such as you may meet any day and not at all heroic it may not be wrong to state that plain-spoken every-day love-making little doome get supper ready bertha have save a prisoner daniel have assist and little doome rather like daniel yet nobody eat much and when daniel -lrb- at the suggestion of doome -rrb- be furnish with a mattress and blanket on the floor he do not make use of it but sit smoking -- smoking for hour after the two woman have go off to bertha 's room but when the tobacco-pouch be empty and the pipe be cold the sailor fall asleep in he chair and though he have do a good act the precede day he do not sleep well but sigh heavily as he slumber on and now it be that jodoque the discomfited again come upon the stage have be laugh at by every soul in the village that poor bachelor go to he lonely house take a small mug of consolatory weak beer feel convinced that all woman be deceiver vow that from that time forth he would think no more of matrimony and go to bed in the dark -- prompt thereto by the power of economy in candle he have fall asleep and sleep soundly when thrift prompt he to remember that one piece of cloth several ball of wool and one white rabbit -- he property -- be at that moment at the deceiver bertha 's why should he the deceive make the married pair happy with one piece of cloth several ball of wool and a white rabbit and jodoque wake up to the terrible truth in a cold sweat the article in question be at the deceiver bertha 's at the first break of day he would go and demand he property be unable to sleep through the remainder of the dark hour he present but a disreputable appearance when he clap to the little door of he house it be barely light and it be not a overpowering distance for jodoque to walk from he house to bertha 's he know the household would not be up but he determine to sit down before it -- besiege it in fact -- and carry off the cloth the wool and the white rabbit when the enemy should first be move and this be what he see as he come up to the cottage : -- a young officer in the french uniform be get in at bertha 's kitchen-window jodoque seize the idea as though it be the white rabbit -- this be the french officer who have escape yesterday endeavor to hide himself in bertha 's house jodoque do not instantly rush forward to re-arrest this prisoner but it strike he there must be a reward for the recapture so determine upon take the prisoner and the basket at one fall swoop he tear away to the burgomaster 's to inform he of the discovery he reach the official residence and draw the pompous little burgomaster to he bedroom-window in a moment the burgomaster be rather scandalize that such a respectable man as jodoque should be out at such a hour but when he hear the information he grow considerably cold and rather wish the french fleet would successfully challenge the place at once and relieve he of he admirable chance of the halter be ever burgomaster in such a fix he wish he ardent longing for that position have be strangle at he birth no -- he have save he neck from the french he think to himself by connive at the escape of a french officer the day previous and now he neck be in danger for have very properly try to save it on that previous day but action action whatever come of it he must appear a patriotic burgomaster so he take he night-cap off and in spite of the energetic remonstrance of the burgomaster 's lady be soon down in the street surround by half a dozen man and make for bertha 's eventful little mansion -- within which be pass a terrible scene the fact be that when the false daniel arrive at the fleet and report himself he find that he have escape with only part of himself and rather want the rest and as at that time the french navy be allow a liberty which it have not now the young officer lay a statement of the whole case before he commander that daring personage thus recommend : -- a french boat to start away for shore with this young officer and several more in she that it should touch near bertha 's house that bertha should receive the merest hint and then take passage for the french fleet herself the french officer attend by half-a-dozen more youth come back to the shore and just as day be peep come up to the little right-hand window and as no one answer he tap he raise the sash and jump lightly in this jodoque saw and report to the burgomaster but he could not tell the remainder for daniel wake by the tap on the window-pane saw who it be and believe that he have come to steal he wife from he he clench he fist and as the slim young man jump down into the room crush he almost dead in he strong arm not a word or i 'll stifle you daniel daniel not a word -- and do not daniel I you thief thief do not speak loud how thief you would steal my wife from I how you wife why bertha -- she promise to marry I six long year ago and she would have marry I if _ you _ have not come and steal she heart why you yourself give she to I ah i owe you a debt i have to pay ` tis pay now i think you go and the marriage knock on the head but now you have come back and will not go again but daniel -- do not daniel _ I _ i say and do not speak loud at least _ she _ sha 'n' t see you take off lie quiet for she sake and show you love for she that way and so you 'll give I up old friend whose life _ i _ save save -- you save it once and i save yours you take away my hope when you rob I of my wife -- now i give you a like return and you yourself daniel who harbor I yesterday -- that be nothing to you -- lie still till some one pass for the strong sailor have tip the officer on to the mattress there he lay -- not from want of courage but because he do not know what to do the sailor feel for he pipe but he remember that all the tobacco be smoke up so he set the pipe down again and bit he nail he have not wait a quarter of a hour when a voice say -- this way herr burgomaster -- this way the sailor and he prisoner both start to they foot and the burgomaster come to the open window lose the last faint hope he have have that this say french officer might not after all be the french officer at whose escape he the respect burgomaster and butcher have assist mr burgomaster here be a french prisoner -- and i hand he to you as the fit personage to place he in the hand of the commander thus speak daniel and as he speak bertha appear at the door of she room and with she doome who hear this little speech all she liking for the sailor vanish on the instant she be ready to utterly exterminate he and more than ready to cry which she do straightway as this be only a little comedy and by no means tragical we pass over the next scene and simply state that bertha before all those neighbor forget everybody but she husband -- if he may be call so -- and the church have say so that daniel feel great remorse at what he have do that he tell doome again that he wish the shark have finish he that doome do not or would not hear for she idol be break -- and so be doome 's heart nearly the authority take away the prisoner and leave bertha and doome wretched and alone as for daniel he go out wander by himself -- for he rather feel ashamed to look upon anybody at this time a little boat with a white flag at its prow put off from the french fleet and bravely approach the bristle fort of rügen nearer and nearer it come -- nearer and nearer and in half a hour there be great cheer over the island of rügen for peace between prussium and france be declare ` tis true the peace do not last very long but it last long enough to save the french officer he be set at liberty at once and a hour afterwards daniel could look people in the face again -- all except doome who would not cease to be incensed but then say daniel you know i would be wait six year how exclaimed bertha yes bertha -- i be the real daniel look here -- and half a little silver cross come forward and you do not say it when you come -- and you actually give she to he -- and you save he life -- and oh you you captain of a man thus doome speak and be comfort and bertha go up to she old sweetheart and kiss he say she think she know of a better wife for he than she could ever have make -- for now that ernest -lrb- the french officer -rrb- have suffer so much for she sake she have no right to leave he and indeed they be re-marry that day it be after bertha have say she know of a better wife for he that daniel look at doome who pick up that pipe of he handed it to he will you take care of it doome save when you want it oh i mean to come with it ` tis the handsomest pipe in all germany -- and -- and i will not part with it till i part with you hence you see there be two marriage that morning doome part with the pipe a good deal -- for daniel love the sea as heartily as he have love bertha and grow to love doome who assure he many time that she be a far better wife for he than bertha would have make whereupon daniel would kiss she -- so you can draw you own conclusion as to he motive for my part i say first love be only heart-love -- and you see the heart be not so wise as the head by the time the long war be over -- with waterloo for the last act -- ernest have make not a little money so he and bertha -- now a grand lady -- come to rügen ernest learn german perfectly from he own child and doome 's and turn he sword into a ploughshare as for daniel -- he give up the sea and take a wine-shop those four people be now still alive and if bertha and daniel do not marry they child have -- though it be rather lower to those grand young lady and gentleman bertha 's child those four when they meet and clapper they friendly old tongue can hardly believe that once upon a time they be all at six and seven -- and that ernest himself be once in that very place a prisoner of war the wash of the foot on

similarly there exist a opinion now that the combined power of gunpowder and peace be banish physical courage and the need of it from the world peace be good but this result of it would be sad indeed life be sweet but it would not be sweet enough without the occasional relish of peril and the luxury of daring deed amid the change of time the monotony of event and the injustice of mankind there be always accessible to the poorest this one draught of enjoyment -- danger in boyhood say the norwegian enthusiast ole bull i love to be far out on the ocean in my little boat for it be dangerous and in danger one draw near to god perhaps every man sometimes feel this longing have he moment of ardor when he would fain leave politics and personality even endearment and success behind and would

amid viper in he dungeon : -- what be the fate of a brave man but to fall amid the foremost he who be never wound have a weary lot this make the fascination of war which be in itself of course brutal and disgusting dr johnson say truly that the naval and military profession have the dignity of danger since mankind reverence those who have overcome fear which be so general a weakness the error usually lie in exaggerate the difference in this respect between war and peace madame de sévigné write to she cousin bussy-rabutin after a campaign i can not understand how one can expose himself a thousand time as you have do and not be kill a thousand time also to which the count answer that she overrate the danger a soldier may often make several campaign without draw a sword and be in a battle without see a enemy -- as for example where one be in the second line or rear guard and the first line decide the contest he finally quote turenne and maurice prince of orange to the same effect that a military life be less perilous than civilian suppose it be therefore a foolish delusion to suppose that as the world grow more pacific the demand for physical courage pass away it be only that its application become nobler in barbarous age man fight against man and animal and need like achille to be feed on the marrow of wild beast as time elapse the savage animal be extirpate the savage man be civilized but nature act through science commerce society be still create new exigency of peril and evoke new type of courage to meet they grace darling at she oar kane in he open boat stephenson test he safety-lamp in the terrible pit -- what be the trophy of miltiade to these the ancient agamemnon face no danger so memorable as that ocean-storm which beset he modern namesake bearing across the water a more priceless treasure than helen pride of greece and indeed set aside these sublimity of purpose and look simply at the quantity and quality of peril it be doubtful whether any tale of the sea-kings thrill the blood more worthily than the plain newspaper narrative of captain thoma bailey in the newburyport schooner atla beat out of the gut of canso in a gale of wind with he crew of two man and a boy up to they waist in the water it be easy to test the matter let any one who believe that the day of daring be past beg or buy a ride on the locomotive of the earliest express-train some cold winter-morning one wave of the conductor 's hand and the live engine spring snort beneath you as no arab steed ever rush over the desert it be not like be bind to a arrow for that motion would be smoother it be not like be hurl upon a ocean crest for that would be slower you be rush onward and you be powerless that be all the frosty air give such a brittle and

grimy engineer turn already to he tobacco and he newspaper and unconscious while he read of the charge at balaklava that he life be balaklava every day physical courage be not therefore a thing to be so easily set aside nor be it as we reformer appear sometimes to assume a mere corollary from moral courage and ultimately to be merge in that moral courage be rare enough no doubt -- probably the rarer quality of the two as it be the nobler but they be thing diverse and not necessarily unite there have be man and still be such leader of they age in moral courage and yet physically timid this be not as it should be god place man at the head of the visible universe and if he be to be throw from he control daunt by a bullet or a wild horse or a flash of lightning or a lee shore then man be dishonor and the order of the universe derange no matter what the occasion of the terror be a mouse or a martyrdom fear dethrone we he that live in fear of death say cæsar at every moment feel its torture i will die but once have claim thus much we can still readily admit that we can not yet estimate the precise effect upon physical courage of a state of permanent national peace since indeed we be not yet within sight of that desirable consummation meanwhile let we attempt some slight sketch and classification of the different type of physical courage as already exist among which be to be enumerate the spontaneous courage of the blood -- the courage of habit -- magnetic or transmitted courage -- and the courage inspire by self-devotion there be a certain innate fire of the blood which do not dare peril for the sake of principle nor grow indifferent to they from familiarity nor confront they under support of a stronger will -- but love they for they own sake without reference to any ulterior object there be no special merit in it for it be a matter of temperament yet it often conceal itself under the finer name of self-devotion and high purpose -- as george borrow convinced himself that he be actuate by evangelical zeal to spread the bible in spain though one see through every line of he narrative that it be chiefly the adventure which allure he and that he would as willingly have distribute the koran in london have it be equally contraband no surplice no library no counting-house desk can eradicate this natural instinct achille disguise among the maiden be detect by the wily ulyss because he choose arm not jewel from the travel merchant 's store in the most placid life a man may pant for danger and we know quiet unobtrusive man who have confess to we that they never step into a railroad-car without the secret hope of a collision this be the courage of heroic race as highlander circassian montenegrin afghan and those arab among whom urquhart finely say that peace could not be purchase by victory where destine to appear at all it be likely to be develop in extreme youth which explain such instance as the _ gamin de paris _ and that of sir cloudesley shovel who in boyhood convey a dispatch during a naval engagement swimming through double line of fire indeed among heroic race young soldier be preferable for daring such at least be the testimony of the highest authority as ney and wellington i have find say the duke that raw troops however inferior to the old one in manoeuvring may be superior to they in downright hard fight with the enemy at waterloo the young ensign and lieutenant who have never before see a enemy rush to meet death as if they be play at cricket but though youth be good for a onset it need habit and discipline to give steadiness a boy will risk he life where a veteran will be too circumspect to follow he but to perform a difficult maneuver in face of a enemy require sicinius with forty-five scar on he breast the very apprehension of a wound say seneca startle a man when he first bear arm but a old soldier bleed boldly for he know that a man may lose blood and yet win the day before the battle of preston pan mr ker of graden a experienced officer mount on a gray pony coolly reconnoitr all the difficult ground between the two army cross it in several direction deliberately alight more than once to lead he horse through gap make for that purpose in the stone wall -- under a constant shower of musket-ball he finally return unhurt to charle edward and dissuade he from cross undoubtedly any raw highlander in the army would have incur the same risk with or without a sufficient object but not one of they would have bring back so clear a report -- if indeed he have bring himself back the most common evidence of this dependence of many person ' courage on habit be in the comparative timidity of brave man against novel danger -- as of sailor on horseback and mountaineer at sea nay the same effect be sometimes produce merely by different form of danger within the same sphere sea-captain often attach a exaggerated sense of peril to small boat condé confess himself a coward in a street-fight and william the conqueror be say to have tremble exceedingly -lrb- _ rehementer tremen _ -rrb- during the disturbance which interrupt he coronation it be probably from the same cause that mr inchbald the most fearless of actress be once entirely overcome by timidity on assume a character in a masquerade on a larger scale the mere want of habitual exposure to danger will often cause a whole population to be charge with greater cowardice than really belong to they thus after the coronation of the chevalier in the scottish insurrection of 1745 although the populace of edinburgh crowd around he kiss he very garment when he walk abroad yet scarcely a man could be enlist in view of the certainty of a approach battle with general cope and before this when the highlander be march on the city out of a volunteer corps of four hundred raise to meet they all but forty-five desert before the gate be pass -lrb- 1 -rrb- yet there be no reason to doubt that these frightened citizen after have once stand fire might have be as brave as the average it be a say in kansa that the new england man need to be shoot at once or twice after which they become the bravest of the brave this habitual courage mingle itself doubtless with the third species the magnetic or transmitted no mental philosopher have yet do justice to the wondrous power of leadership the art napoleon the ancient state it best in they proverb that a army of stag lead by a lion be more formidable than a army of lion lead by a stag it be for this reason that the greek use to send to sparta not for soldier but for a general when crillon _ l'homme san peur _ defend quilleboeuf with a handful of man against marshal villar the latter represent to he that it be madness to resist such superiority of number to which the answer be simply -- _ crillon est dedan et villars est dehors _ the event prove that the hero inside be stronger than the army outside every one know that there be a certain magnetic power in courage apart from all physical strength in a family of lone woman there be usually some one whose presence be hold to confer safety on the house she may be a delicate invalid but she be not afraid the same quality explain the difference in the demeanor of different company of man and woman in great emergency of danger read one narrative of shipwreck and human nature seem all sublime read another and under circumstance equally desperate it appear base selfish grovel the difference lie simply in the influence of a few lead spirit ordinarily as be the captain so be the officer so be the passenger so be the sailor bonaparte say that at the beginning of almost every battle there be a moment when the bravest troops be liable to sudden panic let the personal control of the general once lead they past that and the field be half win the courage of self-devotion lastly be the faculty evoke by special exigency in person who have before give no peculiar evidence of courage it belong especially to the race of martyr and enthusiast whose personal terror vanish in the greatness of the object so that joan of arc listen to the song of the angel do not feel the flame this indeed be the accustomed form in which woman 's courage proclaim itself at last unsuspected until the crisis come this have give we the deed of flora macdonald jane lane and the countess of derby the rescue of lord nithisdale by he wife and that plan for montrose by lady margaret durham the heroism of catherine dougla thrust she arm within the stanchion of the doorway to protect jame i of scotland till he murderer shatter the frail barrier and that sublimest narrative of woman 's devotion gertrude van der wart at she husband 's execution it be possible that all these woman may have be timid and shrink before the hour of trial and every emergency in peace or war bring out some such instance at the close of the trouble of 1856 in kansas a traveller chance to be visit a lady in lawrence who in open she work-basket accidentally let fall a small pistol she smile and blush and presently acknowledge that when she have first pull the trigger experimentally six month before she have shut she eye and scream although there be only a percussion-cap to explode yet it afterwards appear that she be one of the few woman who remain in they house to protect they by they presence when the town be enter by the missourian -- and also one of the still smaller number who bring they rifle to aid they husband in the redoubt when two hundred be all that could be rally against three thousand in September of that eventful year thus easily be the transition effect this be the courage also of african as manifest among ourselves -- the courage create by desperate emergency supple by long slavery soften by mixture of blood the black man seem to pass at one bind as woman do from cower pusillanimity to the topmost height of daring the giddy laugh vanish the idle chatter be hushed and the buffoon become a hero nothing in history surpass the bravery of the maroon of surinam as describe by stedman or of those of jamaica as delineate by dalla agent of the underground railroad report that the incident which daily come to they knowledge be beyond all greek all roman fame these man and woman who have test they courage in the lonely swamp against the alligator and the bloodhound who have starve on prairie hide in hold clung to locomotive ride hundred of mile cramp in box head downward equally near to death if discover or desert -- and who have then after endure all this go voluntarily back to risk it over again for the sake of wife or child -- what be we pale face that we should claim a rival capacity with theirs for heroic deed what matter if none below the throne of god can now identify that nameless negro in the tennessee iron-works who during the last insurrection say he know all about the plot but would die before he would tell he _ receive seven hundred and fifty lash and die _ yet where amid the mausoleum of the world be there carve a epitaph like that the courage of blood of habit or of imitation be not necessarily a very exalted thing but the courage of self-devotion can not be otherwise than noble however waste on fanaticism or delusion it enter the domain of conscience yet although the sublimest it be not necessarily the most undaunted form of courage it be vain to measure merit by martyrdom without reference to the temperament the occasion and the aim there be no passion in the mind of man so weak say lord bacon but it mate and master the fear of death sinner as well as saint may be guillotine or lynch and endure it well a red indian or a chinese robber will dare the stake as composedly as a early christian or a abolitionist one of the bravest of all death-scene be the execution of simon lord lovat who be unquestionably one of the greatest scoundrel that ever burden the earth we must look deeper the test of a man be not in the amount of he endurance but in its motive do he love the right he may die in glory on a bed of down be he false and base these thing thrust discord into he hymn of die anguish and no crown of thorn can sanctify he drooping head physical courage be after all but a secondary quality and need a sublime motive to make it thoroughly sublime among all these different form of courage it be almost equally true that it be the hardest of all quality to predict or identify in a individual case before the actual trial many a man have be unable to discover till the critical moment whether he himself possess it or not it be often deny to the healthy and strong and give to the weak the pugilist may be a poltroon and the bookworm a hero we have see the most purely ideal philosopher in this country face the black muzzle of a dozen load revolver with he usual serene composure and on the other hand we have know a black-bearded backwoodsman whose mere voice and presence would quell any riot among the lumberer -- yet this man nickname by he _ employee _ the black devil confess himself to be in secret the most timid of lamb one reason of this difficulty of estimate lie in the fact that courage and cowardice often complicate themselves with other qualify and so show false color for instance the presence or absence of modesty may disguise the genuine character the unpretending be not always timid nor always brave the boaster be not always but only commonly a coward be it otherwise how could we explain the existence of courage in frenchman or indian bark dog sometimes bite as many a small boy too trustful of the proverb have find to he cost if that be a friend of yours say brantême 's brave spanish cavalier pray for he soul for he have quarrel with I indeed the gascon whose name be identify with boasting -lrb- gasconade -rrb- be always among the bravest race in europe again the mere quality of caution be often mistaken for cowardice while heedlessness pass for daring a late eminent american sculptor a man of undoubted courage be say to have always take the rear car in a railroad train such a spirit of prudence where well-directed be to be view with respect we ought not to reverence the blind recklessness which sit on the safety-valve during a steamboat-race but the cool composure which neither underrate a danger nor shrink from it the best encomium be that of malcolm m ` leod upon charle edward : -- he be the most cautious man not to be a coward and the bravest man not to be rash that i ever see or that of charle vii of france upon pierre d'aubusson : -- never do i see unite so much fire and so much wisdom still again man vary as to the form of danger which test they most severely the irish be undoubtedly a brave nation but they courage be apt to vanish in presence of sickness they be not however alone in this if we may judge from the newspaper statement that after the recent quarantine riot in new york a small-pox patient lay all day untended in the park because no one dare to go near he it be say of dr johnson that he be a hero against pain but a coward against death probably the contrary emotion be quite as common to a believer in immortality death even when premature can scarcely be regard as a unmitigated evil but pain enforce its own recognition we can hardly agree with the frightened recruit in the farce who think victory or death a forbid war-cry but victory or wooden leg a more appetizing alternative beside these complication there be those arise from the share which conscience have in the matter thrice be he arm that have he quarrel just and the most resolute courage will sometimes quail in a bad cause and even die in its armor like bois-guilbert it be generally admit on both side in kansa that the border ruffian seldom dare face a equal number yet nobody assert that these man be intrinsically deficient in daring it be only conscience which make coward of they all but it be after all the faculty of imagination which more than all else confuse the phenomenon of courage and cowardice a very imaginative child be almost sure to be reproach with timidity while mere stolidity take rank as courage the bravest boy may sometimes be most afraid of the dark or of ghost or of the great mystery of storm and the sea even the mighty charlemagne shudder when the profess enchanter bring before he the vast form of dietrich and he northern companion on horseback we once see a party of boy test by a alarm which appeal solely to the imagination the only one among they who stand the test be the most cowardly of the group who escape the contagion through sheer lack of this faculty any imaginative person can occasionally test this on himself by sleep in a large lonely house or by bathing alone in some solitary place by the great ocean there come a thrill which be not bear of terror and the mere presence of a child break the spell -- though it would only enhance the actual danger if danger there be this explain the effect of darkness on danger let ajax perish in the face of day who have not shudder over the description of that arkansa duel fight by two naked combatant with pistol and bowie-knife in a dark room one thrill to think of those first few moment of breathless sightless hopeless hushed expectation -- then the confused encounter the slippery floor the invisible ghastly terror of that horrible chamber many a man would shrink from that who would march coolly up to the cannon 's mouth by daylight it be probably this mingling of imaginative excitement which make the approach of peril often more terrible than its actual contact a true knight say sir philip sidney be fuller of gay bravery in the midst than at the beginning of danger the boy condé be reproach with tremble in he first campaign my body tremble say the hero with the action my soul meditate and it be say of charle v that he often tremble when arm for battle but in the conflict be as cool as if it be impossible for a emperor to be kill these stray glimpse into the autobiography of heroism be of inestimable value and they be scanty at best it be say of turenne that he be once ask by m de lamoignon at the dinner-table of the latter if he courage be never shake at the commencement of a battle yes say turenne i sometimes undergo great nervous excitement but there be in the army a great multitude of subaltern officer and soldier who experience none whatever this go to illustrate the same point to give to any form of courage a available or work value it be essential that it have two quality promptness and persistency what napoleon call two-o'clock-in-the-morning courage be rare it require great enthusiasm or great discipline to be proof against a surprise it be say that suwarrow even in peace always sleep fully arm boot and all when i be lazy he say and want to enjoy a comfortable sleep i usually take off one spur in regard to persistency history be full of instance of unexpected reverse and eleventh-hour triumph the battle of marengo be consider hopeless for the first half of the day and a retreat be generally expect on the part of the french when desaix consult by bonaparte look at he watch and say -- the battle be completely lose but it be only two o'clock and we shall have time to gain another he then make he famous and fatal cavalry-charge and win the field it be from a noble appreciation of this quality of persistency that when the battle of cannæ be lose and hannibal be measure by bushel the ring of the fall roman knight the senate of rome vote thanks to the defeat general consul terentius varro for not have despair of the republic thus arm at all point incapable of be either surprised or exhaust courage achieve result which seem miraculous it be a element of inspiration something superad and incalculable when all the other force be exhaust when we consider how really formidable become the humblest of quadruped cat or rat when it grow mad and desperate and throw all personal fear behind it be clear that there must be a reserved power in human daring which defy computation and equalize the most fearful odds take one man mad with excitement

mountain which incident will prove he say that adventurous and even rash daring will render the most improbable undertaking successful and that desperate attempt may often make a general more fortunate and famous than the wisest and best-concerted plan it be this miraculous quality which help to explain the extraordinary victory of history : as where the army of lucullus at tigranocerta

what a roman be thy father my young bride how could they who never see he have discourse so rightly upon virtue from popular want of faith in these infinite resource of daring it be a common thing for person of eminent courage to be stigmatize as rash this have be strikingly the case for instance in modern time with the marquis of wellesley and sir charle napier when the duke of wellington be in the peninsula in 1810 the city of london address the throne protest against the bestowal of honorable distinction upon a general who have thus far exhibit with equal rashness and ostentation nothing but a useless valor but if bravery be liable to exist in excess on the one side it be a comfort to think that it be capable of cultivation where deficient there may be a few person bear absolutely without the power of courage as without the susceptibility to music -- but very few and no doubt the element of daring like those of musical perception can be develop in almost all once rouse the enthusiasm of the will and courage can be systematically discipline emerson 's maxim give the best regimen : always do what you be afraid to do if you lot be lay amid scene of peace then carry the

be easy to explain many man when commit on the right side of any question get credit for a moral courage which be in they case only a intense egotism isolate they from all demand for human sympathy in the best cause they prefer to belong to a party conveniently small and on the slightest indication of popular approbation begin to suspect themselves of compromise the abstract martyrdom of unpopularity be therefore clear gain to they but when it come to the rack and the thumbscrew the revolver and the bowie-knife the same habitual egotism make they coward these man be annoy in themselves and still worse because they throw discredit on the noble and unselfish reformer with whom they be identify in position but even among this higher class there be difference of temperament and it cost one man a effort to face the brute argument of the slung-shot while another 's fortitude be not seriously test till it come to face the newspaper editor we have give but a few aspect of a rich and endless theme and have depict these more by example than analysis mindful of the say of sidney that alexander receive more bravery of mind by the example of achille than by hear the definition of fortitude if we have seem to draw illustration too profusely from the record of battle it be to be remember that even if war be not the best nurse of heroism it be they best historian the chase for instance though perhaps as prolific in deed of daring as the camp have find few cumming and gerard for annalist and the more trivial aim of the pursuit diminish the permanence of its record the sublime fortitude of hospital the bravery show in infected city the fearlessness of fireman and of sailor these belong to those time of peace which have as yet few historian but we have seek to exhibit the deep foundation and instinct of courage and it matter little whence the illustration come doubtless for every great deed ever narrate there be a hundred greater one untold and the

door be open by a stout red-armed lump of a woman who in reply to my question say she name be bridget but biddy they call she mostly there be a rickety hat-stand in the entry upon which by the side of a schoolboy 's cap there hang a broad-brimmed white hat somewhat fatigue by use but look gentle and kindly as i have often notice good old gentleman 's hat do after they have wear they for a time the door of the dining-room be stand wide open and i go in a long table cover with a oil-cloth run up and down the length of the room and yellow wooden chair be range about it she show I where the gentleman use to sit and at the last part of the time the schoolmistress next to he the chair be like the rest but it be odd enough to notice that they stand close together touch each other while all the rest be straggle and separate i observe that peculiar atmospheric flavor which have be describe by mr balzac -lrb- the french story-teller who borrow so many thing from some of we american load writer -rrb- under the name of _ odeur de pension _ it be as one may say a olfactory perspective of a endless vista of depart breakfast dinner and supper it be similar if not identical in all temperate climate a kind of neutral tint which form the perpetual background upon which the banquet of today strike out its keener but more transitory aroma i do not think it necessary to go into any further particulars because this atmospheric character have the effect of make the dining-room of all boarding-house seem very much alike and the accident of a hair-cloth sofa cold shiny slippery prickly -- or a veneered sideboard with a scale off here and there and a knob or two miss -- or a portrait with one hand half under its coat the other rest on a pious-looking book -- these accident and such as these make no great difference the landlady soon present herself and i follow she into the parlor which be a decent apartment with a smart centre-table on which lay a accordion a recent number of the pactolian a gilt-edged illustrated book or two and a copy of the work of that distinguished native author to whom i feel very spiteful on account of he have some year ago attack _ a near friend of mine _ and whom on christian principle i do not mention -- though i have notice that where there be a accordion on the table he book be apt to be lie near it the landlady be a wilted -lrb- not exactly wither -rrb- sad-eyed woman of the thin-blooded sort but firm-fibred and sharpen and make shrewd by she call so that the look with which she run I over in the light of a possible boarder be so search that i be half put down by it i inform she of my errand which be to make some inquiry concern two former boarder of hers in whom a portion of the public have express some interest and of whom i should be glad to know certain personal detail -- as to they habit appearance and so on any information she might furnish would be look upon in the light of a literary contribution to the page of the oceanic miscellany and be compensate with the well-known liberality of the publisher of that spirited enterprising and very popular periodical up to this point the landlady 's countenance have keep that worried watchful look which poor woman who have to fight the world single-handed sooner or later grow into but now she feature relax a little the blow which have crush she life have shatter she smile and as the web of shivered expression shoot off its ray across she feature i fancy that grief have write she face all over with ` w ' to mark she as one of he forlorn flock of widow the report here give be partly from the conversation hold with the landlady at that time and partly from write note which she furnish I for find that she be to be a contributor to the oceanic miscellany and that in that capacity she would be entitle to the ample compensation offer by the liberal proprietor of that admirably conduct periodical -- which we be pleased to learn have be grow in general favor and which the public may be assure no pain will be spare to render superior in every respect -- i say find that she be to be handsomely remunerate she enter into the subject with great zeal both verbally and by letter the reader will see that i sometimes follow she orthography and sometimes she pronunciation as i may have take it from write or from speech the landlady 's account there be two vacant place at my table which i should be please to fill with two gentleman or with a gentleman and he wife or any respectable people be they merry or single it be about the gentleman and the lady that use to set in they place that inquiry be bein ' make some have write and some have speak and a good many folk that be unbeknown to I have come in and want to see the place where they use to set and some day it be be nothin ' but ring ring ring from mornin ' till night folk will be curious about they that have write in the papers there be my daughter could not be easy no way till she would get a profeel of one of they author to hang up right over the head of she bed that be the gentleman that write story in the papers some in the same way this gentleman do i expect that inquiry be make about i be a poor woman that try to get a honest livin ' and work hard enough for it -- lose my husband and bury five child and have two livin ' one to support it be a great loss to I losin ' they two boarder and if there be anything in they papers he leave in that desk that will fetch anything at any of the shop where they buy such thing i be sure i wish you would ask the printer to step round here and stop in and see what any of 'em be worth i 'll let you have one or two of 'em and then you can see whether you do not know anybody that would take the lot i suppose you 'll put what i tell you into shape for like as not i sha 'n' t write it out nor talk jest as folk that make book do this gentleman war not no great of a gentleman to look at be of a very moderate dimension -- five foot five _ he _ say but five foot four more likely and i have heerd he say he do not weigh much over a hundred and twenty pound he be light-complected rather than darksome and be one of they smooth-faced people that keep they baird and wisker cut close jest as if they would be very troublesome if they let 'em grow -- instead of layin ' out they face in grass as my poor husband that be dead and go use to say he be a well-behaved gentleman at table only talk a good deal and pretty loud sometimes and have a way of turnin ' up he nose when he do not like what folk say that one of my boarder who be a very smart young man say he could not stand no how and use to make face and poke fun at he whenever he see he do it he never say a word aginst any vittle that be set before he but i mistrust that he be more partickerlar in he eatin ' than he want folk to know of for i have know would he make believe to eat and leave the vittle on he plate when he do not seem to fancy 'em but he be very careful never to hurt my feelin 's and i do not belief he would have speak if he have find a tadpole in a dish of chowder but nothin ' could hurry he when he be about he vittle many 's the time i have see that gentleman keepin ' two or three of 'em settin ' round the breakfast-table after the rest have swaller they meal and the thing be clear off and bridget be a-waitin ' to get the cloth away -- and there that little man would set with a tumbler of sugar and water -- what he use to call o sukray -- a-talkin ' and a-talkin ' -- and sometimes he would laugh and sometimes the tear would come into he eye -- which be a kind of grayish blue eye -- and there he would set and set and my boy benjamin franklin hangin ' round and gettin ' late for school and wantin ' a excuse and a old gentleman that be one of my boarder a-listenin ' as if he wa 'n' t no older than my benj franklin and that schoolmistress settin ' jest as if she have be bewitch and you might stick pin into she without she hollerin ' he be a master hand to talk when he get a-goin ' but he never would have no dispute nor long argerment at my table and i like he all the better for that for i have a boarder once that never let nothin ' go by without disputin ' of it till nobody know what he believe and what he do not believe only they be pretty sure he do not believe the side he be a-disputin ' for and some of 'em say that if you want he to go any partickerlar way you must do with he just as folk do that drive -- well they obstinate creetur that squeal so -- for i do not like to name such creetur in connexion with a gentleman that pay he board regular and be a very smart man and know a great deal only he knowledge all lay crosswise as one of 'em use to say after t ` other one have shet he up till he mouth wa 'n' t of no more use to he than if it have be a hole in the back of he head this wa 'n' t no sech gentleman one of my boarder use to say that he always say exactly what he be a mind to and stick he idee out jest like they that sell pear outside they shop-winder -- some be three cent some be two cent and some be only one cent and if you do not like you need not buy but they be the article and they be the price and if you want 'em take 'em and if you do not go about you business and do not stand mellerin ' of 'em with you thumb all day till you have sp ` ilt 'em for other folk he be a man that love to stick round home as much as any cat you ever see in you life he use to say he would as lief have a tooth pull as go away anywhere always get sick he say when he go away and never sick when he do not pretty nigh kill himself goin ' about lecterin ' two or three winter -- talkin ' in cold country lyceum -- as he use to say -- goin ' home to cold parlor and bein ' treat to cold apple and cold water and then goin ' up into a cold bed in a cold chamber and comin ' home next mornin ' with a cold in he head as bad as the horse-distemper then he would look kind of sorry for havin ' say it and tell how kind some of the good woman be to he -- how one spread a edder-down comforter for he and another fix up somethin' hot for he after the lecter and another one say -- there now you smoke that cigar of yours after the lecter jest as if you be at home -- and if they would all be like that he would have go on lecter forever but as it be he have get pooty nigh enough of it and prefer a nateral death to puttin ' himself out of the world by such violent means as lecterin ' he use to say that he be always good company enough if he be not freeze to death and if he be not pin in a corner so ' t he could not clear out when he would get as much as he want but he be a dreadful uneven creetur in he talk and i have heerd a smart young man that be one of my boarder say he believe he have a lid to the top of he head and take he brain out and leave 'em up-stairs sometimes when he come down in the mornin ' -- about he way he be spry and quick and impatient and except in a good company -- he use to say -- where he could get away at any minute he do not like to set still very long to once but want to be off walkin ' or rowin ' round in one of they queer boat of he and he be the solitariest creetur in he goin 's about -lrb- except when he could get that schoolmistress to trail round with he -rrb- that ever you see in you life he use to say that usin ' two eye and two leg at once and keepin ' one tongue a-goin ' too be too sharp practice for he so he have a way of dodgin ' round all sort of odd street i have heerd say where he would not meet people that would stick to he it do not take much to please he sometimes it would be a big book he would lug home and sometimes it would be a mikerscope and sometimes it would be a dreadful old-lookin ' fiddle that he would pick up somewhere and keep a-screechin ' on sayin ' all the while that it be jest as smooth as a flute then ag ` in i would hear he laughin ' out all alone and i would go up and find he readin ' some verse that he would be makin ' but jest as like as not i would go in another time and find he cryin ' -- but he would wipe he eye and try not to show it -- and it be all nothin ' but some more verse he would be a-writin ' i have heerd he say that it be put down in one of they ancient book that a man must cry himself if he want to make other folk cry but say he you can not make 'em neither laugh nor cry if you do not try on they feelin 's yourself before you send you work to the customer he be a temperate man and always encourage temperance by drinkin ' jest what he be a mind to and that be generally water you could not scare he with name though i remember a young minister that be go 'n' to be that board at my house askin ' once what be the safest strong drink for they that have to take somethin' for the stomach 's sake and thine awful infirmity _ aqua forti _ say he -- because you know that 'll eat you inside out if you get it too strong and so you always mind how much you take next to that say he rum 's the safest for a wise man and small beer for a fool i never mistrust anything about he and that schoolmistress till i heerd they be keepin ' company and be go 'n' to be merried but i might have know it well enough by he smartin ' himself up the way he do and partin ' the hair on the back of he head and gettin ' a blue coat with brass button and wearin ' they dreadful tight little french boot that use to stand outside he door to be black and stickin ' round schoolma'am and follerin ' of she with he eye but then he be always fond of lady and use to sing with my daughter and write he name out in a blank book she keep -- they that have daughter of they own will keep they eye on 'em -- and i have often heerd he say he be fond of music and picter -- and she work a beautiful pattern for a chair of he once that he seem to set a good deal by but i ha 'n' t no fault to find and there be they that my daughter like and they that like she as to schoolma'am i ha 'n' t a word to say that a 'n' t favorable and do not harbor no unkind feelin ' to she and never know they that do when she first come to board at my house i have not any idee she have live long she be all dress in black and she face look so delicate i expect before six month be over to see a plate of glass over it and a bible and a bunch of flower layin ' on the lid of the -- well i do not like to talk about it for when she first come and say she mother be dead and she be alone in the world except one sister out west and unlock she trunk and show I she thing and take out she little purse and show I she money and say that be all the property she have in the world but she courage and she education and would i take she and keep she till she could get some scholar -- i could not say not one word but jest go up to she and kiss she and bu ` st out a-cryin ' so as i never cry since i bury the last of my five child that lay in the buryin ' - ground with they father and a place for one more grown person betwixt he and the shortest of they five grave where my baby be waitin ' for its mother -lrb- the landlady stop here and shed a few still tear such as poor woman who have be wring out almost dry by fierce grief lose calmly without sob or hysteric convulsion when they show the scar of a heal sorrow -rrb- -- the schoolma'am have jest be killin ' herself for a year and a half with waitin ' and tendin ' and watchin ' with that sick mother that be dead now and she be in mournin ' for _ she _ do not say so but i get the story out of she and then i knowed why she look so dreadful pale and poor by-and-by she begin to get some scholar and then she would come home sometimes so weak and faint that i be afraid she would drop one day i hand she a bottle of camphire to smell of and she take a smell of it and i think she would have faint right away -- oh say she when she come to i have breathe that smell for a whole year and more and it kill I to breathe it again the fust thing that ever i see pass between the gentleman inquiry be make about and she be on occasion of he makin ' some very searchin ' remark about grief sech as loss of friend and so on i see she fix she eye steady on he and then she kind of tremble and turn white and the next thing i know be she be all of a heap on the floor i remember he look into she face then and seem to be seize as if it be with a start or spasm-like -- but i think nothin ' more of it supposin ' it be because he feel so bad at makin ' she faint away some have ask I what kind of a young woman she be to look at well folk differ as to what be likely and what be homely i have see they that be as pretty as picter in my eye : cheek jest as rosy as they could be and hair all shiny and curly and little mouth with lip as red as sealin ' - wax and yet one of my boarder that have a great name for makin ' marble figger would say such kind of good look war not of no account i know a young lady once that a man drownd himself because she would not marry he and she might have have she pick of a dozen but i do not call she anything great in the way of look all i can say be that whether she be pretty or not she look like a young woman that know what be true and that love what be good and she have about as clear a eye and about as pleasant a smile as any man ought to want for every-day company i have see a good many young lady that could talk faster than she could but if you would see she or heerd she when we boardin ' - house catch afire or when there be anything to be do besides speech-makin ' i guess you would like to have stand still and look on jest to see that young woman 's way of goin ' to work -- dark rather than light and slim but strong in the arm -- perhaps from liftin ' that old mother about for i have see she heavin ' one end of a big heavy chest round that i should not have think of touchin ' -- and yet she hand be little and white -- dress very plain but neat and wear she hair smooth i use to wonder sometimes she do not wear some kind of ornament bein ' a likely young woman and havin ' she way to make in the world and seein ' my daughter wearin ' jewelry which set she off so much every day she never would -- nothin ' but a breastpin with she mother 's hair in it and sometimes one little black cross that make I think she be a roman catholic especially when she get a picter of the virgin mary and hang it up in she room so i ask she and she shake she head and say these very word -- that she never see a church-door so narrow she could not go in through it nor so wide that all the creator 's goodness and glory could enter it and then she drop she eye and go to work on a flannel petticoat she be makin ' -- which i knowed but she do not tell I be for a poor old woman i have say enough about they two boarder but i believe it be all true they place be vacant and i should be very glad to fill 'em with two gentleman or with a gentleman and he wife or any respectable people be they merry or single i have heerd some talk about a friend of that gentleman 's comin ' to take he place that be the gentleman that he call the professor and i be sure i hope there be sech a man only all i can say be i never see he and none of my boarder ever see he and that smart young man that i be speakin ' of say he do not believe there be no sech person as he nor that other one that he call the poet i do not much care whether folk profess or make poem if they make themselves agreeable and pay they board regular i be a poor woman that try to get a honest livin ' and work hard enough for it lose my husband and bury five child excuse I dear madam i say -- look at my watch -- but you speak of certain papers which you boarder leave and which you be ready to dispose of for the page of the oceanic miscellany the landlady 's face splintered again into the wreck of the broken dimple of better day -- she should be much obleege if i would look at they she say -- and go up stair and get a small desk contain loose papers i look they hastily over and select one of the shortest piece hand the landlady a check which astonish she and send the follow poem as a appendix to my report if i should find other adapt to the page of the spirited periodical which have do so much to develop and satisfy the intellectual appetite of the american public and to extend the name of its enterprising publisher throughout the reading world

the union as he have lately be style -- for what reason we know not unless that ajax be chiefly know to the public as a personage very much in want of light -- mr caleb cushing have receive a invitation to dine in south carolina this extraordinary event while it amply account for the appearance of the comet must also be hold to answer for the publication by mr cushing of a letter almost as long if not quite so transparent as the comet 's tail craytonville be the name of the happy village already famous as the place of the nativity of mr speaker orr and hereafter to be a shrine of pilgrimage as the spot where mr cushing might have go through the beautiful natural process of mastication and deglutition have he choose we use this elegant latinism in deference to mr ex-commissioner cushing for as he evidently deem birth-place too simple a word for such a complex character as mr orr we could not think of coupling he own name with so common a proceeding as eat he dinner it may be sectionalism in we -- but at the risk of dissolve the union we will not yield to any southern man a larger share of the dictionary -lrb- unless it be webster 's -rrb- than we give to a gentleman who be bear at -- we beg pardon the place of whose nativity be -- newburyport mr cushing have distinguish himself lately as the preacher-up of a crusade against modern philanthropy and we do not wonder at it if the offer of a dinner be so rare as to demand in acknowledgment a letter three column long or perhaps he consider the offer itself as a instance of that insane benevolence which he reprobate and accordingly punish it with a epistle the reading of which would delay the consummation of the edacious treason till all the meat be cold and the more impatient conspirator drive from the table or be those who have invite he _ negrophilist _ -lrb- to use mr cushing 's favorite word -rrb- and therefore deserving of such retribution not at all they be all _ leucophilist _ as sincere and warm-hearted as himself or perhaps this letter express mr cushing 's notion of what a proper answer to a dinner-invitation should be we have no complete letter-writer at hand and consequently can not compare it with any classic model but if we remember rightly that useful book be not in as many volume as the catalogue of the british museum be to be and the example there give must necessarily be deny so sea-serpentine a voluminousness we suspect that the style be original with the ex-brigadier-attorney-general but while we allow it the merit of novelty we think there be some grave objection to its universal adoption it would be a great check on hospitality for by parity of reason the invitation should be as tedious as the reply and a treaty of dinner would take nearly as much time as a treaty of peace this would be a great damage to the butcher whose interest -lrb- to borrow a bit of political economy from mr cushing 's letter -rrb- be complementary to those of the dinner-giver and the diner again it would be fatal to all conversation suppose the dinner at last to take place for the amphitryon on the one hand have already exploit everything he know and do not know from sanconiathon manetho and berosus to dr hickok -- and the guest -- but the thought of they unite effort be too appalling in short -lrb- if we may use that term in connection with such a subject -rrb- we can not believe and certainly do not hope that mr cushing 's system will ever become popular even if it should we think that a improvement upon it might be suggest we subjoin a form of invitation and answer which any of we reader be at liberty to use if they should ever need they _ punkinopoli _ 28th sept 1858 my dear n n i send by the bearer the correspondence of horace walpole and burke 's letter on a regicide peace which be probably as entertaining and eloquent as anything i could write i send also cicero de amicitia brillat-savarin 's physiologie du gout the work of athenæus and the banquet of plato if after a perusal of these work you be not convince that i entertain the most friendly feeling towards you and that i wish you to dine with I on this day twelvemonth i do not know what further argument to employ yours faithfully & c & c baldeagleville feb 10 1859 my dear & c & c the wagon which accompany this will bring you a copy of the encyclopedia britannica the reading of this choice morçeau of contemporary literature will suggest to you nearly all i have to say in reply to you interesting communication of the 28th September last by read in succession the article confucius fortification sandwich island and æsthetics you will form some notion of the mingled emotion with which i remain : yours truly nn p s the amount of time require for master the greek language in order thoroughly to enjoy some passage of you charming note alone prevent I from send so full a answer as i should wish in these day when everybody be correspondence be publish as soon as he be dead -- or during he life if he be unfortunate enough to be the director of a observatory and there be a chance of injure he by the breach of confidence -- we can not help think that the form we have give above be not only more compendious but safer than mr cushing 's if he method should come into vogue posterity would be deprive of the letter of this generation for nearly a century by the time necessary to print they and then allow for the imperious interval of sleep would hardly contrive to get through they in less than a couple of century more we leave to those who have read mr cushing 's reply to the craytonville invitation the painful task of estimate the loss to the world from such a contingency meanwhile the perplexing question arise -- if such be the warrior-statesman 's measure of gratitude for a dinner what would be he scale for a breakfast or a dish of tea cæsar announce a victory in three word but in this respect he be very inferior to mr cushing whose style be much more copious and who show as remarkable talent in the command of language as the other general do in the command of troops on first reading mr cushing 's letter its obscurity puzzle we not a little there be passage in it that would have pleased lycophron himself who wish he might be hang if anybody could understand he poem dilution be to be expect in a production whose author have to make three column out of thank you can not come even a person overrun with the milk of human kindness as mr cushing on so remarkable a occasion undoubtedly be might be pardon for adopt the shift of dealer in the dearer vaccine article and reinforce he store from a friendly pump the expansiveness of the heart would naturally communicate itself to the diction but on the other hand repeat experiment fail to detect even the most watery flavor of conviviality in the composition the epistle of jacob behman himself be not farther remove from any contamination with the delight of sense be this then a mere baratarian banquet a feast of reason to which mr cushing have be invite or do he intend to pay a indirect tribute of respect to he ancestry by send what would produce all the hilarious effect of one of those interminable puritan grace before meat no the dinner be a real dinner -- the well-known hospitality of south carolina toward massachusett ambassador forbid any other supposition -- and mr cushing 's letter itself however dark in some particulars be clear enough in renounce every principle and practice of the founder of new england we must find therefore some other reason why the ex-commander of the palmetto regiment when the carolinian ask the pleasure of he society give they instead the agreeable relaxation of a sermon -- a example which we trust will not prove infectious among the clergy it occur to we suddenly that the next democratic national convention be to assemble in charleston it be not therefore too early to send in seal proposal for the presidency and if this letter be mr cushing 's bid we must do he the justice to say that we think nobody will be find to go lower we doubt if it will avail he much but the precedent of northern politician go south for wool and come back shear be so long establish that a lawyer like himself will hardly venture to take exception to it like he great namesake the son of jephunneh he may bring back a gigantic bunch of grape from this land of large promise and small fulfilment but we fear they will be of the variety which set the tooth on edge and fill the belly with that east wind which might have be have cheaper at home if nevertheless mr cushing be desirous of be a candidate it be worth while to consider what would be the principle on which he would administer the government and what be he claim to the confidence of the public we be begin to discover that the personal character of the president have a great deal to do with the conduct of the almost irresponsible executive head of the republic what then have be mr cushing 's political antecedent and what be he present creed there be many point of resemblance between he character and career and those of the present chancellor of the english exchequer belong to a part of the country whose opinion be to all intent and purpose politically proscribe he have go over to a party whose whole policy have tend to harass the commerce to cripple the manufacture and to outrage the moral sense of new england and have win advancement and prominence in that party by he talent contrive at the same time to make he origin a service rather than a detriment like mr disraelus he have be consistent only in devotion to success like he accomplish handsome plucky industrious and dangerous if unconvincing in debate he bring to bear on every question the immediate force of personal courage and readiness but none of that force draw from persistent principle whose defeat be tutoring for victory with a quick eye for the weak point of a enemy and a knack of so drape commonplace with rhetoric that they shall have the momentary air of profound generalization he be also like he more cunning in expedient than capable of far-seeing policy adroit in create and foster prejudice acute in draw metaphysical distinction which shall make wrong seem right by show that it be less wrong than it appear he be unable to see that public opinion be never mould by metaphysics and that with the people instinct be as surely permanent as prejudice be transitory like mr disraelus versatile he be liable to forget that what man admire as a grace in the intellect they condemn as a defect in the character and conduct gifted like he with various talent he have one which overshadow all the rest -- the faculty of inspiring a universal want of confidence as a popular leader the advantage which daring would have give he be more than counterpoise by a acuteness and refinement of mind which have no sympathy with the mass of man and which they in turn be likely to distrust from imperfect comprehension ill-adapted for the rough-and-tumble contest of a democracy he be admirably fit to be the minister or the head of a oligarchical republic we wish all we northern representative have the boldness and the ability we hope none of they will be seduce by the example of mr cushing he be one of those able man whose imputed be even greater than they real mental capacity because the standard of ordinary man be success -- and success of a certain kind be assure to those mixed character which combine the virtue of courage with the vice of unscrupulousness a ambitious man like loui napoleon for example who set out with those two best gift of worldly fortune a lace with nothing but brass and a pocket with nothing but copper in it have a brilliant if a short career before he and will be sure to gain the character of ability for if ambition but find selfishness to work upon it have that leverage which archimede wish for but time make sad havoc with this false greatness with this reputation which pass for fame and this adroitness which pass for wisdom with merely acute mind when plausibility and truth divide the world between they the one choose to-day and the other to-morrow to enable we to construct a theory of mr cushing 's present position we have two recent production in print -- he fourth of July oration at new york and he letter to the craytonville committee but he have see too many aspirant for the presidency contrive to drown themselves in they inkstand and be far too shrewd a man to elaborate any documentary evidence of he opinion if we arrive at they it must be by a process of induction and by gather what evidence we can from other source mr cushing know very well that the multitude have nothing but a secondary office in the making of president and address to they only he word while the initiate alone know what mean to put on they if for example when he say _ servant _ he mean _ slave _ when he say _ negrophilist _ he mean _ republican _ and when he say _ false philanthropy _ he mean _ the fairest instinct of the human heart _ we have a right to suspect that there be also a esoteric significance in the phrase _ loyalty to the union _ _ nationality _ and _ conservatism _ have a constituent of mr cushing in the essex north district take a nap of twenty year -- -lrb- and if he have invite he representative to dinner and get such a answer as the craytonville letter the supposition be not extravagant -rrb- -- what would have be he amazement on wake to find he member of congress harangue a assembly of original democrat in tammany hall caius marcius address the volscian council of war would occur to he as the only historic parallel for such a rhetorical phenomenon the one be a ideal as the other be a commonplace example of the ludicrous contradiction in which man may be involve who find in personal motive the justification of public conduct that the chairman of the meeting should have have in he pocket a letter from the candidate of the buffalo convention and that mr john van buren should have sit upon the platform while the orator charge the leader of the republican party with interested motive be merely two of those incidental circumstance by which fact always vindicate she claim to be more satiric than fiction but when mr cushing speak with exultation of the past and with confidence of the future of the original democratic party we can think of nothing like it but charle ii take the solemn league and covenant with a unctuous allusion to the persecution we covenanter have undergo and the triumph of vital piety to which we look forward mr cushing claim that the democratic party have originate and carry through every measure that have become a part of the settle policy of the government this be not very remarkable if we consider that the party have be in power during by far the greater part of we national existence and that under we system the administration be practically a dictatorship for four year mr everett long ago point out the advantage we should gain by have a responsible ministry as it be the representative branch of we government be practically a nullity what with he immense patronage the progress of event and the chance of lure the oppose party into by-question the presidential micawber of the moment be almost sure that something will turn up to extricate he from the consequence of he own incompetency or dishonesty the only check upon this system be the chance that the temerity engender by irresponsible power may lead the executive to measure which as in the case of kansas shall open the eye of think man to the real design and object of those in office a opposition be necessarily transitory in its nature if it be not found on some principle which reach below the shift sand of politics rest upon the primary rock of moral and conscience in such a principle only be find the nucleus of a party which the adverse patronage of a corrupt executive can but strengthen by attract from it its baser element such a opposition the democratic party seem lately to have devote all its policy to build up and now confront with it can find no remedy but in the abolishment of moral and conscience altogether the democratic party like the distinguished ancestor of jonathan wild have be impartially on both side of every question of domestic policy which have arise since it come into political existence it have be _ pro _ and _ con _ in regard to a navy a national bank internal improvement protection hard money and missourus compromise its lead doctrine be state rights its whole course of action culminate in the dred scott decision have be in the direction of centralization during all these change it have contrived to have the constitution always on its side by the simple application of swift 's axiom orthodoxy be _ my _ doxy heterodoxy be _ thy _ doxy though it have have as many doxy as cowley sometimes it have even have two at once as in refuse to the iron of pennsylvanium the protection it give to the sugar of louisiana pennsylvanium avenge herself by the fatal gift of mr buchanan there be one exception to the amiable impartiality of the party -- it have be always and energetically pro-slavery in this respect mr cushing have the advantage of it for he have be on both side of the slavery question also it must be grant however that he lapse into _ negrophilism _ be but a momentary weakness and that without it the whig party would have lose the advantage of he character and the lesson of he desertion in congress he be say to be master of several tongue and it be therefore quite natural that he should have hold a different language at different time on many different question a creed so various that it seem to be not one but every creed 's epitome could not fail to be strangely attractive to a mind so versatile as that of mr cushing yet we can not deny to he conversion some remarkable feature which give it a peculiar interest in some respects he case offer a please contrast to that of the rev john newton for as the latter be convert from slave-trading to christianity so mr cushing -lrb- whatever he may have renounce -rrb- seem to have embrace something very like the principle which the friend of cowper abandon -- another example of the beautiful compensation by which the balance of nature be preserved and he conversion be sudden enough to have please even jonathan edward himself up to the ripe age of forty-two he have be join to he idol it be a proverb that he who be a fool at forty will be a fool at fourscore yet mr cushing who be certainly no fool have be blind to the beauty of original democracy for a year or two beyond that alliterative era the whig have just succeed in elect they candidate and it seem as if nothing short of a almost providential interposition could save he that interposition come in the death of general harrison which take away the last earthly hope of whig advancement it be what the jockey call a very near thing but for that -- it be a sad thought -- mr cushing might have be on we side now this be the _ gratium operan _ mr tyler who succeed to the presidency have democratic proclivity this be the _ gratium coöperans _ and finally we see the _ gratium perficien _ in the appointment of we catechuman to the chinese commissionership from the central flowery kingdom he return a full-blown original democrat in 1853 mr pierce finding himself elect president for no other reason apparently than that he have fail to distinguish himself in the mexican war appoint mr cush he attorney general on the same benevolent principle -- console he for have to sheathe a bloodless sword by give he a chance to draw the more dangerous opinion we have allude only to such fact in mr cushing 's history as be fresh in the remembrance of we reader and it would not have be worth we while to allude even to these if he have not see fit to speak of the lead man of the republican party as dangerous because they have _ no fixed principle no stable conviction no sample of consistency to control they act _ because they _ only creed be what have be call the duty of success _ and because they success -- the successful accomplishment of a sectional organization of the government on the ruin of its nationality -- would be the _ de facto _ dissolution of the union in he letter he say also that it be a fact humiliating to confess that the cant of negroism still have vogue as one of the minor instrument of demagoguy in northern state the coolness of such charge come from mr cushing be below the freezing-point of quicksilver shall we take lesson in fixedness of principle from the whig-antislavery member from federalist essex -- in stable conviction from the tyler-commissioner to china -- in consistency from the democratic attorney-general -- in a amalgam of all three from the coalition judge shall we find a more pointed warning of the worthlessness of success in the word than in the example of the orator since reynard the fox don a friar 's hood and with the feather still stick in he whisker preach against the damnable heresy of hen-stealing there have be nothing like this in china they set great store by porcelain that have be often break and mend again with silver wire prize it more highly than that which be sound and fresh from the hand of the potter there be a kind of political character of the same description -- hollow-ware not generally porcelain indeed -- crack in every direction but deftly bind together with silver strip of preferment till it be consistent enough to serve all the need of its possessor in receive large mess of the public pottage how the chinese would have admire mr tyler 's commissioner if they have know the exquisite perfection of _ crackle _ display in he political career to be sure the chinese be we antipode the imputation of inconsistency be one to which every sound politician and every honest thinker must sooner or later subject himself fool and dead man be the only people who never change they opinion or they course of action the course of great statesman resemble that of navigable river avoid immovable obstacle with noble bend of concession seek the broad level of opinion on which man soonest settle and longest dwell follow and mark the almost imperceptible slope of national tendency yet forever recruit from source nearer heaven from summit where the gather purity of age lie encamped and sometimes burst open path of progress and civilisation through what seem the eternal barrier of both it be a loyalty to great end a anchor cling to solid principle which know how to swing with the tide but not to be carry away by it that we demand in public man -- and not persistence in prejudice sameness of policy or stolid antagonism to the inevitable but we demand also that they shall not too lightly accept wrong instead of right as inevitable and there be a kind of change that be suspicious because it be sudden -- and detrimental to the character in proportion as it be of advantage to the man and the judgment of mankind allow a well-founded distinction between a alteration of policy compel by event and a abandonment of profess principle taint with any suspicion of self-interest we hold that a representative be a trustee for those who elect he -- that he political apostasy only so far deserve the name of conversion as it be a conversion of what be not he to he own use and benefit and we have a right to be impatient of instruction in duty from those whom the hope of promotion could nerve to make the irrevocable leap from a defeat party to a triumphant one and who can serve either side if so they only serve themselves it be this kind of freedom from prejudice that have bring down we politics to the gambling level of the stock-market it be this kind of unlucky success and the readiness of the multitude to forgive and even to applaud it that justify the old sarcasm _ patibulum inter et statuam quàm leve discrimen _ it be not for inconsistency of policy in matter of indifference that we should blame a mart or a party but for make question of honor and moral matter of indifference inconsistency be to be settle not by seem discrepancy between the action of one day and that of the next but by the experience which enable we to judge of motive and impulse time which reconcile apparent contradiction impeach real one and show a malicious satirical turn in force man into position where they must break they own neck in attempt to face both way nor be it for inconsistency that we condemn the democratic party there be no trade-wind for the ship of state unless it be navigate by higher principle than any the political meteorologist have yet discover but there have be mysterious movement of late which raise a violent presumption that we democratic captain and officer be alter the rig and adapt the hold of the vessel to suit the demand of a traffic condemn by the whole civilized world they be paint out the old name letter by letter and put conservative in its stead they seem to fancy there be such a thing as a slave-trade-wind and be attempt to beat up against what they profess to believe a local current and a gust of popular delusion we think they be destine to find that they be strive against the invincible drift of humanity and the elemental breath of god it be a ominous _ consistency _ with which we charge the democratic party mr cushing affirm that the republican have no argument but the cry of _ slavepower _ -- which be as eloquent a one as the old roman 's _ delenda est carthago _ to those who know how many year of bitter experience how many memory of danger and foreboding of aggression be compress in it but he be mistaken democratic administration have be busy in supply argument and we complain rather of they abundance than they paucity the repeal of the missourus compromise the kansa policy which even office-holder who have gulp they own profession find too nauseous to swallow and the dred scott decision -- if these be not argument then history be no teacher and event have no logic mr cushing adroitly evade the real matter in issue and assume that it be a mere question of the relative amount of federal office secure by the north and the south respectively this may be a very natural view of the case in a man whose map of nationality would seem to be bound north by a seat in congress east by a chinese embassy west by a attorney-generalship and south by the vague line of future contingency but it hardly solve the difficulty with characteristic pluck he take the wolf by the ear the charge be that the power of the slave state have be gain a steady preponderance over that of the free state by means of the federal administration he answer it by say that he have make it a subject of philosophic study and have find that massachusett have have a pretty fair run of the power of the union -- whatever that may be the phrase be unfortunate for it remind one too much of the handsome competence with which a father once claim to have endow he son in give he the run of the street since he be able to go alone but let we test mr cushing 's logic by a equivalent proposition he be executor we will suppose of a estate to be divide among sixteen heir he pay a he portion and claim a discharge in full what would not mr buchanan give for a receipt by which office-seeker could be so cheaply satisfied philosophic study to be sure it may be easy for gentleman the chief part of whose productive industry have be the holding of office or the prepare of they conviction for the receipt of more to be philosophic but it be not so easy for massachusett to be satisfy when she see only those of she child so reward who misrepresent she long-cherished principle who oppose the spread of she institution who mock at she sense of right and she hereditary love of freedom and be willing to accept place as a equivalent for the loss of she confidence the question who be in office may be of primary importance to mr cushing but be of little consequence to the free state what concern they be how and in what interest be the office administer if to the detriment of free institution then all the worse that son of theirs can be find to do that part of the work which involve -lrb- as affair be now tend -rrb- something very like personal dishonor it be no matter of pride to we that the south have never be able to produce a sailor skilful enough and bold enough to take command of a slaver mr cushing affect to see in the history of the slavery agitation nothing but a series of injury inflict by the north on the south he charge some of the northern state with act of aggression upon the south which would have be just cause of war as between foreign government he prudently forbear to name any do he mean that person have be find in some of those state unnational enough un-original-democratic enough to give a cup of water to a hunt christian woman or to harbor a outcast christian man without first submit they hair to a microscopic examination do he mean that we have say hard thing of we southern brethren grose 's classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue be open to they as well as to we and the richmond south be surely not in the habit of sprinkle the northern subject of its animadversion with rose-water no -- what mr cushing mean be this -- that there be man at the north who will not surrender the principle they have inherit from three revolution because they be threaten with a fourth that will never come -- who do not consider it a adequate success in we experiment of self-government that we can produce such type of nationality as reckon the value of they country by the amount of salary she pay -- who will not believe that there be no higher kind of patriotism than complicity in every violent measure of a administration which redeem only its pledge to a faction of southern disunionist -- who will not admit that slave-holding be the only important branch of national industry because the profession of that dogma enable unscrupulous man to enter the public service poor and to leave it rich have any citizen of a southern state ever fail to obtain justice -lrb- that be to say in the language of original democracy he _ nigger _ -rrb- in a northern court have massachusett ever mob a envoy or brutally assault a senator of south carolina have any northern state ever nullify a article of the federal constitution as every seaboard slave-state have always do in respect to the color citizen of the north when a man 's allow himself to be kick come to be reckon a outrage on the kicker then mr cushing 's notion of what constitute a just cause of war will deserve as much consideration as mr gt curti 's theory that hustle a deputy-marshal be levy it we can remember when the confirmation of a ambassador to england -lrb- where the eminent fitness of the nomination be universally concede -rrb- be oppose by several southern senator on the ground that he have express a interest in the success of west indium emancipation if original democrat have they way it will not be long before it be make constructive treason to have read that chapter of the act of the apostle which relate the misguided philanthropy of philip in endeavor to convert a ethiopian into anything but a chattel we be incline to think that a too amiable willingness to be kick have be generally consider just cause of war as between foreign government -- especially on the part of the stronger of the two history seem to show this -- and also that the sooner a nation get over its eccentric partiality for this kind of appeal to its reasoning faculty the more likely it be to avoid the risk of war at any rate the forbearance of the south have be such that in spite of the great temptation she have hitherto refrain from send she fleet and army northward and we be glad to find that mr cushing be incline to take a cheerful view of the permanency of we institution he tell we it be true in one place that the success of the republican party would be the _ de facto _ dissolution of the union but in a moment of calmer reflection he assure we that there be thirty million american who stand ready to devour and swallow up the handful of negrophilist union-hater we have great faith in the capacity of the american people yet we somewhat doubt whether any one of they could swallow up what he have already devour unless indeed he perform that feat which have hitherto be the opprobrium of jack-pudding and jump down he own throat afterwards however a man of mr cushing 's warmth of nature might well find himself carry beyond the region of ordinary rhetoric in contemplate so beautiful and affect a vision and it be enough that we have the consolation of know that he either speak with a disregard of the census which we can not believe possible in one so remarkable for accuracy of statement or that he acquit every man woman and child in the country of any hostility to the union it be cheer to have this matter set finally at rest by so eminent a authority and we be particularly glad that the necessity for so painful a experiment in swallow be a great way off for though a handful would not go far among so many yet if its component be as unpleasant as mr cushing represent they it would certainly give a colic to every patriot who get a bite after so generous a exculpation of the american people from any desire to pull they own house about they ear we be leave to conclude that the only real danger to be apprehend in case of a republican success be a _ de facto _ and _ de jure _ dissolution of that union between certain placeman and they place which have last so long that they have come to look on it as something constitutional when that day be likely to arrive we shall see such sample of consistency and such instance of stable conviction in find out on which side of they bread the butter lie as can not fail to gratify even mr cushing himself but we must not congratulate ourselves too soon in the interval between the fifth of July when he oration be deliver and the seventh of August which be the date of the craytonville letter mr cushing seem to have review he opinion on the state of the union there be more cause for alarm than appear on the surface but this time it be not because we have fall out of love with the south but that we have become desperately enamor of negro nurse will have to scare they refractory charge with another bugaboo for the majority of massachusett infant would jump at the chance of be carry off by the once terrible ugly black man we great danger be from _ negrophilism _ though mr cushing seem console by the fact that it be a danger to massachusett and not to south carolina we think mr cushing may calm he disinterested apprehension we believe the disease be not so deep-seated as he imagine and as we see no reason to fear the immediate catastrophe of the millennium from any excess of benevolence on the part of mr cushing and he party toward white man -lrb- whose cause he profess to espouse -rrb- we be incline to look forward with composure to any result that be likely to follow from sporadic case of sympathy with black one there be no reason for turn alarmist in spite of these highly-colored foreboding it will be a great while before we color fellow-citizen or fellow-denizen -lrb- or whatever the dred scott decision have turn they into -rrb- will leave mourning-card in beacon street or rear mulatto-hued house on that avenue which it be propose to build from the public garden into the sunset it be adroit in mr cushing thus to shift the front of he defense but it be dreadfully illogical it be very convenient to make it appear that this be a quarrel of race for in such a case a scruple of prejudice will go farther than a hundredweight of argument in assume to be the champion of the downtrodden whites against the domineering black mr cushing enlist on he side the sympathy and admiration which be sure to follow the advocate of the weak and the defenceless he come home to new england find he own color proscribe and at once take the part of _ amicus curiæ _ for the weak against the strong in the forum of humanity we do not wonder that a gentleman who have devote so much ingenuity so much time and talent to make black appear white should at last deaden the nicety of he sense for the distinction between the two and thus reverse the relation of the two color but we do wonder that in choose race as a convenient catchword he should not see that he be yield a dangerous vantage-ground to the native american party whose principle he seem so pointedly to condemn we say _ seem _ -- for he be carefully indefinite in he specification and hedge he opinion with a thicket of ambiguous phrase which render it hard to get at they and leave opportunity for future evasion if a war of race be justifiable in white against black why not in so-called anglo-saxon against kelt the one be as foolish and as wicked as the other and the only just method of solution be the honest old fair field and no favor under which every race and every individual man will assume the place destine to he in the order of providence we have a great distrust of ethnological assumption for there be as yet no sufficient basis of observe fact for legitimate induction and the blood in the theorist 's own vein be almost sure to press upon the brain and disturb accurate vision or he preconception to render it impossible gervinus read the whole history of europe in the two word _ teutonic _ and _ romanic _ wordsworth believe that only he family could see a mountain dr prichard lead astray by a mistaken philanthropy believe color to be a matter of climate and dr nott consider that the outline show by a single african hair on transverse section be reason enough for the oppression of a race if the black man be radically inferior to the white or radically different from he the folly of white-washing he will soon appear but on the other hand if he natural relation to the white man be that of slave to master we southern brethren have waste a great deal of time in prohibitory and obscurantist legislation they might as well have be pass act to prevent the moon from run away or to make the pleiade know they place it will be a bless day for the world when man be as willing to help each other as they be to assist providence the london cotton-plant a journal establish to sustain the interest of slavery in the old world be almost overpower with acute distress for the order of creation and offer its sustain shoulder to the system of the universe fear nothing it seem to say glorious structure of the divine architect gidding shall not touch you nor shall seward lay he sacrilegious hand on you who be ye murmur the voice that would reedit the work of the almighty sublime but misguided object of we compassion we prefer to remain in the modest seclusion of namelessness but we be publish at red-lion court fleet street and be sell for one shilling to judge from mr cushing 's letter he have study this organ of the sympathizer with the pre-established harmony -- certainly there be a singular coincidence in the sentiment of both so far as we can make they out both call themselves conservative both be anti-philanthropist both claim that public opinion be tend in the direction of they view both affirm that they cause be that of the white man and both appear to mean by white man the same thing -- the owner of a slave but be not mr cushing 's anxiety misdirect and wilfully so in seek the material for its foreboding of danger to the union in the free state the only avowed disunionist of the north be the radical abolitionist whose position be the logical result of they admit that under the constitution it be impossible to touch slavery where it exist and who therefore seek in a dissolution of the federal compact a escape from complicity with what they believe a evil and a wrong -- with what till within the last twenty year be concede to be such by the south itself if mr cushing be so great a admirer of stability in conviction he might have find in these man the subject of something other than vituperation there be man among they who might have win the foremost place of political advancement could they have sacrifice they principle to they ambition could they believe that public honor would heal as well as hide the wound of self-respect it be the south that advocate disunion from sectional motive and add the spice of treason the london cotton-plant say -- if she -lrb- the south -rrb- be deny ` equality ' within the union she can have ` independence ' out of it already in european cabinet the possibility of this contingency be contemplate we but perform a public duty when we tell mr dougla that _ there be in europe more than one power able and willing and prepared to take the cotton state of america and with they the other ` slave ' - state so-called by free-negroist under they protection as valuable and desirable ally _ and more _ he can say by authority that she -lrb- the south -rrb- have active and successful agent in every part of europe prepare the way for equal existence commercially as well as politically so long as the union exist or the active support of powerful ally if drive as a last resort to appeal to the civilized world against tyranny and oppression _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- but what do the cotton-plant understand by equality nothing less than the reopen of the slave-trade speaking of the chance that the capture slave of the echo would be send back to africa and resent such a procedure as a brand upon we section and upon we social condition it affirm that : this labor-question of the south do not depend upon such miserable clap-trap as kansa or the fugitive slave law it rest upon a full open and deliberate recognition of the rights of the southern people and the senator from illinois _ by move the abrogation of the so-called slave-trade treaty with england allow the south to supply herself with labor as she may see fit would give indeed unquestioned assurance of he disposition and courage to follow the principle of the white-basis to its logical and constitutional consequence _ it declare that the send home of the african would be a practical reversal of the dred scott decision and add -- we have no fear that we people _ will long remain passive under such a accumulate weight of inequality _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- be not this explicit enough and do not the white-basis sufficiently explain what be mean by the systematic depreciation of the color race in mr cushing 's letter the democratic party be the party of progress what be the direction of that progress likely to be what be the lesson of the past hitherto this party have be the ally and the tool not of the moderate but of the extreme propaganda of the south the carolinian with they scotch blood receive also a strong infusion of scotch logic they feel that they system be inconsistent with the immortal assertion of jefferson in the declaration of independence and with the principle of the revolution -- that its extension be a direct reversal of the creed and the policy of the man by whom we frame of government be establish they accept the alternative and assume the aggressive the principle of the revolution must be crush out the tradition of the father of the republic repudiate -- and that too by means of the party call itself democratic through which alone the south could control the policy of the government accordingly a reaction be put in motion and steadily press precisely similar in kind to that organize by loui napoleon against the principle of the french revolution and support by precisely the same warning of the danger of civil commotion and by appeal to the timidity of property and the cupidity of trade the party which have so long vaunted the derivation of its fundamental truth from the law of nature be compel to make it a part of its creed that there be nothing higher than a ordinance of man the party of state-rights be force to proclaim that a decision of the supreme court be sovereign over all the rights of the state the party whose lead dogma it be that all power proceed from and reside in the people that all government rest on the consent of the govern be drive into refuse to submit a constitution to the people whose destiny be to be decide by it and all this have be do not for the security of slavery where it exist but to serve the truculent purpose of its indefinite extension to acquiesce in the honesty and justice of such a course of policy as the last few year have show to assist in inaugurate a future that shall accord with it be nationality and conservatism no wonder mr cushing be charm with the consistency of he new ally do they propose to steal cuba -- they be the party who would extend the area of freedom do they make slavery a matter of federal concern by means of the supreme court -- they be the party who maintain that it be a affair of local law do they disfranchise a race -- they be the party of equal rights and the whole wretched imbroglio of creed which be the condemnation of they action and of action which be the death of they creed be dub nationality if sectionalism be the reverse of all this we confess that we prefer sectionalism it be a nationality which have no northern half a conservatism which abolish all we heroic tradition if the democratic party have be urge to such extreme measure and such motley self-stultification by the pressure of the south if every downward step have be only the more likely to be take because it seem impossible six month before what be we not to look for now that its leader be embolden by success and its lieutenant be eager for more plunder at the easy price of more perfidy already as we have see the reopen of the slave-trade be demand already fresh enactment be call for expressly to render it in future impossible for the people of a territory to loosen the grip of slavery as those of kansa have do and to prepare the way for this we be force to hear continual homily on the supremacy of law on what be call legal conscience and legal morality -- phrase which sound well but cover nothing more than the absurd fallacy that everything be legal which can by any hocus-pocus be get enact the doctrine that there be no higher law than the write statute be but one of the symptom of the steady drift of we lead politician toward materialism toward a faith which make the product of man 's industry of more value than man himself and find the god of this lower world in the law of demand and supply cotton be king say such reasoner as mr cushing -- conscience be king say such actor as the puritan to have a moral sense may be very unwise very visionary very unphilosophic but most man be foolish enough to have one and the enforce of any law which wound it be sure to arouse a resistance thoroughly pervade they whole be and last as life itself the carry away of a single fugitive -lrb- 3 -rrb- give the republican a tenure of power in massachusett as firm and likely to be as endure as that of the whig be once the propagandist of slavery overreach themselves when they compel the people of the north to be they accomplice the higher law be not a thing man argue about but act upon people who admit the right of property a thousand mile off go back to first principle when the property come to they door in the upright form of man and appeal for sympathy with a human voice mr cushing represent massachusett to be a babel of _ ism _ so many square mile of bedlam from boston corner to provincetown be this intend as a depreciation of we free institution by show the result to which they inevitably lead have a rarey for vicious hobby be a _ desideratum _ so long and have such a benefactor of he species find he avatar at last in mr cushing he tell we however that the delusion of _ negrophilism _ that be republicanism be on the wane and be destine to speedy extinction the very extravagancies he speak of as so rife and so rampant be to we evidence of the contrary they prove the depth to which the religious instinct of the northern people have be stir upon the question of slavery such extravagancy have accompany every great moral movement of mankind the reformation the great puritan rebellion the french revolution bring they forth in swarm a profound historical thinker gervinus remark that the political enthusiasm of a nation be slow to warm and swift to cool but that its moral enthusiasm be quickly stir and long in subside think man will ask themselves whether the _ ism _ mr cushing enumerate be not the external symptom of such a enthusiasm -- and whether it be wise under the name of nationality and conservatism to urge aggression to the point where it become the right and the duty of man to consider the terrible necessity of a change in they system of government whether it be unpatriotic to resist the extension of a system which make the mass of the population a element of danger and weakness in the body politic as its advocate admit by they scheme for a foreign protectorate of they propose independent organization -- a system which render public education impossible exhaust the soil necessitate sparseness of population and demoralize the govern class -lrb- 4 -rrb- the ethical aspect of slavery be not and can not be the subject of consideration with any party which propose to act under the constitution of the united state nor be they call upon to consider its ethnological aspect they concern with it be confine to the domain of politics and they be not call to the discussion of abstract principle but of practical measure the question even in its political aspect be one which go to the very foundation of we theory and we institution it be simply -- shall the course of the republic be so direct as to subserve the interest of aristocracy or of democracy shall we territory be occupy by lord and serf or by intelligent freeman -- by laborer who be own or by man who own themselves the republican party have no need of appeal to prejudice or passion in this case there be a meaning in the phrase manifest destiny america be to be the land of the worker the country where of all other the intelligent brain and skilled hand of the mechanic and the patient labor of those who till they own field be to stand they in greatest stead we be to inaugurate and carry on the new system which make man of more value than property which will one day put the living value of industry above the dead value of capital we republic be not bear under cancer to go backward perhaps we do not like the prospect perhaps we love the picturesque charm with which novelist and poet have invest the old feudal order of thing that be not the question this new world of ours be to be the world of great worker and small estate the freeman whose capital be they two hand must inevitably become hostile to a system clumsy and barbarous like that of slavery which only carry to its last result the pitiless logic of selfishness sure at last to subject the toil of the many to the irresponsible power of the few it may temporarily avail the party of slavery-extension to announce itself as the party of the white man of the sacredness of property and the obligation of law it may draw to they rank a few well-meaning person whose easy circumstance make they uneasy -- a few leader of defunct party with a general capacity for misdirection and nobody to misdirect but it will avail the republican party more to claim and to prove that it be the party of man no matter what he color or creed or race -- of the sacredness of that property which every human being have in himself -- and of the obligation of that law which outlive legislature and statute-book and be the only real security of all law the cry of conservatism may be efficacious for a season but time will make plainer and plainer the distinction between the false conservatism which for its own benefit would keep thing as they be which smooth imminent ruin delusively over as niagara be smoothest on the edge of the abyss and that true conservatism which work upon thing as they be to prepare they for what they must be -- recognize the necessity of change to forestall revolution with healthy development -- and believe that there be no real antagonism between old and new but only a factitious one the result of man 's obstinacy or self-seeking -lrb- footnote 1 : london cotton-plant 21st

have some important truth at the bottom of it the first of these doctrine have its real meaning it be true that there may be a common feeling of justice in the mind of ignorant people which shall override the decision of a learn chief justice it be true that a man may brutalize himself by a contemplation of theological cruelty until decent parent be ashamed to have they child listen to he libel on the father of all it be true that a physician may become such a drug-peddling routinist that sensible mother see through he and know enough to throw he trash out of the window as soon as he turn he back the second doctrine have its real meaning until man turn into beast they must have some argument address to they reason before they will believe and still more before they will act spiritualism have its significance as a appeal from the gross materialism and heathen idea of another life so commonly entertain mormonism have its logic as a appeal from the enforced celibacy of one

intelligence must be present so it be the business of the spirit to bridle force -- or matter 's motion -- mount the restless steed and ride to a purpose shall we ever see the bit of that bridle on the subject of material form we find the following passage which while perhaps the most original in the book be to we the least instructive : -- however multiply interior action may be the universe as a whole must have a _ common movement _ or none one division can not in relation to the rest stand still lag behind fly off or diverge from its place without destroy all unity the earth be full of motion but they do not interfere with she general and uniform motion so it be with the universal orb : its rotation be we believe fundamental -- the basis of all other movement without which there could be none other in everything there be virtue in form and we surmise that vastly more depend on the configuration and movement of matter as _ one mass _ than have be suspect as perfect a whole as any of its part must not the universe have a definable outline or shape -- one to which nothing amorphous can possibly belong what be its figure it can hardly be a cube cylinder or prism of any kind indeed we might as reasonably suppose it a three-sided figure as one bound at all by straight line no one extend in one direction more than in another could have meet the exigency of creation and that the universe be a sphere may also be infer from fluid matter naturally assume that form -- perhaps because its element have it have atom be bound by plane surface so we may suppose have world drop of water and soap-bubble the universe be spherical then because its molecule be : and it move because they be incapable of rest do this mean that the totality of matter be finite -- that it can be view spiritually from the outside -- even from such a distance as to appear infinitely small if so can there be infinite power either material or spiritual if the universe be spherical because its molecule be can the molecule compose any other than the spherical form do we gain much by reasoning from a assumption below the ken of the microscope to a conclusion above that of the telescope mr ewbank however do not often indulge in a logical stride so long or on such shaky footing as this through more or less cloudiness of expression he give we many striking and satisfactory view look towards a complete synthesis of the glorious system of thing to which we belong make out the universe as habitable and cheerful as it be wide and leave we admire its good more than marvel at its evil he maintain that all solar and planetary body have a central vital heat produce and maintain by the same cause -- to wit the gravitate or condense force its intensity be as the mass in the sun the mass be so great that in spite of its inferior density more and intenser heat be generate by condensation than in any or all of the planet if the whole orb be not incandescent there be such intense heat in its central portion as to generate gas which be throw up through its atmosphere to a height at least as great as the whole diameter of we globe condense there again with a ineffably brilliant combustion the solid crust of the sun he think may be comparatively cool -- as cool perhaps as we tropical climate -- by the favor of cloud-curtain which operate as screen and reflect off into space the heat of the combustion overhead he might have give more reason than he have for this conclusion whether we terrestrial aurora-boreali be cause by the combustion of gas that have be generate by internal heat or not we know that the combustion of gas in the upper region of we atmosphere would not warm the surface of the earth much more than it would that of the moon it be easy enough to make out from fact which we terrene science have reveal to we how the sun may be a perpetual fountain of light heat and force to its most distant planet without have itself any superabundance of either of these emanation for its own domestic consumption the solar population may have no more sunshine than we do and may have even that mitigate with the luxury of ice-cream if not with that of arctic exploration and polar bear whether they have as good opportunity as we for astronomical observation be a little doubtful but they thermological study must flourish abundantly to say nothing of they advantage in pyrotechnics _ a text-book of vegetable and animal physiology design for the use of school seminary and college in the united state _ by henry goadby md professor of vegetable and animal

london tell we of very exquisite anatomical preparation make by he while employ as minute dissector to that institution we be grateful to mr goadby for consecrate he narrow but sure immortality and he excellent mechanical talent to the service of the new world and especially of the state of michigan it do not follow from this that mr goadby have write a good book on animal and vegetable physiology nor that he could write such a book start with this proposition we be candid rather than sanguine as we open the volume we find that it be not in any true sense a treatise upon physiology but chiefly upon the minute anatomy of animal and vegetable with some incidental physiological commentary on closer examination we find it to be the work of a microscopist and not that of a physiologist or a scholar its merit be principally its illustration many of which be from original dissection some of which be very good diagram other ordinary and some -- such as the view of the human brain and spinal chord on page 282 -- wretch the color figure be wash with dull tint in a very shabby and negligent way the text be mainly a account of the object illustrate in the figure and will prove interesting to the work microscopist as explain the observation of a skilful dissector as a text-book of physiology for school and college it be of course without value english microscopist if we might judge by this work and that of mr hassall be not remarkable for scholarship the showy and in some respects valuable work of the latter gentleman be disgrace by constant repetition of gross blunder in spelling mr goadby be not much above he countryman in literary acquirement if we may judge by he treatment of the name of schwann and lieberkuhn whom he repeatedly call schawn and leiberkuhn and by the indignity which he offer to the itch-insect by name it _ aearus scabiæi _ it be not necessary to give further example but if the general statement be dispute we be prepare to speckle the book with correction until it look like a sign-board with a charge of small shot in it nothing that we have say must be consider as detract from mr goadby 's proper merit as a industrious and skilful specialist who be more able with he microscope than with he pen and more at home with the latter in tell we what he have see than in write a general treatise on so vast a subject as physiology _ lettre de silvio
