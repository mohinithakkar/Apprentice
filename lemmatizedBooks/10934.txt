till you be marry to blinksop that be all by dark she begin to look impatiently for teddy for she feel sure he would find jeffry somewhere it be nine o'clock however before he make he appearance do you find he she inquire eagerly i do mum sure and a hard pull i have of it i beat the whole town through and at last i find he a rollin ' bowly alley and i giv he you letther sich dreadful swear as he giv mum a walkin ' up and down a ' a crush he finger like and a bitin ' he tooth together and then he stop in front of I and say in a awful theatur voice ` tell she ' say he ` that i 'll come ' and he giv I a kick mum as boost I clear to the sidewalk and i see plainly as he have more remark of that same kind to deliver and i edge off at about five mile a hour goodnight to ye mum ann sleep calmly and sweetly that night for the one cherish idea of she innocent girlhood be about to be consummate and she smile in she sleep and think she see she mother jeffry maulboy keep he word he be there at noon of the next day and the minister that be to marry they and the lawyer that be to divorce they be there also at one o'clock they be man and wife swear to love honor and obey each other till death do they part at a quarter of two o'clock they be man and woman swear to love honor and obey anybody they want to for a divorce do they part and they go they separate way chapter seventh where be ann belinda return from the half-way house firmly determine to find out all about that affair of ann 's any woman would naturally feel curious about it and belinda really can not be blame for show a little feeling to think say she after all my bragging that i would be marry first and the time i have twit she of be too homely to get a beau that she should step out and get marry right under my very nose and i not know anything about it or even who she be married oh it be _ too _ much but i 'll find out if i die for it and if there _ be _ anything about it that be not straight will not i crow over she the hon michael be also very anxious to find out about it with the affectionate ardor of a grass widower of fifty-five in a state where divorce sprout like mushroom he be loath to believe that ann be utterly lose to he no he would find she he would follow she if necessary to the world 's end live only in this hope and when at last the goal be reach and she adored form greet he vision he would pour out he wealth of love bend he ear to catch the sweet response and then and only then would everything be lovely and so it come that he and belinda each with a different motive take counsel together in reference to the same end belinda 's first step be to send archibald to the half-way house for a full description of the man that call there for ann be smart for once in you life say she and find out _ something _ then she and the hon michael start off to find out what direction ann take after leave the half-way house they interview every carriage-driver depot-master and hotel-keeper for mile around but without the slightest success they finally come across a farmer however who say be drive a woman to the station below to they eager inquiry as to she appearance he could say nothing further than he think she wear a dress and be quite sure though not certain that she have on either a shawl or some other outside garment he remember she distinctly because the half-dollar she give he turn out to be counterfeit and he get rid of it by give it to a blind beggar after which he say he sneak round the corner and laugh till he be red in the face to think how slick that beggar be fool this might be ann they think but to make sure they telegraph to six different station promise a small reward in case they pursuit be successful in due time the answer come all very much alike and to the effect that a woman answer they description be see to take such and such a train and that the reward would reach they at the follow address etc at which they go home rather discourage to see what archibald have accomplish he say he go to the half-way house and question mr backup and teddy for four hour without find out the first thing you be a numskull say belinda if i have not get any more brain than you have i would swap myself off for a dog and then kill the dog i do not believe the folk there would tell anyhow say the hon michael she be probably hire 'em to keep mum now the fact be archibald have not be near the half-way house at all there be not money enough in the state to hire he to do so after the fearful ordeal he have there pass through so he hide in the wood all day and rehearse this terrible falsehood make himself miserable by repeat those extract from the catechism which refer to the future abode of liar though thus foiled in they active investigation they still hold long consultation on the absorb topic and in which to archibald 's horror he be often oblige to participate he have have it on he tongue 's end forty time to tell belinda all about he forced marriage with ann at the half-way house he have even dream on two separate night that he have do so but he wake up both time in a cold clammy sort of ooze and it have naturally shake he confidence and so the word stick in he throat and he remember ann 's horrible threat of come for he when she want he and he make it a point of do all he out-door business before dark and the bare mention of she name will make he start and glare wildly about he and still belinda court he more persistently than ever and it be a scene calculate to touch the most rugged nature to watch they together she smooth he hair and call he she tootsy-pootsy or reading poetry to he stop between each verse to cast languish glance at he and he bear it all with that haggard imbecile look peculiar to a over-courted man and as they wedding-day approach be it any wonder that poor archibald look forward to it as a condemn criminal to the scaffold and watch day by day the setting of the sun with the same air of grim despair once he try to run away but belinda in ambush flank he and lead he home then she send for he trunk and make he board there and so he be float along in a hopeless sort of daze a wretched victim of diabolical circumstance jeffry maulboy be visit he brother juda at terre haute he have sign article of agreement for the great prize fight with sandy mccormick know for he prowess in the ring as the nasty masher the fight will take place some time during the winter and jeffry will go into training early in September and the papers be full of biographical sketch of the two combatant together with comment on they weight general appearance and a list of fight heretofore participate in with vague speculation as to the number of eye fragment of ear & c each one be suppose to possess preserved in alcohol as trophy and when jeffry appear in public the mass regard he with respectful admiration and _ gamin _ applaud and when he get home he find a brigade of those literary

review of the french situation a review in fact for which i have long seek some such opportunity i have make considerable progress with my paper and be about to enter upon that branch of the subject devoted to discuss the bearing of such a victory upon the future prospects of france when a tap at my door be hear and the red head of my landlady 's first-born appear monsieur be want down stair say

get marry without a master in four easy lesson despond not ye bachelor -- anybody can get marry it be as easy as roll off from the roof of a six-story house and quite as beneficial to the system i have know people who do this little business without intend to accomplish it but they never crow over it and i have know other who have intentionally do it three or four time but everybody can not do this work as it should be do it be all very well for you to have a elegant creature of you own dress in a white robe and a blue ribbon but if you do not win she in the proper manner you feel degraded every time you gaze on she style be everything in this business for the benefit of the rise generation i have write this little treatise which will elucidate all the mystery of the marriage business and will make every man he own guide to wed bliss chapter i find the game the true sportsman in this field be very wary he cast he optics around he until he find the bird for which he think he have better go a vast amount of skill can properly be expend here if the hunter be young and rich he can go for almost anything if he be verge towards gray hair and false tooth he must not demand too much in the way of beauty or money if he have reach the well-preserved period he can have youth or beauty but not wealth no true sportsman ever go for brain because it be almost impossible to find they and when find they be very unsatisfactory if the bird be a orphan examine the book in the surrogate 's office until you find she father 's will if she papa be still alive and kick persuade she to take he bank-book into the back kitchen and there count the shekel never let you heart get into the mess for that complicate matter if you have a hankering for widow never run after one who have be in the business more than once they become so know after two or three trial besides there be a fatality about some woman -- they be bind to be widow furthermore widow have a way of appear to be load down with ducat when in reality they be pawn the late defunct 's unmentionable for the means of existence always select young game if possible as it be more likely to be tender than that which have be condemn to the wall at numberless party game with freckle or pimple or cross eye can never be first-class chapter ii ammunition too much care can not be exercise in the selection of this article you must take care that it be adapt to the game if the bird be a unbleached _ blonde _ try first-class prayer-meeting mild decoction of sunday-school exhibition parlor concert and reading if it wear spectacles some light airy and poetical reading matter like butler 's _ analogy _ or the _ tribune _ be useful if the bird be a _ brunette _ try theater ball opera etc supper at del ' have be know to do execution among this class never try lecture to young woman with this kind of bird the bleached _ blonde _ be difficult to handle if you suspect the bleaching try a judicious mixture of both kind of ammunition some kind of ammunition be adapt to all class ring especially diamond fan bouquet and jewel can be use in quantity only limit by the amount of you bank account or of you employer 's petty cash i have see a bracelet do the business at once though to be sure it be a very gorgeous one serenade may be use to advantage but care must be take in select the song and the window to a _ blonde _ you may very well sing thy eye so blue of violet hue to a _ brunette _ black-eyed mary or susan to a bleached _ blonde _ i be die egypt die never sing vulgar song which be use by hungry lover of cook such as wilt thou meat I to-night by the old garden gate or meat I by moonlight alone chapter iii bring down the game nowhere be more real skill require than here if you do not make a dead shot you might better have save you ammunition almost every wound bird escape always make sure of you aim and when you fire bring down the bird the proper course to pursue be this : carefully use you ammunition and when you think thing be favorable and you get a good sight make you shot you can always deliver it best on you knee be careful that there be no little sister or brother around when you go in for business for snicker be catch and the bird may fly before you have deliver you shot some shady nook be the proper place in which to do this part of the business unless the weather be cold in that case i have know game to be bring down by a sportsman in the hall where the house be heat by hot air parent bird sometimes interrupt the sportsman just as he imagine that he have a sure thing which certainly be very aggravating game properly bring down drop upon you left shoulder and you judiciously apply you lip to its bill after that a proper amount of hugging be advantageous and nice but be very careful not to keep the parent bird up too late chapter iv bag the game this should always be do in the very best style first-class church and two or three parson can generally bag you and the bird properly notice of the bagging should always be give to you friend and the bag should be large enough to hold not only the bird but also any first-class house greenback or silver-ware which may be furnish by the friend of the bird they say that brown of grace church understand all the detail of this kind of bag the game should be elegantly dress for the occasion at the expense of the parent bird of course you must take care that the bag be so tie that the bird can not escape though they do say that if you go to the neighborhood of chicago the bird will escape even if the bag be fasten in the most careful manner i advise you therefore not to emigrate in that direction by the aid of the foregoing lesson any man should be enable to catch a bird which in the course of a month he

of the cradle canto xv sing a song of sixpence a pocketfull of rye four and twenty blackbird baked in a pie when the pie be open the bird begin to sing be not that a dainty dish to set before the king the poet have now reach that stage of parental experience where he realize to its fullest extent what many another poor mortal have learn to he sorrow that a baby in the house be the greatest tyrant ever invent a baby may be a well-spring of joy a gleam of bright sunshine a angel from heaven a compound of unalloyed blissfulness or a mixture of snap and snail and puppy dog ' tail but it be nevertheless the tyrant of the household the king of the family the royal personage to whom all must bow and to whom everything must yield what father or mother be there who dare set he or she will up in opposition to the baby if baby want papa 's spectacles it must have they no matter if papa be read if it want mamma 's thimble it have it if baby want to go to sleep the whole family must move on tip-toe and not speak above a whisper if baby get the croup at night the whole family must be arouse papa must run two mile to the doctor 's grandmother must be route from she warm bed and bring post-haste to help take care of it everybody from the cook upward must stir about lively and be on the watch ready any moment to offer they devotional incense at the shrine of this potent baby monarch the wee ruler who be slightest wish have greater weight than the king 's command it be owe to this peculiarity of we humanity which always have be and always will be that the world have receive the remarkable line place at the head of this article since the poet 's time there have be attempt by other aspirant to immortality to continue the story so well begin and add a lengthy jingle to the already complete verse conceive in they futile mind the idea that it be a unfinished structure upon which they could build for themselves a temple of fame but all such dastardly attempt meet with the success they deserve and that be speedy oblivion and we contend and will maintain to the bitter end that these line be the only right and true line write on the subject by we immortal poet and that the other which be falsely circulate as part and parcel of the original be spurious emanate it be say from a half-insane idiot who hang himself immediately after finish they the inspiration to the above line come about in a very natural way the poet be poor that be speak after the manner of later day he be occasionally hard-up he occasion be very lengthy one and the interregnum a period remarkably brief it have become a sort of chronic state with he and although he occasionally write a bit of verse by request he modesty would not allow he to charge more than a sixpence or thereabout for any article and the consequence be that he understand to the fullest extent the meaning of the term hard time now it be a well-known fact that family especially where there be wife and baby do not take kindly to poverty and its concomitant but emphatically insist upon have something to eat drink and wear time have prove that even the weakest be wise in they own way and be give knowledge for self-protection and woman although she may not command success by main strength nor by force of will have learn that when other resource fail she have only to stoop to conquer : that she weakness be she strength she tear she weapon and she baby she shield so when the poet 's politic little wife find there be no money forthcoming and consequently no dinner she advise he to go hunting for bird as it be very necessary for grow child to have the little bone to pick not that she care for a pie make from bird herself but it be really necessary for the child just at this age off set the dupe husband in a spirit of self-sacrifice determine that no negligence of he shall prevent he child from grow properly and if bird be necessary to the process then bird it shall be a weary day be spend tramp among the wood and bush and towards night with two dozen of the feathered creature in he bag he turn he footstep homeward he be reward by a smile and a word of praise for he unusual good luck and with a pat on the shoulder and a promise of a splendid dinner in a hour or two he be set to work to pluck the bird time pass on the savory smell of the cooking bird occasionally salute he nostril and make he mouth water with anticipation when at last come the joyful summons and all seat themselves around the table and engage with unbounded admiration in this wonderful issue of the day 's labor the little lever which have move the mighty event to this result sit in he high chair a spoon in one hand a fork in the other and beat a grand tattoo ornament with numerous little shrill sound of baby joy in honor of the glorious sight the like of which he eye have never see before father and mother gaze enrapture upon the joyful sight of the crow youngster exchange intelligent and admiring glance at he precocity and inwardly congratulate themselves upon possess such a wonderful improvement on baby in general but the poet himself with he sensitive nature -- who can fathom the profound depths of he soul now stir by two such entrancing sight as the high-smoking blackbird-pie win by he own prowess and the little monarch for whose sake all this be bring about the delicious smell excite he like draught of rich old wine and all the soul within he bubble up exultingly and he improvise on the moment joyfully he sing in melodious tone he nerve tremble with ecstasy and he blood bubble through he

knife and fork pierce to the depth of the dainty dish and the delicate blackbird come forth but they do not sing that be poetic license perhaps on the whole it be just as well that they do not sing for it would only have delay the dinner and hungry folk be rather practical and would much prefer test the bird for themselves to hear from they the event of the day be over quiet have settle upon the earth and upon the poet 's household he lean back in he chair in peaceful revery and muse upon the scene of the day slowly like distant music come back to he mind the diamond of thought that drop from

not to say greeleyesque language to the reform nuisance who insist upon improve everything accord to they own fashion the nuisance however have this peculiarity that he never want to change anything that really need to be reform he will insist upon bully mr tilton into total abstinence from the mildest form of claret and water but he never think of urge mr greeley to a wholesome moderation in the use of objurgatory epithet he be clamorous in he demand that _ rip van winkle _ should be transform into a temperance lecture but he be entirely satisfy with the preposterous manner in which the clever but inartistic shakespeare have think fit to end he two meritorious tragedy _ hamlet _ and _ othello _ now no one at all familiar with either of these two popular play can fail to perceive the gross fault of construction which characterize they both to be sure if we accept the theory of hamlet 's insanity we can account for the preposterous idiocy of he conduct but from the greatest to the worst of we interpreter of hamlet -- from booth to fechter -- there be no modern actor who believe in the real insanity of the melancholy dane the fault of he folly therefore lie with the dramatist and not the actor what do hamlet do when he decide -- on the unsworn statement of a irresponsible ghost -- that he father have be murder by the ghost 's brother we all know that he devote himself to the duty of a private detective that he drive he sweetheart crazy by use very improper language to she and by coolly deny that he have ever have any serious intention toward she then he get up the worst specimen of private theatricals that even a royal drawing-room ever witness -- a performance so hopelessly stupid as to actually make the king and he consort seriously ill next he insult he mother and under the weak pretext of kill rat wantonly make a hole in she best tapestry and finally after have kill the young man who be to have be he brother-in-law he stab he own uncle and calmly watch the die agony of he mother who have succumb to a indiscreet indulgence in adulterated whiskey he death be the only redeeming incident in he career -- only he should have die in the first instead of the fifth act the real hamlet -- if there ever be such a person -- would have show the traditional thrift and enterprise of he race by a very different course of conduct after the interview with the ghost he would have have a private audience with the king and there would have ensue a scene somewhat like the follow one of course he would not have talk in blank verse the world have never properly condemn the outrageous cheek with which shakespeare have attempt to make we believe that blank verse be ever the ordinary speech of sensible man hamlet -- i have a little business to settle with you majesty king -- well out with it i have get a appointment with the german ambassador about that schleswig-holstein business at 2 o'clock and can only spare you ten minute hamlet -- i want to be appoint collector of the port of copenhagen with a salary of ten thousand dollar a month besides the fee also i want to marry ophelium and to be recognize as the heir apparent to you throne king -- well i rather like you cheek do you mistake I for a american president that you ask I to appoint one of my own relation to the fattest office in my gift why you impertinent young scoundrel hamlet -- draw it mild if you please the reason why i ask these favor of you be that if grant they will prevent I from talk in my sleep king -lrb- _ aside _ -rrb- -- he be get 'em at last i know he would if he keep company with politician -lrb- _ to hamlet _ -rrb- be you drunk or crazy not that it be of much consequence but still i should like to know the reason of this impudence hamlet -lrb- _ in a sepulchral whisper _ -rrb- -- uncle i have see a reliable gentleman who see my late father die now do not do anything rash you see i know all appoint I collector and i 'll agree to think no more about it refuse and i shall take the course that filial love and duty prompt king -- there be no need of any dispute between relative on such a little matter as this appointment i appreciate you business capacity swear to forget the nonsense you have hint at and you shall be collector be it a bargain hamlet -- it be here the play would naturally end and the audience would feel that both hamlet and the king have conduct themselves in a creditable manner by such a change as this _ hamlet _ become a rational and enjoyable play but will you ever find a reform nuisance who will offer to improve _ hamlet _ not a bit of it there be nothing which you nuisance be more reluctant to do than to engage in any really useful work othello be another idiotic person who spoil what would otherwise have be a respectable play by he stupid jealousy how much better would the drama have be have the fifth act proceed in this wise : -- othello -- desdy my dear be you in bed desdemona -- yes and i be sleepy too and do not want to be bother there be you night-shirt hanging on the chair othello -- iago tell I you have be flirt with lieutenant cassio now that will not do remember that under the fifteenth amendment i have the right be a color man of do pretty much as i choose if this flirtation be not stop promptly i 'll go to indiana divorce you and marry emilium do you know where the boot-jack be desdemona -- i never do flirt with he and iago tell a big story if he say i do the boot-jack must have be kick under the bed as for flirt after the way you have go on with emilium the less say about it the better if you can not find the boot-jack call the servant and let he pull you boot off -- you 'll catch you death if you go poke round under the bureau and sofa and thing much longer othello -- of course it be all right only do not have too much to say to he there be that confound boot-jack at last you see my dear that people will talk if you give they the slightest reason there be a button off this shirt be you all ready for I to put the gas out with the extinction of the gas the curtain would naturally fall and it would fall upon a pleasant well-constructed probable and eminently
