new venture in sandy beach it be not to be a barn that be one thing certain who ever see a barn with skylight on it peggy prescott in a pretty fluffy morning dress of pale green which set off she blonde beauty to perfection lay down she racket and leave the tennis-court join she brother roy at the picket fence the lad bronze and toughen by he trip to the nevada desert be lean upon the paling gaze down the dusty road about a quarter of a mile away be the object of he contemplation -- a big new structure paint a stare red it have no window but in front be great slide door on its flat roof the form of a dozen or more glazed skylight uprear themselves jauntily no it be a work-shop of some sort but what old man harding be interested in it that be one thing sure i hear too that while we be away case of machinery have arrive and be deliver there and that active work of some sort have be go forward ever since rejoin roy who be clothe in white tennis flannel with white shoe and a outing shirt set off by a dark-red necktie see roy cry peggy suddenly they be put up some sort of sign on it or else i be very much mistaken so they be i see man on some ladder and now look peg they be carry up a big board with something paint on it perhaps at last the mystery will be solve as they say in the dime novel can you read the printing on that sign inquire peggy not a word i can see the letter to know that they be print character but that be all tell you what peg just run and get those glass we use on the desert -- there be a good fellow -- and we 'll soon find out be not that just like a brother always send he long-suffering sister on he errand why you know you be die with curiosity yourself to know what be on that signboard parry roy and i suppose you be not pout peggy in mock indignation however i 'll get the field glass to oblige you -- just once as if you will not try to secure the first peek through they laugh roy as sunny peggy trip off across the lawn to a big shed in the rear of the prescott home where the aeroplane and they appurtenance be keep she soon be back with the field glass and as roy have prophesy raise they to she eye first have adjust the focus she scrutinize the sign carefully by this time the big board have be raise horizontally above the door and be be fix in position suddenly peggy give a little squeal of astonishment and lower the magnifier well what be it chaff roy a anarchist bomb factory or a establishment for raise goat or something that will butt in just as much on we peace and quiet or -- roy prescott enunciate peggy severely shake one pink-tipped finger under roy 's freckled nose this be not a subject for jest never more serious in my life si if you could have see you own face as you peek through those glass -- peggy stuff the binoculars into she brother 's brown hand here look for yourself she order she voice be so imperious that roy obey immediately a instant later he sister 's expression of dumfounded amazement be mirror on he own straightforward good-looking countenance well as bud use to say out west ` if that be not the beatingest ' he gasp what do you read demand peggy breathlessly repeat it so that i may be sure my eye do not play I a trick not likely si the letter be big enough they show up on that red paint barn of a place like a big freckle on a pretty girl 's chin then he repeat slowly mimic a boy recite a lesson : the mortlake aeroplane company well would not that jar you roy reprove peggy there be no other way to express it si protest the boy why that be the concern that be be advertise so much recently just to think it be right at we door and we never know it and that hateful old mr harding be interested in it too oh the exclamation and its intonation express peggy 's dislike of the gentleman mention it be a scheme oh he part to make trouble for we i 'll bet on it burst out roy but this time i guess it be no phantom airship but the real thing what time be that naval lieutenant come to look over the prescott aeroplane peggy some time to-day he mention no particular hour do you think it possible that he be also go to take in that outfit down the road it would not surprise I maybe that be why they be just put up the sign they evidently have refrain from do so till now in order to keep the nature of they business secret if we have not come back from nevada sooner than we expect we might not have know anything about it till the navy have investigate and -- approve far down the road beyond the big red building come a whirl of dust from it presently emerge a big maroon car peggy scrutinize it through the glass mr harding be in that auto she say rather quietly for peggy as the car come to a stop in front of the mortlake aeroplane manufacture company 's plant shortly before peggy and roy prescott they aunt miss sallie prescott with whom they make they home and they chum jess and jimsy bancroft have return from the nevada alkali waste the red building which engage they attention that morning have cause a good deal of speculation in the humdrum long island village of sandy beach in the first place coincident with the completion of the build a new element have be introduce into the little community by the arrival of several keen-eyed close-mouthed man who board at the local hotel and be understand to be employee at the new building but what the nature of they employment be to be even the keenest of the village cross examiner have fail to elicit before long within the freshly paint wooden wall still sticky with pigment there could be hear all day and sometimes far into the night the buzz and whir of machinery and other more mystic sound the village be on tenter-hook of curiosity but there be no side window to peer through and a watchman of ferocious aspect station at the door they inquisitiveness be perforce unsatisfied not even a sign appear on the building to indicate the nature of the industry carry on within and its employee continue to observe the stoniest of silence they herd together ignore all attempt to draw they into conversation what peggy and roy have observe that day have be the first outward sign of the inward business from the throbbing automobile which the boy and girl have observe draw up in front of the mortlake plant a man of advanced age alight whose yellow skin be stretch tightly like a drumhead over he bony face from the new building at the same time there emerge a short stout personage garb in overalls but the fine quality of he linen and a diamond pin which nestle in the silken fold of he capacious necktie show as clearly as do he self-assertive manner that the newcomer be by no mean a ordinary workman he face be pouchy and heavy although the whole appearance of the man be by no means ill-looking he cheek and chin be clean shave the close-cut beard show bluely under the coarse skin for the rest he hair be black and thick slightly streak with gray and heavy eyebrow as dark in hue as he hair overhang a pair of shrewd gray eye like small pent-house the man be eugene mortlake the brain of the mortlake company the individual who have just descend from the automobile throw a word to the chauffeur over he shoulder be a person we have meet before -- mr hard the banker and local magnate of sandy beach whose money it be that have finance the new aeroplane concern chapter ii mr harding declare himself reader of the first volume of this series the girl aviator and the phantom airship will recall mr harding they will also be likely to recollect he son fanning who make so much trouble for peggy prescott and she brother culminate in a daring attempt to bluff they out of enter a competition for a big aerial prize by construct a phantom aeroplane fanning 's part in the mystery of the steal jewel of mr bancroft the mother of jess and jimsy will likewise be probably hold in memory by those who peruse that volume the elder harding 's part in the attempt to coerce the young prescott into parting with they aerial secret consist in try to foreclose a mortgage he hold on the prescott home with the alternative of roy turn over to he the blue print and description of he device leave the lad by he dead father how the elder harding be route and how the girl aviator peggy prescott come into she own be all tell in this volume since that time mr harding 's revengeful nature have brood over what he choose to fancy be he wrong what the fruit of he moody and mean meditation be to be the mortlake plant which he have finance be in part the answer in the volume refer to it be also related how peter bell a old hermit have be discover by means of the prescott aeroplane and restore to he brother a wealthy mining magnate in the second volume of the girl aviator we see what come of the meeting between jame bell the westerner and the young fly folk by the agency of the aeroplane a mine -- otherwise inaccessible -- have be open up by mr bell in a remote part of the desert hill of nevada the aeroplane and peggy prescott play a important part in they adventure and peril notably so when in a neck-to-neck dash with a express train the aeroplane win out in a race to file the location papers of the mine at monument rock the rescue of a desert wanderer from a terrible death on the alkali and the route of a gang of rascally outlaw be also set forth in full in that book which be call the girl aviator on golden wing the present story commence soon after the return of the party from the far west when they be much surprised -- as have be say -- to observe the mushroom-like rise of the mortlake factory but of what the new plant be to mean to they and how intimately they be to be bring in contact with it none of they guess well mortlake observe mr harding in he harsh squeaky voice -- not unlike the complaint of a long unused door well mortlake we be get ahead i see the two man have by this time pass within the big slide door of the freshly-painted shed and now stand in a maze of machinery and strange look bit of apparatus from skylight in the roof -- there be no side window to gratify the inquisitive -- the sunlight stream down on three or four partially complete aircraft with they yellow wing of vulcanized cloth and they slender body like long tail they resemble so many dragon-fly or devil 's darn needle assemble in conclave upon the level floor at the farther end of the shed be a small blast furnace shooting upward a livid blue spout of flame which roar savagely actively engage at they various task at lathe and work-bench be a dozen or more overalled mechanic the most skillful in they line that could be gather here and there be the motor the driving power of the dragon fly the engine glisten with new paint and bright brass and copper part behind they be range big propeller of laminated or join wood in stripe of brown and yellow timber altogether the mortlake plant be as complete a one for the manufacture of aerial machine as could have be find in the country yes we be get along mr harding return mortlake and it be time too by the way lieut bradbury be due here at noon i want to have everything as far advance as possible in time for he visit you will not mind accompany I then while i oversee the workman follow by mr harding he make a active nervous tour of the work-bench drop a reproof here and a nod of commendation or advice there when he see a chance mr harding speak so the government really mean to give we a opportunity to show the worth of we machine he grate out rub he hand as if wash they in some sort of invisible soap yes so it seem at any rate they notify I that this officer would be here to-day to inspect the place it mean a great deal for we if the government consent to adopt we form of machine for the naval experiment to we to you you mean echo mr harding with a unpleasant laugh i have put enough capital into this thing now mortlake i be not the man to throw good money after bad if we be defeat by any other make of machine at the test i mean to sell the whole thing and at least realize what i have put into it mortlake turn a little pale under he swarthy skin he rub he blue chin nervously why you would not chuck we over now mr harding he say deprecatingly it be at you solicitation that the plant be put up here and i have rely on you for unlimited support why do you go into the manufacture of aerial machine if you do not mean to stick it out i have two reason be the rejoinder in tone as cold as a frigid blast of wind one be that i think it be certain we should capture the government contract and the other be -- well i have a little grudge i wish to satisfy but we will capture the government business i be not afraid there be no machine to touch the mortlake that i know of -- yes there be interrupted mr harding a machine that may be able to discount it in every way nonsense where be such a aeroplane within a quarter of a mile from here to be accurate young prescott 's -- you know whom i mean the other nodded abstractedly well that youth have a monoplane that have already cause I a lot of trouble the old man 's yellow skin darken with anger and he blue pinpoint of eye grow flinty it be partly out of revenge that i decide to start up a opposition business to he he be in the west till a few day ago and i never dream that he would return till i have secure the government contract but i be now inform -- oh i have ear everywhere in sandy beach -- that this boy and he sister who be in a kind of partnership with he have have the audacity to offer they machine for the government test also audacity mutter mortlake under he breath but harding 's keen ear catch the remark it be audacity agree the leathern-faced old financier and it be audacity that we must find some way to checkmate i have never have a business rival yet that i have not break into submission or crushed and a boy and a girl be not go to outwit I now they do it once i admit but this time i shall arrange thing differently you mean -- that i intend to cinch that government business but what if as you fear the prescott have a superior aeroplane my dear mortlake the pin-point eye almost close and the thin bloodless lip draw together in a tight line if they have a superior machine we must arrange so that nobody but ourselves be ever aware of the fact with a throaty gurgle that might or might not have be mean for a chuckle the old man glide through the door which by this time he have reach and slide rather than step into he machine give the chauffeur some order mortlake a peculiar expression on he face look after the car as it chug off and then turn and re-enter the shop he head be bent and he seem to be lose in deep thought chapter iii a naval visitor roy have depart on a errand for town peggy indolently enjoy the perfect drowsiness of noonday be recline in a gayly color hammock suspend between two regal maple tree on the lawn in she hand be a book on a taboret by she side be a big pink box full of chocolate the girl be not read however she blue eye be stare straight up through the delicate green tracery of the big maple at the sky above she watch with lazy fascination tiny white cloud drift slowly across the blue like tiny argosy of the heaven she mind be far away from sandy beach and its peaceful surroundings the young girl 's thought be of the desert the bleak arid waste of alkali which lay so far behind they now almost like event that have happen in another life suddenly she be arouse from she reverie by a voice -- a remarkably pleasant voice : i beg you pardon be this the prescott house good gracious a man exclaim peggy to herself get out of the hammock as gracefully as she could and with a rather flush face at the gate stand a rickety station hack which have approach on the soft dusty road almost noiselessly just step out of it be a sunburned young man very upright in carriage and dress in a light-gray suit with a jaunty straw hat he carry a bamboo cane which he switch somewhat nervously as the pretty girl advance toward he across the velvet-like lawn i be lieut bradbury of the navy say the newcomer and peggy note that he whole appearance be as pleasant and wholesome as he voice i come -- er in response to you letter to the department in regard to the forthcoming trial of aeroplane for the service oh yes exclaim peggy smother a inclination to giggle we -- i -- that be -- i presume that i have call at the right place say the young officer with a smile they tell I -- oh come in will not you suddenly request the embarrassed peggy the sun be fearfully hot will not you have a straw hat -- i mean a seat thank you reply lieut bradbury gravely sit in a garden bench at the foot of one of the big maple he eye fall on the book peggy have be read it be a treatise on aeronautics it be not possible that you be r prescott he ask glance up quickly oh no i be only a humble helper r prescott be in town he -- he will be back shortly indeed i have hope to see he personally i be anxious to inspect the prescott type of monoplane before visit another aeroplane plant in this neighborhood the -- the -- the officer draw out a small morocco cover notebook and refer to it the mortlake aeroplane company he conclude oh yes they be just down the road within a stone 's throw of here you can see the place from here that big barn-like structure volunteer peggy heartily wish that the mortlake plant have be a hundred mile away indeed that be very convenient i shall be able to make a early train back to new york do you suppose that mr prescott will be long i do not really know he should not be unless he be delay but in the meantime i can show you the aeroplane if you wish ah the officer glance at this girl curiously but you know what i particularly desire be a practical demonstration a flight yes if it be possible i think it can be arrange you have a aviator attach to you place then peggy laugh musically she have quite recover from she embarrassment now no i guess it be a aviatress -- if there be such a word you see i -- you oh yes i have fly quite a good deal recently i think it be the most delightful sport there be a sudden light seem to break over the young officer be you miss margaret prescott the girl aviator i have read so much about in the technical publication i believe i be smile peggy but here come my aunt miss sallie prescott as she speak miss prescott in a soft gown of cool white material emerge from the house peggy go through the ceremony of introduction after which they all direct they step to the large shed in which the prescott machine be keep in the meantime old sam hickey the gardener and he stalwart son jerusah have be summon to aid in drag out one of the aeroplane we only have two on hand explain peggy my brother have forward the other that we build to mr jame bell the mining man they be be use in aerial gold transportation across the nevada desert indeed that be most interesting sam hickey fling open the big door and reveal the interior of the shed with the two scarab-like monoplane stand within a strong smell of gasoline and machine-oil fill the air the officer glance at peggy 's dainty figure in astonishment it seem hard to associate this refined exquisite young girl with the rough actuality of machinery and aeroplane -lrb- illustration : when she emerge a very business-like peggy have take the place of the lounger in the hammock -rrb- but peggy with a word of excuse dive suddenly into a small room while she be go miss prescott entertain the young officer with many tale of she harrowing experience on the nevada desert to all of which he listen with keen attention at least he do so to all outward appearance but he eye be rivet on the door through which peggy have vanish when she emerge a very business-like peggy have take the place of the lounger in the hammock a linen duster fitting tightly cover she from top to toe a motoring bonnet of maroon silk imprison she hair and upon its rim above she forehead be perch a pair of goggles gauntlet encase she hand look rather too warm to be comfortable do not it she laugh but we shall find it cool enough up above perhaps the lieutenant -- venture miss prescott oh yes how stupid of I not to have think of it exclaim peggy mr bradbury you will find aviation tog inside there by jove she know enough not to call a naval officer ` lieutenant ' think the young officer as with a bow and a word of thanks he vanish to equip himself for he aerial excursion by the time he be invest in a similar long duster with weighted seam and have don a cap and goggles the larger of the two aeroplane name the _ golden butterfly _ be ready for its passenger old sam and he son who have drag it out -- it move easily on its landing wheel -- stand by they awe of the big craft show plainly on they face a section of the fence have be make removable so as to give the prescott aeroplane a free run from they stable to the smooth slope of the meadow beyond this be now remove and peggy follow by the young officer take she place in the chassis peggy make a pretty figure at the steer wheel the first improvement i should like to call you attention to she begin in the most business-like tone she could muster up be the self-starter it work by pneumatic power and do away with the old-fashioned method of start a aeroplane by twist the propeller the girl open a valve connect with a galvanized tank with a pressure gauge on top and pull back a lever instantly a hissing sound fill the air then with a dexterous movement peggy throw in the spark and turn on the gasoline which the spark would ignite thereby cause a explosion in the cylinder but first the compress air have start the motor turn over at the right moment peggy switch on the power and cut off the air instantly there be a roar from the exhaust and blue flame and smoke spout from the motor the aeroplane shake violently it would have make a inexperienced person 's tooth chatter but both the officer and peggy be sufficiently familiar with aeroplane for it not to bother they in the least magnificent cry the young officer enthusiastically as he see the ease with which the compress air attachment set the motor to work it will do away with assistant to start the machine he declare the next instant the importance of that in warfare can hardly be overestimate peggy be too busy to reply so far all have go splendidly if only she could carry out the whole test as well ready she ask fling back the word over she shoulder to lieutenant bradbury all ready come in a hearty voice from behind she peggy with a quick movement throw in the clutch that start the propeller to whir with a drone like that of a huge night-beetle or prehistoric thunder-lizard the machine leap forward as a race-horse jump under the raise barrier in a blur of blue smoke it skim through the gap in the paling out upon the smooth meadowland it shoot roaring and smoking terrifically and then all at once the jolting motion of the start cease it seem as if the occupant of the chassis be ride luxuriously over a road pave with the softest of eiderdown the sensation be delightful exhilarating peggy shut off the exhaust turn the explosion of the cylinder into a muffler in almost complete silence they wing upward up up toward the fleecy cloud she have be lazily watch but a short time before from the hammock the _ golden butterfly _ have never do better you be a darling breathe peggy confidentially to the motor that with steady pulse drive they upward and onward chapter iv in a storm dwarf to the merest midget the figure about the prescott house wave enthusiastically as the golden-winged monoplane make a graceful swoop high above the elm and maple surround it other figure could be glimpse too now run about excitedly outside the barn-like structure housing the mortlake aeroplane guess they think you be steal a march on they drawl lieut bradbury a wild reckless feeling bear of the thrilling sensation of aerial ride come over peggy she would do it -- she would with a scarcely perceptible thrust of she wrist she alter the angle of the rudder-like tail and instantly the obedient _ golden butterfly _ begin race through space toward the mortlake plant the naval officer quick to guess she plan laugh as happily as a mischievous boy what a lark he exclaim it be contrary to all discipline but it be jolly good fun peggy turn a small brass-capped valve -- the timer at once the aeroplane show accelerate speed it fairly cut through the air both the occupant be glad to lower they goggles to protect they eye from the sharp cut sensation of the atmosphere as they rush against it -- into its tooth as it be peggy glance at the indicator the black pointer on the white dial be creep up -- fifty sixty sixty-two -- she would show this officer what the prescott monoplane could do sixty-four great christmas the exclamation come from the officer he have lean forward and scan the indicator eagerly we 'll do better when we have we new type of motor install say peggy with a confident nod the young fellow gasp this be the twentieth century with a vengeance he murmur sink back in he rear seat which be as comfortably upholster as the luxurious tonneau of a five-thousand-dollar automobile like a dart pounce swallow seek its food in mid-air the _ golden butterfly _ swoop soar and dive in long graceful gradient above the mortlake plant once peggy bring the aeroplane so close to the ground in a long swinging sweep that it seem as if it could never recover enough way to rise again even the officer train in a strict school to repress he emotion tighten he lip and then open they to emit a relieved gasp so close to the gaping machinist and the anger-crimsoned mortlake do the triumphant aeroplane swoop that peggy to she secret amusement could trace the astonished look on the face of the employee and the chagrined expression that darken mortlake 's countenance i guess i have give they something to think over she say mischievously fling back a brilliant smile at the dazed young officer now she exclaim the next moment for a distance flight i be anxious to put the _ golden butterfly _ through all she pace oh by the way the balancer i have not show you how that work yet if peggy 's bright eye have not be veil by goggles the officer might have see a mischievous gleam flash into they like a wind ripple over the placid surface of a blue lake suddenly the aeroplane slant to one side as if it must turn over peggy have bank it on a sharp aerial curve the young officer in spite of himself in defiance of he training give a gasp i say -- but the word have hardly leave he lip before the aeroplane be back on a level keel once more at the same time a rasp slide sound be hear like to see how that be do ask peggy with a bewitching smile yes by jove i think we be over for a instant but how -- that we shall be glad to show you when the united state government have contract for a number of the prescott aeroplane retort peggy the young officer bit he lip confound it he think be this chit of a girl make fun of I young officer have a high idea of they own dignity mr bradbury color a bit with mortification but peggy quickly dispel he temporary chagrin you see she explain it would never do for we to reveal all we secret would it you agree with I do not you oh perfectly you be quite right still i confess that you have arouse all my inquisitiveness peggy be busy just then with a bit of machinery on the bulkhead separate the motor from the body of the chassis make no reply but presently when she look up she give a sharp exclamation the sky as if by magic have grow suddenly dark above the pulsating voice of the motor could be hear the rumble of thunder all at once a vivid flash of lightning leap across the horizon one of those sudden storm of summer have blow up from the sea and peggy know enough of long island weather to know that these disturbance be usually accompany by terrific wind -- squall and gust that no aeroplane yet build or think of could hope to cope with we be run into dirty weather it seem remark the officer i think i notice some thunderhead away off on the horizon when we first go up i wish you would mention they then say the straightforward peggy as it be we 'll have to descend till this blow over what will not even the wonderful equalizer render she safe no it will not it will do anything reasonable but you have no idea of the fury of the wind that come with these black squall indeed i have last summer i be off montauk point in the _ dixie _ something go wrong with the steering gear just as one of these self-same young hurricane come bustling up i tell you it be all hand and the cook for a while it hardly blow much harder in a typhoon peggy gaze below she over the darkening landscape anxiously there seem to be tree tree everywhere and not a bit of clear ground all at once as they clear some wood she spy a bit of meadowland the hay which have cover it earlier in the summer have be crop it afford a ideal landing-place but the wind be puffy now and peggy do not dare to attempt short descend spiral instead trust to the balancing device do its duty faithfully she swing down in long circle just as they touch the ground with a gentle shock much minimize thanks to the shock-absorber with which the _ golden butterfly _ be fit the storm burst in all its fury bolt after bolt of vivid lightning rip and tear across the darkened sky which hang like a pall behind the terrific electrical display the rain come down in torrent just in time laugh the young officer as he aid peggy in drag the aeroplane under the shelter of a open cart-shed it be quite snug and dry once they have it under the roof a short distance off stand a farm-house of fairly comfortable appearance smoke issue from one of its chimney show that it be occupy let 's go over there and see if we can dry we thing suggest peggy i be wet through same here be the laughing reply but a sailor do not mind that one actually get webbed foot in the navy -- like duck you know ignore this remarkable contribution to natural history peggy gather up she skirt daintily and flee across the meadow to the farm-house it be only a few hundred foot but the rain come down so hard that both she and she escort be wetter than ever by the time they arrive at the door it be shut and except for the lazy wisp of smoke issue from the chimney there be no sign of life about the place the lieutenant knock thunderously no answer try again say peggy maybe they be in some other part of the house perhaps they be scare of the aeroplane and have all retire into hide suggest mr bradbury he rap again louder this time but still no reply they must all be asleep he say apply himself once more to a thunderous assault on the door but to no avail a silence hang about the place break only by the roar and rattle of the thunder it be positively uncanny shudder peggy it be like red ride hood and the three little bear one would think that even a bear would open the door on such a occasion as this say she companion redouble he effort to attract attention finally he give the door handle a twist it yield and the door be speedily find to be unlock the officer shove it open and disclose a neat farm-house kitchen in a newly blacken stove which fairly shine be a blaze fire a old clock tick sturdily in one corner the floor be scrub as white as snow and on a shelf above the shine stove be a array of gleam copper pan that gladden peggy 's housewifely heart what a dear of a place she exclaim but where be the folk who own it have not the least idea say the officer gayly but that stove look invite to I let 's get over to it and get dry out a bit then we can commence to investigate but really you know we have not the least right in here suppose they mistake we for burglar and shoot we not much danger of that they would shoot I first anyhow because i be the most burglarious look of the two queer though where they all can be it be worse than queer -- it be weird good gracious exclaimed peggy as a sudden thought strike she suppose there should be trapdoor trapdoor she companion be plainly puzzle yes you know in most book when two folk run across a desert farm-house there be always a trapdoor or a ghost or something suppose -- good heaven what be that from without have come a most peculiar sound a whir like the noise one would suppose would be occasion by a gigantic locust then something -- a huge indefinite shadow -- darken the window of the farm-house kitchen peggy give a shrill squeal of alarm while lieut bradbury gallantly run to the door and fling it open chapter v peggy a heroine it be -- it be another aeroplane cry the officer with a shout of amazement what peggy spring to she foot a large red one yes come here and look they be just run it under the same shed as ours -- yours i mean the girl aviator spring toward the door through the rain she peer to where across the meadow two dim figure clothe in oilskin could be see shove a big aeroplane under the same shelter that already protect the _ golden butterfly _ well if this be not the ultimate she gasp i beg you pardon ask the young man at she side the ultimate that be my way of express what the boy call ` the limit ' why that be jess and jimsy bancroft in they new aeroplane -- the one roy build for they well do you ever oh jess oh jimsy peggy raise she voice and shout in response they see the oil-skinned figure turn and through the drive downpour come a answering shout presently across the drip meadow the two figure begin advance all this time the lightning be rip in a manner to make peggy shield she eye occasionally the thunder too be terrific and the earth seem to vibrate to its rolling detonation well peggy gasp jess she dark eye peer from under she waterproof hood as she and she brother arrive at the threshold of the farm-house what on earth do this mean yes give a account of yourself at once demand jimsy roy have we on the phone ask if you would fly in we direction we say no but we would take a flight and look for you in we enthusiasm we do not notice the storm come up but luckily be young person of forethought we have oilskin in a locker of the machine and -- and here we be finish jess shoot a killing glance from under she hood at the good-looking young man at peggy 's side be not you go to ask we in demand jimsy the next minute for hospitality i do not think you rate very high we -- well you see we be here ourselves without know if we have any right to be rejoin peggy but come in and i 'll explain first of all i want you to meet mr bradbury of the united state navy he come to test the prescott aeroplane mr bradbury this be miss bancroft and she brother -- jimsy put in that irrepressible youth glad to meet you sir almost as much at sea here as in mid-atlantic laugh they all enter the farm-house kitchen while peggy hastily explain the state of affair there well so long as they do not put in a appearance before we get dry i be sure i do not care say jimsy airily what a delightful old kitchen it might have come out of a picture book he and the naval officer be soon deep in conversation leave peggy and jess alone my dear peggy exclaimed jess with a smile that show all she white even tooth what will you do next do not you think it be a bit -- er -- er -- unconventional for one of the foremost member of sandy beach 's younger set to be fly about the country with a good-looking young naval officer nonsense retort peggy sharply as the only representative of the prescott aeroplane on the ground i have to do it if it have not be for this old storm i would have be home long ago so should we what a coincidence we should have meet here be this -- this -- lieutenant prompt peggy be this lieutenant go to stay long in sandy beach dear I no he be only on a fly visit -- no pun intend he be to have take in the establishment of the mortlake aeroplane company this afternoon you know they be in that red barn-like place

air-buggy around here miss they would not be in we way come in a hearty gruff tone from the door they look up to see a big farmer-like look person with a fringe of black whisker run under he chin in a half-moon standing there this be my husband isaac galloway say the woman introduce the owner of the farm at you service gent and lady say the farmer what that young woman do fer we ter-day ther ' be not no way of repay but anything ike galloway kin do any time ye kin count on he fer he move toward a object they have not previously notice a iron door in the wall turn a knob this way and that he presently fling it open reveal the inside of a wall safe thrust he hand inside he draw out a bundle of bill then close the door again and adjust the combination he say : je ' goin ' ter give ther boy a bit of thank you fer helpin ' I put out ther fire if any of you folk would like -- oh no no thank you laugh peggy sit up and feeling except for a slight dizziness almost herself again very well no harm mean say the farmer as he shuffle out of the room and into the kitchen where he distribute he largess quite a idea comment jimsy regard the wall safe i suppose you have quite a lot of money on hand at time and it be safest to keep it so he add address the farmer 's wife yep be the rejoinder ike get he money fer he corn crop ther other day -- two thousand dollar what with ther corn and ther early apple it be all in thar except what he be je ' take out be not you afraid of burglar come and blow the door of the safe off ask peggy land sake no we would hear 'em besides that be a patent safe a ' if it be open without a knowledge of the combination it would take a plaguey long time to do just then the farmer come back and after some more general conversation the whir of a approach automobile announce the arrival of roy the lad be naturally much interested in the doings of the afternoon as excitedly relate to he by everybody at once and be favorably impressed with the young naval officer of course he do not ask he he opinion of the prescott aeroplane but from remark lieut bradbury drop roy gather that he be much pleased with its performance soon afterward jess and jimsy shot skyward in the now still air in they red aeroplane -- the _ red dragon fly _ as it have be christen and amid warm farewell from the farmer and he wife the auto buzz off they have traverse a mile or more when on round a corner at a narrow part of the road they come almost head-on against another machine come in the opposite direction both car be compel to slow down so that the occupant have a good view of each other both roy and peggy be considerably astonish to see that the oncoming auto be occupy by old mr harding and that by he side be seat none other than the blue-chinned man know as eugene mortlake where can they be go wonder roy as old man harding favor they with a scowl in pass and then both car resume they normal speed i notice that this be a private road lead only to that farm rejoin peggy the right-of-way end there then that must be they destination for there be no other house on this road look that way assent roy queer be not it very respond peggy for some inexplicable reason as the girl speak a chill run through she she feel a dull sense of foreboding but the next minute she shake it off after all why should not mr harding and mortlake be drive to the farm mr harding 's financial dealings comprise mortgage in every part of the island it be quite probable that the farmer be in some way involve in the old man 's net possibly that be the reason of all that money be store in the wall safe refusing courteously a invitation extend by miss prescott to spend the night at the homestead lieut bradbury be drive to the station by roy after they have drop peggy and just manage to make a new york train i shall be back to-morrow he say and have a look at mortlake 's machine of course the government want to give everybody a fair field and no favor oh of course assent roy ponder in he own mind what sort of a machine this mysterious mortlake craft be suddenly there flash across he mind a thought that have not occur to he hitherto the _ golden butterfly _ have be leave under the shed at the farm what be there to prevent harding and mortlake from examine it and acquaint themselves with the intricacy of the self-starting mechanism and the automatic balancing device there be no question that the farm must have be they destination roy blame himself bitterly for not foresee this he have half a mind to return to the farm and bring the aeroplane home himself but it be grow dark and a distant rumble seem to presage the return of the afternoon 's storm anyhow the boy thought and the thought console he all those device be cover by patent and even if they want to they could not steal they and yet -- and yet -- but the storm come up sharper than ever that evening and even have he wish to roy would have find it impossible to handle the aeroplane alone in the heavy wind that come now in puff and now in a steady gale so roy put he tiresome thought out of he head but he resolve to get the aeroplane the first thing the follow morning chapter vii a case for the authority it be just after breakfast the next morning that a big automobile skim past the prescott home peggy and roy see it from the window why that be sheriff lawley exclaim peggy and look old mr harding be with he and that mortlake man that be right wonder where they can be go say roy saunter out to the garage at the back of the house and give the matter little more think it have be arrange that he be to bring the aeroplane back that morning drive over with peggy jimsy and jess in the car and skim home in the _ butterfly _ while a part of the party bring the car back they be to call for jess and jimsy at they home a fine residence overlook the sound from a lofty hill jess and jimsy be wait for they and almost before the car have stop they be at its side hear the news ask jimsy breathlessly no what be it demand peggy eagerly why that safe at the farm-house be rob last night all the money be take and they have no clue to the thief how do you hear of it ask roy incredulously peggy have tell he of the queer wall safe the ` central ' tell one of the servant and she tell jess strange be not it it be odd agree roy but if people will keep they money in such place it be hardly surprising if they lose it do you hear any detail no but no doubt we shall when we reach the farm-house put in jess be not it thrilling though not very thrilling for poor galloway who lose the money say peggy i expect he do not make it any too easily on they arrival at the galloway farm-house the young people find a scene of great excitement the sheriff red-faced and important be examine several farm hand beneath one of the big elm while in the background stand the farmer and he wife look somewhat perplexed as well as worry as the prescott auto drive up old mr harding in he usual rusty black suit rise from he seat under the elm and whisper something to the sheriff the blue-chinned thick-necked mortlake arise also all three turn and gaze curiously at the young occupant of the car as it slow down good morning mr and mr galloway cry peggy we be dreadfully sorry to hear of you loss have you any clue yet there be something curiously cold in the woman 's voice as she reply in the negative she husband look sullen and merely nod the sheriff now rise and come toward the machine he know all the young folk and greet they briefly at he heel press old harding and he companion they whisper in the sheriff 's ear as he advance and seem to be urge he to something i understand that you folk be in this house yesterday afternoon begin the sheriff abruptly why yes during the storm say peggy there be lieut bradbury of the united state navy -- harding and mortlake exchange annoyed glance this be confirmation of they fear yes go on urge the sheriff and myself and mr bancroft here and he sister and later my brother come do you recall the safe be open while you be in the room i presume from the remark you make when you drive up that you know of the robbery we hear of it at the bancroft 's but we do not know the detail that be not necessary answer my question please who be in the parlor beside yourself when mr galloway open the wall safe to reward the man who have help he extinguish the fire why jimsy -- i mean mr bancroft -- he sister and lieut bradbury beside of course mr and mr galloway what you brother be not there certainly not he do not come till later then you brother do not see the safe open of course not strike in roy i be here only a very brief time but what do all this mean i do not understand it mean that you be clear of a grave suspicion say the sheriff mr harding and mr galloway 's brother mr mortlake here -- she brother exclaim peggy in a undertone the sheriff go on : seem to have a idea that roy prescott be here at the time they even go so far as to intimate that -- but old mr harding be tug frantically at the sheriff 's arm he be second by mortlake interpret the signal aright he stop short in fact it look suspicious he conclude lamely he turn and go off follow by harding and mortlake how do you ever come to make such a mistake snarl old harding as they walk away much crestfallen we have not a leg to stand on now why confound it all retort mortlake my sister mention a young man be with the girl in the aeroplane and i take it for grant that it be she brother and a nice mess you have get we both into with you ` take it for grant ' snort the old miserly financier of sandy beach it look as if we would get ourselves in a trap now nonsense who be to know we have the money i 'll take the first opportunity to send it back and no more will be hear of the matter lucky i do not hide it in he aeroplane as i intend to do yes but we have still get the cub as we rival i wish i could think of some plan to choke he off that scheme of yours to blame the robbery on he would have be all right if you would only make sure of you fact first do not worry we chance will come yet i 'll make that whole outfit regret bitterly that they ever steal a march on we by kidnapping that officer to have discredit he with the navy would have be the best way however say old harding brusquely i 'll find a way to do that yet mortlake promise in the meantime speculation and wonder have rule among the occupant of roy 's auto everything seem very much muddle but one fact stand out clearly and that be that a attempt have be make to cast suspicion if not the actual guilt of the robbery upon roy for what object i have it cry peggy suddenly if they could have place roy under a cloud of suspicion it would have work to he discredit with the naval authority and might have result in we aeroplane be deny a place in the trial that seem plain enough they all agree that it do but jimsy say suddenly : if that be the case why do not they try to make out that i steal it because -- forgive I jimsy -- you be not roy without he the test of the prescott aeroplane could hardly be conduct unless -- unless a certain young person name peggy prescott undertake to take charge of they cry jess loyally do not be foolish jess warn peggy but look here be mrs galloway come to speak to we the farmer 's wife approach the automobile from which none of the party have as yet alight she be follow by she husband both begin apologize profusely for the question of the sheriff but land 's sake alive exclaim the farmer 's wife i declar ter goodness we have bin so flustered thet i don ' know no more than a wet hen my brother that be mr mortlake be dead sot on it bein ' one of you folk but i know that be reediculous they hardly know whether to be angry or to laugh at the woman 's blunt frankness but roy strike in with a question : be not mr mortlake accompany by hard out here last night why yes say the woman with perfect candor they stay quite a while harding hed some business with ike a ' -- a ' gene mortlake say he would like ter hev a look at yer aeroplane yer know he be in thet thar business hisself volunteer ike confidentially peggy feel as if she could have groan aloud roy 's fear earlier confide to she seem to have be base on a true presentiment the blue-jowled mortlake have undoubtedly improve he opportunity to study the _ golden butterfly _ at close range the farmer 's next word confirm she reckon he be powerful interested too the farmer go on fer he make a lot uv ther nicest drooring you ever see a ' -- why what be the trouble for roy hardly know what he intend to do have jump from the machine and be sprint toward the harding car but as he near it the old financier who with mortlake be already seat in the tonneau speak a word in the chauffeur 's ear and the machine dash off leave roy enraged and nonplussed too bad roy breathe peggy as rather crestfallen the lad return oh i do not know si even if they have not sneak off like that and i would catch the machine i guess i would have be like the dog that chase the train i would not have know what to do with it when i get it but roy they flight confirm they guilt i know si but what possible way have we to prove it the rascal have cover up they track cleverly a sudden thought strike peggy and she turn to the farmer do any of those bill have a identify mark on it she ask the farmer shake he head but mr galloway have a better memory why yes ike she exclaim that twenty-dollar-bill you get frum si giddens fer ther baldwins i re ` klect thet it hed a big round o in red ink mark on ther back uv it it be a bit rub out a ' hard ter see but ef you know it wuz thar a ' luked fer it you could see it plain enough after inquire about the baby whose thankful mother declare it to be as well as ever roy and jimsy drag out the _ golden butterfly _ and board it it have be arrange that the two girl be to spin back to town in the car the aeroplane follow they as closely as possible from above as they chug out of the farm-yard gate and on to the rough road peggy 's thought keep time to the rhythmic pulsation of the motor : a-twenty-dollar-bill-with-a-red-round-o a-twenty-dollar-bill-with-a-red-round-o chapter viii mr mortlake lose some drawing dash along the rough country road with every sense on the alert peggy find mental occupation enough to drive gloomier thought from she mind the prescott 's car be a good one with a powerful sixty-horse motor and splendidly upholster it be paint a dark blue and be know in the surrounding country as the blue bird it have be purchase with the money make by the brother and sister from they share in jame bell 's desert mine far above they sail the aeroplane its two occupant from time to time wave at they pretty sister below but in the upper-air current it would have be dangerous to drive at a pace slow enough to keep level with the automobile and so the aeroplane soon dash on ahead from time to time however it make circle and swoop which bring it sometimes in seemingly dangerous closeness to the tree-top all at once peggy stop the automobile with a jerk which almost throw jess who be unprepared for the shock out of the car good gracious peggy what be you try to do she gasp look cry peggy point with wide eye in the center of the road lay a rolled-up bundle of papers secure with a rubber band somebody have drop something from another auto or a wagon cry jess i think so say peggy in excited tone as she descend from the car and i have a idea that these papers have be drop from mr harding 's car it must have be the only one to pass here recently as this road run direct to the farm and nowhere else she stoop down in the road and pick up the bundle and then with a beating heart she open it but for a inward intuition of what its contents would prove to be peggy with she rigid idea of honor could not have bring herself to do this as she eye fall on the first sheet and she see that it be cover with annotation and sketch she give a little cry oh jess the luck the wonderful wonderful luck why what be it a bundle of thousand-dollar bill or -- it be not that or anything cry peggy it be -- oh jess -- it be the sketch and plan of we aeroplane that mortlake and he accomplice harding be spirit away they must have drop they from they automobile say jess or more likely from the pocket of one of they see the ground be trample about here it look to I as if they have have a break-down and be fix it when the papers fall out and be leave behind unnoticed oh what a bit of luck if they have have those papers it would have mean -- a shrill cry from jess interrupt she at the same moment peggy become conscious of a presence behind she she wheel sharply and find herself face two bloated-faced individual one of whom carry a heavy cudgel they clothes and broken boot and they leering odious appearance at once proclaim they of the genus tramp waal growl one of the man with a ugly leer we do not hardly expec ' ter run inter such luck ez this foun ' suthin ' vallerable hev yer reckin ' it must hev bin drop by that auto that je ' go round the corner beyond we 'll hev ter trouble you for it miss he hold out a filthy hand while peggy with a beating heart fall back toward the car frum what we hearn ' yer sayin ' i guess the papers be vallerable all right chime in the first speaker 's companion come on now fork over you know it be not honest ter take wot do not berlong ter ye a ' by yer own confession they papers do not what right have you to demand they ask peggy boldly enough despite she inward terror you have better go on at once or -- waal or what sneer the other we have get ye here on a lonely road you can not escape we come on hand over they papers we 'll see that ther rightful owner git 'em and that we git er reward beside see peggy 's reply be to leap nimbly into the machine but to she horror the two tramp follow instantly jess cower back in she seat she pale lip move but she say nothing tell yer wot burst out the man with the club you gal give we ten bone a piece -- the money do not mean much to folk like you -- a ' we 'll let yer go if not -- a sudden inspiration come to peggy -- a flash of recollection why do not you say that before she say cheerfully i 'll be glad to give you the money wait a minute while i get it out she raise the cushion of the front bucket seat and dive beneath it with one hand the man watch she with greedy yet suspicious eye be not tryin ' ter fool we be yer growl one of they ` cos ef you air -- he raise he club threateningly just as peggy 's hand withdraw from beneath the cushion something bright flash in it look out mike she be get a gun shout one of the man fall back the other whip a hand amidst he rag and be just about to aim a pistol when : phiz-z-z-z-z-z-z-z from the shiny object peggy hold in she hand a fine stream of some sort of liquid jet forcibly the fellow with the gun throw he hand up to he face and drop the pistol stagger back with a howl of agony the other dart off without even look at he the air be fill with a pungent scent of ammonia and a quiet smile of triumph curl peggy 's red lip as she start the car in motion once more oh peggy how brave you be gasp jess whatever be that you use i hope the poor man be not badly hurt although he be so horrid i just remember in time jess dear say peggy as she speed the car along that we have under the seat a ammonia pistol for use on vicious dog i use it on another sort of a dog that be all and it prove equally effective just at this moment peggy turn out to avoid another car that be approach they from the opposite direction in a second she see that it carry harding and mortlake they both look angry and blank peggy guess at once that they have discover they loss but she resolve not to stop unless they do and ask question she feel that such a despicable act as they have attempt to perpetrate deserve no help on she part hey there shout old mr harding as he car be slow down by the chauffeur hey stop i want to speak to you he be polite about it be not he whisper jess be you go to tell he peggy cer-tain-ly not rejoin peggy with a tightening of she lip why should i he try to fasten a theft on my brother this morning and then cap the climax by instigate mortlake to try to steal the idea of we aeroplane hey girl see a package on the road bawl old mr harding as peggy slow up and stop i recover some of my own property if that be what you mean say peggy slowly a dull flush rise to she cheek well -- well what d'ye mean by that hey what d'ye mean by that you may construe it any way you wish to mr harding be the cold rejoinder and to avoid further question peggy speed up she machine and soon vanish in a cloud of dust the old financier turn to he companion with a look of disgusted amazement what d'ye think of that hey mortlake he snap out what d'ye think of that fine young girl eh nice product of the twentieth century hey oh let 's get on and see if we can not find that roll of papers somewhere along here rejoin mortlake impatiently i do not think it be likely they could have see it it must have fall from my pocket where the car break down and i get out hey oh yes yes that be it drive on tom drive we to where the car break down in a few seconds they reach the spot just in time to see the two tramp who have molest the girl make off there they go shout mortlake those fellow must have find they i would not lose those sketch for a thousand dollar put on more speed tom and overtake they the chauffeur do as he be bid and the car leap ahead in a few chug it have reach the tramp ' side they have stop bewilder in the meantime why blow I bill say one to the other as the car come up if it be not the self-same gent as drive down the road a while ago give I those papers you rascal shout mortlake almost fling himself out of the car give they to I or -- hold you horse guv ` ner hold you hoss counsel the hobo who have receive the dose of ammonia and whose eye be still red from its effect wot papers might you be lookin ' fer ask this fellow cautiously although he know very well a bundle of papers i drop pant mortlake do not you find they naw grunt the red-eyed tramp naw echo the other be careful what you say if you be lie it will go hard with you the warning come from old mr harding we know that guv ` ner but we be not get 'em search we if yer like the knight of the road spread they arm to signify they willingness to be search mortlake groan it be evident that neither of the tatterdermalion have the papers but what have become of they in he distress and chagrin mortlake give a audible groan this the tramp seem to construe as a favorable sign one wink to the other and the red-eyed one speak wot it worth if we tell yer where they papers be guv ` ner both what you know cry mortlake while old mr harding splutter : eh eh hey what be all this what be all this i do not say we know be the cunning reply i say what be it worth if we do know mortlake draw out a yellow-backed bill be this enough he ask the tramp ' eye round as they gaze at the figure perfec ` ly satisfactory guv ` ner say red eye well where be those papers then snap mortlake impatiently thet thar purty gal wot jest go by in a autermobubble have 'em what yes we see she pick they up out of the road we try to convince she it be dishonest to keep 'em but she would not listen to we you have do well and seem to be bright fellow say mortlake handing over the bill to red eye who seem to be the leader of the two by the way you do not belong about here do you oh no guv ` ner we home be whar we hang we hat my permanent address be care of the ` dicky bird ' well i may have some work for you to do -- work guv ` ner work 's only for the workman i know all that but this work be on you own line i 'll pay well too if you want to talk it over come to the mortlake aeroplane factory outside sandy beach at ten o'clock to-night i 'll be there to meet you all right guv ` ner we 'll be thar till then we 'll bid yer ` oliver oil ' as ther french say come on joey the worthy pair shuffle off up the road while mortlake turn to hard with a shrug there be two tool make to we hand we may find they very useful i agree with you be the dry and rasping reply at least they have put we in possession of one valuable bit of knowledge hey chapter ix the flight of the silver cobweb a week roll slowly by a week of suspense during which they have one or two call from lieut bradbury who have be busy down at the mortlake plant but the officer be naturally noncommittal concern he opinion of the comparative merit of the two type of aeroplane equally naturally of course the young prescott have not question he concern they but during this week they have have a glimpse of the mortlake machine in flight one still breathless morning the air have be fill soon after dawn with a vibrant buzz sound which peggy 's trained ear have recognize as the song of a aeroplane engine she hasten to she brother 's room and rap upon the door in reply to he sleepy query the girl rapidly tell he of what she have hear roy 's window face on the road and a glance satisfy he that the mortlake machine be to have its first try-out hastily as he dress however he find that peggy be before he on the dewy lawn field glass in hand down the road could be see in front of the mortlake plant a small crowd of mechanic with one or two dominant figure move among they with the glass they have no difficulty in make out mortlake 's heavy-shouldered figure and the slender upright form of lieut bradbury all at once the group open up a bit and they see a silvery glittering aeroplane agleam with new aluminum paint throbbing and vibrate as if anxious to be off blue smoke eddy up as the motor roar and whir the air seem to vibrate under the sound as if a battery of gatle gun have be discharge fascinate brother and sister watch the spectacle intently they see mortlake clamber heavily into the machine follow by lieut bradbury a mechanic start for the front of the plane and begin swing the propeller at least they have not crib we self-starting device exclaim peggy as she see the next instant the propeller become a whir blur and the aeroplane after a brief preliminary run begin to climb upward the morning sun catch its silvered plane and turn they to gold it be a beautiful and inspiring sight even with all that lay at stake peggy and roy could not deny the machine a meed of praise it be fairy-like in its delicacy of construction and speedy as a flash thunder like a express train it dash above the prescott home leave in its wake the pungent odor of burn castor-oil -- the most suitable lubricant for aeroplane then suddenly -- as if a recollection of peggy 's mischievous flight of a few day previously have occur to he -- mortlake swing the delicate silvery machine about and dash straight down at the boy and girl standing by the garden gate so close to they head do he skim in he desire to show off that he almost come too low for one instant it look as if the machine would be dash to a premature end but it recover buoyancy like a keeled-over racing yacht and tear upward into the sky at a increase speed let 's get out the _ golden butterfly _ and follow the -- _ silver cobweb _ cry roy the name occur to he in a flash of inspiration as he watch the filmy outline of the other aeroplane melt in the distance oh roy what a pretty name be not it but somehow i like _ golden butterfly _ best we machine may be a bit heavier but solidity count in hard service scarcely ten minute later and while mortlake 's mechanic and assistant be still crane they neck skyward another aeroplane a yellow adventurer of the sky thunder upward not to be outdo by mortlake roy who be at the wheel swoop above the rival crowd they do not take it with a good grace remark of which they could not catch the wording but only the menacing intonation be hurl upward at they they receive they with a laugh and a wave of the hand which do not put the mortlake crowd into any better humor and then with a graceful swinging curve that bank the machine almost on its beam end they be up off and away in pursuit of the _ silver cobweb _ which by this time be a mere shoe-button of a dot on the horizon do you think we can overhaul she roy venture peggy as they race through the air the fresh breath of morning come refreshingly in they face not a chance admit roy cheerfully but they 'll turn after a while i guess and then we 'll try the _ butterfly _ against the _ cobweb _ but they keep on and on unrelentingly and still there be no sign of diminution of speed on the part of the _ silver cobweb _ nor do the other aircraft give any indication that she be prepare to put about below they farm meadow village and crowd of wonder country folk swam by in a ever-changing panorama the earth beneath they look like a big saucer divide up into brown red and green square with tiny fly-like dot run and walk about all at once roy give a shout and point dead ahead and not more than a few mile distant lay a silvery gleaming streak the sea the exclamation come simultaneously from peggy and roy they have be travel due south across the island and now the broad atlantic lay stretch beyond the land shimmering in the sunlight far off they could make out the black smoke of a steamer hover above the ocean a mail boat make for new york announce roy so fast be they travel that by this time they could plainly make out the ocean which from a silvery streak be now change into a dark-blue rolling expanse of salt water and still the _ silver cobweb _ keep on and give no sign of turn nor for that matter have she speed diminish appreciably the rival aeroplane be now skim above the water at a height of about a thousand foot the _ golden butterfly _ maintain about the same altitude but the gap between the two aerial craft be not close up mortlake 's take a desperate chance to show lieut bradbury what the _ cobweb _ can do exclaimed roy with a new engine he be risk too much i guess he be see we and mean to beat we out at all hazard conjecture peggy and she be right mortlake glance back a short time before the sea appear on the horizon have see the other aeroplane and guess at once what its appearance mean have determine to keep on even at the risk of plunge himself and he passenger into the sea that be mortlake 's character he be a man who could brook no rivalry use all he life to sweep obstacle aside he would rather have terminate he career than permit any one to pass he in the race for first place no matter in what line that first place might lie be you go to keep on roy the question come as a strip of white beach flash beneath they and peggy peer over the edge of the chassis see the big atlantic swell roll below they the thunder of the surf on the beach come clearly to they ear even at that height what do you think si we have get lot of gasoline the motor be work without a hitch i would hate to turn back now particularly with that officer 's eye upon we as in all probability they be oh let 's keep on exclaimed peggy casting prudence to the wind i feel like you roy if we turn back now it would look as if we be afraid to trust the _ butterfly _ above the ocean and after all it be a naval contest that we hope to be elect for forward it be then cry roy exultingly the tang of the salt wind the inspiration of the ocean have come to he he feel like a corsair -- a very modern corsair -- urge he craft above the ancient sea the vessel whose smoke they have espy at a distance be quite close to they now a huge black hull with white passenger deck rise tier on tier four huge red funnel with black top and slender mast between which hang the spider-web aerial of she wireless apparatus she bow be cream up the ocean into foam as she rush onward at a twenty-four knot gait roy obey a daring impulse let the _ golden butterfly _ descend now they could see she promenade deck line with white face peer upward here and there the sun glint on the bright metal work of camera all aim at the wonderful spectacle of the soar buoyant _ golden butterfly _ oh if only we could drop a message on she deck breathe peggy eagerly i do wish we have a post-card or something -- by ginger cry roy suddenly i do believe i have get some in my coat-pocket i buy some in the village yesterday to mail to the chap back at school yes here they be and here be a fountain-pen now write all you want peggy take the card she brother hand to she with he free hand and with the fountain-pen sit down to compose some message after a few seconds ' thought she begin to write busily card after card be cover with she neat penmanship all this time roy have keep the _ golden butterfly _ hover above the liner from time to time take swoop and dive around it like some monstrous sea gull suddenly from the liner 's whistle a great cascade of white steam spout wough-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h it be the vessel 's siren blow a greet to the young adventurer of the air at the same instant a deep-throated roar a cheer from cabin and steerage passenger alike wing its way upward roy acknowledge it by a graceful wave of he cap then the cheer break forth afresh the passenger of the newest ocean giant the _ ruritanium _ realize that they be see a spectacle that would remain in they memory all they life have conquer old ocean with leviathan vessel man be now seek to subdue the air to he utility chapter x a aerial post office peggy address half a dozen card two of course go to jess and jimsy another to aunt sallie prescott one to the captain of the _ ruritanium _ and one other which bear the address eugene mortlake esq it be a mischievous freak that make peggy write this last missive which read : to mr eugene mortlake per steamer _ ruritanium _ -- in mid-air : greeting from aeroplane _ golden butterfly _ r & m prescott that be all but peggy know that it would serve its prankish purpose all this time the _ silver cobweb _ have be out at sea but now apparently detect the maneuver of the _ golden butterfly _ she head about and come race back peggy deftly attach weight -- spare bolt from the tool locker -- to each of the card and then snatch up a megaphone she hail the uniformed figure on the bridge of the great vessel below they will you be good enough to mail some letter for we with pleasure come the reply in a big bellowing british voice from one of the stalwart figure beneath all right roy come down as low as you dare cry peggy catch she bundle of mail roy throw over a couple of lever and turn a valve instantly the _ golden butterfly _ begin to drop in long beautiful arc she shoot by above the liner 's bridge at a height of not more than fifteen foot at the correct moment peggy drop the weighted bundle overboard and have the satisfaction of see one of the officer catch it the gallant officer now realize for the first time that a girl -- and a pretty one -- be one of the passenger of the big aeroplane wave they hat and bow profoundly and peggy -- what would aunt sallie have say -- peggy blow they a kiss but then as she tell jess later : i be in a aeroplane my dear -- a sort of a unattainable possibility in fact in the meantime mortlake in the _ silver cobweb _ have be duly mystify as to what the _ golden butterfly _ be about when she swoop downward on the steamer for one instant the thought flash across he that they be disabled a unholy glee fill he at the think if only the _ golden butterfly _ be to come to grief right under lieut bradbury 's eye it would be a great feather in the cap of the mortlake-harding machine but to he chagrin he see they rise the next instant as cleverly as ever lieut bradbury who have be watch the maneuver of the _ golden butterfly _ give a admiring gasp as he witness the daring feat good heaven he exclaim and the evident note of astonishment and appreciation in he tone do not tend to increase mortlake 's self-satisfaction the pesky brat he mutter to himself we have get to do something to put they out of the race there be not another american-built aeroplane that i fear except that bothersome kid ' machine and there and then mortlake begin to hatch up a scheme that in the near future be to come very nearly prove disastrous to peggy and roy and they high hope magnificently handle do not you think so mortlake inquire the naval officer the next instant yes very clever agree mortlake far too smart to show he inward feeling or to wear he heart upon he sleeve very neat but i can do the same thing if you would care to see it the naval officer glance at the puffy feature of he companion and he thick bull-like neck no thanks he say i have get to be get back there be another type of machine i have get to look over out at mineolum it be really necessary that i reach there as quickly as possible very well say mortlake inwardly relieve as he do not much fancy duplicate roy 's feat we 'll head straight on for the shore if you please but what be the _ golden butterfly _ do as the steamer race onward that aerial wonder have swing in a spiral and be now seemingly hover about await the arrival of the _ silver cobweb _ as the two aeroplane draw abreast mortlake mutter something and bent over he engine the _ cobweb _ leap forward like a unleash greyhound but the _ golden butterfly _ be close on she heel and make almost as good time mortlake plunge he hand in among the machinery and readjust the air valve of the carburetor another increase of speed result the indicator crawl up to sixty-six sixty-eight and then to seventy mile a hour press she a bit be not you ask the officer as they seem to hurtle through the air so fast do they rush onward oh no she be build for speed respond mortlake with a gratified grin she 'll leave any such old lumber wagon as that prescott machine mile behind she any day in the week this seem to be true the _ golden butterfly _ make about sixty mile be be rapidly leave behind i should think you would be afraid of overheate you cylinder volunteer the lieutenant now this be just what mortlake be afraid of but as have be say he be the sort of man who in sport parlance be willing always to take a chance to beat any one he consider he rival he be take a desperate chance now under the artificial means he have use to increase the speed of he engine the motor be turn up several hundred more revolution a minute than she have be build for now they shoot above the strip of white beach and below they the pleasant meadow-land and patch of verdant wood begin to show once more all at once the sign for which mortlake have be watch so anxiously manifest itself a tiny curl of smoke ascend from one of the cylinder-head a smell of blister burning paint be waft back to the nostril of lieut bradbury i think so he say overheating already better slow down mortlake mortlake glance back the _ golden butterfly _ much diminish in size now by the distance still hang doggedly on he heel i 'll give she more air he vouchsafe stubbornly that ought to cool she off a bit -- that and advance spark he manipulate the necessary lever but before many minute it become apparent that if urge at that rate the _ silver cobweb _ would never reach sandy beach without a break-down have not you better shut down a bit that paint 's blister as if the cylinder be red-hot much as he dislike to interfere with the operation of the aeroplane the young officer feel that it be necessary that some means should be take to compel mortlake to reduce speed if the engine become so overheate that it stop in mid-air they might be catch in a nasty position where it might be impossible to volplane -- or glide -- downward without the aid of the engine it be all right i tell you say mortlake stubbornly we 'll beat those cub into sandy beach or -- or what be destine never to be know for at that instant with a splutter and a sigh the overheate engine almost at a red-heat stop short the propeller cease to revolve and the aeroplane begin to plunge downward with fearful velocity but mortlake no matter what he other fault possess a cool head the instant he lose control of the motor he seize the warping lever and begin manipulate they at the same time he set the rudder so as to bring the _ silver cobweb _ to earth in a series of long spiral the maneuver be that of volplaning and have be perform successfully by several aviator whose engine have suddenly cease to work while in mid-air the young officer watch approvingly whatever else mortlake might be -- and lieut bradbury have not take a violent fancy to he -- he be a master of the aerial craft despite the mishap to the engine -- cause by he own carelessness -- mortlake manage to bring the _ silver cobweb _ to a gentle landing in a broad flat meadow inhabit by some spotted cow which flee in undignified panic as the monster silent now swoop down like a bolt from the blue the instant the _ silver cobweb _ come to rest mortlake 's restless eye glance upward he be hope against all common sense that the young prescott have not see he mishap or at least that they would pass on above he unnotice he first glance show he the _ golden butterfly _ still steadily plug along and a moment later it become apparent that they have see the sudden descent of the _ cobweb _ for the aeroplane be see to dip and glide lower much as a mouse hawk can be see to do hard luck murmur the young naval officer as mortlake who have clamber out of the machine stamp and fume by its side inwardly lieut bradbury be think how stubborn man invariably meet with some mishap or accident yes beastly hard luck agree mortlake readily i see a farm-house over there though the other side of those tree i guess i can get a bucket and some water over there once i have cool those cylinder off we 'll be all right how long will that take do you think inquire the officer pull out he watch and a time-table not more than half a hour it should not take that that mean i miss my train if we do not get into sandy beach by eleven o'clock i can not possibly make it and there be not another from there for two hour that would make I late for my appointment at mineolum mortlake 's face fall here be a bit of hard luck with a vengeance it might cost he a place in the contest we can make up time once we get under way he say tentatively that be not it i dare not risk it i wonder if i can get a automobile or some sort of a conveyance about here not a chance i know this neighborhood it be very sparsely settle a sudden whir above they cause they both to look up it be the _ golden butterfly _ swoop and hover above the disabled _ cobweb _ have a accident shout down roy what do you think you can see we be not fly can not you bellow mortlake he face crimson with anger and mortification can we do anything to help you come from peggy ignore the fellow 's insulting tone no yes the first monosyllable come from mortlake the second from lieut bradbury if you do not mind accept a passenger i should be glad of a lift to sandy beach i have get to make a train explain the young officer in five minute the _ golden butterfly _ be on the sward beside the cripple _ cobweb _ mortlake 's face be black as night he fulminate malediction on the young aviator who have appear at -- for he -- such a inopportune moment can i help you fix the machine ask roy pleasantly there be nothing serious the matter be there not a thing assert mortlake it be all the fault of the man who make the carburetor they do a bungling bit of work and the cylinder have overheate can we leave a message for you at you shop or would you like a lift home with we ask roy who feel a kind of pity for the angry and stranded man you can not do anything for I except leave I alone snap out mortlake you cub be altogether too inquisitive you be too nosy but not to the extent of make sketch and note mr mortlake inquire peggy sweetly -- cattily she say it be afterward mortlake start and pale then without vouchsafe a reply he stride off in the direction of the farm house to get the water he need now mr bradbury say roy extend a hand the young officer leap nimbly into the chassis and presently a buzz whir tell that the faithful _ golden butterfly _ be take the air once more score two for we think peggy to herself from a far corner of the pasture mortlake watch he young rival climb the sky he shake he fist at they and he heavy face darkened chapter xi the marked bill some two day after the event narrate in we last chapter lieut bradbury sit in the library of the new york aero club on west fifty-fourth street receive a telegram from eugene mortlake he be considerably astonish when on tear it open he read as follow : must see you at once have positive proof that young prescott be about to sell out he secret to foreign government phew whistle the young officer this be a serious charge if it be prove it will bar prescott from bidding for the united state government contract but i can hardly believe it there must be some mistake however it be my duty to investigate let 's see -- three o'clock i can get a train to sandy beach at four too bad too bad the young officer shake he head he have come to have a sincere regard for roy and he pretty sister as well as admiration for they resourcefulness and pluck when it be explain that during the time elapse between he lucky lift in the prescott machine and the reception of the note that lieut bradbury have notify roy that he would be expect to report at the brooklyn navy yard he feeling on learn that there be suspicion direct against he young proteg may be imagine mortlake too have receive a notice that he machine be eligible for a test so that there would have seem to be no object for he act treacherously otherwise the young officer might have be suspicious what he have see of mortlake have not particularly elevated that gentleman in he opinion but if he have desire to wrong the prescott reason the officer such a resourceful man as he have adjudge mortlake to be would have seek a deeper and more subtle way of go about it and i would have stake my word on that boy 's loyalty aye and on he sister 's too mutter the officer as he make ready for he hasty trip to long island by this it will be see that lieut bradbury be by no means proof against the rather common fail of incline to believe the first evil report we hear it be a phase of human nature that be not combat as it should be in the meantime roy and peggy have sustain a surprise likewise the day before that on which lieut bradbury receive the disturbing dispatch a automobile have whiz up to they gate and stop roy peggy and jess and jimsy be at a game of tennis when a rather imperious voice summon they from the tonneau of the machine they look up to see a remarkably pretty young girl who could scarcely have be more than eighteen year old she eye be black as sloe and flash like smolder fire a great mass of hair of the same color be pile on the top of she head in grown-up fashion and she gown of a magenta hue which set off she dark beauty to perfection be cut in the most recent -- too recent in fact -- style can you direct I to mr mortlake 's aeroplane factory she demand in a imperious tone evidently the flush healthy-looking young people who have be play tennis so hard be very despicable in she eye there it be down the road there volunteer roy it be that barn-like place the appellation be unfortunate the girl 's eye flash angrily my name be regina mortlake she say angrily i be mr mortlake 's daughter he be not in the habit of put up barn i can assure you i beg you pardon -- begin roy quite take aback by the extraordinary energy with which the reproof to he harmless remark have be give but the dark-eyed beauty in the automobile have give a quick order to the chauffeur and the car skim on down the road later that day the _ silver cobweb _ ascend for a flight it have nothing more the matter with it on the day of the break-down than the heated cylinder which as mortlake have prophesy soon cool but mortlake himself do not take up the silvery aeroplane on this occasion a new figure be at the wheel clothe in dainty dark aviation tog and bonnet with a fluttering flow veil of the same color which stream out like a flag of defiance the new driver be miss regina mortlake they learn later that the girl have take frequent flight in the south where she father have for a time enter into the business of give aeroplane flight for money at county fair and the like he daughter have take naturally to the sport and be a accomplished air woman she know no fear and she imperious ambitious spirit make she a formidable rival even to the foreign fly woman who compete at various international aviation meet while he daughter spin through the air eugene mortlake sit in he little glass-enclosed office in one corner of the noisy aeroplane plant four finish machine be now ready and he would have feel capable of face any test with they have it not be for he uneasy fear of the prescott aeroplane but he have evolve a scheme by which he think he would succeed in put peggy and roy out of the race altogether it be in the make that afternoon in the little office opposite to mortlake sit two man whom we have see before but in the cheap but neat suit they now wear and with they face clean-shaven of the growth of stubby beard that have formerly cover they it would have be somewhat difficult to recognize the two ill-favored tramp who have be route by peggy in such a plucky manner but nevertheless they be the man you thoroughly understand you instruction now question mortlake as he conclude speak the fellow who have be address by he companion as joey at the time they encounter mortlake and harding on the road to the galloway farm nod we understand guv ` ner he rasp out in a hoarse voice slim here and I do not take long ter catch on eh slim no dubious manner of doubt about that respond slim a ' although i be a tramp now guv ` ner i be not aller one i have hold my head as high as the rest of the good folk of the world i can play the gentleman to perfection do not you worry this slim -- or to give he he correct name -- frederick palmer be as he declare with such emphasis a man who have indeed see better day as the phrase be now that he be invest in fair-looking clothes and be grace with a clean collar and a smooth-shaven face he actually might have pass for a person in fairly well-to-do circumstance for the part mortlake wish he to play he could not have pick out a better man utterly unscrupulous and with the best of he life behind he slim -- as the tramp fraternity know he -- be prepare to do anything that there be money in he companion possess no such saving grace of appearance short coarse and utterly lack in every element of refinement joey eccle be a typical hobo but mortlake 's shrewd mind have see where he could make use of he too in the diabolical plan he be concoct and the detail of which he have just finish confide to he unsavory lieutenant but say guv ` ner strike in joey eccle he little pig-like eye agleam with cupidity we have get to have a bit more of the brass you know -- a little more money -- eh he end in a insinuate whine the cringe plea of the professional beggar mortlake make a gesture of impatience i give you fellow a twenty-dollar-bill a few day ago he say in addition to that you have be provide with clothes and lodge what more do you want we have get to have some more coin that be flat announce slim decidedly come on fork over guv ` ner you have go too far into this now to pull out mortlake 's florid face go white as if he hear it for the first time the word strike home he have indeed go too far as the tramp sit opposite to he have say he be in fact completely in the power of these two unscrupulous mendicant make a resolve to get rid of they as speedily as possible he dive into he breast pocket and draw from it a roll of bill that make slim 's and joey 's eye stick out of they head he peel off a twenty-dollar-bill and fling it with no good grace down upon the table there he say that be the last you 'll get till the trick be do thankee guv ` ner i know you would see sense a man of you intelligous intellect and -- that will do snapped mortlake do you think i have get nothing to do but talk to you fellow all day you thoroughly understand now to-morrow night on the road to galloway 's farm yus and we have get a nice little desert farm house all pick out where we can keep the young rooster on ice grin joey well well shoot out mortlake that will be you task i have nothing to do with that do you understand he rap the table nervously i know nothing about it all right all right we be wise slim assure he confidently do not you worry come on joey get the money have i oh no i be goin ' ter leave it right here grin joey enjoy he own irony hugely still chuckle he arise and shuffle out follow by the unsavory slim outside and on the road to the village slim begin to be obsess by doubt some way i do not je ' trust that mortlake he say you be sure that bill be all right joey sure well you je ' bet i be here look at it yourself all right be not it he draw out the bill and hand it to slim for he inspection and the best of it be he chuckle while slim inspect the bill carefully the best of it be that i be not conformin ' to the exact truth when i tell mortlake that we would spend all the other coin i have get the best part of it leave good grunt slim turn the twenty-dollar-bill over and examine the reverse side that be the case -- hullo what be up ask joey for reply slim hand the bill to joey point with a grimy first finger at something on the reverse side it be a o scrawl in dull red ink that would be a easy bill to identify comment palmer uneasily wonder if this can be a trap well keep you suspicion to yourself for a while counsel joey we do not need to break it till we make sure chapter xii what happen to roy it be the next evening mortlake sit at he desk look up as a quick step sound outside the factory be in darkness as the man have go home only a twilight dimness illuminate the little glass sanctum of the inventor and constructor of the mortlake aeroplane come in say mortlake as the next instant a sharp decisive knock sound lieut bradbury in a mufti suit of gray step into the office ah good evening lieutenant say mortlake rise clumsily to he foot and offer a chair i be begin to despair of you bradbury genuinely worry lose no time in plunge into the object of the interview that message you send I -- what do it mean he ask i can scarcely believe -- nor could i at first say mortlake with assume sorrow it cut I pretty deep i tell you to think that a boy who be in negotiation with he own government for a valuable implement of warfare should deal with a foreign government at the same time in brief this young traitor be balance the profit and will sell out to the highest bidder that be strong language mortlake say the young officer drum the table with he finger impatiently honorable and upright in all he dealings the young officer have no liking for the business in hand yet it be he duty to see the thing through now unpleasant as it promise to be strong language echo mortlake yes it be strong language but not a bit more emphatic than the case warrant do you know that for some day past a german spy have be in sandy beach no certainly not well there have be he visit this plant with proposal to turn over we aeronautic secret to he government but we refuse to have anything to do with he scheming yes very good go on please the young officer feel that mortlake be approach the climax of he story one of we man resume mortlake in even tone in which he cunningly manage to mingle a note of regret one of we man take upon himself -- loyal fellow -- to watch this spy he report to I some day ago that the man be in negotiation with young prescott good heaven i know it sound incredible but we be deal with fact well more than this my zealous workman ascertain that young prescott be to meet this foreign agent at nine o'clock to-night on a lonely road and be there to hand over to he the complete plan and specification of the prescott aeroplane it be unbelievable horrible and in the face of this do you mean to say that the boy would dare to keep up he apparent negotiation with the united state that be just the worst part of it as i understand it rejoin mortlake the negotiation with this foreigner would of course be presume by young prescott to be secret this be so he would if successful in the test sell he idea to the united state also without mention the fact that they have already be buy and pay for monstrous just what i say when i hear of it i could not believe it in fact the boy have always seem to be all that be upright and honest it just show how we can be mistake in a person i can not credit it yet mortlake it be to give you proof positive that i summon you here we will take a automobile out to the spot where young prescott be to meet the foreign agent of course we arrival will be so calculate as to give we time to secrete ourselves before prescott and the other meet be you willing to let you estimate of young prescott stand or fall by this meeting i be yes reply lieut bradbury breathing heavily the young scoundrel if he be catch red-handed i will see if there be not some law that will operate to take care of he case mortlake could hardly conceal a smile he plan to ruin roy be work to perfection in he imagination he see the prescott aeroplane eliminate as a naval possibility and the field clear for the selection of the mortlake machine mentally he be already add up the million of profit that would accrue to he lieut bradbury leave that meeting heavy of heart mortlake 's story have be so circumstantial so full of detail that it hardly leave room for doubt and then too he have offer to produce positive proof to allow the officer to witness the actual transaction good heaven be not there any good in the world think the officer as the hack in which he have drive out to the mortlake plant drive he back to the village mortlake have agree to call for he at the little hotel at eight o'clock the hour till then seem to have leaden foot to the anxious young officer it be shortly before this that roy return from a errand in town in the prescott automobile be halt at the roadside by a figure which step from the hedge-row and hold up a caution finger utter a sharp : hist roy turn see a man seemingly a workingman from he overalls at the side of the machine what be it what do you want demand roy i have a message for you say the man speaking in a slightly foreign accent you be in great danger you enemy plot it my enemy exclaim roy yes you enemy at the mortlake factory let 's see say roy thoughtfully you be one of the workman at the mortlake plant be not you i _ be _ once say the man with a vindictive inflection but i be so no longer mortlake discharge I discharge you eh well what be that get to do with I roy look curiously at the man just this much i know the meanness that mortlake plan to do to you you have bad and wicked enemy at we place humph i guess there may be some truth in that say roy with a rather grim inflection well what do you want I to do about it just this : i be a honest man i do not want to see harm come to you or to you sister this be touch roy in a tender spot to my sister he exclaim do you mean to say that mortlake be scoundrel enough to plot against she too in this way explain the man he mean to destroy you aeroplane leave the field clear for he own type to be select by the navy the -- the -- the ruffian pant roy now thoroughly arouse tell I more about this i can not rejoin the workman but my partner -- he be discharge too -- he can tell you much much more will you meet he i can take you to he roy think a moment the man seem to be wholly honest and in earnest how far from here be the place where you partner be he ask oh not so very far we soon get there in you fine machine will you go well i -- yes i 'll go come on get in the man obey the invitation with alacrity under he direction roy swing the car off upon a by-road after they have go some few hundred yard not long now he say as the vehicle bounce and jounce over the rut and stone of the little-used thoroughfare this be a funny direction for you partner to live in say roy at length there be not many dwelling out this way nothing but a big swamp as i recollect it my partner he poor man be the rejoinder he live with cousin out here the answer lull roy 's rouse suspicion it must be all right he think there can not be any trick in all this it be quite likely that mortlake do want to play we a mean trick i can not forget the look he flash at I the day we take lieut bradbury away from he in that meadow after we have make we first sea trip wow roy could not forbear smile at the recollection they chug along in silence for some little distance farther and then the man beside he lay a detain hand on roy 's arm almost there now he say better slow up roy do so the brake grind down with a jarring rasp at the same moment a dark figure step from behind a tree trunk the man beside roy hold up a hand this be the young gentleman he say through the gloom the other figure now approach the automobile do you mind get out it say we can talk better in the house where be the house i do not see one say roy he suspicion rouse a little it be just behind that knoll the path be just ahead say the newcomer roy get out he be determine to see the adventure through now if mortlake be plot against he he want to know it as he reach the ground the newcomer extend he hand as if offer to shake roy 's palm roy put out he hand which be instantly grasp by the other you friend tell I that you have something interesting to tell I -- begin roy i -- here what be you try to do stop it the other have seize he hand in a clutch of steel and before the astonished boy could offer any resistance have wrench it over in such a manner that without exactly know what have occur roy find himself sprawl on he back the lad be helpless in this lonely place with two man who have now show themselves in they true and sinister character chapter xiii plot and counterplot the spot be fearfully lonely roy realize this to the full brave as the lad be he feel suddenly chill and creepy besides the utter mystery that envelop the affair be gruelle to the mind now be still plead the late guide as roy full of fight jump to he foot and fling off the detain hold which have be lay on he yep we do not want to hurt you chime in another voice the voice of the powerful stockily-built man who have throw he be reasonable and quiet now and you 'll come to no harm if not -- he draw a pistol and present it at the boy 's head the hint be rough but effectual roy see that it would be mere folly to attempt resistance what be the meaning of this rough behavior he ask in a steady voice mentally resign himself to the inevitable you just come with we for a little while say the gruff-voiced one do not worry we be not goin ' ter harm you you 'll git loose agin after a while do not worry about that this assurance though mysterious be more or less comforting but roy resent the utter mystery of the affair but what be it all for he protest be mortlake at the back of it or -- now you come along young feller say a gruff voice do not axe no question and you will not git tell no lie see roy see well go ahead since i be in you power he say but i warn you it will go hard with you if ever i be able to set justice on you track hard word break no bone guv ` ner come from the gruff-voiced man who be none other than joey eccle disguise with a big beard the man who have escort roy into the trap be in truth a former workman at the mortlake factory who have be discharge for incompetency he have apply at the plant to be take on again be well-nigh desperate with hunger and mortlake have assign he to the present task for which if the truth be tell he have no great liking where do you want I to go be roy 's next question as neither of he captor have yet make a move we 'll show you fast enough young guv ` ner say joey through he beard come on this way he catch hold of roy 's arm and begin pilot he along a path or rather cow track that run across the meadow it be now almost dark and roy after they have go a few step be only able to make out the dark outline of what seem to be a small hut on the edge of a dense wood lie directly ahead of they i suppose that be we destination think the boy well they have not attempt any violence and i guess if they have mean I any physical harm they would have attack I when they first trap I but what do all this mean that be the question nothing more be say as the three the captor and the prisoner tramp across the dewy grass as they draw closer to the building roy have descry he see that it be a dilapidated look affair shutter hang crazily from a single hinge break window-pane look disconsolately out in the roof be a yawning gap from which a great owl flap as they draw closer evidently the place have not be occupy as a dwelling for many year the door however be open and with the pistol still menace he roy be march by he captor into the moldy smell place hand he pistol to the other man gruff-voice -- otherwise joey eccle -- strike a match carefully screen it from the draught which sweep through the rickety building he lead the way into a bare room in which be a tumble-down table and two box to serve as seat a pack of greasy card lay on the table-top show that joey have be pass he time at solitaire this fact show roy that the plot have be carefully concoct and that the trap be all ready to be spring much earlier in the day only a brain like mortlake 's he reason could have think out such a intricate plan and yet what could be mortlake 's object now then announce joey when he have light the tin kerosene lamp i 'll show you to you quarter master prescott a chill run through roy at the word what could be come now with he pistol in he hand joey gently urge roy into a rear room he companion follow with the lamp once in the room joey step forward and stoop down raise a trap door in the center of the floor a rank musty smell rush up as he open it thar 's you abode for the next three or four hour he say with a grin to roy and point downward the boy shudder not in there he say they be we order say joey shortly there be a ladder there now you can climb down on that do not be scare it be only a cellar and guarantee snake-proof when the time come we 'll lower the ladder to you again a ' git you out roy look desperately about he unarmed he know that he do not stand a chance against he burly captive but have it not be for the fact that one of they have a pistol he would have even then attempt to make a break for liberty but as it be -- hopeless he nod as joey point downward into the dark rank hole and with a inward prayer he slowly descend the ladder the instant he foot touch the ground joey who have be hold the lamp above the trapdoor order he companion to pull up the ladder the next moment it be go and the trapdoor be slam to with a ominous crash roy be envelop in pitchy darkness suddenly through the gloom he hear a sound it be the rasp of a padlock be insert in the door above he then come a sharp click and the boy know that hope of escape from above have be cut off if the man keep they promise they would release he in they own good time and that be all he have to buoy he up in that black pit but roy as those who have follow he and peggy 's adventure know be not the boy to weakly give way to despair before he have exhaust every possible hope and not even then but in the darkness he do bitterly reproach himself for fall into the rascal ' trap so blindly well of all the prize idiot in the world he break forth under he breath in the blackness commend I to you roy prescott if you would think it over before you start -- look before you leap -- this would never have happen anybody but a chump could have see that on the face of it the whole thing be a scheme to entice you away oh you bonehead you ninny the boy feel better after this outbreak he even smile as he think how neatly he have walk into the spider 's web then he shift he position and prepare to think but as he move he foot strike something a wallet it feel like he reach down and by dint of feel about manage to get he finger on it the leather be still warm and roy realize that it must have be drop into the cellar from the bearded man 's pocket when he lean over to see if roy have reach the bottom of the ladder queer find think the boy i 'll keep it maybe there be something in it that may result in bring those rascal to justice he thrust it into he pocket and think no more of it he mind be busy on other thing just then if only he have a match he feel in all he pocket without result and be about give up in despair when in the lining of he coat he feel several lucifer they have slip through a hole in he pocket gee whiz how lucky that aunt sally forget to mend that pocket think the boy eagerly thrust he finger through the aperture and draw out a dozen or more match these may stand I in good stead now but i do not want to waste they guess i 'll just light one to see what kind of a place i be in and then trust to the sense of touch if i see any means of escape there be a scratch and a splutter and the match flare bravely its yellow ray illumine a cellar very much like any other cellar it be wall with stonework well cement and there be two or three small window at the side but these which at first fill roy with a flush of hope prove on examination to have be brick up and solidly too nothing do there he mutter and turn he attention to the rear of the underground place where there be a flight of step lead up to a horizontal door which evidently open on the outerworld but this door be secure on the under side by a rusty padlock of formidable dimension roy try it it be solid as the rock of gibraltar as the advertisement say stick he mutter disappointedly and yet : hold on what about that pocket tool kit i have when i start out on the auto hooray those chap forget to search I think it be too much trouble i guess now for a sharp file good here 's one now then if the luck hold i 'll be free in not much more than a long jiffy these thought shoot through roy 's brain as he select a file from he fortunate find and begin work away at the hasp of the padlock above he he could hear the low grumble growl of the voice of he guardian but they come very faintly lucky thing they be in the front room think roy as he work on otherwise they might hear this at last the file have cut far enough into the hasp for roy 's strong finger to be able to bend the metal apart with a beating heart he replace the little tool in its case and pull the ring of the padlock out of the hasp then he give a upward shove but very gently for all he know the door he be push upward might open in another room but when it gape a inch only roy see the faint radiance of a clouded moon a gust of fresh clean air blow in he face as if welcome he from he noisome depths a instant later with throb pulse and flush cheek roy stand out in the open above he light cloud race across the moon alternately obscure and reveal the luminary of the night but roy do not linger he creep across the field keep close to a tall dark hedge-row till he reach the automobile as he have guess neither of he captor know how to run it and it stand just where he have leave it glory be think the boy climb in i be all right now i do not know where this road go to and it be too narrow to turn round but i 'll keep straight on and i be bind to land somewhere he turn on the gasoline and set the spark but the engine do not move queer think roy he get out and walk round to the front and then the rear of the car there be a strong smell of gasoline there stoop down he find the ground be saturate with the fuel what have happen be plain enough the cunning rascal who have capture he have drain the tank of gasoline the auto be as helpless as if it have not have a engine in it at all well this be a fine fix think roy however there be nothing for it now but to keep on those ruffian be cleverer than i give they credit for steal softly toward the wood the boy speed into they dark shadow aid by the flickering light of the moon he make good progress through the gloomy depths he do not dare to slacken he pace till he have travel at least half a mile then he let he footstep lag not much chance of they discover I now even if they have awaken to the fact that i have escape he say to himself as he stride on suddenly he emerge on a strip of road that somehow have a familiar look he be still look about when a strange thing happen there come the sound of rapid footstep approach he and the quick breathing of a almost spend runner then come a sound as if somebody be scuffle not far from he and suddenly a voice he know well ring out : prescott you young scoundrel i 'll get you yet the voice be that of lieut bradbury well how under the sun do lieut bradbury know that i be here marvel the amaze boy stop short at the same instant from the direction in which the naval officer 's shout have come a slender dark figure come race toward he chapter xiv how they work out roy make a desperate clutch at the figure as it race past evidently flee from a unseen peril that that peril be lieut bradbury roy do not for a instant doubt as he could hear the officer 's shout in he undoubted voice close at hand the boy 's hand grasp the unknown 's collar but at the same instant with a eel-like squirm the figure dive and twist suddenly it bent down and scoop up a handful of sandy gravel and fling the stuff full in roy 's face blind the boy stagger back and the other dart off like a deer the next instant two heavy hand fall on roy 's shoulder and he feel himself twist violently about and then a voice -- lieut bradbury 's voice -- say : now then you young rascal i have get you what do all this mean that be just what i would like to know exclaimed roy indignantly brushing the gravel out of he smart eye i have be make prisoner and -- the officer 's astonished voice interrupt he what do you mean to try to lie out of it do not you just hand the plan of the aeroplane over to that representative of a foreign government whom mr mortlake be now chase roy look at the other as if he think he have go suddenly mad as well he might i do not understand you he gasp what be all this -- a joke it be a very poor one if it be i 'll give you a chance to explain say the officer grimly tighten he hold on roy 's collar as thing stand at present i believe you to be as black a young traitor as ever wear shoe leather the world swam before roy 's eye he sense for the first time a inkling of the diabolical web that have be spin about he but it be time that we retrace we footstep a little and return to event which occur after the lieutenant have be pick up by appointment in sandy beach in the automobile which call for he be seat mr harding whom he already know slightly from meet he at the aeroplane plant and mortlake himself this be a very unfortunate business hey croak old harding as they spin along the road to the place where mortlake who be drive declare roy have make a appointment to meet the foreign spy it be worse than that sir it be deplorable the officer have say and he mean it too he have hardly be able to eat he dinner for think over the extraordinary situation but the auto speed rapidly on now it have pass the last scattering house outside the village and be race along a lonely country road finally it turn off and enter a branch thoroughfare which lead from the main track all this time but little have be say each occupant of the machine be busy with he own thought and in the lieutenant 's case at any rate they be not of the pleasantest the road into which they turn be little more than a track with a high grass-grown ridge in the center it be a lonesome spot and certainly seem retire enough to suit any plotter who might wish to transact they business unobserved bother such sneaky bit of work think the young officer to himself as they rush onward through the darkness i feel like a cheap detective or somebody equally low and degraded it be unmanly and -- oh well it be in the line of duty i suppose or hang if i would have anything to do with it mortlake show up as more of a gentleman in the matter than i would have give he credit for he seem to be genuinely cut up over the whole nasty mess well he may be too as describe in another chapter the sky be overcast with hurry cloud which from time to time allow a flood of moonlight to filter through by one of these temporary period of light lieut bradbury be able to perceive that they be in a sort of lane with high hedge on each side suddenly mortlake run the auto through a gap in the hedge at one side of the road and drive it in among a clump of alder where there be no danger of it be see this be the place say he as they come to a standstill and a nice lonely sort of place too hey chirp old harding just the place for a traitor to he country to -- hush say the young officer seriously let we wait and see if young prescott complete the case against himself before we condemn he mr harding humph grunt the old money-bag in my opinion he be condemn already never do like that boy something sneaky about he hey hey hey the officer 's heart be too sick within he to answer he draw out he watch and look at it in a fleeting glimpse of moonshine it be almost the time that mortlake have declare have be agree upon for the consummation of the plot at all event i shall know within a few minute if this story be to be credit or condemn thought lieut bradbury old harding and mortlake the latter lead and beckon to lieut bradbury slip cautiously through the alder and take up a position in the clump at the edge of the road behind a big bowlder where they could command a good view of the thoroughfare without be see themselves the officer with a keener sense than ever of do something dishonorable join they hark exclaimed mortlake presently but although they all strain they ear they could hear no sound except the crack of a tree limb as it rub against another branch in the night wind you be sure this be the place ask the officer so my man tell I rejoin mortlake you know i rely absolutely on he word for this thing all the way through i myself know nothing of it he emphasize these last word as if he wish they to stick in he hearer 's memory suddenly however a new sound strike into the silence it be a heavy footstep gradually draw closer round the dark corner of the road come a tall form in a long coat and with a slouch hat pull down well over its eye lieutenant bradbury could have groan mortlake nudge he triumphantly well he say i guess part of it be true anyhow i be afraid so breathe the officer i think so hey hey i think so chuckle old harding rustily the tall figure come on until it be almost opposite the bush where the three hide onlooker be conceal it look about in some impatience tap one of its foot querulously then it fall to pacing up and down evidently the boy be late think the lieutenant and then a glad guess shoot through he mind perhaps the boy have think better of it but even as he feel a great sense of relief at this supposition there come a low whistle from farther down the road it be answer by the figure opposite the hidden party which instantly stop its pacing to and fro by the great north star it be true gasp the officer as from round the bend in the road below where they be station a slight boyish figure walk rapidly come into view it hesitate a instant and then perceive the tall man it come on again have you get der plan the question come in a thick guttural foreign tone from the tall figure the boy who have just appear show every trace of agitation he be struggle with he better nature think lieut bradbury i 'll help he he be start forward with this intention when mortlake prepare for some such move drag he back do not interfere he whisper if the lad be a traitor as well know it now as at some future time lieut bradbury could not but feel that this be true he sink back once more watch intently breathlessly every move of the drama go on under he eye with a quick gesture the boy seem to cast aside he doubt he mutter something in a low voice and as a ray of moonlight filter through a cloud lieut bradbury distinctly see he pass something to the tall man goot you haf do vell here be der money say the man in a low but distinct tone that carry plainly to the listener ' ear he hold out a envelope which the boy take with a muttered word of thanks seemingly lieut bradbury could control himself no longer fling mortlake aside as if he have be a child he flash out of he place of concealment mad rage boil over in he vein what he have just see have sweep every doubt aside he whole be be bent on get hold of the young traitor and trounce he within a inch of he life he feel he would be fulfil a sacred duty in do so but as he spring forward as if impel by a uncoiled steel spring the two conspirator catch the alarm while the officer be still rush through the bush they dash off one in one direction one in the other he be ruin everything groan mortlake no no you can save the day yet if you act quickly cry old man harding in the same low intense voice shout out that you be after the spy right cry mortlake clutch at a straw he too dash out of concealment and take off after the tall man bellow loudly : you chase the boy bradbury i 'll get the spy stop you villain stop it be at that moment that roy just emerge from the wood hear lieut bradbury 's angry challenge : prescott you young scoundrel i 'll get you yet chapter xv what mortlake do look here cry roy indignantly wiggle in the officer 's strong grasp can not you see that this be all a mistake if you have not grab I i could have catch that impostor a great light seem to break on lieut bradbury why bless my soul he exclaim that be so i can see it all now that chap who get away wear a gray suit while yours be a blue serge be not it it be before i be throw into that cellar say roy ruefully the moon be shine brightly now and he see that in the semi-darkness it would have be easy to mistake he blue serge dust-covered as it be for one of gray material tell I exactly what have happen urge the officer i must confess i be in a mental whirl over to-night 's happening roy rapidly sketch the event lead up to he capture and imprisonment not forget to lay the blame on himself for be so gullible as to be lead into such a pitfall not a word more of self-blame my boy cry the young officer warmly older person than you would have stumble into such a artfully prepared snare bait as it be with the hope of catch mortlake in a plot to destroy you aeroplane but now i be go to tell you my experience and we can see if they dovetail at any point but when lieut bradbury conclude he narrative they be still at sea as to the main instigator of the plot of course the finger of suspicion point pretty plainly to mortlake but the rascal have cover he track so cleverly that neither roy nor the young officer feel prepared to actually accuse he but i can not see how a ordinary workman would have have either the brain or the motive to direct such a ingenious scheme to discredit I in you eye conclude roy as they finish discuss this phase of the question nor i but hark somebody 's shout it must be mortlake yes it be hull -- o -- a hullo -- a come back out of the night come we will retrace we step to the auto and meet he there say the lieutenant i wonder if he 'll have the face to brazen it out think roy by which it will be see that he mind be pretty well make up as to the power behind the night 's work could not come near the fellow puffed mortlake as they come up he run like a deer but -- great christmas -- you have have better luck i see for a instant even in the semi-darkness roy see the other 's face grow white as ash he think that lieut bradbury have catch my impersonator be the thought that flash through the boy 's mind but the same sudden radiance that have betray mortlake 's agitation also show he that it be the real roy prescott he be face instantly he assume a mask of the greatest apparent astonishment roy prescott i be really amaze that you should be implicate in such a -- save you breath mr mortlake snap out the lieutenant and he word come sharp as the crack of a whip this be the real roy prescott and he have be the victim of as foul a plot to blacken a honest lad 's name as ever come to my knowledge the young ruffian who impersonate he to-night have escape escape exclaimed mortlake but to roy 's quick ear despite the other 's attempt to disguise he relief it stand out boldly yes escape partly owing i confess to my overzealousness there have be foul play here somewhere mr mortlake the officer 's voice be stern he eye flash ominously just then old mr harding come puff up oh so you get the boy hey he cackle but mortlake shut he off with a quick word no this be the real roy prescott it seem that a trick have be put up on we all the lad we mistake for roy prescott be some one impersonate he this lad have be the victim of a vile plot while we be watch here for he supposed appearance and the revelation of he treachery some rascal have lock he in a cellar the lieutenant 's word be hot and angry he feel that he be face two clever rascal whose cunning be too much for he straightforward method you -- you amaze I exclaimed old mr harding look in the moonlight like some hideous old ghoul what game of cross-purposes and crooked answer be this that remain to be see i shall see to it that a investigation be make and the guilty party punish be it fancy or do roy for a second see mortlake quail and whiten but if the boy have see such a thing the next instant mortlake be master of himself it seem to I to have be a plot put up by my workman he say if i find it to be so i shall discharge every one of they poor fellow in they mistaken loyalty to I perhaps they think that they be do I a good turn by try to discredit my young friend -- i be proud to call he so -- my young friend prescott for the first time roy be move to speak i hardly think that you workman be responsible mr mortlake he say slowly and distinctly you do not who then i do not know yet but i shall you can depend upon that really how very clever we be smart as a steel trap hey grate out old harding rub he hand smart as a steel trap with tooth that bite and hold hey hey hey instead of waste time here i propose that we at once go to the house in which roy be confine and see if we can catch the rascal implicate in this say lieut bradbury can you guide we my boy i think so sir it be not more than half a hour 's tramp from here say roy let 's be off at once otherwise they may escape we ridiculous in my opinion say mortlake decisively depend upon it those ruffian have find out by now how cleverly the boy escape they and have decamp we have much better get back to town and notify the police i beg you pardon but i differ from you opinion say the naval officer look at the other sharply of course if you do not want to go -- oh it be not that mortlake hasten to say i be willing but mr harding he be old and the night air -- mr harding can remain with the automobile there be plenty of wrap in it come roy be you come mr mortlake yes oh yes mr harding you will make yourself comfortable till we return have say this mortlake come lumber after the other two as eagerly as if he whole soul be bent on capture the two man who have be carry out he order i have get a revolver ready for they he volunteer as the party plunge through the wood along the little track roy have follow take care it do not go off prematurely and alarm they say the officer we do not want to let they slip through we finger of course not i 'll be very careful promise mortlake they trudge on in silence suddenly roy halt we be near to the place now he say advance cautiously in single file order the lieutenant i 'll go first in indian file they creep up on the house its outline could now be see and in one window a ruddy glow from the lamp the two abductor of roy have kindle evidently they have not yet discover he escape all at once mortlake who be last stumble on a root and fall forward as he do so he revolver be discharge twice the shot ring out loudly in the still night instantly the light be extinguish the next instant two dark figure could be see race from the house before lieut bradbury could call on they to halt they vanish in the darkness and a patch of wood to the north what a misfortune exclaim mortlake contritely pick himself up lieutenant bradbury could hardly restrain he anger how on earth do you happen to do that mortlake he snap those two shot alarm those rascal and now they be go for good it be most annoying i appreciate you chagrin my dear bradbury rejoin mortlake suavely but accident will happen you know yes and sometimes they happen most opportunely be the sharp reply mortlake say nothing in silence they approach the house but nothing save the pack of greasy card be find there to indicate the identity of its late occupant there be nothing to do but to return to the automobile they find old mr harding await they eagerly he show no emotion on learn that roy 's captor have escape just as they capture seem certain on the drive back to sandy beach the old banker and mortlake occupy the front seat while roy and lieut bradbury sit in the tonneau as they skim along roy draw something from he pocket and show it to the officer it be a object that glisten in the waver moonlight it be a woman 's hair comb cry the officer in amazement as he regard it hush not so loud warn roy i pick it up where i have the struggle with the other roy prescott it may prove a valuable clue chapter xvi miss side-comb some day after the strange and exciting event just record peggy burst like a whirlwind into the little room -- half work-shop half study -- in which roy be hard at work develop a problem in equilibrium it be but a short time now to the day on which they be to report to the navy board of aviation at hampton road and submit they aerial craft to exhaustive test both brother and sister have occupy they time in work like literal trojan over the _ golden butterfly _ but although every nut bolt and tiniest fairy-like turn-buckle on the craft be in perfect order roy be still devote the last moment to develop the balancing device to which he mainly pin he hope of best the other craft from the newspaper they have be make aware that several type bi-planes monoplane and freak design be to compete and roy be not the boy to let lack of preparation stand in the way of success detective and the local police have be set to work on the mysterious plot whose object have be to entrap the boy but no result have come of they work incidentally it have be find when the auto which roy have drive to the desert house be tow back for repair that the tank have be puncture by some sharp instrument as for the clue of the brilliant-studded comb peggy on examine it declare it to be one of a pair of side-comb which only complicate the mystery roy have think of surrender this clue to the police but on think it over he decide not to he have a idea in regard to that comb himself and so have peggy but it seem too wild and preposterous a theory to submit to the intensely practical police of sandy beach roy look up from the paper-littered desk as peggy fling breathlessly into he sanctum he know that only unusual news would have lead she to interrupt he work in which she be as keenly interested as he be what be it si he ask you look as excite as if the statue of liberty have pay we a visit and be now do a song and dance on the front lawn oh roy do be serious listen -- who do you suppose have come back to sandy beach not the least idea who fan harding fan hard the dickens be not it and more than that he be down at the mortlake plant now he be go to take up the _ cobweb _ and who do you think be to be he companion give it up regina mortlake phew whistle the boy a new conquest for the irresistible fanning eh do not be stupid reprove peggy severely i have be think it over and i have just hit on the solution fanning or so i hear take up aviation when he be in the west you know he always have a hankering for it yes i recollect he fake aeroplane that scare the life out of you grin roy well pursued peggy not deign to notice this remark i guess they decide that mr mortlake would be a bit er -- er -- overweight be not it call so they send for old mr harding 's son to manage the _ cobweb _ at the test jove that must be it make it rather awkward though somehow i do not much fancy master fanning as if we have not good reason to despise he hark there go the _ cobweb _ now a drone buzz be bear to they ear run to the window they see the mortlake aeroplane whiz by at a fair height it be go fast and a male figure tall and slight be at the wheel in the stern seat regina mortlake 's rubicund aviation costume could be make out -lrb- illustration : run to the window they see the mortlake aeroplane whiz by at a fair height -rrb- fanning have certainly turn out to be a good driver of aeroplane comment roy as he watch see that flaw strike they there he bring the _ cobweb _ through it like a old general of the upper region peggy have to admit that fan harding do seem to be a expert at he work but she do it regretfully he give I the creep she volunteer there be nothing creepy about he aeroplane work though laugh roy i should not have believe he could have pick up so much in such a short time but a bigger surprise lay in store for the young prescott that afternoon they have as visitor no one less than fan harding and regina mortlake while peggy and the daughter of the designer of the mortlake aeroplane chat in one corner fanning place he arm on roy 's shoulder and draw he out upon the veranda where miss prescott sit with she embroidery i know you do not like I roy and you never do he say insinuatingly but i have change a lot since i be in sandy beach before let 's let bygones be bygones and be friend again more especially as in a few day we 'll be pit against each other at the naval test of course if you be genuinely sorry for all the harm you try to do we i have nothing more to say say roy i be willing to be friend but although i may forgive it be go to be hard to forget oh that will come in time say fanning airily i be a changed fellow since i go west but in spite of fanning 's protestation roy could not help feel a sensation of mistrust and suspicion toward the youth there be something unnatural even in this sudden move toward friendship it be ungenerous ungentlemanly roy protest to himself but somehow the feeling persist that fan be not to be trust how prettily you do you hair peggy be remark to regina mortlake in the meantime she look with genuine admiration at the glossy black wave which the other have draw back over she ear in the french style oh do you like it ask regina eagerly i think its hideous but you know i lose one of my comb and -- but let 's go and see what the boy be do she break off suddenly turn crimson and hasten to the porch once outside she plunge at once into conversation with the two boy and peggy have no opportunity of pick up the drop stitch of conversation she catch herself puzzling over it why have regina be so mortified and apparently alarm when she have announce the loss of one of she side-comb right there a strange thought come into peggy 's mind the brilliant-studded comb that roy have pick up could it be that -- but no the idea be too fantastic in the page of a book perhaps but not in real life and yet -- and yet -- peggy as she watch the graceful dark-eyed girl talk with splendid animation find herself wonder -- and wonder the next day just as peggy and roy be start out for a run to the bancroft place fan harding and regina mortlake come whiz up to the gate in the latter 's big touring car -- the one in which she have arrive in sandy beach the machine be the gift of she father it be a commodious maroon-colored car with a roomy tonneau and fore-door and torpedo body of the latest type beside it the blue bird look somewhat small and insignificant but roy and peggy feel no embarrassment on the contrary they be quite certain the blue bird be the better car where be you off to ask fanning in friendly tone while regina bow and smile very sweetly to peggy go to take a spin in the direction of the bancroft 's say roy start he car what fun cry regina mortlake so be we let 's race i do not believe in race rejoin peggy no of course it be dangerous say fanning i guess roy be a bit timid with that old car too besides it be all in the way you handle a machine roy flush angrily i guess this ` old car ' as you call it could give yours a tussle if it come down to it he say sharply peggy tug he sleeve she see where this would lead too she see too that fan be anxious to provoke roy into a race presumably he be anxious to humiliate the boy in regina mortlake 's eye well do you want to race then ask regina provokingly she fine eye flash there be a bit of road beyond here that be quite broad and one hardly ever meet anything now roy be averse as be most boy to be think a ` fraid cat and the almost openly taunt air with which the girl look at he anger he almost to desperation very well he say we 'll race you when we get to that bit of road oh roy what be you say plead peggy it be all a trick to humiliate we the blue bird can not possibly keep up with they car and -- but roy check she impatiently you do not think i be go to allow fan harding to scare I out of anything do you he demand in as near to a rough tone of voice as he have ever use to he sister poor peggy feel the stinging tear rise but she say nothing the next moment the car begin to glide off run side by side on the broad country road faster and faster they go the speed get into roy 's head he begin to let the blue bird out and then fan harding for the first time seemingly realize what a formidable opponent he be place in contact with as they reach the bit of road previously agree upon as a race course the banker 's son stop he machine and hail roy to do the same tell you what we 'll do to make this interesting he say we 'll change machine or be you afraid to drive mine i 'll drive it say roy recklessly in spite of peggy 's quaver : say no good that will give we a fine opportunity to compare the two machine cry fan harding he jump from the bigger car and hand out he companion then for the fraction of a minute he bent monkey wrench in hand above one of the forward wheel a bolt have work loose he explain come on peggy urge roy and against she better judgment peggy as many another girl have do before she obey the summons although a intuition warn she that something be not just right ready cry fan from the blue bird all ready hail back roy who find the spark and throttle adjustment of the maroon car perfectly simple then -- go almost scream regina mortlake peggy be look at she at the moment and she be almost certain she see a look of hatred flash across the girl 's countenance but before she could give the matter any more think the maroon car shot forward close alongside come the blue bird motor hood to motor hood they thunder along at a terrific pace the road shoot by on either side like a brown and green blur faster peggy hear fanning shout somewhere out of the dust cloud whi-z-z-z-z-z-z it be wild exciting -- dangerous roy gasp peggy if -- but she get no further there be a sudden soul-shaking shock the front of the car seem to plough into the ground a rend splitting noise fill the air the car stop short and its boy and girl occupant be hurtle like projectile into the storm center of disaster chapter xvii jimsy 's suspicion be rouse peggy after a moment in which the entire world seem spin about she crazily sit up she have land in a ditch and partially against a clump of springy bush which have break the force of she fall in fact she presently realize that by one of those miraculous happening that no one can explain she be unhurt the automobile its hood crush in like so much paper have skid into the same ditch in which peggy lay and bump into a small tree which it have snap clean off but the obstacle have stop it one wheel lay in the roadway evidently it have come off while the machine be at top speed and cause the crash but peggy

exclaim regina with a impatient stamp of the foot do not you see that this bill will come pretty close to prove roy prescott a thief if we want to use it that way you be a witness that i find it in he wallet which have be jerk out of he pocket be not that enough well man have be send to prison on less evidence say fan with a shrug but i have get to hurry up with this water or they 'll suspect something i 'll talk more with you about this later on you father and mine need every bit of fight material they can get hold of if we be to win the big prize for the mortlake aeroplane a shadow fall athwart the road as fan a evil smile on he flabby pale face hasten down into the depression in which roy with peggy bend above he still lay the girl look swiftly up a big red aeroplane be hover on high presently one of its occupant a girl peer over the edge the next minute she turn and say something in a excited tone to she companion the aeroplane begin to drop rapidly in a few seconds it come to earth in the roadway not a stone 's throw from the wreck auto and its uninjured blue bird comrade the new arrival be jimsy and jess they have set out on a sky cruise to the prescott home and jess 's bright eye have espy the confusion in the road beneath they as they fly over the swift descent have be the result hardly notice regina who regard they curiously the young sky sailor hasten toward the spot in which from on high they have see the injured boy lie a warm wave of gratitude sweep over peggy as she look up at the sound of footstep and see who the newcomer be in a emergency like the present one she could not wish for two better helper than the bancroft jess and jimsy have be off on a visit and so have not be make aware of the fact that fanning have return to sandy beach they astonishment on see he may be imagine jess regard he with a tinge of disdain but the frank and open jimsy grasp the outstretched hand which the son of the sandy beach banker extend to he evidently fan 's policy be one of conciliation and he mean to press it to the uttermost well this be a nice fix be not it murmur roy smile pluckily as the bancroft come toward he with pity look but where in the world do you come from from yonder sky grin jimsy try not very successfully to assume a inanely cheerful tone not badly hurt old man be you no just this wallop over my eye and a twisted ankle think it be break at first but i guess it be not how do it all happen peggy explain jimsy whistle what make of machine be you car fan he ask a dashaway be the rejoinder the same type as ours exclaimed young bancroft they be the best and stanchest car on the market i can not understand how such a accident could have happen unless -- he pause and then go on resolutely unless the car have be tamper with what a idea shrill regina who have now join the group you do not surely mean to insinuate why the damage do to my poor machine will cost a lot to repair and -- do not mind if i have a look at it do you ask jimsy in he most careless manner i be interested you know a motor bug be what dad call I well i -- begin fan but regina interrupt he with strange eagerness oh by no means look at it all you wish i only hope you can find some explanation for this regrettable accident i hope so too say jimsy gravely but in the meantime let 's make roy comfortable in the blue bird then if we can fix you car up miss -- oh i beg you pardon strike in peggy jimsy this be miss mortlake fanning you know miss mortlake these be we particular chum jess and jimsy bancroft indeed i have hear a great deal about you vouchsafe regina as jimsy and fanning lift roy and carry he to the blue bird and make he comfortable on the cushion i 'll attend to the other car volunteer fan readily but jimsy be not to be put off in this way i would like to have a look at it before we try to put the wheel back he say it may be a useful bit of experience all right assent fanning rather sullenly if you insist but i think we ought to hurry back at once by all means quoth the bland jimsy but -- hullo what be this he be stoop over the wheel now this wheel have be tamper with the hold cap must have be partially unscrewed look here he hold up the brass cap which be suppose to keep the wheel on its axle some of the thread have be file out of this he say positively let 's have a look say fanning eagerly he lean over and scrutinize the part which jimsy be examine those thread have not be file he say they have worn very careless not to have notice that it be surprising that it hold on so long it might have hold for a year if the car be run at average speed say jimsy slowly but the minute it be race beyond its normal rate the weak part would have go what do you mean to imply blustered fanning though he face be pale and he breath come quickly i do not imply anything say jimsy slowly but i would like to know who file this cap down pshaw you be dream scoff fan a dull flush overspread jimsy 's ordinarily placid face after a while i 'll wake up maybe he say and then -- he stop well let 's see about get roy home he say peggy you can drive the blue bird and fanning and miss mortlake can sit in the other machine as soon as we get the wheel back then jess and i will go ahead in the _ red dragon fly _ and break the news to miss prescott shortly thereafter the two auto move slowly off while the aeroplane race above they go at a far faster speed regina turn to fan do you think that odious boy suspect anything she ask i guess he do but he can not prove a thing so that be all the good it will do he scoff fanning and besides if they get too gay we have get a marked bill that will make it very unpleasant for a certain young aviator chapter xviii a bolt prom the blue the broken ankle which both peggy and roy have dread turn out to be only a sprain -- affect the same unlucky ankle that have be injure on the desert this be a big relief as a broken joint would have keep roy effectually out of the aeroplane test as part of the machinery of the _ golden butterfly _ be control by foot pressure a council of war be in progress on the porch of the prescott home the participant be the inseparable four peggy and roy the latter with he injured foot on a stool and jess and jimsy they have be discuss the case against mortlake and fanning harding all agree that thing look as black against they as could be but -- where be the proof there be not a iota of evidence against they that would hold water a instant before impartial judge it be positively depress sigh jess to know that people have do mean thing and not be able to get a atom of proof against they never mind say peggy all 's well that end well we start for hampton to-morrow and once there they will not have a chance to try any more trick luckily all they mean plan and scheme have end in nothing roy will be as good as ever by to-morrow will not you boy roy nod i have get to be he say decisively those test have get to bring the _ golden butterfly _ out on top and they will too declare jess with a nod of she dark head that poky old harding and he crowd will not have a word to say when they be over let 's hope not it do not do to be too confident you know smile peggy throw a arm round the waist of she enthusiastic friend as the man say when he think he would lasso a horse but find he would rope he own foot instead grin jimsy but say what be all this come up the road sure enough a small crowd of ten or a dozen person could be see approach the prescott house they be come from the direction of the mortlake plant in advance as they draw nearer could be see mortlake himself with a tall man by he side and fan hard the man behind seem to be workman from the plant wonder where they can be go to query jess idly for a few moment more they watch the advance throng and then jimsy cry suddenly : why that be sheriff lawley with mortlake and there be si hardscrabble the constable right behind they what can they be after clue laugh peggy but the laugh fade on she lip as she exclaim : why -- why they be come here here echo the other yes that be what they be confirm jimsy as the procession pass inside the wicket gate and come up

glint of the truth of this visit have dawn upon he why roy it be about that thar robbery at galloway t ` other night sputter the sheriff look rather embarrassed we have come to the conclusion that you

meantime peggy have take upon herself the task of consoling miss prescott poor aunt sallie she take the news very hardly it be all peggy could do to keep she from rush out upon the porch and denounce the entire assemblage that mortlake she cry i would like to scratch he eye out the proceedings in sandy beach before the local magistrate ephraim gray be brief isaac galloway the farmer tell of the

mr mortlake be a respected member of this community you display of ill-will do you no good as for you story of how you find the wallet you can tell that to a jury later on my present duty be to hold you in bond of $ 2500 for trial a deep breath like a sigh go through the courtroom in the midst of it a active upright figure step forward it be lieut bradbury who have arrive in the courtroom just in time to hear the conclude word but he have already be inform of the fact for the story be on every tongue in the village i be prepare to offer that bail he say but peggy have be before he with she mine share she have a good bank account and be able to offer cash security this be accept almost before the young officer reach the judge 's desk peggy thank the lieutenant with a look she could not trust herself to speak of course say the magistrate the fact that the defendant be under bond will prohibit he leave the state that be understand mortlake nudge fan harding this be what they have cunningly calculate on with roy safely bottle up in new york state it would be manifestly impossible for he to take part in the contest at hampton in virginium while they converse in low eager tone peggy and lieutenant bradbury could be see talk in another corner court have be adjourn but the curious crowd still linger jess and jimsy stand by roy fencing off the inquisitive villager and would-be sympathizer the whole thing have take place so rapidly that they all feel dazed and bewildered suddenly the thought of what he detention mean dawn upon roy we 'll be out of the race for the naval contract he almost moan it be the first sign he have show of give way but peggy be at he side in a instant no we will not roy she exclaim she eye brilliant with excitement i have ask lieutenant bradbury and he say it be unusual but he do not see why a woman should be bar from fly in the contest there be nothing in the rule about it anyway oh peg -- gy gasp jess you would -- do anything within reason to balk that mortlake crowd in they trickery and deceit declare peggy with flash eye and we 'll stand by you announce jimsy step forward we 'll go with you to hampton and we 'll bring home the bacon the inexcusable slang go unreproved jimsy 's enthusiasm be contagious thank you jimsy say peggy wink to keep back the tear that would come we -- we -- i -- that -- be -- we 'll beat they out yet the bunch of sneak and it be my opinion that mortlake himself know all about who rob that safe cry jimsy not take the trouble to sink he voice he face defiantly about and catch mortlake 's eye it be instantly avert and catch fanning by the arm he hasten from the courtroom i wonder what mischief those young cub be hatch up now he say as the two hasten off bend they step toward old mr harding 's bank it do not make much difference chuckle fan we have get that contract nail down and deliver now chapter xix the gathering of the man-bird the aeroplane -- a dozen in all that have be select by various naval sharp from all over the widely distribute portion of the country for the weed out of the best type -- be quarter in a broad meadow not far from the town of hampton the locality have be choose as remove from the reach of the ordinary run of curiosity seeker who have flock from all part of the country to be present at the first test of aeroplane as actual naval adjunct shed have be provide for the accommodation of each type and above each shed be the name of the aeroplane it house print in small letter one of the first thing that mortlake and fanning harding proceed to do on they arrival at this bivouac be to make a tour of the row of shed in search of the prescott machine but to they joy apparently no shed house it there be machine of dozen of other type monoplane bi-planes machine of the helicopter type and a few device base on the parachute principle but no prescott the name the various machine bear be weird : the _ sky pilot _ the _ cloud chaser _ the _ star bug _ the _ moon mounter _ the _ aerial auto _ the _ heavenly harvester _ and some title even more far-fetched grace the shed so that it be small wonder that in this maze of high-sounding name a shed at the far end of the row bear the obscure title of nameless miss the scrutiny of mortlake and he aide we have beat they to a standstill this time say mortlake with intense conviction i feel that the _ motor hornet _ have the contest cinch the _ motor hornet _ be the name that have be bestow on the machine which roy have poetically dub the _ silver cobweb _ the shed of the mysterious nameless be the only one of the long row that do not buzz with activity all that day which be one assign to preparation for the contest of the morrow all the other aeroplane hive fairly radiate activity freakish-looking man hover about they weird helicopter and lovingly polish brass and test engine the reek of gasolene and burning lubricant hang heavily over the field reporter dart here and there follow by pant photographer bear elephantine camera and bulge box of plate for the metropolitan press be play up the test which be expect to produce a definite aerial type of machine for the united state navy but even the most inquisitive of the news-getter fail to get anything from within the mysterious realm occupy presumably by the nameless its roller-fitted double door remain closed and no sign of activity appear about it this be concede on all side to be extraordinary but all the speculation which be indulge in fail to elucidate the mystery the nameless be also the ungetatable joke one reporter as he and a companion pass by but if anyone have be about late that night long after the aviator who have quarter at the hotel in town have quit the field he would have see three figure -- two girl and a boy steal across the field from a auto which have drive up almost noiselessly and unfasten the formidable padlock on the door of the nameless 's dwelling place this do they vanish within the shed for a short time and presently thereafter a dark and strangely shaped form slowly emerge from the shed it be the _ golden butterfly _ and the trio of young folk be as you have already guess peggy jess and jimsy they crawl noiselessly on board and a few minute later with a soft whir of the propeller the _ butterfly _ shut down for precaution 's sake to half speed speed almost noiselessly upward the night be a calm one hardly a leaf be stir and the star shine like steel point in a cloudless sky the aeroplane after it have attain a few hundred foot seem to merge into the dark background of night sky unless one have know of its flight it would have take a sharp pair of eye to have discern it say this be glorious it be like be pirate or -- or something say jimsy enthusiastically as soon as they have reach a height where they feel they could talk without difficulty it be great after be pen up all day at that hotel agree peggy who be at the wheel how beautiful the star be poor roy i wonder how he be get along you know he be do splendidly when we leave and he have we telegram by this time say jess oh peggy i be so glad that the board of naval aviation say you could fly the _ golden butterfly _ oh be not they take aback though at the idea chuckle jimsy i think that dignified old officer would fall out of he chair at the idea of a girl daring to run a aeroplane i 'll bet if there would be anything in the rule about it peggy they would have bar you i think so too laugh peggy but luckily there be not as lieut bradbury point out it be a case of a emergency it be not as if i would try to ` butt in ' as you say jimsy well i be sure i do not see why a girl should not run a aeroplane just as well as a boy you certainly show that you could peggy when you race that train back in nevada in year to come prophesied peggy i dare say woman as aviator will be as common as man i do not see why not ten year ago a woman who run a automobile would have be laugh at if not insult but now why lot of woman run they own car and nobody think of even turn he head hear hear cry jimsy i declare i feel like a lone man at a suffragette meeting then conduct yourself as if you be actually in that dangerous position laugh peggy the girl 's spirit be rise now under the excitement of the night ride on the advice of lieut bradbury the party from sandy beach have keep closely to they room at the hotel all that day it be at the officer 's advice too that they shed have be label the nameless if mortlake be as i begin to think concerned in these attack on you the officer have say i think it would be advisable not to appear any more than necessary let he think that you be out of the race accordingly the _ butterfly _ have be transport secretly and place in she shed at night the secret have be well guard and as we know neither mortlake nor fan harding have even a inkling that the prescott machine be far -- very far from be out of the race on and on through the night throb the _ golden butterfly _ make fast time at last they decide that it be time to return the object of the trip to see that all be in run order have be accomplish nothing remain to do now but to wait for the morrow and what it would bring forth the nature of the test have be carefully guard and not one of the contestant know anything about what they be to be till the hour come at which they would be announce from the judge ' boat suddenly as they near the environs of hampton and the glare of electric light could be see on the sky jimsy give a cry and point down below they be fly pretty low and in a road beneath they they could see a automobile its headlight shine brightly but it have stop all at once a sharp shout for help wing upward hullo exclaimed jimsy somebody be in trouble down there maybe we would better descend that be if you girl be not scared um -- well begin jess but peggy interrupt she : jess bancroft i be ashamed of you it be we duty to help out if we can at least if it get too hot we can always retreat muttered jimsy under the covering of one of the locker be a revolver under peggy 's direction jimsy find it the next moment they be descend rapidly with hardly more noise than a alighting night bird they drop into the lane in which the auto be stall as they touch ground the sound of harsh voice catch they ear : shell out now if you do not want to be half-killed yes come on hand over you coin or it 'll be the worse for you chime in another ruffianly voice good gracious gasp jess it be a hold up but now another voice come through the darkness i suppose you fellow know that you be break the law and in danger of imprisonment if you be catch now what be there that be familiar about that voice puzzle peggy rack she brain aw do not preach sermon to we boss come one of the gruff voice we need the money and we be not particular how we git it see fork over now or -- the sentence be never complete there be a sudden flash and a sharp report the man in the automobile have defend himself apparently for there come the sound of a heavy body fall and then he voice : i hope i have not hurt you badly but you bring it on yourself as you companion can witness the next instant and just as jimsy spring forward from the clump of brush at the roadside which have hitherto conceal the aero party -- there come a heavy rush of foot toward they a dark form run pantingly appear jimsy with a dexterous outward thrust of he foot trip the flee man who come down heavily in the center of the road and start howl for mercy in the meantime the occupant of the automobile have climb down and detach one of the lamp examine the wounded man lie in the road beyond jimsy 's capture as the ray of he light swing to and fro they hover for a instant on peggy 's white strained face lean forward above jimsy 's prisoner upon whose neck the redoubtable young bancroft be now sit miss prescott by all that be wonderful come a amaze voice there be no mistaking that bold straightforward voice now it be james bell the mining magnate and they kind friend oh mr bell cry peggy half hysterically we be so glad you have come chapter xx a unexpected meeting as mr bell speak the fellow who have apparently be shoot leap to he foot and be about to make off but the westerner 's iron hand seize he by the scruff of the neck and bring he up all stand simultaneously jimsy 's captive give a wrench and a twist and would have escape but for peggy the girl seize a small nickled wrench out of the _ golden butterfly _ in the dark it look not unlike a pistol you would b-b-b-better stay w-w-w-where you be say peggy in a voice which though rather shaky be still courageous the fellow take the hint and just then mr bell come up with he capture

a short dash to they shed and they reach it without incident then with heart that feel lighter for the brisk healthy influence of breezy jame bell they trudge to the small hotel at which they be stop in order to avoid be see by mortlake and he aide till the last moment chapter xxi the start of the sky cruise the first flight be to be to cape charle and return a distance of sixty mile approximately announce jimsy the next morning he hold in he hand a small blue folder which have be issue to all the contestant it contain the rule and regulation govern the first day 's test a hasty breakfast be follow by a quick trip to the grounds in one of the ancient hack that seem to swarm in hampton if the start field have be a scene of confusion the day before it be a veritable chaos now smoke and the fume of gasolene hang like a pall above it through the bluish cloud could be see dim figure hurry with can of fuel or lubricant bag of tool and engine part remind I of circus day comment jimsy look about he hullo there be the _ cobweb _ out already he exclaim presently across the field could be see the silvery wing of the mortlake aeroplane several figure hover about she adjusting stay and put finishing touch to she complicated mechanism presently a hush settle over the scene and the party of naval officer detail to superintend the start and take the time of the compete craft come through the crowd they be direct they step to a unpainted wooden structure at one end of the field this building be equip with various instrument for record time accurately from it also would presently be give out the wind velocity and any other datum of interest to the aviator the party in full uniform swing past we three young adventurer lieutenant bradbury be among they he bow and be about to pass on when he stop and fall back now do not get nervous and do you best he say to peggy i be sure that we shall all have reason to be proud of the _ golden butterfly _ before these test be over i hope so rejoin peggy we shall do we best at any rate i know you will and now if you 'll excuse I i must be hurry on the board have a immense amount of work to do before ten o'clock the official start hour the trio leave to themselves make for the shed which bear the legend nameless above its door many curious eye follow they as they pause before it and jimsy insert a key in the stout padlock who could the two pretty girl in natty motor bonnet with goggles attach the plain heavy skirt and dark shirt-waist be speculation run rife there be a regular stampede of reporter and photographer to the shed of the nameless but when they arrive there to they chagrin they find that they prospective victim have slip inside and only the blank door greet they among the crowd that hasten to try to solve the mystery of the nameless be fan harding whose attention have be attract by the rush of the crowd at he side be regina mortlake they arrive just in time to hear somebody say : it be two pretty girl and a good-looking boy they be just kid fan and regina exchange glance the girl actually turn pale they be here after all she exclaim and i think you say they be not well how on earth be i to know that they have hide they machine under that name there be so many freak craft here that -- you be more of a idiot than i think you say the girl impatiently all we work have go for nothing no there be time yet if only eccle and that other chap have not decamp like that last night we might have put they to work to-night they decamp -- as you call it -- because you father would not give they any more money say regina with flash eye that be inexcusable folly they know too many of we secret to allow they to wander about unwatched oh two tramp like that would not have the sense to make any use of what they know rejoin fan easily besides -- but regina mortlake 's mind be busy on another tack be not it against the rule for woman or girl to drive machine in this contest she ask say fanning 's eye glisten i guess it be let 's find out if peggy prescott be go to drive that machine we may be able to head they off yet the two conspirator hasten across the field to the unpainted wooden shack that house the committee a crowd surge about it ask question and demand impossible thing it be some time before fan elbow people right and leave as he be could reach the front he scan a print list of the entry for the contest hang on the wall as he read it he blame himself bitterly for not look at it the day before near the bottom be the name nameless entrant miss margaret prescott suddenly the disgruntled youth spy lieut bradbury a moment he cry as the young officer turn fan without a word of greet bellow out : be not it against the rule for a girl to drive a aeroplane in this contest not that i be aware of rejoin the officer he reach over to a stack of pink booklet here be a book of rule read it hold on cry fanning as the officer move off i want to make a protest i -- make you protest in write no verbal one will be consider say the officer briefly but see here -- i have no time to talk now mr harding good morning and the officer pass on the crowd begin to grin and soon laugh openly this enraged fan the more he angrily shove he way to the outskirts where regina be await he well she say lift she dark eyebrow well echo fanning in a surly tone it be no go no go what do you mean i mean that there be not anything in the rule apparently to prevent a woman or a girl drive a aeroplane if she want to come and let 's see my father suggest the girl presently he 'll want to know about this it may mean a complete change of we plan you 'll have to change 'em to beat the _ golden butterfly _ mutter fan if only those drawing have not be lose we would have have that balancer and it look to I as if we might need it before we get to cape charle why the wind 's freshen not more than a half dozen of these aeroplane will venture up bother the luck if it be not for the _ golden butterfly _ we would have a clean sweep this be only the first day counsel regina the point score to-day will not count for so very much there be plenty of time humph grumble fanning and as this conversation have bring they up to the _ silver cobweb _ he break it off to communicate he intelligence concern the prescott aeroplane to mortlake who hear it with a lower brow bang a bomb shot upward and explode in a cloud of thick yellow smoke in mid-air the half-hour signal cry jimsy everything ready as ready as it ever will be rejoin peggy nervously finger a stay wire the navigator of the nameless be still inside the shed the door be still close peggy have decide not to risk have the machine damage by the crowd by bring it out before the very last moment as the bomb sound jimsy draw out he watch he keep it in he hand await the elapse of the preliminary half-hour outside as fanning have prophesy there have be a great and sweeping reduction in the number of aeroplane that be to start the puffy wind have scare most of the entrant of the freak type and only five of the more conventional kind of aircraft be on the start line the _ silver cobweb _ be among they fan be in the driver 's seat as a passenger he carry regina mortlake she look very stunning in she lurid aviation costume and she handsome face be as calm as chiseled marble she nervousness only display itself by a constant tap of she gauntleted finger fan finish oil the motor and adjust grease cup and timer and straighten up glance nervously about he still no sign of the nameless i guess they have get scare off by the wind he grin to mortlake who with the elder harding and several machinist stand by the side of the _ cobweb _ i doubt it rejoin mortlake it would take more than that to alarm those girl and just to think that all we trouble to out-maneuver they have go for nothing you do a bad thing when you let eccle and that other chap get away comment fanning i do not like they disappearance at all why well for one thing they know a good deal that would make it very awkward for we if they fall into the hand of anyone who dislike we and again -- pshaw you be alarming yourself over nothing they be well pay and they would not dare to make trouble if they tell about we they would implicate themselves just the same i do not feel easy hullo there go the second bomb that fellow 's just go to touch it off and -- at the same instant the door of the nameless 's shed be fling open from they emerge the glistening form of the golden-winged _ butterfly _ half a dozen man whom jimsy have hire push the aerial craft rapidly across the field to the start line so engrossed be the crowd in watch the other machine that they hardly notice the arrival of the add starter but not so mortlake and he companion they watch with jaundiced eye the forthcoming of they dreaded rival and if wish could have disabled she the _ golden butterfly _ would never have fly on that day b-o-o-m the echo of the second bomb ring deafeningly they be off yell the crowd as if there might have be some doubt of it up into the puffy air wing six aeroplane it be a glorious sight from the chassis of the various air craft the airman wave farewell to the cheer crowd fly wing and wing they dash off toward where the sea lay a deep blue patch beyond the shore presently they fade into dot and then be blot out altogether there be a thick haze out there say one of the officer as the aeroplane vanish the word run through the crowd and create a momentary sensation then the big throng dismiss the fly aeroplane from its mind and wander about the grounds gaze openmouthe at the freak type whose inventor be willing enough -- too willing -- to explain they remarkable point it might be a long time before the first of the homing craft would come in sight and what be the use of worry about they only in the wooden structure housing the naval officer be there any concern display if it be thick weather say lieutenant bradbury sum up a discussion they be go to have some trouble on they hand out there chapter xxii the white peril what be that no not that schooner below there -- i mean that sort of whitish drift -- it look like cotton -- on the horizon jess lean forward and address jimsy you have get I guess rejoin that slangy young person ask peggy no i do not want to bother she now she be get she hand full i fancy the _ golden butterfly _ be swing steadily onward above a sparkling sea the slight haze perceptible from the land be not noticeable to the air voyager below they a four-masted schooner be tack in the light wind closer in shore lay several grim look battleship and cruiser in they leaden color war paint they look menacing and bulldoggish far off a mere speck could be see a dim and indistinct object point upward from the cape like a finger they guess it be the light for which they be aim peggy 's last glance at the compass have confirm this guess jimsy look about he about a quarter of a mile off and slightly ahead be the _ cobweb _ the silvery aeroplane be rush through the atmosphere at a great rate but profit by mortlake 's experience fanning be evidently not speed the ` plane to its fullest capacity on the other side be a large red biplane fly steadily and keep about level with the _ golden butterfly _ far behind lag a monoplane the other contestant have drop out of the race they be so manifestly out of it that they driver do not care to continue a glance at the speedometer show peggy 's two passenger that they be reel off fifty-five mile a hour the _ cobweb _ be do slightly better we should round the light in a few minute now say jimsy scrutinize he watch anxiously will they report we ask jess yes there be a wireless rig up there the minute we round it on we return trip word will be flash back to the start point silently they sit count the minute roll by all at once jimsy notice that the air have become strangely damp and moist he look up he could not refrain a cry of astonishment as he do so the _ golden butterfly _ be envelop in a damp steamy sort of smother the _ cobweb _ have be blot out and so have the other aeroplane fog he exclaim what a bit of bad luck it be just as bad for the other peggy remind he have you get you course ask jess anxiously yes almost due east but in this dense mist it will be hard to come close enough to the lighthouse to be report without the danger of dash into it be you go to try for it of course be the brief reply peggy slow down the engine the _ golden butterfly _ now seem to be glide silently through lonely billow of white sea fog it be a uncanny feeling the occupant of the machine feel a chilling sense of complete isolation thanks to they barograph however they could judge they height above the sea good thing we have get it comment jimsy otherwise we might have a thrilling encounter with the topmast of some schooner i only wish we have some instrument to show we where the other aeroplane be say peggy it be hard to hear anything in this fog maybe it will clear off suggest jess hopefully not unless we get some wind opine jimsy queer how quick that wind drop and this smother come up nobody even hint at the deadly danger they be in but each occupant of the _ golden butterfly _ know it full well except for the compass they have no way of guide they flight and to turn about would have be to court disaster there be only one thing for it to keep on this peggy do grimly compress she lip hark exclaimed jimsy suddenly far below they they could hear a mournful sound it be waft up to they in fit and start ding-dong ding-dong a church bell cry jess we must be over land peggy the other shake she head that be a bell buoy i guess she say i wish he would tell we how to get out of here joke jimsy rather wearily who ask jess that bell boy never have one of jimsy 's joke fall so flat he mentally resolve not to attempt another one presently he look at he watch almost eleven he say we must have pass the light by this time i do not know say peggy helplessly if only the chart mark that bell buoy -- but it do not she again scrutinize the chart pin before she on the sloping slab design for such purpose but no bell buoy be mark on it as be located anywhere near where they estimate they must be drift drift however be not quite the correct word a aeroplane can not drift its life depend upon its motion the instant it stop or decrease speed beyond a certain point in that same instant it must fall to the earth this fact be what make the position of the young sky cruiser particularly dangerous although the gauge show that they have plenty of gasoline the supply -- even with the use of the auxiliary tank -- would not hold out indefinitely if the fog do not lift or they do not land sooner or later they must face disaster worse still they be -- or believe they be navigate above the sea have the _ golden butterfly _ be fit with pontoon like some of the glen curtiss machine this would not have be so alarming but a descent into the ocean would inevitably mean a speedy death by drown suddenly voice strike through the smother all about they they seem to come from below it be thick as pea soup captain aye aye i 'll be glad when we be out of it i kin tell yer this bay 's a bad place ter be in er fog a ship cry jimsy quick peggy he almost yell the next instant set you rise lever the girl swiftly manipulate the machinery that send the _ golden butterfly _ on a upward course but it be only just in time that this maneuver be carry out all of they have a glimpse for a instant of the gilded ball on the main-mast head of the vessel beneath they for a instant peggy 's watchful eye have be deflect from the height gauge and she have allow the _ golden butterfly _ to drop almost on the top of some coast vessel 's mast the danger over they could not help laugh at the whimsical adventure just to think how utterly unconscious those fellow be of the fact that three human being be hover right above they and listen to every word of they conversation chuckle jimsy be not it queer a little while later a steamer 's whistle boom through the fog beneath they but as the altitude register show five hundred foot they do not bother about it at all event we know we be still above the water and not in danger of collide with any church steeple say jess and she find consolation in the thought have you any idea at all as to the direction of the light peggy inquire jimsy at length i -- i really do not know confess peggy with a gulp everything 's mix up it be so thick i can not tell anything and i be deathly afraid of run into the lighthouse by mistake then for goodness sake give it a wide berth cry jimsy if we keep on cruise about for a while we 'll be bind to land somewhere anyhow we have get lot of gasoline that be one comfort it be indeed in the steady hum of they powerful motor the young aviator find consolation in that lonely ride through the billow fog-bank at all event there be no sign of a falter or skip there if only we could get some wind sigh jess might as well wish for the moon say jimsy the air be as still as it use to be at noon out on the desert what a contrast between the big alkali and this cry jess half hysterically the strain of the white drift fog be begin to tell upon she jimsy look at she sharply look here sis he begin and be go on when a sharp cry from peggy arrest he at the same instant the _ golden butterfly _ swerve sharply swing over on she beam-end almost right in front of they for one dreadful instant there loom the outline of another aeroplane the next instant it be go but the picture of the deadly peril its outline exaggerate by the mist be photograph in the mind of every one of they we must land somewhere soon say peggy in rather a faint voice i do not think i could stand many shock like that another inch and -- she do not complete the sentence she two listener do not require she to it do not take a vivid imagination to have picture the result of that other inch chapter xxiii out of the cloud ten minute or so later a puff of wind blow the fold of fog apart for a brief instant beneath they peggy could see a sandy beach and some scrubby-looking brush like a flash she take advantage of the momentarily reveal opportunity the _ golden butterfly _ under she guidance sink swiftly ground a few seconds later into a bed of soft sand it be like lighting on a pillow of down so gently have the glide to earth be make shut off the engine peggy take hold of jimsy 's outstretched arm and follow by jess she jump lightly out upon the sand the roar of the surf as the big swell roll upon the beach be in they ear a wholesome stinging tang of salt in they nostril i wonder where on earth we have land say jimsy look about he perhaps this be some enchanted land and we be to face new peril -- dragon or something well gallant knight laugh jess in the highest spirit to be back on the firm ground again -- even if it be only shift sand -- we trust to you and by my troth exclaim the mercurial jimsy ye shall not be disappoint in I fair damsel hullo a adventure already hark through the smother a dull sound be bear to they ear a sound that come in muffle but rhythmic thump at interval it pause but then be resume again somebody chop wood exclaim peggy recognize the sound that be just what it be if i ever wield a axe in my life agree jimsy now logic tell we that a axe can not work itself therefore somebody must be use it where there be human life there be -- or ought to be -- food how about it girl be you hungry hungry i could eat anything declare jess i be almost as bad laugh peggy well say jimsy as there be no sign of the fog lifting yet awhile what be the matter with we start out to find the wood-chopper and see if he have anything to eat jimsy you be a genius cry jess that be what all my friend tell I rejoin the modest youth they set off over rough sand dune overgrow with coarse grass in the direction of the sound of the axe the sand be loose and they foot sink ankle deep in it but they plod along pluckily all at once just as if a curtain have be draw the outline of a rough shanty appear in front of they it be a tumble-down sort of a place seemingly make of driftwood and old sack and bit of canvas from a rusty iron stove-pipe on top a feeble column of blue smoke be ascend the noise of chop have cease on they approach and as they stand hesitate a strange figure suddenly appear round the corner of the wretched rookery of a place the man who stand face they a startled look in he light blue eye be apparently about middle age he wear a full beard of a golden brown color and be barefoot and hatless he clothes consist of a tattered shirt and a pair of coarse canvas trousers well shiver my toplight he cry as he eye fall on the trio whar under ther sun do you come from drop from ther cloud that be just what we do say the debonnaire jimsy as the girl draw back rather affright at the weird look figure and he queer wild way of talk what be that do not try to fool with I young feller i be not as crazy as i reckon i look there be a certain dignity about the man when he speak that despite he ragged clothing and miserable habitation be impressive no it be really so jimsy hasten to assure he we -- we come in a aeroplane you know well now say the man scratch he head i reckon that be the first of they contrivance to reach lose brig island lose brig island echo jess in a alarmed tone be this a island if the geography book still define a island as a body of land surround by water it be rejoin the man with a smile be we far from cape charle ask peggy eagerly why no not more than six mile to the north but what under ther sun air you young folk in you fine clothes a-doin ' out here peggy hastily explain and the man say that he have see some reference to the come contest in a stray paper the light-keeper have give he the last time he pass the lighthouse in a small boat he keep be the island inhabit inquire jimsy we would like to get something to eat if there be a hotel or -- the man of the island burst into a laugh not a rough guffaw but a laugh of genuine amusement i guess i be the only hotel keeper on the island he say and my guest be sea gull and once in a while a turtle but if you do not mind eat some fish and potato you be welcome to what i have i be sure that be awfully good of you say peggy warmly and we love fish well come on in and sit down this fog will not last forever i be chop wood to get dinner when i hear you come over the sand i do not often have visitor so you 'll have to rough it so say the strange lone island dweller lead they into he hut it be rough inside but scrupulously clean some attempt have be make to beautify it by hang up on the wall shell and curiosity of the beach here and there too be panel of rare wood which the island-dweller explain have come from the cabin of wreck ship a big cat he only companion lay beside the fire and blink at the visitor as if they be a everyday occurrence chair fashion out of barrel and box stand about some of they cushion after a fashion with sack stuff with dry sea weed sit down say they host hospitably be not much to boast of in the way of furniture but it be the best i can do can not expect to find a waldorf hotel on lose brig island you have be in new york then exclaim peggy strike by the reference the man 's face undergo a transformation once many year ago he say but i never like to talk about it why not blunder the tactless jimsy because a wrong -- a very great wrong -- be do to I there say the man slowly without another word he rise and leave the hut none of the visitor dare to speak to he so black have he face grow at the recollection call up by peggy 's unlucky remark after a absence of some moment he come back he carry a string of clean fish in one hand and a tin measure of potato in the other in the interval that have elapse he seem to have recover he equanimity well here 's dinner he announce in a cheery voice it be not much to boast of but hunger 's the best sauce sit on a upturned box he start to peel potato and presently put they on the fire in a rough iron pot when they be almost do a fact which he ascertain by prod they with a clean sliver of wood he set the fish in a frying pan or spider and the appetizing aroma of the meal presently fill the lowly hut on a table form of big plank once the hull of some wreck schooner lay on rough trestle they eat what peggy afterward declare be one of the most enjoyable dinner of she life they host have at one time of he life be a sailor it would seem at any rate he have a fund of anecdote of the sea and its peril that hold they enthral every now and again through the open door peggy cast a glance outside but the fog still hang thick suddenly in the midst of they meal footstep sound and voice come to they ear hullo more visitor exclaim the man of the island start to he foot this be a day of event with a vengeance who can be come now the footstep have draw close now and a voice could be hear say : what a rickety tumble-down old place i wonder what kind of savage life here fan harding gasp peggy as another voice strike in a voice she instantly know as regina mortlake 's -lrb- illustration : the next minute the man of the island usher in he two new guest -rrb- oh what a dreadful place why will not this miserable fog lift i 'll be dead before we get back to the hotel the man of the island have hasten hospitably out to welcome the newcomer peggy jess and jimsy exchange glance the prospect of spend the afternoon maroon on a island with fan harding and regina mortlake be not alluring but there be no escape the next minute the man of the island usher in he two new guest what you here say fanning in a ungracious tone while regina mortlake more skilled at disguise she feeling exclaim : oh how perfectly wonderful that we should both have land on the same island it be not from choice grumble fanning in a perfectly audible tone jimsy flush a dark dangerous flush jess tell I not to punch that chap he mutter to he sister i certainly do tell you not to whisper jess emphatically the man of the island look on wonderingly do you come in a aeroplane too he ask fan in the manner of a man prepare to hear any marvel yes we have the race win too but this fog have delay we what can you give we to eat i can pay for it say fanning in a loud rude tone i do not take pay say the hut-dweller in a quiet tone that ought to have cause fan to redden with shame but if you be hungry i can cook some more fish there be plenty of potato leave they 'll be very nice i be sure regina have the grace to say but fan mumble something about pauper 's food but nevertheless he eat as heartily as jimsy himself when the food be put on the rough table it be hard work try to be pleasant to the two young people who have so unexpectedly come into they midst and the conversation languish and go on by fit and start hullo the fog 's lifting cry fanning suddenly i be off come on regina the girl rise and as she do so the trio from the prescott machine notice the island dweller 's eye fix on she in a curious way pardon I he say but be you name regina the girl look at he in a half-startled way while peggy as she say afterward feel as if she be watch a drama yes she say why because say the island dweller slowly because i once know someone call regina who be very dear to I come on call fan from outside we have get to win this race back the girl linger hesitatingly a instant and the next moment be go the fog be lift say peggy we must be go too come along jess come on jimsy we do not want to let the mortlake craft beat we at the eleventh hour what name be that you just mention ask the man of the island quickly he be bend forward eagerly as if to catch the answer do you mean mortlake yes that be the name what of he do you know he the man 's eye gleam brightly he seem to be much excited peggy answer he calmly although she feel as if some sort of a life tragedy be work out to swift conclusion of course mr eugene mortlake be the man who be manufacture the mortlake aeroplane he be we chief rival that be the reason we must hurry off why do they the man nod he head in the direction in which fanning and regina have vanish do they come in a mortlake aeroplane yes say peggy do not you know that girl be mr mortlake 's daughter regina mortlake the man give a terrible cry and reel backward jimsy step forward quickly and catch he for a instant they think they host be go to swoon but he quickly recover good heaven he cry eugene mortlake be here close at hand he be in hampton -- why i must see he as soon as possible no i can explain nothing now but i must see he the man 's manner show that he be terribly in earnest he seem almost carry away by excitement outside come suddenly a whir sound fanning be start he engine exclaim jimsy we must hurry will you do something for I -- will you aid a miserable outcast to right a great wrong plead the ragged man who face they what can we do for you ask jimsy take I back to hampton in you aeroplane i must see mortlake at once it be imperative i tell you see i be not poor although i appear so in two stride the man have cross the room and lift a board in the floor he draw forth bag after bag the seam of some of they be rotten under the sudden strain they break and stream of gold coin trickle out upon the floor year ago when i be first a exile here say the man a spanish ship come ashore one stormy night not a soul of she crew be save i find this money in the wreck i will give you half of it if you will take I to hampton with you the other half i must keep till -- till i learn from mortlake 's lip the secret he hold put you money back say jimsy quietly after a telegraphic exchange of look with peggy we 'll take you to hampton but hurry fifteen minute later a golden-hued aeroplane flash past the cape charle light the announcer post there instantly send in a wireless flash to hampton number six have just pass two minute behind number five -lrb- the _ silver cobweb _ -rrb- four person on board mortlake be among the crowd that read the bulletin which be instantly post upon the field outside hampton i wonder who the fourth can be he think little guess that through the air fate be wing its way toward he anyway he add to himself the next instant the _ mortlake _ be lead now if only -- but what be that roar at first a sullen boom gradually deepen into the excited skirling cheer of a vast throng mortlake look round startle out of the distance two tiny dot momentarily grow larger like homing bird have come into view hark what be that the crowd be shout those with field glass throw the cry out first and then come a mighty roar as it be catch up by hundred of throat the nameless the nameless win mortlake pale and catch at a post erect to hold up a telephone line he gaze at the oncoming aeroplane there be three of they now but one be far behind labor slowly but the first be unquestionably the _ golden butterfly _ he could catch the yellow glint of she wing and that second craft -- its silvery sheen betray it -- be the mortlake _ cobweb _ as roy have call it come on come on shout mortlake uselessly as he know what be the matter with you but alas the _ cobweb _ do not come on some three or four minute after the _ golden butterfly _ have alight and be swallow up in a surge yell throng of enthusiasm-crazed aero fan the _ cobweb _ flutter wearily to the ground unnoticed almost amid the excitement over the _ golden butterfly 's _ feat mortlake rage old mr harding almost weep and fan sulkily explain that it be not he fault the cylinder have overheate again but not all of this could wipe out those figure that have just be put up on the board which proclaim a victory for the prescott aeroplane by a margin of three and twenty-one hundredth minute chapter xxiv friend and foe -- conclusion the winning of the sky cruise as the newspaper have dub it be the talk of hampton that night not a small part of the zest with which it be discuss be cause by the fact that a young girl have drive the machine through its daring dash the wire from new york baltimore philadelphium boston and richmond be keep hot with instruction from editor to they representative demand interview with the girl aviator but to the chagrin of the newspaper representative after see they machine house the party have vanish this on investigation be not as mysterious as it have at first appear there be a small door in the back of the nameless 's shed and at this door there have be wait for some moment before the conclusion of the race a big automobile in it be seat a bronzed man with broad shoulder and a alert wideawake expression and a boy whose foot be prop up on a extemporize contrivance affix to the seat while the crowd have hover about the front of the shed await the reappearance of the girl aviator whose feat have cause such a furore this boy have limp from the machine assist by he stalwart companion and have enter the shed by the rear door it would have astonish the crowd and delight the reporter in search of a story if they could have see peggy rush at the youth and with a wild cry of : roy you darling throw she arm about he neck mr bell for he be the stalwart personage stand aside with a look of warm satisfaction as peggy 's turn over jess and jimsy come forward what a joyous reunion that be i will leave you to imagine then come mr bell 's story of he telegram to sandy beach to the judge who be a friend of he the message have announce that he have obtain complete confession from both joey eccle and the unsavory slim roy 's release from bail and suspicion at once follow eccle have own up to he part in the mischief that have be work against the young prescott frankly and without reserve he have swear to a statement before a local attorney in which he admit lose the bill with the mark upon it on the night he have aid in decoy roy to the old house he assistant have be a cast off workman of the mortlake plant of whose whereabouts joey say he be now ignorant then have come slim 's turn sullenly but with the alternative of prison stare he in the face he have admit to impersonate the foreign spy the part of roy on that eventful night have be play by : guess whom say mr bell look round they all shake they head i 'll tell you about that part of it later say mr bell there be still one or two thing to be clear up in that connection but he continue palmer confess that it be mortlake who rob the farm-house safe the object being of course not so much the money as a chance to put roy out of the race contest it have be a record of vile plot all the way through say the westerner warmly but the toil be close in about mortlake & co of course my first step be to take the fellow before a attorney -- luckily i know one in hampton and he as it happen be a friend of the sandy beach judge we have to move quickly but thanks to the telegraph wire and fast train i get roy release from bail and suspicion and here in time to greet you they could only look they gratitude just as the strain be become almost too taut mr bell who have notice it break the tension let 's sneak out of the back door he say and all go to some quiet place to dine hullo who be this he exclaim as the tattered figure of the man of the island appear i be what be leave of budd pierce jim bell say the man in he queer tired tone budd pierce exclaim the mining man fall back a step no -- but yes now i look again -- it be but man what have happen to you what be you do here it be a long story say the ragged man while the younger member of the party look on in astonishment but i can tell you that gene mortlake have reach the end of he tether i have hear all you say about he and my interest in he you know already i know that you be swindle out of you fortune by some man year ago and then
