life -- remainder of my life chapter i childhood and early education it seem proper that i should prefix to the follow biographical sketch some mention of the reason which have make I think it desirable that i should leave behind I such a memorial of so uneventful a life as mine i do not for a moment imagine that any part of what i have to relate can be interesting to the public as a narrative or as be connect with myself but i have think that in a age in which education and its improvement be the subject of more if not of profounder study than at any former period of english history it may be useful that there should be some record of a education which be unusual and remarkable and which whatever else it may have do have prove how much more than be commonly suppose may be teach and well teach in those early year which in the common mode of what be call instruction be little better than waste it have also seem to I that in a age of transition in opinion there may be somewhat both of interest and of benefit in note the successive phase of any mind which be always press forward equally ready to learn and to unlearn either from its own thought or from those of other but a motive which weigh more with I than either of these be a desire to make acknowledgment of the debt which my intellectual and moral development owe to other person some of they of recognize eminence other less known than they deserve to be and the one to whom most of all be due one whom the world have no opportunity of know the reader whom these thing do not interest have only himself to blame if he read farther and i do not desire any other indulgence from he than that of bearing in mind that for he these page be not write i be bear in london on the 20th of may 1806 and be the eldest son of jame mill the author of the _ history of british indium _ my father the son of a petty tradesman and -lrb- i believe -rrb- small farmer at northwater bridge in the county of angus be when a boy recommend by he ability to the notice of sir john stuart of fettercairn one of the baron of the exchequer in scotland and be in consequence send to the university of edinburgh at the expense of a fund establish by lady jane stuart -lrb- the wife of sir john stuart -rrb- and some other lady for educate young man for the scottish church he there go through the usual course of study and be license as a preacher but never follow the profession have satisfy himself that he could not believe the doctrine of that or any other church for a few year he be a private tutor in various family in scotland among other that of the marquis of tweeddale but end by take up he residence in london and devote himself to authorship nor have he any other means of support until 1819 when he obtain a appointment in the indium house in this period of my father 's life there be two thing which it be impossible not to be strike with : one of they unfortunately a very common circumstance the other a most uncommon one the first be that in he position with no resource but the precarious one of write in periodical he marry and have a large family conduct than which nothing could be more oppose both as a matter of good sense and of duty to the opinion which at least at a later period of life he strenuously uphold the other circumstance be the extraordinary energy which be require to lead the life he lead with the disadvantage under which he labor from the first and with those which he bring upon himself by he marriage it would have be no small thing have he do no more than to support himself and he family during so many year by write without ever be in debt or in any pecuniary difficulty hold as he do opinion both in politics and in religion which be more odious to all person of influence and to the common run of prosperous englishman in that generation than either before or since and be not only a man whom nothing would have induce to write against he conviction but one who invariably throw into everything he write as much of he conviction as he think the circumstance would in any way permit : be it must also be say one who never do anything negligently never undertake any task literary or other on which he do not conscientiously bestow all the labor necessary for perform it adequately but he with these burden on he plan commence and complete the _ history of indium _ and this in the course of about ten year a shorter time than have be occupy -lrb- even by writer who have no other employment -rrb- in the production of almost any other historical work of equal bulk and of anything approach to the same amount of reading and research and to this be to be add that during the whole period a considerable part of almost every day be employ in the instruction of he child : in the case of one of whom myself he exert a amount of labor care and perseverance rarely if ever employ for a similar purpose in endeavor to give accord to he own conception the highest order of intellectual education a man who in he own practice so vigorously act up to the principle of lose no time be likely to adhere to the same rule in the instruction of he pupil i have no remembrance of the time when i begin to learn greek i have be tell that it be when i be three year old my earliest recollection on the subject be that of commit to memory what my father term vocable be list of common greek word with they signification in english which he write out for I on card of grammar until some year later i learn no more than the inflection of the noun and verb but after a course of vocable proceed at once to translation and i faintly remember go through aesop 's _ fable _ the first greek book which i read the _ anabasis _ which i remember better be the second i learn no latin until my eighth year at that time i have read under my father 's tuition a number of greek prose author among whom i remember the whole of herodotus and of xenophon 's _ cyropaedium _ and _ memorial of socrate _ some of the life of the philosopher by diogene laertius part of lucian and isocrate ad demonicum and ad nicoclem i also read in 1813 the first six dialogue -lrb- in the common arrangement -rrb- of plato from the euthyphron to the theoctetus inclusive : which last dialogue i venture to think would have be better omit as it be totally impossible i should understand it but my father in all he teaching demand of I not only the utmost that i could do but much that i could by no possibility have do what he be himself willing to undergo for the sake of my instruction may be judge from the fact that i go through the whole process of prepare my greek lesson in the same room and at the same table at which he be write : and as in those day greek and english lexicon be not and i could make no more use of a greek and latin lexicon than could be make without have yet begin to learn latin i be force to have recourse to he for the meaning of every word which i do not know this incessant interruption he one of the most impatient of man submit to and write under that interruption several volume of he history and all else that he have to write during those year the only thing besides greek that i learn as a lesson in this part of my childhood be arithmetic : this also my father teach I : it be the task of the evening and i well remember its disagreeableness but the lesson be only a part of the daily instruction i receive much of it consist in the book i read by myself and my father 's discourse to I chiefly during we walk from 1810 to the end of 1813 we be live in newington green then a almost rustic neighborhood my father 's health require considerable and constant exercise and he walk habitually before breakfast generally in the green lane towards hornsey in these walk i always accompany he and with my earliest recollection of green field and wild flower be mingle that of the account i give he daily of what i have read the day before to the best of my remembrance this be a voluntary rather than a prescribe exercise i make note on slip of paper while reading and from these in the morning walk i tell the story to he for the book be chiefly history of which i read in this manner a great number : robertson 's history hume gibbon but my greatest delight then and for long afterwards be watson 's _ philip the second and third _ the heroic defense of the knight of malta against the turk and of the revolted province of the netherland against spain excite in I a intense and lasting interest next to watson my favorite historical reading be hooke 's _ history of rome _ of greece i have see at that time no regular history except school abridgment and the last two or three volume of a translation of rollin 's _ ancient history _ begin with philip of macedon but i read with great delight langhorne 's translation of plutarch in english history beyond the time at which hume leaf off i remember read burnet 's _ history of he own time _ though i care little for anything in it except the war and battle and the historical part of the _ annual register _ from the begin to about 1788 where the volume my father borrow for I from mr bentham leave off i feel a lively interest in frederic of prussium during he difficulty and in paolus the corsican patriot but when i come to the american war i take my part like a child as i be -lrb- until set right by my father -rrb- on the wrong side because it be call the english side in these frequent talk about the book i read he use as opportunity offer to give I explanation and idea respect civilization government morality mental cultivation which he require I afterwards to restate to he in my own word he also make I read and give he a verbal account of many book which would not have interested I sufficiently to induce I to read they of myself : among other 's millar 's _ historical view of the english government _ a book of great merit for its time and which he highly value mosheim 's _ ecclesiastical history _ mccrie 's _ life of john knox _ and even sewell and rutty 's history of the quaker he be fond of put into my hand book which exhibit man of energy and resource in unusual circumstance struggle against difficulty and overcome they : of such work i remember beaver 's _ african memorandum _ and collin 's _ account of the first settlement of new south wale _ two book which i never wearied of reading be anson 's voyage so delightful to most young person and a collection -lrb- hawkesworth 's i believe -rrb- of _ voyage round the world _ in four volume begin with drake and end with cook and bougainville of child 's book any more than of plaything i have scarcely any except a occasional gift from a relation or acquaintance : among those i have _ robinson crusoe _ be pre-eminent and continue to delight I through all my boyhood it be no part however of my father 's system to exclude book of amusement though he allow they very sparingly of such book he possess at that time next to none but he borrow several for I those which i remember be the _ arabian night _ cazotte 's _ arabian tale _ _ don quixote _ miss edgeworth 's _ popular tale _ and a book of some reputation in its day brooke 's _ fool of quality _ in my eighth year i commence learn latin in conjunction with a younger sister to whom i teach it as i go on and who afterwards repeat the lesson to my father from this time other sister and brother be successively add as pupil a considerable part of my day 's work consist of this preparatory teaching it be a part which i greatly dislike the more so as i be hold responsible for the lesson of my pupil in almost as full a sense as for my own : i however derive from this discipline the great advantage of learn more thoroughly and retain more lastingly the thing which i be set to teach : perhaps too the practice it afford in explain difficulty to other may even at that age have be useful in other respects the experience of my boyhood be not favourable to the plan of teaching child by means of one another the teaching i be sure be very inefficient as teaching and i well know that the relation between teacher and teach be not a good moral discipline to either i go in this manner through the latin grammar and a considerable part of cornelius nepo and caesar 's commentary but afterwards add to the superintendence of these lesson much longer one of my own in the same year in which i begin latin i make my first commencement in the greek poet with the iliad after i have make some progress in this my father put pope 's translation into my hand it be the first english verse i have care to read and it become one of the book in which for many year i most delighted : i think i must have read it from twenty to thirty time through i should not have think it worth while to mention a taste apparently so natural to boyhood if i have not as i think observe that the keen enjoyment of this brilliant specimen of narrative and versification be not so universal with boy as i should have expect both _ a priori _ and from my individual experience soon after this time i commence euclid and somewhat later algebra still under my father 's tuition from my eighth to my twelfth year the latin book which i remember reading be the _ bucolic _ of virgil and the first six book of the aeneid all horace except the epode the fable of phaedrus the first five book of livy -lrb- to which from my love of the subject i voluntarily add in my hour of leisure the remainder of the first decade -rrb- all sallust a considerable part of ovid 's _ metamorphose _ some play of terence two or three book of lucretius several of the oration of cicero and of he writings on oratory also he letter to atticus my father take the trouble to translate to I from the french the historical explanation in mingault 's note in greek i read the _ iliad _ and _ odyssey _ through one or two play of sophocle euripide and aristophane though by these i profit little all thucydide the _ hellenic _ of xenophon a great part of demosthene aeschine and lysias theocritus anacreon part of the _ anthology _ a little of dionysius several book of polybius and lastly aristotle 's _ rhetoric _ which as the first expressly scientific treatise on any moral or psychological subject which i have read and contain many of the best observation of the ancient on human nature and life my father make I study with peculiar care and throw the matter of it into synoptic table during the same year i learn elementary geometry and algebra thoroughly the differential calculus and other portion of the higher mathematics far from thoroughly : for my father not have keep up this part of he early acquire knowledge could not spare time to qualify himself for remove my difficulty and leave I to deal with they with little other aid than that of book : while i be continually incur he displeasure by my inability to solve difficult problem for which he do not see that i have not the necessary previous knowledge as to my private reading i can only speak of what i remember history continue to be my strongest predilection and most of all ancient history mitford 's greece i read continually my father have put I on my guard against the tory prejudice of this writer and he perversion of fact for the whitewashing of despot and blacken of popular institution these point he discourse on exemplify they from the greek orator and historian with such effect that in reading mitford my sympathy be always on the contrary side to those of the author and i could to some extent have argue the point against he : yet this do not diminish the ever new pleasure with which i read the book roman history both in my old favorite hooke and in ferguson continue to delight I a book which in spite of what be call the dryness of its style i take great pleasure in be the _ ancient universal history _ through the incessant reading of which i have my head full of historical detail concern the obscurest ancient people while about modern history except detach passage such as the dutch war of independence i know and care comparatively little a voluntary exercise to which throughout my boyhood i be much addict be what i call write history i successively compose a roman history pick out of hooke and a abridgment of the _ ancient universal history _ a history of holland from my favorite watson and from a anonymous compilation and in my eleventh and twelfth year i occupy myself with write what i flattered myself be something serious this be no less than a history of the roman government compile -lrb- with the assistance of hooke -rrb- from livy and dionysius : of which i write as much as would have make a octavo volume extend to the epoch of the licinian law it be in fact a account of the struggle between the patrician and plebeian which now engross all the interest in my mind which i have previously feel in the mere war and conquest of the roman i discuss all the constitutional point as they arise : though quite ignorant of niebuhr 's research i by such light as my father have give I vindicate the agrarian law on the evidence of livy and uphold to the best of my ability the roman democratic party a few year later in my contempt of my childish effort i destroy all these papers not then anticipate that i could ever feel any curiosity about my first attempt at write and reasoning my father encourage I in this useful amusement though as i think judiciously he never ask to see what i write so that i do not feel that in write it i be accountable to any one nor have the chill sensation of be under a critical eye but though these exercise in history be never a compulsory lesson there be another kind of composition which be so namely write verse and it be one of the most disagreeable of my task greek and latin verse i do not write nor learn the prosody of those language my father think this not worth the time it require contented himself with make I read aloud to he and correct false quantity i never compose at all in greek even in prose and but little in latin not that my father could be indifferent to the value of this practice in give a thorough knowledge of these language but because there really be not time for it the verse i be require to write be english when i first read pope 's homer i ambitiously attempt to compose something of the same kind and achieve as much as one book of a continuation of the _ iliad _ there probably the spontaneous prompting of my poetical ambition would have stop but the exercise begin from choice be continue by command conformably to my father 's usual practice of explain to I as far as possible the reason for what he require I to do he give I for this as i well remember two reason highly characteristic of he : one be that some thing could be express better and more forcibly in verse than in prose : this he say be a real advantage the other be that people in general attach more value to verse than it deserve and the power of write it be on this account worth acquire he generally leave I to choose my own subject which as far as i remember be mostly address to some mythological personage or allegorical abstraction but he make I translate into english verse many of horace 's shorter poem : i also remember he give I thomson 's _ winter _ to read and afterwards make I attempt -lrb- without book -rrb- to write something myself on the same subject the verse i write be of course the merest rubbish nor do i ever attain any facility of versification but the practice may have be useful in make it easier for I at a later period to acquire readiness of expression -lrb- 1 -rrb- i have read up to this time very little english poetry shakspeare my father have put into my hand chiefly for the sake of the historical play from which however i go on to the other my father never be a great admirer of shakspeare the english idolatry of whom he use to attack with some severity he care little for any english poetry except milton -lrb- for whom he have the highest admiration -rrb- goldsmith burn and gray 's _ bard _ which he prefer to he elegy : perhaps i may add cowper and beattie he have some value for spenser and i remember he read to I -lrb- unlike he usual practice of make I read to he -rrb- the first book of the _ fairie queene _ but i take little pleasure in it the poetry of the present century he see scarcely any merit in and i hardly become acquaint with any of it till i be grow up to manhood except the metrical romance of walter scott which i read at he recommendation and be intensely delighted with as i always be with animated narrative dryden 's poem be among my father 's book and many of these he make I read but i never care for any of they except _ alexander 's feast _ which as well as many of the song in walter scott i use to sing internally to a music of my own : to some of the latter indeed i go so far as to compose air which i still remember cowper 's short poem i read with some pleasure but never get far into the longer one and nothing in the two volume interested I like the prose account of he three hare in my thirteenth year i meet with campbell 's poem among which _ lochiel _ _ hohenlinden _ _ the exile of erin _ and some other give I sensation i have never before experience from poetry here too i make nothing of the longer poem except the striking opening of _ gertrude of wyome _ which long keep its place in my feeling as the perfection of pathos during this part of my childhood one of my greatest amusement be experimental science in the theoretical however not the practical sense of the word not try experiment -- a kind of discipline which i have often regret not have have -- nor even see but merely read about they i never remember be so wrapt up in any book as i be in joyce 's _ scientific dialogue _ and i be rather recalcitrant to my father 's criticism of the bad reasoning respect the first principle of physics which abound in the early part of that work i devour treatise on chemistry especially that of my father 's early friend and schoolfellow dr thomson for year before i attend a lecture or see a experiment from about the age of twelve i enter into another and more advanced stage in my course of instruction in which the main object be no longer the aid and appliance of thought but the thought themselves this commence with logic in which i begin at once with the _ organon _ and read it to the analytic inclusive but profit little by the posterior analytic which belong to a branch of speculation i be not yet ripe for contemporaneously with the _ organon _ my father make I read the whole or part of several of the latin treatise on the scholastic logic give each day to he in we walk a minute account of what i have read and answer he numerous and most search question after this i go in a similar manner through the _ computatio sive logica _ of hobbe a work of a much higher order of thought than the book of the school logician and which he estimate very highly in my own opinion beyond its merit great as these be it be he invariable practice whatever study he exact from I to make I as far as possible understand and feel the utility of they : and this he deem peculiarly fitting in the case of the syllogistic logic the usefulness of which have be impugn by so many writer of authority i well remember how and in what particular walk in the neighborhood of bagshot heath -lrb- where we be on a visit to he old friend mr wallace then one of the mathematical professor at sandhurst -rrb- he first attempt by question to make I think on the subject and frame some conception of what constitute the utility of the syllogistic logic and when i have fail in this to make I understand it by explanation the explanation do not make the matter at all clear to I at the time but they be not therefore useless they remain as a nucleus for my observation and reflection to crystallize upon the import of he general remark be interpret to I by the particular instance which come under my notice afterwards my own consciousness and experience ultimately lead I to appreciate quite as highly as he do the value of a early practical familiarity with the school logic i know of nothing in my education to which i think myself more indebted for whatever capacity of think i have attain the first intellectual operation in which i arrive at any proficiency be dissect a bad argument and finding in what part the fallacy lay : and though whatever capacity of this sort i attain be due to the fact that it be a intellectual exercise in which i be most perseveringly drill by my father yet it be also true that the school logic and the mental habit acquire in study it be among the principal instrument of this drilling i be persuade that nothing in modern education tend so much when properly use to form exact thinker who attach a precise meaning to word and proposition and be not impose on by vague loose or ambiguous term the boast influence of mathematical study be nothing to it for in mathematical process none of the real difficulty of correct ratiocination occur it be also a study peculiarly adapt to a early stage in the education of philosophical student since it do not presuppose the slow process of acquire by experience and reflection valuable thought of they own they may become capable of disentangle the intricacy of confused and self-contradictory thought before they own thinking faculty be much advance a power which for want of some such discipline many otherwise able man altogether lack and when they have to answer opponent only endeavor by such argument as they can command to support the opposite conclusion scarcely even attempt to confute the reasoning of they antagonist and therefore at the utmost leave the question as far as it depend on argument a balanced one during this time the latin and greek book which i continue to read with my father be chiefly such as be worth study not for the language merely but also for the thought this include much of the orator and especially demosthene some of whose principal oration i read several time over and write out by way of exercise a full analysis of they my father 's comment on these oration when i read they to he be very instructive to I he not only draw my attention to the insight they afford into athenian institution and the principle of legislation and government which they often illustrate but point out the skill and art of the orator -- how everything important to he purpose be say at the exact moment when he have bring the mind of he audience into the state most fit to receive it how he make steal into they mind gradually and by insinuation thought which if express in a more direct manner would have rouse they opposition most of these reflection be beyond my capacity of full comprehension at the time but they leave seed behind which germinate in due season at this time i also read the whole of tacitus juvenal and quintilian the latter owing to he obscure style and to the scholastic detail of which many part of he treatise be make up be little read and seldom sufficiently appreciate he book be a kind of encyclopedia of the thought of the ancient on the whole field of education and culture and i have retain through life many valuable idea which i can distinctly trace to my reading of he even at that early age it be at this period that i read for the first time some of the most important dialogue of plato in particular the _ gorgia _ the _ protagoras _ and the _ republic _ there be no author to whom my father think himself more indebted for he own mental culture than plato or whom he more frequently recommend to young student i can bear similar testimony in regard to myself the socratic method of which the platonic dialogue be the chief example be unsurpassed as a discipline for correct the error and clear up the confusion incident to the _ intellectus sibus permissus _ the understanding which have make up all its bundle of association under the guidance of popular phraseology the close search _ elenchus _ by which the man of vague generality be constrain either to express he mean to himself in definite term or to confess that he do not know what he be talk about the perpetual testing of all general statement by particular instance the siege in form which be lay to the meaning of large abstract term by fix upon some still larger class-name which include that and more and divide down to the thing seek -- mark out its limit and definition by a series of accurately draw distinction between it and each of the cognate object which be successively part off from it -- all this as a education for precise thinking be inestimable and all this even at that age take such hold of I that it become part of my own mind i have feel ever since that the title of platonist belong by far better right to those who have be nourish in and have endeavor to practice plato 's mode of investigation than to those who be distinguish only by the adoption of certain dogmatical conclusion draw mostly from the least intelligible of he work and which the character of he mind and writings make it uncertain whether he himself regard as anything more than poetic fancy or philosophic conjecture in go through plato and demosthene since i could now read these author as far as the language be concern with perfect ease i be not require to construe they sentence by sentence but to read they aloud to my father answer question when ask : but the particular attention which he pay to elocution -lrb- in which he own excellence be remarkable -rrb- make this reading aloud to he a most painful task of all thing which he require I to do there be none which i do so constantly ill or in which he so perpetually lose he temper with I he have think much on the principle of the art of reading especially the most neglect part of it the inflection of the voice or _ modulation _ as writer on elocution call it -lrb- in contrast with _ articulation _ on the one side and _ expression _ on the other -rrb- and have reduce it to rule ground on the logical analysis of a sentence these rule he strongly impressed upon I and take I severely to task for every violation of they : but i even then remark -lrb- though i do not venture to make the remark to he -rrb- that though he reproach I when i read a sentence ill and _ tell _ I how i ought to have read it he never by read it himself _ show _ I how it ought to be read a defect run through he otherwise admirable mode of instruction as it do through all he mode of thought be that of trust too much to the intelligibleness of the abstract when not embody in the concrete it be at a much later period of my youth when practise elocution by myself or with companion of my own age that i for the first time understand the object of he rule and see the psychological grounds of they at that time i and other follow out the subject into its ramification and could have compose a very useful treatise ground on my father 's principle he himself leave those principle and rule unwritten i regret that when my mind be full of the subject from systematic practice i do not put they and we improvement of they into a formal shape a book which contribute largely to my education in the best sense of the term be my father 's _ history of indium _ it be publish in the beginning of 1818 during the year previous while it be pass through the press i use to read the proof sheet to he or rather i read the manuscript to he while he correct the proof the number of new idea which i receive from this remarkable book and the impulse and stimulus as well as guidance give to my thought by its criticism and disquisition on society and civilization in the hindoo part on institution and the act of government in the english part make my early familiarity with it eminently useful to my subsequent progress and though i can perceive deficiency in it now as compare with a perfect standard i still think it if not the most one of the most instructive history ever write and one of the book from which most benefit may be derive by a mind in the course of make up its opinion the preface among the most characteristic of my father 's writings as well as the richest in material of thought give a picture which may be entirely depend on of the sentiment and expectation with which he write the history saturate as the book be with the opinion and mode of judgment of a democratic radicalism then regard as extreme and treat with a severity at that time most unusual the english constitution the english law and all party and class who possess any considerable influence in the country he may have expect reputation but certainly not advancement in life from its publication nor could he have suppose that it would raise up anything but enemy for he in powerful quarter : least of all could he have expect favor from the east indium company to whose commercial privilege he be unqualifiedly hostile and on the act of whose government he have make so many severe comment : though in various part of he book he bear a testimony in they favor which he feel to be they just due namely that no government have on the whole give so much proof to the extent of its light of good intention towards its subject and that if the act of any other government have the light of publicity as completely let in upon they they would in all probability still less bear scrutiny on learn however in the spring of 1819 about a year after the publication of the history that the east indium director desire to strengthen the part of they home establishment which be employ in carry on the correspondence with indium my father declare himself a candidate for that employment and to the credit of the director successfully he be appoint one of the assistant of the examiner of indium correspondence officer whose duty it be to prepare draft of despatch to india for consideration by the director in the principal department of administration in this office and in that of examiner which he subsequently attain the influence which he talent he reputation and he decision of character give he with superior who really desire the good government of indium enable he to a great extent to throw into he draft of despatch and to carry through the ordeal of the court of director and board of control without have they force much weaken he real opinion on indian subject in he history he have set forth for the first time many of the true principle of indian administration : and he despatch follow he history do more than have ever be do before to promote the improvement of indium and teach indian official to understand they business if a selection of they be publish they would i be convinced place he character as a practical statesman fully on a level with he eminence as a speculative writer this new employment of he time cause no relaxation in he attention to my education it be in this same year 1819 that he take I through a complete course of political economy he loved and intimate friend ricardo have shortly before publish the book which form so great a epoch in political economy a book which would never have be publish or write but for the entreaty and strong encouragement of my father for ricardo the most modest of man though firmly convince of the truth of he doctrine deem himself so little capable of do they justice in exposition and expression that he shrink from the idea of publicity the same friendly encouragement induce ricardo a year or two later to become a member of the house of common where during the remain year of he life unhappily cut short in the full vigor of he intellect he render so much service to he and my father 's opinion both on political economy and on other subject though ricardo 's great work be already in print no didactic treatise embody its doctrine in a manner fit for learner have yet appear my father therefore commence instruct I in the science by a sort of lecture which he deliver to I in we walk he expound each day a portion of the subject and i give he next day a write account of it which he make I rewrite over and over again until it be clear precise and tolerably complete in this manner i go through the whole extent of the science and the write outline of it which result from my daily _ compte rendu _ serve he afterwards as note from which to write he _ element of political economy _ after this i read ricardo give a account daily of what i read and discuss in the best manner i could the collateral point which offer themselves in we progress on money as the most intricate part of the subject he make I read in the same manner ricardo 's admirable pamphlet write during what be call the bullion controversy to these succeed adam smith and in this read it be one of my father 's main object to make I apply to smith 's more superficial view of political economy the superior light of ricardo and detect what be fallacious in smith 's argument or erroneous in any of he conclusion such a mode of instruction be excellently calculate to form a thinker but it require to be work by a thinker as close and vigorous as my father the path be a thorny one even to he and i be sure it be so to I notwithstanding the strong interest i take in the subject he be often and much beyond reason provoke by my failure in case where success could not have be expect but in the main he method be right and it succeed i do not believe that any scientific teaching ever be more thorough or better fit for train the faculty than the mode in which logic and political economy be teach to I by my father strive even in a exaggerated degree to call forth the activity of my faculty by make I find out everything for myself he give he explanation not before but after i have feel the full force of the difficulty and not only give I a accurate knowledge of these two great subject as far as they be then understand but make I a thinker on both i think for myself almost from the first and occasionally think differently from he though for a long time only on minor point and make he opinion the ultimate standard at a later period i even occasionally convinced he and alter he opinion on some point of detail : which i state to he honor not my own it at once exemplify he perfect candor and the real worth of he method of teaching at this point conclude what can properly be call my lesson : when i be about fourteen i leave england for more than a year and after my return though my study go on under my father 's general direction he be no longer my schoolmaster i shall therefore pause here and turn back to matter of a more general nature connect with the part of my life and education include in the precede reminiscence in the course of instruction which i have partially retrace the point most superficially apparent be the great effort to give during the year of childhood a amount of knowledge in what be consider the higher branch of education which be seldom acquire -lrb- if acquire at all -rrb- until the age of manhood the result of the experiment show the ease with which this may be do and place in a strong light the wretched waste of so many precious year as be spend in acquire the modicum of latin and greek commonly teach to schoolboy a waste which have lead so many educational reformer to entertain the ill-judged proposal of discard these language altogether from general education if i have be by nature extremely quick of apprehension or have possess a very accurate and retentive memory or be of a remarkably active and energetic character the trial would not be conclusive but in all these natural gift i be rather below than above par what i could do could assuredly be do by any boy or girl of average capacity and healthy physical constitution : and if i have accomplish anything i owe it among other fortunate circumstance to the fact that through the early training bestow on I by my father i start i may fairly say with a advantage of a quarter of a century over my contemporary there be one cardinal point in this training of which i have already give some indication and which more than anything else be the cause of whatever good it effect most boy or youth who have have much knowledge drill into they have they mental capacity not strengthen but overlay by it they be cram with mere fact and with the opinion or phrase of other people and these be accept as a substitute for the power to form opinion of they own and thus the son of eminent father who have spare no pain in they education so often grow up mere parroter of what they have learn incapable of use they mind except in the furrow trace for they mine however be not a education of cram my father never permit anything which i learn to degenerate into a mere exercise of memory he strive to make the understanding not only go along with every step of the teaching but if possible precede it anything which could be find out by think i never be tell until i have exhaust my effort to find it out for myself as far as i can trust my remembrance i acquit myself very lamely in this department my recollection of such matter be almost wholly of failure hardly ever of success it be true the failure be often in thing in which success in so early a stage of my progress be almost impossible i remember at some time in my thirteenth year on my happen to use the word idea he ask I what a idea be and express some displeasure at my ineffectual effort to define the word : i recollect also he indignation at my use the common expression that something be true in theory but require correction in practice and how after make I vainly strive to define the word theory he explain its meaning and show the fallacy of the vulgar form of speech which i have use leave I fully persuade that in be unable to give a correct definition of theory and in speaking of it as something which might be at variance with practice i have show unparalleled ignorance in this he seem and perhaps be very unreasonable but i think only in be angry at my failure a pupil from whom nothing be ever demand which he can not do never do all he can one of the evil most liable to attend on any sort of early proficiency and which often fatally blight its promise my father most anxiously guard against this be self-conceit he keep I with extreme vigilance out of the way of hearing myself praise or of be lead to make self-flattering comparison between myself and other from he own intercourse with I i could derive none but a very humble opinion of myself and the standard of comparison he always hold up to I be not what other people do but what a man could and ought to do he completely succeed in preserve I from the sort of influence he so much dreaded i be not at all aware that my attainment be anything unusual at my age if i accidentally have my attention draw to the fact that some other boy know less than myself -- which happen less often than might be imagine -- i conclude not that i know much but that he for some reason or other know little or that he knowledge be of a different kind from mine my state of mind be not humility but neither be it arrogance i never think of say to myself i be or i can do so and so i neither estimate myself highly nor lowly : i do not estimate myself at all if i think anything about myself it be that i be rather backward in my study since i always find myself so in comparison with what my father expect from I i assert this with confidence though it be not the impression of various person who see I in my childhood they as i have since find think I greatly and disagreeably self-conceited probably because i be disputatious and do not scruple to give direct contradiction to thing which i hear say i suppose i acquire this bad habit from have be encourage in a unusual degree to talk on matter beyond my age and with grown person while i never have inculcate on I the usual respect for they my father do not correct this ill-breeding and impertinence probably from not be aware of it for i be always too much in awe of he to be otherwise than extremely subdue and quiet in he presence yet with all this i have no notion of any superiority in myself and well be it for I that i have not i remember the very place in hyde park where in my fourteenth year on the eve of leave my father 's house for a long absence he tell I that i should find as i get acquaint with new people that i have be teach many thing which youth of my age do not commonly know and that many person would be dispose to talk to I of this and to compliment I upon it what other thing he say on this topic i remember very imperfectly but he wind up by say that whatever i know more than other could not be ascribe to any merit in I but to the very unusual advantage which have fall to my lot of have a father who be able to teach I and willing to give the necessary trouble and time that it be no matter of praise to I if i know more than those who have not have a similar advantage but the deepest disgrace to I if i do not i have a distinct remembrance that the suggestion thus for the first time make to I that i know more than other youth who be consider well educate be to I a piece of information to which as to all other thing which my father tell I i give implicit credence but which do not at all impress I as a personal matter i feel no disposition to glorify myself upon the circumstance that there be other person who do not know what i know nor have i ever flatter myself that my acquirement whatever they might be be any merit of mine : but now when my attention be call to the subject i feel that what my father have say respect my peculiar advantage be exactly the truth and common sense of the matter and it fixed my opinion and feeling from that time forward chapter ii moral influence in early youth my father 's character and opinion in my education as in that of everyone the moral influence which be so much more important than all other be also the most complicated and the most difficult to specify with any approach to completeness without attempt the hopeless task of detail the circumstance by which in this respect my early character may have be shape i shall confine myself to a few lead point which form a indispensable part of any true account of my education i be bring up from the first without any religious belief in the ordinary acceptation of the term my father educate in the creed of scotch presbyterianism have by he own study and reflection be early lead to reject not only the belief in revelation but the foundation of what be commonly call natural religion i have hear he say that the turn point of he mind on the subject be read butler 's _ analogy _ that work of which he always continue to speak with respect keep he as he say for some considerable time a believer in the divine authority of christianity by prove to he that whatever be the difficulty in believe that the old and new testament proceed from or record the act of a perfectly wise and good be the same and still greater difficulty stand in the way of the belief that a being of such a character can have be the maker of the universe he consider butler 's argument as conclusive against the only opponent for whom it be intend those who admit a omnipotent as well as perfectly just and benevolent maker and ruler of such a world as this can say little against christianity but what can with at least equal force be retort against themselves find therefore no halt place in deism he remain in a state of perplexity until doubtless after many struggle he yield to the conviction that concern the origin of thing nothing whatever can be know this be the only correct statement of he opinion for dogmatic atheism he look upon as absurd as most of those whom the world have consider atheist have always do these particulars be important because they show that my father 's rejection of all that be call religious belief be not as many might suppose primarily a matter of logic and evidence : the grounds of it be moral still more than intellectual he find it impossible to believe that a world so full of evil be the work of a author combine infinite power with perfect goodness and righteousness he intellect spurn the subtlety by which man attempt to blind themselves to this open contradiction the sabaean or manichaean theory of a good and a evil principle struggle against each other for the government of the universe he would not have equally condemn and i have hear he express surprise that no one revive it in we time he would have regard it as a mere hypothesis but he would have ascribe to it no depraving influence as it be he aversion to religion in the sense usually attach to the term be of the same kind with that of lucretius : he regard it with the feeling due not to a mere mental delusion but to a great moral evil he look upon it as the greatest enemy of morality : first by set up fictitious excellence -- belief in creed devotional feeling and ceremony not connect with the good of human-kind -- and cause these to be accept as substitute for genuine virtue : but above all by radically vitiate the standard of moral make it consist in do the will of a be on whom it lavish indeed all the phrase of adulation but whom in sober truth it depict as eminently hateful i have a hundred time hear he say that all age and nation have represent they god as wicked in a constantly increase progression that mankind have go on add trait after trait till they reach the most perfect conception of wickedness which the human mind can devise and have call this god and prostrate themselves before it this _ ne plus ultra _ of wickedness he consider to be embody in what be commonly present to mankind as the creed of christianity think -lrb- he use to say -rrb- of a be who would make a hell -- who would create the human race with the infallible foreknowledge and therefore with the intention that the great majority of they be to be consign to horrible and everlasting torment the time i believe be draw near when this dreadful conception of a object of worship will be no longer identify with christianity and when all person with any sense of moral good and evil will look upon it with the same indignation with which my father regard it my father be as well aware as anyone that christian do not in general undergo the demoralizing consequence which seem inherent in such a creed in the manner or to the extent which might have be expect from it the same slovenliness of thought and subjection of the reason to fear wish and affection which enable they to accept a theory involve a contradiction in term prevent they from perceive the logical consequence of the theory such be the facility with which mankind believe at one and the same time thing inconsistent with one another and so few be those who draw from what they receive as truth any consequence but those recommend to they by they feeling that multitude have hold the undoubting belief in a omnipotent author of hell and have nevertheless identify that be with the best conception they be able to form of perfect goodness they worship be not pay to the demon which such a be as they imagine would really be but to they own ideal of excellence the evil be that such a belief keep the ideal wretchedly low and oppose the most obstinate resistance to all think which have a tendency to raise it higher believer shrink from every train of idea which would lead the mind to a clear conception and a elevated standard of excellence because they feel -lrb- even when they do not distinctly see -rrb- that such a standard would conflict with many of the dispensation of nature and with much of what they be accustom to consider as the christian creed and thus morality continue a matter of blind tradition with no consistent principle nor even any consistent feeling to guide it it would have be wholly inconsistent with my father 's idea of duty to allow I to acquire impression contrary to he conviction and feeling respect religion : and he impress upon I from the first that the manner in which the world come into existence be a subject on which nothing be know : that the question who make I can not be answer because we have no experience or authentic information from which to answer it and that any answer only throw the difficulty a step further back since the question immediately present itself who make god he at the same time take care that i should be acquaint with what have be think by mankind on these impenetrable problem i have mention at how early a age he make I a reader of ecclesiastical history and he teach I to take the strongest interest in the reformation as the great and decisive contest against priestly tyranny for liberty of thought i be thus one of the very few example in this country of one who have not throw off religious belief but never have it : i grow up in a negative state with regard to it i look upon the modern exactly as i do upon the ancient religion as something which in no way concerned I it do not seem to I more strange that english people should believe what i do not than that the man i read of in herodotus should have do so history have make the variety of opinion among mankind a fact familiar to I and this be but a prolongation of that fact this point in my early education have however incidentally one bad consequence deserving notice in give I a opinion contrary to that of the world my father think it necessary to give it as one which could not prudently be avow to the world this lesson of keep my thought to myself at that early age be attend with some moral disadvantage though my limited intercourse with stranger especially such as be likely to speak to I on religion prevent I from be place in the alternative of avowal or hypocrisy i remember two occasion in my boyhood on which i feel myself in this alternative and in both case i avowed my disbelief and defend it my opponent be boy considerably older than myself : one of they i certainly stagger at the time but the subject be never renew between we : the other who be surprised and somewhat shocked do he best to convince I for some time without effect the great advance in liberty of discussion which be one of the most important difference between the present time and that of my childhood have greatly alter the morality of this question and i think that few man of my father 's intellect and public spirit hold with such intensity of moral conviction as he do unpopular opinion on religion or on any other of the great subject of thought would now either practice or inculcate the withholding of they from the world unless in the case become fewer every day in which frankness on these subject would either risk the loss of means of subsistence or would amount to exclusion from some sphere of usefulness peculiarly suitable to the capacity of the individual on religion in particular the time appear to I to have come when it be the duty of all who be qualify in point of knowledge have on mature consideration satisfied themselves that the current opinion be not only false but hurtful to make they dissent know at least if they be among those whose station or reputation give they opinion a chance of be attend to such a avowal would put a end at once and for ever to the vulgar prejudice that what be call very improperly unbelief be connect with any bad quality either of mind or heart the world would be astonish if it know how great a proportion of its brightest ornament -- of those most distinguish even in popular estimation for wisdom and virtue -- be complete sceptic in religion many of they refrain from avowal less from personal consideration than from a conscientious though now in my opinion a most mistaken apprehension lest by speak out what would tend to weaken exist belief and by consequence -lrb- as they suppose -rrb- exist restraint they should do harm instead of good of unbeliever -lrb- so call -rrb- as well as of believer there be many species include almost every variety of moral type but the best among they as no one who have have opportunity of really know they will hesitate to affirm be more genuinely religious in the best sense of the word religion than those who exclusively arrogate to themselves the title the liberality of the age or in other word the weakening of the obstinate prejudice which make man unable to see what be before they eye because it be contrary to they expectation have cause it be very commonly admit that a deist may be truly religious : but if religion stand for any grace of character and not for mere dogma the assertion may equally be make of many whose belief be far short of deism though they may think the proof incomplete that the universe be a work of design and though they assuredly disbelieve that it can have a author and governor who be _ absolute _ in power as well as perfect in goodness they have that which constitute the principal worth of all religion whatever a ideal conception of a perfect be to which they habitually refer as the guide of they conscience and this ideal of good be usually far nearer to perfection than the objective deity of those who think themselves oblige to find absolute goodness in the author of a world so crowd with suffering and so deform by injustice as ours my father 's moral conviction wholly dissevered from religion be very much of the character of those of the greek philosopher and be deliver with the force and decision which characterize all that come from he even at the very early age at which i read with he the _ memorabilia _ of xenophon i imbibe from that work and from he comment a deep respect for the character of socrate who stand in my mind as a model of ideal excellence : and i well remember how my father at that time impressed upon I the lesson of the choice of hercule at a somewhat later period the lofty moral standard exhibit in the writings of plato operate upon I with great force my father 's moral inculcation be at all time mainly those of the socraticus virus justice temperance -lrb- to which he give a very extended application -rrb- veracity perseverance readiness to encounter pain and especially labor regard for the public good estimation of person accord to they merit and of thing accord to they intrinsic usefulness a life of exertion in contradiction to one of self-indulgent ease and sloth these and other morality he convey in brief sentence utter as occasion arise of grave exhortation or stern reprobation and contempt but though direct moral teaching do much indirect do more and the effect my father produce on my character do not depend solely on what he say or do with that direct object but also and still more on what manner of man he be in he view of life he partake of the character of the stoic the epicurean and the cynic not in the modern but the ancient sense of the word in he personal quality the stoic predominate he standard of moral be epicurean inasmuch as it be utilitarian take as the exclusive test of right and wrong the tendency of action to produce pleasure or pain but he have -lrb- and this be the cynic element -rrb- scarcely any belief in pleasure at least in he later year of which alone on this point i can speak confidently he be not insensible to pleasure but he deem very few of they worth the price which at least in the present state of society must be pay for they the greater number of miscarriage in life he consider to be attributable to the overvaluing of pleasure accordingly temperance in the large sense intend by the greek philosopher -- stop short at the point of moderation in all indulgence -- be with he as with they almost the central point of educational precept he inculcation of this virtue fill a large place in my childish remembrance he think human life a poor thing at best after the freshness of youth and of unsatisfied curiosity have go by this be a topic on which he do not often speak especially it may be suppose in the presence of young person : but when he do it be with a air of settle and profound conviction he would sometimes say that if life be make what it might be by good government and good education it would be worth have : but he never speak with anything like enthusiasm even of that possibility he never vary in rating intellectual enjoyment above all other even in value as pleasure independently of they ulterior benefit the pleasure of the benevolent affection he place high in the scale and use to say that he have never know a happy old man except those who be able to live over again in the pleasure of the young for passionate emotion of all sort and for everything which bas be say or write in exaltation of they he profess the greatest contempt he regard they as a form of madness the intense be with he a bye-word of scornful disapprobation he regard as a aberration of the moral standard of modern time compare with that of the ancient the great stress lay upon feeling feeling as such he consider to be no proper subject of praise or blame right and wrong good and bad he regard as quality solely of conduct -- of act and omission there be no feeling which may not lead and do not frequently lead either to good or to bad action : conscience itself the very desire to act right often leading people to act wrong consistently carry out the doctrine that the object of praise and blame should be the discouragement of wrong conduct and the encouragement of right he refuse to let he praise or blame be influence by the motive of the agent he blame as severely what he think a bad action when the motive be a feeling of duty as if the agent have be consciously evil doer he would not have accept as a plea in mitigation for inquisitor that they sincerely believe burning heretic to be a obligation of conscience but though he do not allow honesty of purpose to soften he disapprobation of action it have its full effect on he estimation of character no one prize conscientiousness and rectitude of intention more highly or be more incapable of value any person in whom he do not feel assurance of it but he dislike people quite as much for any other deficiency provide he think it equally likely to make they act ill he dislike for instance a fanatic in any bad cause as much as or more than one who adopt the same cause from self-interest because he think he even more likely to be practically mischievous and thus he aversion to many intellectual error or what he regard as such partook in a certain sense of the character of a moral feeling all this be merely say that he in a degree once common but now very unusual throw he feeling into he opinion which truly it be difficult to understand how anyone who possess much of both can fail to do none but those who do not care about opinion will confound this with intolerance those who have opinion which they hold to be immensely important and they contrary to be prodigiously hurtful have any deep regard for the general good will necessarily dislike as a class and in the abstract those who think wrong what they think right and right what they think wrong : though they need not therefore be nor be my father insensible to good quality in a opponent nor govern in they estimation of individual by one general presumption instead of by the whole of they character i grant that a earnest person be no more infallible than other man be liable to dislike people on account of opinion which do not merit dislike but if he neither himself do they any ill office nor connive at its be donc by other he be not intolerant : and the forbearance which flow from a conscientious sense of the importance to mankind of the equal freedom of all opinion be the only tolerance which be commendable or to the highest moral order of mind possible it will be admit that a man of the opinion and the character above describe be likely to leave a strong moral impression on any mind principally form by he and that he moral teaching be not likely to err on the side of laxity or indulgence the element which be chiefly deficient in he moral relation to he child be that of tenderness i do not believe that this deficiency lay in he own nature i believe he to have have much more feeling than he habitually show and much greater capacity of feeling than be ever develop he resemble most englishman in be ashamed of the sign of feeling and by the absence of demonstration starve the feeling themselves if we consider further that he be in the try position of sole teacher and add to this that he temper be constitutionally irritable it be impossible not to feel true pity for a father who do and strive to do so much for he child who would have so value they affection yet who must have be constantly feel that fear of he be dry it up at its source this be no longer the case later in life and with he younger child they love he tenderly : and if i can not say so much of myself i be always loyally devote to he as regard my own education i hesitate to pronounce whether i be more a loser or gainer by he severity it be not such as to prevent I from have a happy childhood and i do not believe that boy can be induce to apply themselves with vigor and -- what be so much more difficult -- perseverance to dry and irksome study by the sole force of persuasion and soft word much must be do and much must be learn by child for which rigid discipline and know liability to punishment be indispensable as mean it be no doubt a very laudable effort in modern teaching to render as much as possible of what the young be require to learn easy and interesting to they but when this principle be push to the length of not require they to learn anything _ but _ what have be make easy and interesting one of the chief object of education be sacrifice i rejoice in the decline of the old brutal and tyrannical system of teaching which however do succeed in enforce habit of application but the new as it seem to I be train up a race of man who will be incapable of do anything which be disagreeable to they i do not then believe that fear as a element in education can be dispense with but i be sure that it ought not to be the main element and when it predominate so much as to preclude love and confidence on the part of the child to those who should be the unreservedly trust adviser of after year and perhaps to seal up the fountain of frank and spontaneous communicativeness in the child 's nature it be a evil for which a large abatement must be make from the benefit moral and intellectual which may flow from any other part of the education during this first period of my life the habitual frequenter of my father 's house be limit to a very few person most of they little known to the world but whom personal worth and more or less of congeniality with at least he political opinion -lrb- not so frequently to be meet with then as since -rrb- inclined he to cultivate and he conversation with they i listen to with interest and instruction my be a habitual inmate of my father 's study make I acquaint with the dearest of he friend david ricardo who by he benevolent countenance and kindliness of manner be very attractive to young person and who after i become a student of political economy invite I to he house and to walk with he in order to converse on the subject i be a more frequent visitor -lrb- from about 1817 or 1818 -rrb- to mr hume who bear in the same part of scotland as my father and have be i rather think a younger schoolfellow or college companion of he have on return from indium renew they youthful acquaintance and who -- come like many other greatly under the influence of my father 's intellect and energy of character -- be induce partly by that influence to go into parliament and there adopt the line of conduct which have give he a honorable place in the history of he country of mr bentham i see much more owe to the close intimacy which exist between he and my father i do not know how soon after my father 's first arrival in england they become acquaint but my father be the earliest englishman of any great mark who thoroughly understand and in the main adopt bentham 's general view of ethic government and law : and this be a natural foundation for sympathy between they and make they familiar companion in a period of bentham 's life during which he admit much fewer visitor than be the case subsequently at this time mr bentham pass some part of every year at barrow green house in a beautiful part of the surrey hill a few mile from godstone and there i each summer accompany my father in a long visit in 1813 mr bentham my father and i make a excursion which include oxford bath and bristol exeter plymouth and portsmouth in this journey i see many thing which be instructive to I and acquire my first taste for natural scenery in the elementary form of fondness for a view in the succeed winter we move into a house very near mr bentham 's which my father rent from he in queen square westminster from 1814 to 1817 mr bentham live during half of each year at ford abbey in somersetshire -lrb- or rather in a part of devonshire surround by somersetshire -rrb- which interval i have the advantage of pass at that place this sojourn be i think a important circumstance in my education nothing contribute more to nourish elevation of sentiment in a people than the large and free character of they habitation the middle-age architecture the baronial hall and the spacious and lofty room of this fine old place so unlike the mean and cramped externals of english middle-class life give the sentiment of a larger and freer existence and be to I a sort of poetic cultivation aid also by the character of the grounds in which the abbey stand which be _ riant _ and secluded umbrageous and full of the sound of fall water i owe another of the fortunate circumstance in my education a year 's residence in france to mr bentham 's brother general sir samuel bentham i have see sir samuel bentham and he family at they house near gosport in the course of the tour already mention -lrb- he be then superintendent of the dockyard at portsmouth -rrb- and during a stay of a few day which they make at ford abbey shortly after the peace before go to live on the continent in 1820 they invite I for a six month ' visit to they in the south of france which they kindness ultimately prolong to nearly a twelvemonth sir samuel bentham though of a character of mind different from that of he illustrious brother be a man of very considerable attainment and general power with a decide genius for mechanical art he wife a daughter of the celebrated chemist dr fordyce be a woman of strong will and decide character much general knowledge and great practical good sense of the edgeworth kind : she be the ruling spirit of the household as she deserve and be well qualify to be they family consist of one son -lrb- the eminent botanist -rrb- and three daughter the youngest about two year my senior i be indebted to they for much and various instruction and for a almost parental interest in my welfare when i first join they in may 1820 they occupy the chteau of pompignan -lrb- still belong to a descendant of voltaire 's enemy -rrb- on the height overlook the plain of the garonne between montauban and toulouse i accompany they in a excursion to the pyrenee include a stay of some duration at bagnres de bigorre a journey to pau bayonne and bagnres de luchon and a ascent of the pic du midi de bigorre this first introduction to the highest order of mountain scenery make the deepest impression on I and give a color to my taste through life in October we proceed by the beautiful mountain route of castre and st pon from toulouse to montpellier in which last neighborhood sir samuel have just buy the estate of restinclire near the foot of the singular mountain of st loup during this residence in france i acquire a familiar knowledge of the french language and acquaintance with the ordinary french literature i take lesson in various bodily exercise in none of which however i make any proficiency and at montpellier i attend the excellent winter course of lecture at the facult des science those of m anglada on chemistry of m provenal on zoology and of a very accomplished representative of the eighteenth century metaphysics m gergonne on logic under the name of philosophy of the science i also go through a course of the higher mathematics under the private tuition of m lenthric a professor at the lyce of montpellier but the greatest perhaps of the many advantage which i owe to this episode in my education be that of have breathe for a whole year the free and genial atmosphere of continental life this advantage be not the less real though i could not then estimate nor even consciously feel it have so little experience of english life and the few people i know be mostly such as have public object of a large and personally disinterested kind at heart i be ignorant of the low moral tone of what in england be call society the habit of not indeed profess but take for grant in every mode of implication that conduct be of course always direct towards low and petty object the absence of high feeling which manifest itself by sneer depreciation of all demonstration of they and by general abstinence -lrb- except among a few of the stricter religionist -rrb- from profess any high principle of action at all except in those preordained case in which such profession be put on as part of the costume and formality of the occasion i could not then know or estimate the difference between this manner of existence and that of a people like the french whose fault if equally real be at all event different among whom sentiment which by comparison at least may be call elevated be the current coin of human intercourse both in book and in private life and though often evaporate in profession be yet keep alive in the nation at large by constant exercise and stimulate by sympathy so as to form a living and active part of the existence of great number of person and to be recognize and understand by all neither could i then appreciate the general culture of the understanding which result from the habitual exercise of the feeling and be thus carry down into the most uneducated class of several country on the continent in a degree not equal in england among the so-called educate except where a unusual tenderness of conscience lead to a habitual exercise of the intellect on question of right and wrong i do not know the way in which among the ordinary english the absence of interest in thing of a unselfish kind except occasionally in a special thing here and there and the habit of not speak to other nor much even to themselves about the thing in which they do feel interest cause both they feeling and they intellectual faculty to remain undeveloped or to develop themselves only in some single and very limited direction reduce they consider as spiritual being to a kind of negative existence all these thing i do not perceive till long afterwards but i even then feel though without state it clearly to myself the contrast between the frank sociability and amiability of french personal intercourse and the english mode of existence in which everybody act as if everybody else -lrb- with few or no exception -rrb- be either a enemy or a bear in france it be true the bad as well as the good point both of individual and of national character come more to the surface and break out more fearlessly in ordinary intercourse than in england : but the general habit of the people be to show as well as to expect friendly feeling in every one towards every other wherever there be not some positive cause for the opposite in england it be only of the best breed people in the upper or upper middle rank that anything like this can be say in my way through paris both go and return i pass some time in the house of m say the eminent political economist who be a friend and correspondent of my father have become acquaint with he on a visit to england a year or two after the peace he be a man of the later period of the french revolution a fine specimen of the best kind of french republican one of those who have never bent the knee to bonaparte though court by he to do so a truly upright brave and enlighten man he live a quiet and studious life make happy by warm affection public and private he be acquaint with many of the chief of the liberal party and i see various noteworthy person while stay at this house among whom i have pleasure in the recollection of have once see saint-simon not yet the founder either of a philosophy or a religion and consider only as a clever original the chief fruit which i carry away from the society i saw be a strong and permanent interest in continental liberalism of which i ever afterwards keep myself _ au courant _ as much as of english politics : a thing not at all usual in those day with englishman and which have a very salutary influence on my development keep I free from the error always prevalent in england -- and from which even my father with all he superiority to prejudice be not exempt -- of judge universal question by a merely english standard after pass a few week at caen with a old friend of my father 's i return to england in July 1821 and my education resume its ordinary course chapter iii last stage of education and first of self-education for the first year or two after my visit to france i continue my old study with the addition of some new one when i return my father be just finish for the press he _ element of political economy _ and he make I perform a exercise on the manuscript which mr bentham practice on all he own writings make what he call marginal contents a short abstract of every paragraph to enable the writer more easily to judge of and improve the order of the idea and the general character of the exposition soon after my father put into my hand condillac 's _ trait des sensation _ and the logical and metaphysical volume of he _ cour d'etude _ the first -lrb- notwithstanding the superficial resemblance between condillac 's psychological system and my father 's -rrb- quite as much for a warning as for a example i be not sure whether it be in this winter or the next that i first read a history of the french revolution i learn with astonishment that the principle of democracy then apparently in so insignificant and hopeless a minority everywhere in europe have bear all before they in france thirty year earlier and have be the creed of the nation as may be suppose from this i have previously a very vague idea of that great commotion i know only that the french have throw off the absolute monarchy of loui xiv and xv have put the king and queen to death guillotine many person one of whom be lavoisier and have ultimately fall under the despotism of bonaparte from this time as be natural the subject take a immense hold of my feeling it ally itself with all my juvenile aspiration to the character of a democratic champion what have happen so lately seem as if it might easily happen again : and the most transcendent glory i be capable of conceive be that of figure successful or unsuccessful as a girondist in a english convention during the winter of 1821-2 mr john austin with whom at the time of my visit to france my father have but lately become acquaint kindly allow I to read roman law with he my father notwithstanding he abhorrence of the chaos of barbarism call english law have turn he thought towards the bar as on the whole less ineligible for I than any other profession : and these reading with mr austin who have make bentham 's best idea he own and add much to they from other source and from he own mind be not only a valuable introduction to legal study but a important portion of general education with mr austin i read heineccius on the institute he _ roman antiquity _ and part of he exposition of the pandect to which be add a considerable portion of blackstone it be at the commencement of these study that my father as a needful accompaniment to they put into my hand bentham 's principal speculation as interpret to the continent and indeed to all the world by dumont in the _ trait de lgislation _ the reading of this book be a epoch in my life one of the turn point in my mental history my previous education have be in a certain sense already a course of benthamism the benthamic standard of the greatest happiness be that which i have always be teach to apply i be even familiar with a abstract discussion of it form a episode in a unpublished dialogue on government write by my father on the platonic model yet in the first page of bentham it burst upon I with all the force of novelty what thus impress I be the chapter in which bentham pass judgment on the common mode of reasoning in moral and legislation deduce from phrase like law of nature right reason the moral sense natural rectitude and the like and characterize they as dogmatism in disguise impose its sentiment upon other under cover of sound expression which convey no reason for the sentiment but set up the sentiment as its own reason it have not strike I before that bentham 's principle put a end to all this the feeling rush upon I that all previous moralist be supersede and that here indeed be the commencement of a new era in think this impression be strengthen by the manner in which bentham put into scientific form the application of the happiness principle to the morality of action by analyze the various class and order of they consequence but what strike I at that time most of all be the classification of offence which be much more clear compact and impose in dumont 's _ rdaction _ than in the original work of bentham from which it be take logic and the dialectic of plato which have form so large a part of my previous training have give I a strong relish for accurate classification this taste have be strengthen and enlighten by the study of botany on the principle of what be call the natural method which i have take up with great zeal though only as a amusement during my stay in france and when i find scientific classification apply to the great and complex subject of punishable act under the guidance of the ethical principle of pleasurable and painful consequence follow out in the method of detail introduce into these subject by bentham i feel take up to a eminence from which i could survey a vast mental domain and see stretch out into the distance intellectual result beyond all computation as i proceed further there seem to be add to this intellectual clearness the most inspiring prospects of practical improvement in human affair to bentham 's general view of the construction of a body of law i be not altogether a stranger have read with attention that admirable compendium my father 's article on jurisprudence : but i have read it with little profit and scarcely any interest no doubt from its extremely general and abstract character and also because it concern the form more than the substance of the _ corpus juri _ the logic rather than the ethic of law but bentham 's subject be legislation of which jurisprudence be only the formal part : and at every page he seem to open a clearer and broader conception of what human opinion and institution ought to be how they might be make what they ought to be and how far remove from it they now be when i lay down the last volume of the _ trait _ i have become a different be the principle of utility understand as bentham understand it and apply in the manner in which he apply it through these three volume fall exactly into its place as the keystone which hold together the detach and fragmentary component part of my knowledge and belief it give unity to my conception of thing i now have opinion a creed a doctrine a philosophy in one among the best sens of the word a religion the inculcation and diffusion of which could be make the principal outward purpose of a life and i have a grand conception lay before I of change to be effect in the condition of mankind through that doctrine the _ trait de legislation _ wind up with what be to I a most impressive picture of human life as it would be make by such opinion and such law as be recommend in the treatise the anticipation of practicable improvement be studiously moderate deprecate and discountenance as reverie of vague enthusiasm many thing which will one day seem so natural to human being that injustice will probably be do to those who once think they chimerical but in my state of mind this appearance of superiority to illusion add to the effect which bentham 's doctrine produce on I by heighten the impression of mental power and the vista of improvement which he do open be sufficiently large and brilliant to light up my life as well as to give a definite shape to my aspiration after this i read from time to time the most important of the other work of bentham which have then see the light either as write by himself or as edit by dumont this be my private reading : while under my father 's direction my study be carry into the higher branch of analytic psychology i now read locke 's _ essay _ and write out a account of it consist of a complete abstract of every chapter with such remark as occur to I which be read by or -lrb- i think -rrb- to my father and discuss throughout i perform the same process with _ helvetius de l'esprit _ which i read of my own choice this preparation of abstract subject to my father 's censorship be of great service to I by compelling precision in conceive and express psychological doctrine whether accept as truth or only regard as the opinion of other after helvetius my father make I study what he deem the really master-production in the philosophy of mind hartley 's _ observation on man _ this book though it do not like the _ trait de lgislation _ give a new color to my existence make a very similar impression on I in regard to its immediate subject hartley 's explanation incomplete as in many point it be of the more complex mental phenomenon by the law of association commend itself to I at once as a real analysis and make I feel by contrast the insufficiency of the merely verbal generalization of condillac and even of the instructive groping and feeling about for psychological explanation of locke it be at this very time that my father commence write he _ analysis _ of the mind which carry hartley 's mode of explain the mental phenomenon to so much greater length and depth he could only command the concentration of thought necessary for this work during the complete leisure of he holiday for a month or six week annually : and he commence it in the summer of 1822 in the first holiday he pass at dorking in which neighborhood from that time to the end of he life with the exception of two year he live as far as he official duty permit for six month of every year he work at the _ analysis _ during several successive vacation up to the year 1829 when it be publish and allow I to read the manuscript portion by portion as it advance the other principal english writer on mental philosophy i read as i feel inclined particularly berkeley hume 's _ essay _ reid dugald stewart and brown on cause and effect brown 's _ lecture _ i do not read until two or three year later nor at that time have my father himself read they among the work read in the course of this year which contribute materially to my development i owe it to mention a book -lrb- write on the foundation of some of bentham 's manuscript and publish under the pseudonyme of philip beauchamp -rrb- entitle _ analysis of the influence of natural religion on the temporal happiness of mankind _ this be a examination not of the truth but of the usefulness of religious belief in the most general sense apart from the peculiarity of any special revelation which of all the part of the discussion concern religion be the most important in this age in which real belief in any religious doctrine be feeble and precarious but the opinion of its necessity for moral and social purpose almost universal and when those who reject revelation very generally take refuge in a optimistic deism a worship of the order of nature and the suppose course of providence at least as full of contradiction and pervert to the moral sentiment as any of the form of christianity if only it be as completely realize yet very little with any claim to a philosophical character have be write by sceptic against the usefulness of this form of belief the volume bear the name of philip beauchamp have this for its special object have be show to my father in manuscript it be put into my hand by he and i make a marginal analysis of it as i have do of the _ element of political economy _ next to the trait de lgislation _ it be one of the book which by the search character of its analysis produce the greatest effect upon I on read it lately after a interval of many year i find it to have some of the defect as well as the merit of the benthamic mode of thought and to contain as i now think many weak argument but with a great overbalance of sound one and much good material for a more completely philosophic and conclusive treatment of the subject i have now i believe mention all the book which have any considerable effect on my early mental development from this point i begin to carry on my intellectual cultivation by write still more than by read in the summer of 1822 i write my first argumentative essay i remember very little about it except that it be a attack on what i regard as the aristocratic prejudice that the rich be or be likely to be superior in moral quality to the poor my performance be entirely argumentative without any of the declamation which the subject would admit of and might be expect to suggest to a young writer in that department however i be and remain very inapt dry argument be the only thing i could manage or willingly attempt though passively i be very susceptible to the effect of all composition whether in the form of poetry or oratory which appeal to the feeling on any basis of reason my father who know nothing of this essay until it be finish be well satisfied and as i learn from other even please with it but perhaps from a desire to promote the exercise of other mental faculty than the purely logical he advise I to make my next exercise in composition one of the oratorical kind on which suggestion avail myself of my familiarity with greek history and idea and with the athenian orator i write two speech one a accusation the other a defense of pericle on a suppose impeachment for not march out to fight the lacedemonian on they invasion of attica after this i continue to write papers on subject often very much beyond my capacity but with great benefit both from the exercise itself and from the discussion which it lead to with my father i have now also begin to converse on general subject with the instruct man with whom i come in contact : and the opportunity of such contact naturally become more numerous the two friend of my father from whom i derive most and with whom i most associate be mr grote and mr john austin the acquaintance of both with my father be recent but have ripen rapidly into intimacy mr grote be introduce to my father by mr ricardo i think in 1819 -lrb- be then about twenty-five year old -rrb- and seek assiduously he society and conversation already a highly instruct man he be yet by the side of my father a tyro in the great subject of human opinion but he rapidly seize on my father 's best idea and in the department of political opinion he make himself know as early as 1820 by a pamphlet in defense of radical reform in reply to a celebrated article by sir jame mackintosh then lately publish in he _ edinburgh review _ mr grote 's father the banker be i believe a thorough tory and he mother intensely evangelical so that for he liberal opinion he be in no way indebted to home influence but unlike most person who have the prospect of be rich by inheritance he have though actively engage in the business of banking devote a great portion of time to philosophic study and he intimacy with my father do much to decide the character of the next stage in he mental progress he i often visit and my conversation with he on political moral and philosophical subject give I in addition to much valuable instruction all the pleasure and benefit of sympathetic communion with a man of the high intellectual and moral eminence which he life and writings have since manifest to the world mr austin who be four or five year older than mr grote be the eldest son of a retired miller in suffolk who have make money by contract during the war and who must have be a man of remarkable quality as i infer from the fact that all he son be of more than common ability and all eminently gentleman the one with whom we be now concerned and whose writings on jurisprudence have make he celebrate be for some time in the army and serve in sicily under lord william bentinck after the peace he sell he commission and study for the bar to which he have be call for some time before my father know he he be not like mr grote to any extent a pupil of my father but he have attain by reading and think a considerable number of the same opinion modify by he own very decide individuality of character he be a man of great intellectual power which in conversation appear at they very best from the vigor and richness of expression with which under the excitement of discussion he be accustom to maintain some view or other of most general subject and from a appearance of not only strong but deliberate and collect will mix with a certain bitterness partly derive from temperament and partly from the general cast of he feeling and reflection the dissatisfaction with life and the world feel more or less in the present state of society and intellect by every discerning and highly conscientious mind give in he case a rather melancholy tinge to the character very natural to those whose passive moral susceptibility be more than proportion to they active energy for it must be say that the strength of will of which he manner seem to give such strong assurance expend itself principally in manner with great zeal for human improvement a strong sense of duty and capacity and acquirement the extent of which be prove by the writings he have leave he hardly ever complete any intellectual task of magnitude he have so high a standard of what ought to be do so exaggerate a sense of deficiency in he own performance and be so unable to content himself with the amount of elaboration sufficient for the occasion and the purpose that he not only spoilt much of he work for ordinary use by overlabour it but spend so much time and exertion in superfluous study and think that when he task ought to have be complete he have generally work himself into a illness without have half finish what he undertake from this mental infirmity -lrb- of which he be not the sole example among the accomplished and able man whom i have know -rrb- combine with liability to frequent attack of disable though not dangerous ill-health he accomplish through life little in comparison with what he seem capable of but what he do produce be hold in the very highest estimation by the most competent judge and like coleridge he might plead as a set-off that he have be to many person through he conversation a source not only of much instruction but of great elevation of character on I he influence be most salutary it be moral in the best sense he take a sincere and kind interest in I far beyond what could have be expect towards a mere youth from a man of he age standing and what seem austerity of character there be in he conversation and demeanor a tone of high-mindedness which do not show itself so much if the quality exist as much in any of the other person with whom at that time i associate my intercourse with he be the more beneficial owe to he be of a different mental type from all other intellectual man whom i frequented and he from the first set himself decidedly against the prejudice and narrowness which be almost sure to be find in a young man form by a particular mode of thought or a particular social circle he younger brother charle austin of whom at this time and for the next year or two i see much have also a great effect on I though of a very different description he be but a few year older than myself and have then just leave the university where he have shine with great _ clat _ as a man of intellect and a brilliant orator and converser the effect he produce on he cambridge contemporary deserve to be account a historical event for to it may in part be trace the tendency towards liberalism in general and the benthamic and politico-economic form of it in particular which show itself in a portion of the more active-minded young man of the higher class from this time to 1830 the union debate society at that time at the height of its reputation be a arena where what be then think extreme opinion in politics and philosophy be weekly assert face to face with they opposite before audience consist of the _ lite _ of the cambridge youth : and though many person afterwards of more or less note -lrb- of whom lord macaulay be the most celebrated -rrb- gain they first oratorical laurel in those debate the really influential mind among these intellectual gladiator be charle austin he continue after leave the university to be by he conversation and personal ascendency a leader among the same class of young man who have be he associate there and he attach I among other to he car through he i become acquaint with macaulay hyde and charle villier strutt -lrb- now lord belper -rrb- romilly -lrb- now lord romilly and master of the roll -rrb- and various other who subsequently figure in literature or politics and among whom i hear discussion on many topic as yet to a certain degree new to I the influence of charle austin over I differ from that of the person i have hitherto mention in be not the influence of a man over a boy but that of a elder contemporary it be through he that i first feel myself not a pupil under teacher but a man among man he be the first person of intellect whom i meet on a ground of equality though as yet much he inferior on that common ground he be a man who never fail to impress greatly those with whom he come in contact even when they opinion be the very reverse of he the impression he give be that of boundless strength together with talent which combine with such apparent force of will and character seem capable of dominate the world those who know he whether friendly to he or not always anticipate that he would play a conspicuous part in public life it be seldom that man produce so great a immediate effect by speech unless they in some degree lay themselves out for it and he do this in no ordinary degree he love to strike and even to startle he know that decision be the greatest element of effect and he utter he opinion with all the decision he could throw into they never so well pleased as when he astonish anyone by they audacity very unlike he brother who make war against the narrower interpretation and application of the principle they both profess he on the contrary present the benthamic doctrine in the most startling form of which they be susceptible exaggerate everything in they which tend to consequence offensive to anyone 's preconceived feeling all which he defend with such verve and vivacity and carry off by a manner so agreeable as well as forcible that he always either come off victor or divide the honor of the field it be my belief that much of the notion popularly entertain of the tenet and sentiment of what be call benthamite or utilitarian have its origin in paradox throw out by charle austin it must be say however that he example be follow _ haud passibus aequi _ by younger proselyte and that to _ outrer _ whatever be by anybody consider offensive in the doctrine and maxim of benthamism become at one time the badge of a small coterie of youth all of these who have anything in they myself among other quickly outgrow this boyish vanity and those who have not become tired of differ from other people and give up both the good and the bad part of the heterodox opinion they have for some time profess it be in the winter of 1822-3 that i form the plan of a little society to be compose of young man agree in fundamental principle -- acknowledge utility as they standard in ethic and politics and a certain number of the principal corollary draw from it in the philosophy i have accept -- and meeting once a fortnight to read essay and discuss question conformably to the premise thus agree on the fact would hardly be worth mention but for the circumstance that the name i give to the society i have plan be the utilitarian society it be the first time that anyone have take the title of utilitarian and the term make its way into the language from this humble source i do not invent the word but find it in one of galt 's novel the _ annals of the parish _ in which the scotch clergyman of whom the book be a suppose autobiography be represent as warn he parishioner not to leave the gospel and become utilitarian with a boy 's fondness for a name and a banner i seize on the word and for some year call myself and other by it as a sectarian appellation and it come to be occasionally use by some other hold the opinion which it be intend to designate as those opinion attract more notice the term be repeat by stranger and opponent and get into rather common use just about the time when those who have originally assume it lay down that along with other sectarian characteristic the society so call consist at first of no more than three member one of whom be mr bentham 's amanuensis obtain for we permission to hold we meeting in he house the number never i think reach ten and the society be break up in 1826 it have thus a existence of about three year and a half the chief effect of it as regard myself over and above the benefit of practice in oral discussion be that of bring I in contact with several young man at that time less advanced than myself among whom as they profess the same opinion i be for some time a sort of leader and have considerable influence on they mental progress any young man of education who fall in my way and whose opinion be not incompatible with those of the society i endeavor to press into its service and some other i probably should never have know have they not join it those of the member who become my intimate companion -- no one of whom be in any sense of the word a disciple but all of they independent thinker on they own basis -- be william eyton tooke son of the eminent political economist a young man of singular worth both moral and intellectual lose to the world by a early death he friend william elli a original thinker in the field of political economy now honourably know by he apostolic exertion for the improvement of education george graham afterwards official assignee of the bankruptcy court a thinker of originality and power on almost all abstract subject and -lrb- from the time when he come first to england to study for the bar in 1824 or 1825 -rrb- a man who have make considerably more noise in the world than any of these john arthur roebuck in may 1823 my professional occupation and status for the next thirty-five year of my life be decide by my father 's obtain for I a appointment from the east indium company in the office of the examiner of indium correspondence immediately under himself i be appoint in the usual manner at the bottom of the list of clerk to rise at least in the first instance by seniority but with the understanding that i should be employ from the beginning in prepare draft of despatch and be thus train up as a successor to those who then fill the higher department of the office my draft of course require for some time much revision from my immediate superior but i soon become well acquaint with the business and by my father 's instruction and the general growth of my own power i be in a few year qualify to be and practically be the chief conductor of the correspondence with indium in one of the lead department that of the native state this continue to be my official duty until i be appoint examiner only two year before the time when the abolition of the east indium company as a political body determine my retirement i do not know any one of the occupation by which a subsistence can now be gain more suitable than such as this to anyone who not be in independent circumstance desire to devote a part of the twenty-four hour to private intellectual pursuit write for the press can not be recommend as a permanent resource to anyone qualify to accomplish anything in the higher department of literature or thought : not only on account of the uncertainty of this means of livelihood especially if the writer have a conscience and will not consent to serve any opinion except he own but also because the writings by which one can live be not the writings which themselves live and be never those in which the writer do he best book destine to form future thinker take too much time to write and when write come in general too slowly into notice and repute to be rely on for subsistence those who have to support themselves by they pen must depend on literary drudgery or at best on writings address to the multitude and can employ in the pursuit of they own choice only such time as they can spare from those of necessity which be generally less than the leisure allow by office occupation while the effect on the mind be far more enervating and fatiguing for my own part i have through life find office duty a actual rest from the other mental occupation which i have carry on simultaneously with they they be sufficiently intellectual not to be a distasteful drudgery without be such as to cause any strain upon the mental power of a person use to abstract thought or to the labor of careful literary composition the drawback for every mode of life have its drawback be not however unfelt by I i care little for the loss of the chance of riches and honor hold out by some of the profession particularly the bar which have be as i have already say the profession thought of for I but i be not indifferent to exclusion from parliament and public life : and i feel very sensibly the more immediate unpleasantness of confinement to london the holiday allow by indium house practice not exceed a month in the year while my taste be strong for a country life and my sojourn in france have leave behind it a ardent desire of travel but though these taste could not be freely indulge they be at no time entirely sacrifice i pass most sunday throughout the year in the country take long rural walk on that day even when reside in london the month 's holiday be for a few year pass at my father 's house in the country afterwards a part or the whole be spend in tour chiefly pedestrian with some one or more of the young man who be my choose companion and at a later period in longer journey or excursion alone or with other friend france belgium and rhenish germany be within easy reach of the annual holiday : and two longer absence one of three the other of six month under medical advice add switzerland the tyrol and italy to my list fortunately also both these journey occur rather early so as to give the benefit and charm of the remembrance to a large portion of life i be dispose to agree with what have be surmise by other that the opportunity which my official position give I of learn by personal observation the necessary condition of the practical conduct of public affair have be of considerable value to I as a theoretical reformer of the opinion and institution of my time not indeed that public business transact on paper to take effect on the other side of the globe be of itself calculate to give much practical knowledge of life but the occupation accustom I to see and hear the difficulty of every course and the means of obviate they state and discuss deliberately with a view to execution : it give I opportunity of perceive when public measure and other political fact do not produce the effect which have be expect of they and from what cause above all it be valuable to I by make I in this portion of my activity merely one wheel in a machine the whole of which have to work together as a speculative writer i should have have no one to consult but myself and should have encounter in my speculation none of the obstacle which would have start up whenever they come to be apply to practice but as a secretary conduct political correspondence i could not issue a order or express a opinion without satisfy various person very unlike myself that the thing be fit to be do i be thus in a good position for find out by practice the mode of put a thought which give it easiest admittance into mind not prepare for it by habit while i become practically conversant with the difficulty of move body of man the necessity of compromise the art of sacrifice the non-essential to preserve the essential i learn how to obtain the best i could when i could not obtain everything instead of be indignant or dispirited because i could not have entirely my own way to be pleased and encouraged when i could have the smallest part of it and when even that could not be to bear with complete equanimity the be overrule altogether i have find through life these acquisition to be of the greatest possible importance for personal happiness and they be also a very necessary condition for enable anyone either as theorist or as practical man to effect the greatest amount of good compatible with he opportunity chapter iv youthful propagandism the westminster review the occupation of so much of my time by office work do not relax my attention to my own pursuit which be never carry on more vigorously it be about this time that i begin to write in newspaper the first writings of mine which get into print be two letter publish towards the end of 1822 in the _ traveller _ evening newspaper the _ traveller _ -lrb- which afterwards grow into the _ globe and traveller _ by the purchase and incorporation of the _ globe _ -rrb- be then the property of the well-known political economist colonel torren and under the editorship of a able man mr walter coulson -lrb- who after be a amanuensis of mr bentham become a reporter then a editor next a barrister and conveyancer and die counsel to the home office -rrb- it have become one of the most important newspaper organ of liberal politics colonel torren himself write much of the political economy of he paper and have at this time make a attack upon some opinion of ricardo and my father to which at my father 's instigation i attempt a answer and coulson out of consideration for my father and goodwill to I insert it there be a reply by torren to which i again rejoin i soon after attempt something considerably more ambitious the prosecution of richard carlile and he wife and sister for publication hostile to christianity be then exciting much attention and nowhere more than among the people i frequented freedom of discussion even in politics much more in religion be at that time far from be even in theory the concede point which it at least seem to be now and the holder of obnoxious opinion have to be always ready to argue and re-argue for the liberty of express they i write a series of five letter under the signature of wickliffe go over the whole length and breadth of the question of free publication of all opinion on religion and offer they to the _ morning chronicle _ three of they be publish in January and February 1823 the other two contain thing too outspoken for that journal never appear at all but a paper which i write soon after on the same subject _  propo _ of a debate in the house of common be insert as a leading article and during the whole of this year 1823 a considerable number of my contribution be print in the _ chronicle _ and _ traveller _ : sometimes notice of book but oftener letter comment on some nonsense talk in parliament or some defect of the law or misdoing of the magistracy or the court of justice in this last department the _ chronicle _ be now render signal service after the death of mr perry the editorship and management of the paper have devolve on mr john black long a reporter on its establishment a man of most extensive reading and information great honesty and simplicity of mind a particular friend of my father imbue with many of he and bentham 's idea which he reproduce in he article among other valuable thought with great facility and skill from this time the _ chronicle _ cease to be the merely whig organ it be before and during the next ten year become to a considerable extent a vehicle of the opinion of the utilitarian radical this be mainly by what black himself write with some assistance from fonblanque who first show he eminent quality as a writer by article and _ jeux d'esprit _ in the _ chronicle _ the defect of the law and of the administration of justice be the subject on which that paper render most service to improvement up to that time hardly a word have be say except by bentham and my father against that most peccant part of english institution and of they administration it be the almost universal creed of englishman that the law of england the judicature of england the unpaid magistracy of england be model of excellence i do not go beyond the mark in say that after bentham who supply the principal material the greatest share of the merit of break down this wretched superstition belong to black as editor of the _ morning chronicle _ he keep up a incessant fire against it expose the absurdity and vice of the law and the court of justice pay and unpaid until he force some sense of they into people 's mind on many other question he become the organ of opinion much in advance of any which have ever before find regular advocacy in the newspaper press black be a frequent visitor of my father and mr grote use to say that he always know by the Monday morning 's article whether black have be with my father on the Sunday black be one of the most influential of the many channel through which my father 's conversation and personal influence make he opinion tell on the world cooperate with the effect of he writings in make he a power in the country such as it have rarely be the lot of a individual in a private station to be through the mere force of intellect and character : and a power which be often act the most efficiently where it be least see and suspect i have already notice how much of what be do by ricardo hume and grote be the result in part of he prompt and persuasion he be the good genius by the side of brougham in most of what he do for the public either on education law reform or any other subject and he influence flow in minor stream too numerous to be specify this influence be now about to receive a great extension by the foundation of the _ westminster review _ contrary to what may have be suppose my father be in no degree a party to set up the _ westminster review _ the need of a radical organ to make head against the _ edinburgh _ and _ quarterly _ -lrb- then in the period of they greatest reputation and influence -rrb- have be a topic of conversation between he and mr bentham many year earlier and it have be a part of they _ chteau en espagne _ that my father should be the editor but the idea have never assume any practical shape in 1823 however mr bentham determine to establish the _ review _ at he own cost and offer the editorship to my father who decline it as incompatible with he indium house appointment it be then entrust to mr -lrb- now sir john -rrb- bowring at that time a merchant in the city mr bowring have be for two or three year previous a assiduous frequenter of mr bentham to whom he be recommend by many personal good quality by a ardent admiration for bentham a zealous adoption of many though not all of he opinion and not least by a extensive acquaintanceship and correspondence with liberal of all country which seem to qualify he for be a powerful agent in spread bentham 's fame and doctrine through all quarter of the world my father have see little of bowr but know enough of he to have form a strong opinion that he be a man of a entirely different type from what my father consider suitable for conduct a political and philosophical review : and he augur so ill of the enterprise that he regret it altogether feel persuade not only that mr bentham would lose he money but that discredit would probably be bring upon radical principle he could not however desert mr bentham and he consent to write a article for the first number as it have be a favorite portion of the scheme formerly talk of that part of the work should be devote to review the other review this article of my father 's be to be a general criticism of the _ edinburgh review _ from its commencement before write it he make I read through all the volume of the _ review _ or as much of each as seem of any importance -lrb- which be not so arduous a task in 1823 as it would be now -rrb- and make note for he of the article which i think he would wish to examine either on account of they good or they bad quality this paper of my father 's be the chief cause of the sensation which the _ westminster review _ produce at its first appearance and be both in conception and in execution one of the most striking of all he writings he begin by a analysis of the tendency of periodical literature in general point out that it can not like book wait for success but must succeed immediately or not at all and be hence almost certain to profess and inculcate the opinion already hold by the public to which it address itself instead of attempt to rectify or improve those opinion he next to characterize the position of the _ edinburgh review _ as a political organ enter into a complete analysis from the radical point of view of the british constitution he hold up to notice its thoroughly aristocratic character : the nomination of a majority of the house of common by a few hundred family the entire identification of the more independent portion the county member with the great landholder the different class whom this narrow oligarchy be induce for convenience to admit to a share of power and finally what he call its two prop the church and the legal profession he point out the natural tendency of a aristocratic body of this composition to group itself into two party one of they in possession of the executive the other endeavor to supplant the former and become the predominant section by the aid of public opinion without any essential sacrifice of the aristocratical predominance he describe the course likely to be pursue and the political ground occupy by a aristocratic party in opposition coquet with popular principle for the sake of popular support he show how this idea be realize in the conduct of the whig party and of the _ edinburgh review _ as its chief literary organ he describe as they main characteristic what he term seesaw write alternately on both side of the question which touch the power or interest of the govern class sometimes in different article sometimes in different part of the same article : and illustrate he position by copious specimen so formidable a attack on the whig party and policy have never before be make nor have so great a blow ever be strike in this country for radicalism nor be there i believe any live person capable of write that article except my father -lrb- 2 -rrb- in the meantime the nascent _ review _ have form a junction with another project of a purely literary periodical to be edit by mr henry southern afterwards a diplomatist then a literary man by profession the two editor agree to unite they corps and divide the editorship bowr take the political southern the literary department southern 's review be to have be publish by longman and that firm though part proprietor of the _ edinburgh _ be willing to be the publisher of the new journal but when all the arrangement have be make and the prospectus send out the longman see my father 's attack on the _ edinburgh _ and draw back my father be now appeal to for he interest with he own publisher baldwin which be exert with a successful result and so in April 1824 amidst anything but hope on my father 's part and that of most of those who afterwards aid in carry on the _ review _ the first number make its appearance that number be a agreeable surprise to most of we the average of the article be of much better quality than have be expect the literary and artistic department have rest chiefly on mr bingham a barrister -lrb- subsequently a police magistrate -rrb- who have be for some year a frequenter of bentham be a friend of both the austin and have adopt with great ardor mr bentham 's philosophical opinion partly from accident there be in the first number as many as five article by bingham and we be extremely pleased with they i well remember the mixed feeling i myself have about the _ review _ the joy of find what we do not at all expect that it be sufficiently good to be capable of be make a creditable organ of those who hold the opinion it profess and extreme vexation since it be so good on the whole at what we think the blemish of it when however in addition to we generally favourable opinion of it we learn that it have a extraordinary large sale for a first number and find that the appearance of a radical review with pretension equal to those of the established organ of party have excite much attention there could be no room for hesitation and we all become eager in do everything we could to strengthen and improve it my father continue to write occasional article the _ quarterly review _ receive its exposure as a sequel to that of the _ edinburgh _ of he other contribution the most important be a attack on southey 's _ book of the church _ in the fifth number and a political article in the twelfth mr austin only contribute one paper but one of great merit a argument against primogeniture in reply to a article then lately publish in the _ edinburgh review _ by mcculloch grote also be a contributor only once all the time he could spare be already take up with he _ history of greece _ the article he write be on he own subject and be a very complete exposure and castigation of mitford bingham and charle austin continue to write for some time fonblanque be a frequent contributor from the third number of my particular associate elli be a regular writer up to the ninth number and about the time when he leave off other of the set begin eyton tooke graham and roebuck i be myself the most frequent writer of all have contribute from the second number to the eighteenth thirteen article review of book on history and political economy or discussion on special political topic as corn law game law law of libel occasional article of merit come in from other acquaintance of my father 's and in time of mine and some of mr bowring 's writer turn out well on the whole however the conduct of the review be never satisfactory to any of the person strongly interested in its principle with whom i come in contact hardly ever do a number come out without contain several thing extremely offensive to we either in point of opinion of taste or by mere want of ability the unfavourable judgment pass by my father grote the two austin and other be re-echoed with exaggeration by we younger people and as we youthful zeal render we by no means backward in make complaint we lead the two editor a sad life from my knowledge of what i then be i have no doubt that we be at least as often wrong as right and i be very certain that if the _ review _ have be carry on accord to we notion -lrb- i mean those of the junior -rrb- it would have be no better perhaps not even so good as it be but it be worth note as a fact in the history of benthamism that the periodical organ by which it be best know be from the first extremely unsatisfactory to those whose opinion on all subject it be suppose specially to represent meanwhile however the _ review _ make considerable noise in the world and give a recognize _ status _ in the arena of opinion and discussion to the benthamic type of radicalism out of all proportion to the number of its adherent and to the personal merit and ability at that time of most of those who could be reckon among they it be a time as be know of rapidly rise liberalism when the fear and animosity accompany the war with france have be bring to a end and people have once more a place in they thought for home politics the tide begin to set towards reform the renew oppression of the continent by the old reign family the countenance apparently give by the english government to the conspiracy against liberty call the holy alliance and the enormous weight of the national debt and taxation occasion by so long and costly a war render the government and parliament very unpopular radicalism under the leadership of the burdett and cobbett have assume a character and importance which seriously alarm the administration : and they alarm have scarcely be temporarily assuage by the celebrated six act when the trial of queen caroline rouse a still wider and deeper feeling of hatred though the outward sign of this hatred pass away with its exciting cause there arise on all side a spirit which have never show itself before of opposition to abuse in detail mr hume 's persevere scrutiny of the public expenditure force the house of common to a division on every objectionable item in the estimate have begin to tell with great force on public opinion and have extort many minor retrenchment from a unwilling administration political economy have assert itself with great vigor in public affair by the petition of the merchant of london for free trade draw up in 1820 by mr tooke and present by mr alexander bare and by the noble exertion of ricardo during the few year of he parliamentary life he writings follow up the impulse give by the bullion controversy and follow up in they turn by the exposition and comment of my father and mcculloch -lrb- whose writings in the _ edinburgh review _ during those year be most valuable -rrb- have draw general attention to the subject making at least partial convert in the cabinet itself and huskisson support by canning have commence that gradual demolition of the protective system which one of they colleague virtually complete in 1846 though the last vestige be only sweep away by mr gladstone in 1860 mr peel then home secretary be enter cautiously into the untrodden and peculiarly benthamic path of law reform at this period when liberalism seem to be become the tone of the time when improvement of institution be preach from the highest place and a complete change of the constitution of parliament be loudly demand in the lowest it be not strange that attention should have be rouse by the regular appearance in controversy of what seem a new school of writer claim to be the legislator and theorist of this new tendency the air of strong conviction with which they write when scarcely anyone else seem to have a equally strong faith in as definite a creed the boldness with which they tilted against the very front of both the exist political party they uncompromising profession of opposition to many of the generally receive opinion and the suspicion they lay under of hold other still more heterodox than they profess the talent and verve of at least my father 's article and the appearance of a corps behind he sufficient to carry on a review and finally the fact that the _ review _ be buy and read make the so-called bentham school in philosophy and politics fill a greater place in the public mind than it have hold before or have ever again hold since other equally earnest school of thought have arise in england as i be in the headquarters of it know of what it be compose and as one of the most active of its very small number might say without undue assumption _ quorum par magna fui _ it belong to I more than to most other to give some account of it this suppose school then have no other existence than what be constitute by the fact that my father 's writings and conversation draw round he a certain number of young man who have already imbibe or who imbibe from he a greater or smaller portion of he very decide political and philosophical opinion the notion that bentham be surround by a band of disciple who receive they opinion from he lip be a fable to which my father do justice in he fragment on mackintosh and which to all who know mr bentham 's habit of life and manner of conversation be simply ridiculous the influence which bentham exercise be by he writings through they he have produce and be produce effect on the condition of mankind wider and deeper no doubt than any which can be attribute to my father he be a much greater name in history but my father exercise a far greater personal ascendency he _ be _ seek for the vigor and instructiveness of he conversation and do use it largely as a instrument for the diffusion of he opinion i have never know any man who could do such ample justice to he best thought in colloquial discussion he perfect command over he great mental resource the terseness and expressiveness of he language and the moral earnestness as well as intellectual force of he delivery make he one of the most striking of all argumentative converser : and he be full of anecdote a hearty laugher and when with people whom he like a most lively and amusing companion it be not solely or even chiefly in diffuse he merely intellectual conviction that he power show itself : it be still more through the influence of a quality of which i have only since learn to appreciate the extreme rarity : that exalted public spirit and regard above all thing to the good of the whole which warm into life and activity every germ of similar virtue that exist in the mind he come in contact with : the desire he make they feel for he approbation the shame at he disapproval the moral support which he conversation and he very existence give to those who be aim at the same object and the encouragement he afford to the faintheart or desponding among they by the firm confidence which -lrb- though the reverse of sanguine as to the result to be expect in any one particular case -rrb- he always feel in the power of reason the general progress of improvement and the good which individual could do by judicious effort if be my father 's opinion which give the distinguishing character to the benthamic or utilitarian propagandism of that time they fall singly scatter from he in many direction but they flow from he in a continued stream principally in three channel one be through I the only mind directly form by he instruction and through whom considerable influence be exercise over various young man who become in they turn propagandist a second be through some of the cambridge contemporary of charle austin who either initiate by he or under the general mental impulse which he give have adopt many opinion ally to those of my father and some of the more considerable of whom afterwards seek my father 's acquaintance and frequent he house among these may be mention strutt afterwards lord belper and the present lord romilly with whose eminent father sir samuel my father have of old be on term of friendship the third channel be that of a younger generation of cambridge undergraduate contemporary not with austin but with eyton tooke who be draw to that estimable person by affinity of opinion and introduce by he to my father : the most notable of these be charles buller various other person individually receive and transmit a considerable amount of my father 's influence : for example black -lrb- as before mention -rrb- and fonblanque : most of these however we account only partial ally fonblanque for instance be always divergent from we on many important point but indeed there be by no means complete unanimity among any portion of we nor have any of we adopt implicitly all my father 's opinion for example although he _ essay on government _ be regard probably by all of we as a masterpiece of political wisdom we adhesion by no means extend to the paragraph of it in which he maintain that woman may consistently with good government be exclude from the suffrage because they interest be the same with that of man from this doctrine i and all those who form my choose associate most positively dissent it be due to my father to say that he deny have intend to affirm that woman _ should _ be exclude any more than man under the age of forty concern whom he maintain in the very next paragraph a exactly similar thesis he be as he truly say not discuss whether the suffrage have better be restricted but only -lrb- assume that it be to be restricted -rrb- what be the utmost limit of restriction which do not necessarily involve a sacrifice of the security for good government but i think then as i have always think since that the opinion which he acknowledge no less than that which he disclaim be as great a error as any of those against which the _ essay _ be direct that the interest of woman be include in that of man exactly as much as the interest of subject be include in that of king and no more and that every reason which exist for give the suffrage to anybody demand that it should not be withhold from woman this be also the general opinion of the younger proselyte and it be pleasant to be able to say that mr bentham on this important point be wholly on we side but though none of we probably agree in every respect with my father he opinion as i say before be the principal element which give its color and character to the little group of young man who be the first propagator of what be afterwards call philosophic radicalism they mode of thinking be not characterize by benthamism in any sense which have relation to bentham as a chief or guide but rather by a combination of bentham 's point of view with that of the modern political economy and with the hartleian metaphysics malthus 's population principle be quite as much a banner and point of union among we as any opinion specially belong to bentham this great doctrine originally bring forward as a argument against the indefinite improvability of human affair we take up with ardent zeal in the contrary sense as indicate the sole means of realize that improvability by secure full employment at high wages to the whole labor population through a voluntary restriction of the increase of they number the other lead characteristic of the creed which we hold in common with my father may be state as follow : in politics a almost unbounded confidence in the efficacy of two thing : representative government and complete freedom of discussion so complete be my father 's reliance on the influence of reason over the mind of mankind whenever it be allow to reach they that he feel as if all would be gain if the whole population be teach to read if all sort of opinion be allow to be address to they by word and in write and if by means of the suffrage they could nominate a legislature to give effect to the opinion they adopt he think that when the legislature no longer represent a class interest it would aim at the general interest honestly and with adequate wisdom since the people would be sufficiently under the guidance of educate intelligence to make in general a good choice of person to represent they and have do so to leave to those whom they have choose a liberal discretion accordingly aristocratic rule the government of the few in any of its shape be in he eye the only thing which stand between mankind and a administration of they affair by the best wisdom to be find among they be the object of he sternest disapprobation and a democratic suffrage the principal article of he political creed not on the ground of liberty rights of man or any of the phrase more or less significant by which up to that time democracy have usually be defend but as the most essential of security for good government in this too he hold fast only to what he deem essential he be comparatively indifferent to monarchical or republican form -- far more so than bentham to whom a king in the character of corrupter-general appear necessarily very noxious next to aristocracy a established church or corporation of priest as be by position the great depraver of religion and interested in oppose the progress of the human mind be the object of he greatest detestation though he dislike no clergyman personally who do not deserve it and be on term of sincere friendship with several in ethic he moral feeling be energetic and rigid on all point which he deem important to human well be while he be supremely indifferent in opinion -lrb- though he indifference do not show itself in personal conduct -rrb- to all those doctrine of the common morality which he think have no foundation but in asceticism and priestcraft he look forward for example to a considerable increase of freedom in the relation between the sex though without pretend to define exactly what would be or ought to be the precise condition of that freedom this opinion be connect in he with no sensuality either of a theoretical or of a practical kind he anticipate on the contrary as one of the beneficial effect of increase freedom that the imagination would no longer dwell upon the physical relation and its adjunct and swell this into one of the principal object of life a perversion of the imagination and feeling which he regard as one of the deepest seat and most pervading evil in the human mind in psychology he fundamental doctrine be the formation of all human character by circumstance through the universal principle of association and the consequent unlimited possibility of improve the moral and intellectual condition of mankind by education of all he doctrine none be more important than this or need more to be insist on unfortunately there be none which be more contradictory to the prevail tendency of speculation both in he time and since these various opinion be seize on with youthful fanaticism by the little knot of young man of whom i be one : and we put into they a sectarian spirit from which in intention at least my father be wholly free what we -lrb- or rather a phantom substitute in the place of we -rrb- be sometimes by a ridiculous exaggeration call by other namely a school some of we for a time really hope and aspire to be the french _ philosophe _ of the eighteenth century be the example we seek to imitate and we hope to accomplish no less result no one of the set go to so great excess in he boyish ambition as i do which might be show by many particulars be it not a useless waste of space and time all this however be properly only the outside of we existence or at least the intellectual part alone and no more than one side of that in attempt to penetrate inward and give any indication of what we be as human being i must be understand as speak only of myself of whom alone i can speak from sufficient knowledge and i do not believe that the picture would suit any of my companion without many and great modification i conceive that the description so often give of a benthamite as a mere reasoning machine though extremely inapplicable to most of those who have be designate by that title be during two or three year of my life not altogether untrue of I it be perhaps as applicable to I as it can well be to anyone just enter into life to whom the common object of desire must in general have at least the attraction of novelty there be nothing very extraordinary in this fact : no youth of the age i then be can be expect to be more than one thing and this be the thing i happen to be ambition and desire of distinction i have in abundance and zeal for what i think the good of mankind be my strongest sentiment mix with and color all other but my zeal be as yet little else at that period of my life than zeal for speculative opinion it have not its root in genuine benevolence or sympathy with mankind though these quality hold they due place in my ethical standard nor be it connect with any high enthusiasm for ideal nobleness yet of this feeling i be imaginatively very susceptible but there be at that time a intermission of its natural aliment poetical culture while there be a superabundance of the discipline antagonistic to it that of mere logic and analysis add to this that as already mention my father 's teaching tend to the undervaluing of feel it be not that he be himself cold-hearted or insensible i believe it be rather from the contrary quality he think that feeling could take care of itself that there be sure to be enough of it if action be properly care about offend by the frequency with which in ethical and philosophical controversy feeling be make the ultimate reason and justification of conduct instead of be itself call on for a justification while in practice action the effect of which on human happiness be mischievous be defend as be require by feeling and the character of a person of feeling obtain a credit for desert which he think only due to action he have a real impatience of attribute praise to feeling or of any but the most spare reference to it either in the estimation of person or in the discussion of thing in addition to the influence which this characteristic in he have on I and other we find all the opinion to which we attach most importance constantly attack on the ground of feeling utility be denounce as cold calculation political economy as hard-hearted anti-population doctrine as repulsive to the natural feeling of mankind we retort by the word sentimentality which along with declamation and vague generality serve we as common term of opprobrium although we be generally in the right as against those who be oppose to we the effect be that the cultivation of feeling -lrb- except the feeling of public and private duty -rrb- be not in much esteem among we and have very little place in the thought of most of we myself in particular what we principally think of be to alter people 's opinion to make they believe accord to evidence and know what be they real interest which when they once know they would we think by the instrument of opinion enforce a regard to it upon one another while fully recognize the superior excellence of unselfish benevolence and love of justice we do not expect the regeneration of mankind from any direct action on those sentiment but from the effect of educate intellect enlighten the selfish feeling although this last be prodigiously important as a means of improvement in the hand of those who be themselves impel by nobler principle of action i do not believe that any one of the survivor of the benthamite or utilitarian of that day now rely mainly upon it for the general amendment of human conduct from this neglect both in theory and in practice of the cultivation of feeling naturally result among other thing a undervaluing of poetry and of imagination generally as a element of human nature it be or be part of the popular notion of benthamite that they be enemy of poetry : this be partly true of bentham himself he use to say that all poetry be misrepresentation : but in the sense in which he say it the same might have be say of all impressive speech of all representation or inculcation more oratorical in its character than a sum in arithmetic a article of bingham 's in the first number of the _ westminster review _ in which he offer as a explanation of something which he dislike in moore that mr moore _ be _ a poet and therefore be _ not _ a reasoner do a good deal to attach the notion of hate poetry to the writer in the _ review _ but the truth be that many of we be great reader of poetry bingham himself have be a writer of it while as regard I -lrb- and the same thing might be say of my father -rrb- the correct statement would be not that i disliked poetry but that i be theoretically indifferent to it i dislike any sentiment in poetry which i should have dislike in prose and that include a great deal and i be wholly blind to its place in human culture as a means of educate the feeling but i be always personally very susceptible to some kind of it in the most sectarian period of my benthamism i happen to look into pope 's _ essay on man _ and though every opinion in it be contrary to mine i well remember how powerfully it act on my imagination perhaps at that time poetical composition of any higher type than eloquent discussion in verse might not have produce a similar effect upon I : at all event i seldom give it a opportunity this however be a mere passive state long before i have enlarged in any considerable degree the basis of my intellectual creed i have obtain in the natural course of my mental progress poetic culture of the most valuable kind by means of reverential admiration for the life and character of heroic person especially the hero of philosophy the same inspiring effect which so many of the benefactor of mankind have leave on record that they have experience from plutarch 's _ live _ be produce on I by plato 's picture of socrate and by some modern biography above all by condorcet 's _ life of turgot _ a book well calculate to rouse the best sort of enthusiasm since it contain one of the wisest and noblest of life delineate by one of the wisest and noblest of man the heroic virtue of these glorious representative of the opinion with which i sympathize deeply affect I and i perpetually recur to they as other do to a favorite poet when need to be carry up into the more elevated region of feeling and think i may observe by the way that this book cure I of my sectarian folly the two or three page begin il regardait toute secte comme nuisible and explain why turgot always keep himself perfectly distinct from the encyclopedist sink deeply into my mind i leave off designate myself and other as utilitarian and by the pronoun we or any other collective designation i cease to _ afficher _ sectarianism my real inward sectarianism i do not get rid of till later and much more gradually about the end of 1824 or beginning of 1825 mr bentham have lately get back he papers on evidence from m dumont -lrb- whose _ trait des preuves judiciaire _ ground on they be then first complete and publish -rrb- resolve to have they print in the original and bethought himself of I as capable of prepare they for the press in the same manner as he _ book of fallacy _ have be recently edit by bingham i gladly undertake this task and it occupy nearly all my leisure for about a year exclusive of the time afterwards spend in see the five large volume through the press mr bentham have begin this treatise three time 's at considerable interval each time in a different manner and each time without reference to the precede : two of the three time he have go over nearly the whole subject these three mass of manuscript it be my business to condense into a single treatise adopt the one last write as the groundwork and incorporate with it as much of the two other as it have not completely supersede i have also to unroll such of bentham 's involve and parenthetical sentence as seem to overpass by they complexity the measure of what reader be likely to take the pain to understand it be further mr bentham 's particular desire that i should from myself endeavor to supply any _ lacuna _ which he have leave and at he instance i read for this purpose the most authoritative treatise on the english law of evidence and comment on a few of the objectionable point of the english rule which have escape bentham 's notice i also reply to the objection which have be make to some of he doctrine by reviewer of dumont 's book and add a few supplementary remark on some of the more abstract part of the subject such as the theory of improbability and impossibility the controversial part of these editorial addition be write in a more assume tone than become one so young and inexperienced as i be : but indeed i have never contemplate come forward in my own person and as a anonymous editor of bentham i fall into the tone of my author not think it unsuitable to he or to the subject however it might be so to I my name as editor be put to the book after it be print at mr bentham 's positive desire which i in vain attempt to persuade he to forego the time occupy in this editorial work be extremely well employ in respect to my own improvement the _ rationale of judicial evidence _ be one of the richest in matter of all bentham 's production the theory of evidence be in itself one of the most important of he subject and ramify into most of the other the book contain very fully develop a great proportion of all he best thought : while among more special thing it comprise the most elaborate exposure of the vice and defect of english law as it then be which be to be find in he work not confine to the law of evidence but include by way of illustrative episode the entire procedure or practice of westminster hall the direct knowledge therefore which i obtain from the book and which be imprint upon I much more thoroughly than it could have be by mere reading be itself no small acquisition but this occupation do for I what might seem less to be expect it give a great start to my power of composition everything which i write subsequently to this editorial employment be markedly superior to anything that i have write before it bentham 's later style as the world know be heavy and cumbersome from the excess of a good quality the love of precision which make he introduce clause within clause into the heart of every sentence that the reader might receive into he mind all the modification and qualification simultaneously with the main proposition : and the habit grow on he until he sentence become to those not accustom to they most laborious reading but he earlier style that of the _ fragment on government plan of a judicial establishment _ etc be a model of liveliness and ease combine with fulness of matter scarcely ever surpass : and of this earlier style there be many striking specimen in the manuscript on evidence all of which i endeavor to preserve so long a course of this admirable writing have a considerable effect upon my own and i add to it by the assiduous reading of other writer both french and english who combine in a remarkable degree ease with force such as goldsmith fielding pascal voltaire and courier through these influence my write lose the jejuneness of my early composition the bone and cartilage begin to clothe themselves with flesh and the style become at time lively and almost light this improvement be first exhibit in a new field mr marshall of leed father of the present generation of marshall the same who be bring into parliament for yorkshire when the representation forfeit by grampound be transfer to it a earnest parliamentary reformer and a man of large fortune of which he make a liberal use have be much strike with bentham 's _ book of fallacy _ and the thought have occur to he that it would be useful to publish annually the parliamentary debate not in the chronological order of hansard but classify accord to subject and accompany by a commentary point out the fallacy of the speaker with this intention he very naturally address himself to the editor of the _ book of fallacy _ and bingham with the assistance of charle austin undertake the editorship the work be call _ parliamentary history and review _ its sale be not sufficient to keep it in existence and it only last three year it excite however some attention among parliamentary and political people the best strength of the party be put forth in it and its execution do they much more credit than that of the _ westminster review _ have ever do bingham and charle austin write much in it as do strutt romilly and several other liberal lawyer my father write one article in he best style the elder austin another coulson write one of great merit it fall to my lot to lead off the first number by a article on the principal topic of the session -lrb- that of 1825 -rrb- the catholic association and the catholic disability in the second number i write a elaborate essay on the commercial crisis of 1825 and the currency debate in the third i have two article one on a minor subject the other on the reciprocity principle in commerce _  propo _ of a celebrated diplomatic correspondence between canning and gallatin these writings be no longer mere reproduction and application of the doctrine i have be teach they be original thinking as far as that name can be apply to old idea in new form and connexion : and i do not exceed the truth in say that there be a maturity and a well-digested character about they which there have not be in any of my previous performance in execution therefore they be not at all juvenile but they subject have either go by or have be so much better treat since that they be entirely supersede and should remain bury in the same oblivion with my contribution to the first dynasty of the _ westminster review _ while thus engage in write for the public i do not neglect other mode of self-cultivation it be at this time that i learn german begin it on the hamiltonian method for which purpose i and several of my companion form a class for several year from this period we social study assume a shape which contribute very much to my mental progress the idea occur to we of carry on by reading and conversation a joint study of several of the branch of science which we wish to be master of we assemble to the number of a dozen or more mr grote lend a room of he house in threadneedle street for the purpose and he partner prescott one of the three original member of the utilitarian society make one among we we meet two morning in every week from half-past eight till ten at which hour most of we be call off to we daily occupation we first subject be political economy we choose some systematic treatise as we text-book my father 's _ element _ be we first choice one of we read aloud a chapter or some smaller portion of the book the discussion be then open and anyone who have a objection or other remark to make make it we rule be to discuss thoroughly every point raise whether great or small prolong the discussion until all who take part be satisfy with the conclusion they have individually arrive at and to follow up every topic of collateral speculation which the chapter or the conversation suggest never leave it until we have untied every knot which we find we repeatedly keep up the discussion of some one point for several week think intently on it during the interval of we meeting and contrive solution of the new difficulty which have rise up in the last morning 's discussion when we have finish in this way my father 's _ element _ we go in the same manner through ricardo 's _ principle of political economy _ and bailey 's _ dissertation on value _ these close and vigorous discussion be not only improve in a high degree to those who take part in they but bring out new view of some topic of abstract political economy the theory of international value which i afterwards publish emanate from these conversation as do also the modified form of ricardo 's _ theory of profit _ lay down in my _ essay on profit and interest _ those among we with whom new speculation chiefly originate be elli graham and i though other give valuable aid to the discussion especially prescott and roebuck the one by he knowledge the other by he dialectical acuteness the theory of international value and of profit be excogitate and work out in about equal proportion by myself and graham : and if we original project have be execute my _ essay on some unsettled question of political economy _ would have be bring out along with some papers of he under we joint name but when my exposition come to be write i find that i have so much over-estimated my agreement with he and he dissent so much from the most original of the two essay that on international value that i be oblige to consider the theory as now exclusively mine and it come out as such when publish many year later i may mention that among the alteration which my father make in revise he _ element _ for the third edition several be found on criticism elicit by these conversation and in particular he modify he opinion -lrb- though not to the extent of we new speculation -rrb- on both the point to which i have advert when we have enough of political economy we take up the syllogistic logic in the same manner grote now join we we first text-book be aldrich but be disgust with its superficiality we reprint one of the most finish among the many manual of the school logic which my father a great collector of such book possess the _ manuductio ad logicam _ of the jesuit du trieu after finish this we take up whately 's _ logic _ then first republish from the _ encyclopedia metropolitana _ and finally the _ computatio sive logica _ of hobbe these book deal with in we manner afford a high range for original metaphysical speculation : and most of what have be do in the first book of my _ system of logic _ to rationalize and correct the principle and distinction of the school logician and to improve the theory of the import of proposition have its origin in these discussion graham and i originate most of the novelty while grote and other furnish a excellent tribunal or test from this time i form the project of write a book on logic though on a much humbler scale than the one i ultimately execute have do with logic we launch into analytic psychology and have choose hartley for we text-book we raise priestley 's edition to a extravagant price by search through london to furnish each of we with a copy when we have finish hartley we suspend we meeting but my father 's _ analysis of the mind _ be publish soon after we reassemble for the purpose of read it with this we exercise end i have always date from these conversation my own real inauguration as a original and independent thinker it be also through they that i acquire or very much strengthen a mental habit to which i attribute all that i have ever do or ever shall do in speculation : that of never accept half-solution of difficulty as complete never abandon a puzzle but again and again return to it until it be clear up never allow obscure corner of a subject to remain unexplored because they do not appear important never think that i perfectly understand any part of a subject until i understand the whole we doings from 1825 to 1830 in the way of public speaking fill a considerable place in my life during those year and as they have important effect on my development something ought to be say of they there be for some time in existence a society of owenite call the co-operative society which meet for weekly public discussion in chancery lane in the early part of 1825 accident bring roebuck in contact with several of its member and lead to he attend one or two of the meeting and take part in the debate in opposition to owenism some one of we start the notion of go there in a body and have a general battle : and charle austin and some of he friend who do not usually take part in we joint exercise enter into the project it be carry out by concert with the principal member of the society themselves nothing loth as they naturally prefer a controversy with opponent to a tame discussion among they own body the question of population be propose as the subject of debate : charle austin lead the case on we side with a brilliant speech and the fight be keep up by adjournment through five or six weekly meeting before crowded auditory include along with the member of the society and they friend many hearer and some speaker from the inn of court when this debate be end another be commence on the general merit of owen 's system : and the contest altogether last about three month it be a _ lutte corps  corps _ between owenite and political economist whom the owenite regard as they most inveterate opponent : but it be a perfectly friendly dispute we who represent political economy have the same object in view as they have and take pain to show it and the principal champion on they side be a very estimable man with whom i be well acquaint mr william thompson of cork author of a book on the distribution of wealth and of a appeal in behalf of woman against the passage relate to they in my father 's _ essay on government _ elli roebuck and i take a active part in the debate and among those from the inn of court who join in it i remember charle villier the other side obtain also on the population question very efficient support from without the well-known gale jone then a elderly man make one of he florid speech but the speaker with whom i be most strike though i dissent from nearly every word he say be thirlwall the historian since bishop of st david 's then a chancery barrister unknown except by a high reputation for eloquence acquire at the cambridge union before the era of austin and macaulay he speech be in answer to one of mine before he have utter ten sentence i set he down as the best speaker i have ever hear and i have never since hear anyone whom i place above he the great interest of these debate predispose some of those who take part in they to catch at a suggestion throw out by mcculloch the political economist that a society be want in london similar to the speculative society at edinburgh in which brougham horner and other first cultivate public speak we experience at the co-operative society seem to give cause for be sanguine as to the sort of man who might be bring together in london for such a purpose mcculloch mention the matter to several young man of influence to whom he be then give private lesson in political economy some of these enter warmly into the project particularly george villier after earl of clarendon he and he brother hyde and charle romilly charle austin and i with some other meet and agree on a plan we determine to meet once a fortnight from November to June at the freemason ' tavern and we have soon a fine list of member contain along with several member of parliament nearly all the most note speaker of the cambridge union and of the oxford unite debate society it be curiously illustrative of the tendency of the time that we principal difficulty in recruit for the society be to find a sufficient number of tory speaker almost all whom we could press into the service be liberal of different order and degree besides those already name we have macaulay thirlwall praed lord howick samuel wilberforce -lrb- afterwards bishop of oxford -rrb- charle poulett thomson -lrb- afterwards lord sydenham -rrb- edward and henry lytton bulwer fonblanque and many other whom i can not now recollect but who make themselves afterwards more or less conspicuous in public or literary life nothing could seem more promising but when the time for action draw near and it be necessary to fix on a president and find somebody to open the first debate none of we celebrity would consent to perform either office of the many who be press on the subject the only one who could be prevail on be a man of whom i know very little but who have take high honor at oxford and be say to have acquire a great oratorical reputation there who some time afterwards become a tory member of parliament he accordingly be fix on both for fill the president 's chair and for make the first speech the important day arrive the bench be crowd all we great speaker be present to judge of but not to help we effort the oxford orator 's speech be a complete failure this throw a damp on the whole concern : the speaker who follow be few and none of they do they best : the affair be a complete _ fiasco _ and the oratorical celebrity we have count on go away never to return give to I at least a lesson in knowledge of the world this unexpected breakdown altered my whole relation to the project i have not anticipate take a prominent part or speak much or often particularly at first but i now see that the success of the scheme depend on the new man and i put my shoulder to the wheel i open the second question and from that time speak in nearly every debate it be very uphill work for some time the three villier and romilly stick to we for some time longer but the patience of all the founder of the society be at last exhaust except I and roebuck in the season follow 1826-7 thing begin to mend we have acquire two excellent tory speaker hayward and shee -lrb- afterwards sergeant shee -rrb- : the radical side be reinforce by charle buller cockburn and other of the second generation of cambridge benthamity and with they and other occasional aid and the two tory as well as roebuck and I for regular speaker almost every debate be a _ bataille range _ between the philosophic radical and the tory lawyer until we conflict be talk about and several person of note and consideration come to hear we this happen still more in the subsequent season 1828 and 1829 when the coleridgian in the person of maurice and sterling make they appearance in the society as a second liberal and even radical party on totally different grounds from benthamism and vehemently oppose to it bring into these discussion the general doctrine and mode of thought of the european reaction against the philosophy of the eighteenth century and add a third and very important belligerent party to we contest which be now no bad exponent of the movement of opinion among the most cultivate part of the new generation we debate be very different from those of common debate society for they habitually consist of the strongest argument and most philosophic principle which either side be able to produce throw often into close and _ serr _ confutation of one another the practice be necessarily very useful to we and eminently so to I i never indeed acquire real fluency and have always a bad and ungraceful delivery but i could make myself listen to : and as i always write my speech when from the feeling involve or the nature of the idea to be develop expression seem important i greatly increase my power of effective write acquire not only a ear for smoothness and rhythm but a practical sense for _ tell _ sentence and a immediate criterion of they tell property by they effect on a mixed audience the society and the preparation for it together with the preparation for the morning conversation which be go on simultaneously occupy the greater part of my leisure and make I feel it a relief when in the spring of 1828 i cease to write for the _ westminster _ the _ review _ have fall into difficulty though the sale of the first number have be very encourage the permanent sale have never i believe be sufficient to pay the expense on the scale on which the _ review _ be carry on those expense have be considerably but not sufficiently reduce one of the editor southern have resign and several of the writer include my father and I who have be pay like other contributor for we earlier article have latterly write without payment nevertheless the original fund be nearly or quite exhaust and if the _ review _ be to be continue some new arrangement of its affair have become indispensable my father and i have several conference with bowr on the subject we be willing to do we utmost for maintain the _ review _ as a organ of we opinion but not under bowring 's editorship : while the impossibility of its any longer support a pay editor afford a ground on which without affront to he we could propose to dispense with he service we and some of we friend be prepare to carry on the _ review _ as unpaid writer either finding among ourselves a unpaid editor or share the editorship among we but while this negotiation be proceed with bowring 's apparent acquiescence he be carry on another in a different quarter -lrb- with colonel perronet thompson -rrb- of which we receive the first intimation in a letter from bowr as editor inform we merely that a arrangement have be make and propose to we to write for the next number with promise of payment we do not dispute bowring 's right to bring about if he could a arrangement more favourable to himself than the one we have propose but we think the concealment which he have practice towards we while seemingly enter into we own project a affront : and even have we not think so we be indispose to expend any more of we time and trouble in attempt to write up the _ review _ under he management accordingly my father excuse himself from write though two or three year later on great pressure he do write one more political article as for I i positively refuse and thus end my connexion with the original _ westminster _ the last article which i write in it have cost I more labor than any previous but it be a labor of love be a defense of the early french revolutionist against the tory misrepresentation of sir walter scott in the introduction to he _ life of napoleon _ the number of book which i read for this purpose make note and extract -- even the number i have to buy -lrb- for in those day there be no public or subscription library from which book of reference could be take home -rrb- -- far exceed the worth of the immediate object but i have at that time a half-formed intention of write a history of the french revolution and though i never execute it my collection afterwards be very useful to carlyle for a similar purpose chapter v crisis in my mental history one stage onward for some year after this time i write very little and nothing regularly for publication : and great be the advantage which i derive from the intermission it be of no common importance to I at this period to be able to digest and mature my thought for my own mind only without any immediate call for give they out in print have i go on write it would have much disturbed the important transformation in my opinion and character which take place during those year the origin of this transformation or at least the process by which i be prepare for it can only be explain by turn some distance back from the winter of 1821 when i first read bentham and especially from the commencement of the _ westminster review _ i have what might truly be call a object in life to be a reformer of the world my conception of my own happiness be entirely identify with this object the personal sympathy i wish for be those of fellow labourer in this enterprise i endeavor to pick up as many flower as i could by the way but as a serious and permanent personal satisfaction to rest upon my whole reliance be place on this and i be accustom to felicitate myself on the certainty of a happy life which i enjoy through place my happiness in something durable and distant in which some progress might be always make while it could never be exhaust by complete attainment this do very well for several year during which the general improvement go on in the world and the idea of myself as engage with other in struggle to promote it seem enough to fill up a interesting and animated existence but the time come when i awaken from this as from a dream it be in the autumn of 1826 i be in a dull state of nerve such as everybody be occasionally liable to unsusceptible to enjoyment or pleasurable excitement one of those mood when what be pleasure at other time become insipid or indifferent the state i should think in which convert to methodism usually be when smite by they first conviction of sin in this frame of mind it occur to I to put the question directly to myself : suppose that all you object in life be realize that all the change in institution and opinion which you be look forward to could be completely effect at this very instant : would this be a great joy and happiness to you and a irrepressible self-consciousness distinctly answer no at this my heart sink within I : the whole foundation on which my life be construct fall down all my happiness be to have be find in the continual pursuit of this end the end have cease to charm and how could there ever again be any interest in the means i seem to have nothing leave to live for at first i hope that the cloud would pass away of itself but it do not a night 's sleep the sovereign remedy for the smaller vexation of life have no effect on it i awake to a renew consciousness of the woful fact i carry it with I into all company into all occupation hardly anything have power to cause I even a few minute ' oblivion of it for some month the cloud seem to grow thicker and thicker the line in coleridge 's _ dejection _ -- i be not then acquaint with they -- exactly describe my case : a grief without a pang void dark and drear a drowsy stifle unimpassioned grief which find no natural outlet or relief in word or sigh or tear in vain i seek relief from my favorite book those memorial of past nobleness and greatness from which i have always hitherto draw strength and animation i read they now without feeling or with the accustomed feeling minus all its charm and i become persuade that my love of mankind and of excellence for its own sake have worn itself out i seek no comfort by speak to other of what i feel if i have love anyone sufficiently to make confide my grief a necessity i should not have be in the condition i be i feel too that mine be not a interesting or in any way respectable distress there be nothing in it to attract sympathy advice if i have know where to seek it would have be most precious the word of macbeth to the physician often occur to my thought but there be no one on whom i could build the faintest hope of such assistance my father to whom it would have be natural to I to have recourse in any practical difficulty be the last person to whom in such a case as this i look for help everything convinced I that he have no knowledge of any such mental state as i be suffer from and that even if he could be make to understand it he be not the physician who could heal it my education which be wholly he work have be conduct without any regard to the possibility of its end in this result and i see no use in give he the pain of think that he plan have fail when the failure be probably irremediable and at all event beyond the power of _ he _ remedy of other friend i have at that time none to whom i have any hope of make my condition intelligible it be however abundantly intelligible to myself and the more i dwelt upon it the more hopeless it appear my course of study have lead I to believe that all mental and moral feeling and quality whether of a good or of a bad kind be the result of association that we love one thing and hate another take pleasure in one sort of action or contemplation and pain in another sort through the clinging of pleasurable or painful idea to those thing from the effect of education or of experience as a corollary from this i have always hear it maintain by my father and be myself convince that the object of education should be to form the strongest possible association of the salutary class association of pleasure with all thing beneficial to the great whole and of pain with all thing hurtful to it this doctrine appear inexpugnable but it now seem to I on retrospect that my teacher have occupy themselves but superficially with the means of form and keep up these salutary association they seem to have trust altogether to the old familiar instrument praise and blame reward and punishment now i do not doubt that by these means begin early and apply unremittingly intense association of pain and pleasure especially of pain might be create and might produce desire and aversion capable of last undiminished to the end of life but there must always be something artificial and casual in association thus produce the pain and pleasure thus forcibly associate with thing be not connect with they by any natural tie and it be therefore i think essential to the durability of these association that they should have become so intense and inveterate as to be practically indissoluble before the habitual exercise of the power of analysis have commence for i now saw or think i see what i have always before receive with incredulity -- that the habit of analysis have a tendency to wear away the feeling : as indeed it have when no other mental habit be cultivate and the analyze spirit remain without its natural complement and corrective the very excellence of analysis -lrb- i argue -rrb- be that it tend to weaken and undermine whatever be the result of prejudice that it enable we mentally to separate idea which have only casually cling together : and no association whatever could ultimately resist this dissolve force be it not that we owe to analysis we clearest knowledge of the permanent sequence in nature the real connexion between thing not dependent on we will and feeling natural law by virtue of which in many case one thing be inseparable from another in fact which law in proportion as they be clearly perceive and imaginatively realize cause we idea of thing which be always join together in nature to cohere more and more closely in we thought analytic habit may thus even strengthen the association between cause and effect mean and end but tend altogether to weaken those which be to speak familiarly a _ mere _ matter of feeling they be therefore -lrb- i thought -rrb- favourable to prudence and clear - sightedness but a perpetual worm at the root both of the passion and of the virtue and above all fearfully undermine all desire and all pleasure which be the effect of association that be accord to the theory i hold all except the purely physical and organic of the entire insufficiency of which to make life desirable no one have a stronger conviction than i have these be the law of human nature by which as it seem to I i have be bring to my present state all those to whom i look up be of opinion that the pleasure of sympathy with human being and the feeling which make the good of other and especially of mankind on a large scale the object of existence be the greatest and surest source of happiness of the truth of this i be convinced but to know that a feeling would make I happy if i have it do not give I the feeling my education i think have fail to create these feeling in sufficient strength to resist the dissolve influence of analysis while the whole course of my intellectual cultivation have make precocious and premature analysis the inveterate habit of my mind i be thus as i say to myself leave strand at the commencement of my voyage with a well-equipped ship and a rudder but no sail without any real desire for the end which i have be so carefully fit out to work for : no delight in virtue or the general good but also just as little in anything else the fountain of vanity and ambition seem to have dry up within I as completely as those of benevolence i have have -lrb- as i reflect -rrb- some gratification of vanity at too early a age : i have obtain some distinction and feel myself of some importance before the desire of distinction and of importance have grow into a passion : and little as it be which i have attain yet have be attain too early like all pleasure enjoy too soon it have make I _ blas _ and indifferent to the pursuit thus neither selfish nor unselfish pleasure be pleasure to I and there seem no power in nature sufficient to begin the formation of my character anew and create in a mind now irretrievably analytic fresh association of pleasure with any of the object of human desire these be the thought which mingle with the dry heavy dejection of the melancholy winter of 1826-7 during this time i be not incapable of my usual occupation i go on with they mechanically by the mere force of habit i have be so drill in a certain sort of mental exercise that i could still carry it on when all the spirit have go out of it i even compose and speak several speech at the debate society how or with what degree of success i know not of four year ' continual speaking at that society this be the only year of which i remember next to nothing two line of coleridge in whom alone of all writer i have find a true description of what i feel be often in my thought not at this time -lrb- for i have never read they -rrb- but in a later period of the same mental malady : work without hope draw nectar in a sieve and hope without a object can not live in all probability my case be by no means so peculiar as i fancy it and i doubt not that many other have pass through a similar state but the idiosyncrasy of my education have give to the general phenomenon a special character which make it seem the natural effect of cause that it be hardly possible for time to remove i frequently ask myself if i could or if i be bind to go on living when life must be pass in this manner i generally answer to myself that i do not think i could possibly bear it beyond a year when however not more than half that duration of time have elapse a small ray of light break in upon my gloom i be read accidentally marmontel 's _ mmoires _ and come to the passage which relate he father 's death the distressed position of the family and the sudden inspiration by which he then a mere boy feel and make they feel that he would be everything to they -- would supply the place of all that they have lose a vivid conception of the scene and its feeling come over I and i be move to tear from this moment my burden grow lighter the oppression of the thought that all feeling be dead within I be go i be no longer hopeless : i be not a stock or a stone i have still it seem some of the material out of which all worth of character and all capacity for happiness be make relieved from my ever-present sense of irremediable wretchedness i gradually find that the ordinary incident of life could again give I some pleasure that i could again find enjoyment not intense but sufficient for cheerfulness in sunshine and sky in book in conversation in public affair and that there be once more excitement though of a moderate kind in exert myself for my opinion and for the public good thus the cloud gradually draw off and i again enjoy life and though i have several relapse some of which last many month i never again be as miserable as i have be the experience of this period have two very marked effect on my opinion and character in the first place they lead I to adopt a theory of life very unlike that on which i have before i act and have much in common with what at that time i certainly have never hear of the anti-self - consciousness theory of carlyle i never indeed waver in the conviction that happiness be the test of all rule of conduct and the end of life but i now think that this end be only to be attain by not make it the direct end those only be happy -lrb- i thought -rrb- who have they mind fix on some object other than they own happiness on the happiness of other on the improvement of mankind even on some art or pursuit follow not as a means but as itself a ideal end aim thus at something else they find happiness by the way the enjoyment of life -lrb- such be now my theory -rrb- be sufficient to make it a pleasant thing when they be take _ en passant _ without be make a principal object once make they so and they be immediately feel to be insufficient they will not bear a scrutinize examination ask yourself whether you be happy and you cease to be so the only chance be to treat not happiness but some end external to it as the purpose of life let you self-consciousness you scrutiny you self-interrogation exhaust themselves on that and if otherwise fortunately circumstance you will inhale happiness with the air you breathe without dwelling on it or think about it without either forestall it in imagination or put it to flight by fatal question this theory now become the basis of my philosophy of life and i still hold to it as the best theory for all those who have but a moderate degree of sensibility and of capacity i for enjoyment that be for the great majority of mankind the other important change which my opinion at this time undergo be that i for the first time give its proper place among the prime necessity of human well-being to the internal culture of the individual i cease to attach almost exclusive importance to the order of outward circumstance and the training of the human be for speculation and for action i have now learn by experience that the pass susceptibility need to be cultivate as well as the active capacity and require to be nourished and enriched as well as guide i do not for a instant lose sight of or undervalue that part of the truth which i have see before i never turn recreant to intellectual culture or cease to consider the power and practice of analysis as a essential condition both of individual and of social improvement but 1 think that it have consequence which require to be correct by join other kind of cultivation with it the maintenance of a due balance among the faculty now seem to be of primary importance the cultivation of the feeling become one of the cardinal point in my ethical and philosophical creed and my thought and inclination turn in a increase degree towards whatever seem capable of be instrumental to that object i now begin to find meaning in the thing which i have read or hear about the importance of poetry and art as instrument of human culture but it be some time longer before i begin to know this by personal experience the only one of the imaginative art in which i have from childhood take great pleasure be music the best effect of which -lrb- and in this it surpass perhaps every other art -rrb- consist in exciting enthusiasm in wind up to a high pitch those feeling of a elevated kind which be already in the character but to which this excitement give a glow and a fervor which though transitory at its utmost height be precious for sustain they at other time this effect of music i have often experienced but like all my pleasurable susceptibility it be suspend during the gloomy period i have seek relief again and again from this quarter but find none after the tide have turn and i be in process of recovery i have be help forward by music but in a much less elevated manner i at this time first become acquaint with weber 's _ oberon _ and the extreme pleasure which i draw from its delicious melody do I good by show I a source of pleasure to which i be as susceptible as ever the good however be much impaired by the thought that the pleasure of music -lrb- as be quite true of such pleasure as this be that of mere tune -rrb- fade with familiarity and require either to be revive by intermittence or feed by continual novelty and it be very characteristic both of my then state and of the general tone of my mind at this period of my life that i be seriously torment by the thought of the exhaustibility of musical combination the octave consist only of five tone and two semi-tone which can be put together in only a limited number of way of which but a small proportion be beautiful : most of these it seem to I must have be already discover and there could not be room for a long succession of mozart and weber to strike out as these have do entirely new and surpassingly rich vein of musical beauty this source of anxiety may perhaps be think to resemble that of the philosopher of laputa who fear lest the sun should be burn out it be however connect with the best feature in my character and the only good point to be find in my very unromantic and in no way honorable distress for though my dejection honestly look at could not be call other than egotistical produce by the ruin as i thought of my fabric of happiness yet the destiny of mankind in general be ever in my thought and could not be separate from my own i feel that the flaw in my life must be a flaw in life itself that the question be whether if the reformer of society and government could succeed in they object and every person in the community be free and in a state of physical comfort the pleasure of life be no longer keep up by struggle and privation would cease to be pleasure and i feel that unless i could see my way to some better hope than this for human happiness in general my dejection must continue but that if i could see such a outlet i should then look on the world with pleasure content as far as i be myself concern with any fair share of the general lot this state of my thought and feeling make the fact of my reading wordsworth for the first time -lrb- in the autumn of 1828 -rrb- a important event of my life i take up the collection of he poem from curiosity with no expectation of mental relief from it though i have before resort to poetry with that hope in the worst period of my depression i have read through the whole of byron -lrb- then new to I -rrb- to try whether a poet whose peculiar department be suppose to be that of the intenser feeling could rouse any feeling in I as might be expect i get no good from this reading but the reverse the poet 's state of mind be too like my own he be the lament of a man who have wear out all pleasure and who seem to think that life to all who possess the good thing of it must necessarily be the vapid uninteresting thing which i find it he harold and manfr have the same burden on they which i have and i be not in a frame of mind to desire any comfort from the vehement sensual passion of he giaour or the sullenness of he lara but while byron be exactly what do not suit my condition wordsworth be exactly what do i have look into the _ excursion _ two or three year before and find little in it and i should probably have find as little have i read it at this time but the miscellaneous poem in the two-volume edition of 1815 -lrb- to which little of value be add in the latter part of the author 's life -rrb- prove to be the precise thing for my mental want at that particular juncture in the first place these poem address themselves powerfully to one of the strongest of my pleasurable susceptibility the love of rural object and natural scenery to which i have be indebted not only for much of the pleasure of my life but quite recently for relief from one of my longest relapse into depression in this power of rural beauty over I there be a foundation lay for take pleasure in wordsworth 's poetry the more so as he scenery lie mostly among mountain which owe to my early pyrenean excursion be my ideal of natural beauty but wordsworth would never have have any great effect on I if he have merely place before I beautiful picture of natural scenery scott do this still better than wordsworth and a very second-rate landscape do it more effectually than any poet what make wordsworth 's poem a medicine for my state of mind be that they express not mere outward beauty but state of feeling and of think color by feel under the excitement of beauty they seem to be the very culture of the feeling which i be in quest of in they i seem to draw from a source of inward joy of sympathetic and imaginative pleasure which could be share in by all human being which have no connection with struggle or imperfection but would be make richer by every improvement in the physical or social condition of mankind from they i seem to learn what would be the perennial source of happiness when all the greater evil of life shall have be remove and i feel myself at once better and happier as i come under they influence there have certainly be even in we own age greater poet than wordsworth but poetry of deeper and loftier feeling could not have do for I at that time what he do i need to be make to feel that there be real permanent happiness in tranquil contemplation wordsworth teach I this not only without turn away from but with a greatly increase interest in the common feeling and common destiny of human being and the delight which these poem give I prove that with culture of this sort there be nothing to dread from the most confirm habit of analysis at the conclusion of the poem come the famous ode falsely call platonic intimation of immortality : in which along with more than he usual sweetness of melody and rhythm and along with the two passage of grand imagery but bad philosophy so often quote i find that he too have have similar experience to mine that he also have feel that the first freshness of youthful enjoyment of life be not lasting but that he have seek for compensation and find it in the way in which he be now teach I to find it the result be that i gradually but completely emerge from my habitual depression and be never again subject to it i long continue to value wordsworth less accord to he intrinsic merit than by the measure of what he have do for I compare with the greatest poet he may be say to be the poet of unpoetical nature possess of quiet and contemplative taste but unpoetical nature be precisely those which require poetic cultivation this cultivation wordsworth be much more fit to give than poet who be intrinsically far more poet than he it so fall out that the merit of wordsworth be the occasion of my first public declaration of my new way of thinking and separation from those of my habitual companion who have not undergo a similar change the person with whom at that time i be most in the habit of compare note on such subject be roebuck and i induce he to read wordsworth in whom he also at first seem to find much to admire : but i like most wordsworthian throw myself into strong antagonism to byron both as a poet and as to he influence on the character roebuck all whose instinct be those of action and struggle have on the contrary a strong relish and great admiration of byron whose writings he regard as the poetry of human life while wordsworth 's accord to he be that of flower and butterfly we agree to have the fight out at we debate society where we accordingly discuss for two evening the comparative merit of byron and wordsworth propounding and illustrate by long recitation we respective theory of poetry : sterling also in a brilliant speech put forward he particular theory this be the first debate on any weighty subject in which roebuck and i have be on opposite side the schism between we widen from this time more and more though we continue for some year longer to be companion in the begin we chief divergence related to the cultivation of the feeling roebuck be in many respects very different from the vulgar notion of a benthamite or utilitarian he be a lover of poetry and of most of the fine art he take great pleasure in music in dramatic performance especially in painting and himself draw and design landscape with great facility and beauty but he never could be make to see that these thing have any value as aid in the formation of character personally instead of be as benthamite be suppose to be void of feeling he have very quick and strong sensibility but like most englishman who have feeling he find he feeling stand very much in he way he be much more susceptible to the painful sympathy than to the pleasurable and look for he happiness elsewhere he wish that he feeling should be deaden rather than quicken and in truth the english character and english social circumstance make it so seldom possible to derive happiness from the exercise of the sympathy that it be not wonderful if they count for little in a englishman 's scheme of life in most other country the paramount importance of the sympathy as a constituent of individual happiness be a axiom take for grant rather than need any formal statement but most english thinker always seem to regard they as necessary evil require for keep man 's action benevolent and compassionate roebuck be or appear to be this kind of englishman he see little good in any cultivation of the feeling and none at all in cultivate they through the imagination which he think be only cultivate illusion it be in vain i urge on he that the imaginative emotion which a idea when vividly conceive excite in we be not a illusion but a fact as real as any of the other quality of object and far from imply anything erroneous and delusive in we mental apprehension of the object be quite consistent with the most accurate knowledge and most perfect practical recognition of all its physical and intellectual law and relation the intensest feeling of the beauty of a cloud light by the setting sun be no hindrance to my know that the cloud be vapor of water subject to all the law of vapor in a state of suspension and i be just as likely to allow for and act on these physical law whenever there be occasion to do so as if i have be incapable of perceive any distinction between beauty and ugliness while my intimacy with roebuck diminish i fall more and more into friendly intercourse with we coleridgian adversary in the society frederick maurice and john sterling both subsequently so well know the former by he writings the latter through the biography by hare and carlyle of these two friend maurice be the thinker sterling the orator and impassioned expositor of thought which at this period be almost entirely form for he by maurice with maurice i have for some time be acquaint through eyton tooke who have know he at cambridge and although my discussion with he be almost always dispute i have carry away from they much that help to build up my new fabric of think in the same way as i be derive much from coleridge and from the writings of goethe and other german author which i read during these year i have so deep a respect for maurice 's character and purpose as well as for he great mental gift that it be with some unwillingness i say anything which may seem to place he on a less high eminence than i would gladly be able to accord to he but i have always think that there be more intellectual power waste in maurice than in any other of my contemporary few of they certainly have have so much to waste great power of generalization rare ingenuity and subtlety and a wide perception of important and unobvious truth serve he not for put something better into the place of the worthless heap of receive opinion on the great subject of thought but for prove to he own mind that the church of england have know everything from the first and that all the truth on the ground of which the church and orthodoxy have be attack -lrb- many of which he see as clearly as anyone -rrb- be not only consistent with the thirty-nine article but be better understand and express in those article than by anyone who reject they i have never be able to find any other explanation of this than by attribute it to that timidity of conscience combine with original sensitiveness of temperament which have so often drive highly gifted man into romanism from the need of a firmer support than they can find in the independent conclusion of they own judgment any more vulgar kind of timidity no one who know maurice would ever think of impute to he even if he have not give public proof of he freedom from it by he ultimate collision with some of the opinion commonly regard as orthodox and by he noble origination of the christian socialist movement the nearest parallel to he in a moral point of view be coleridge to whom in merely intellectual power apart from poetical genius i think he decidedly superior at this time however he might be describe as a disciple of coleridge and sterling as a disciple of coleridge and of he the modification which be take place in my old opinion give I some point of contact with they and both maurice and sterling be of considerable use to my development with sterling i soon become very intimate and be more attach to he than i have ever be to any other man he be indeed one of the most lovable of man he frank cordial affectionate and expansive character a love of truth alike conspicuous in the highest thing and the humblest a generous and ardent nature which throw itself with impetuosity into the opinion it adopt but be as eager to do justice to the doctrine and the man it be oppose to as to make war on what it think they error and a equal devotion to the two cardinal point of liberty and duty form a combination of quality as attractive to I as to all other who know he as well as i do with he open mind and heart he find no difficulty in join hand with I across the gulf which as yet divide we opinion he tell I how he and other have look upon I -lrb- from hearsay information -rrb- as a make or manufacture man have have a certain impress of opinion stamp on I which i could only reproduce and what a change take place in he feeling when he find in the discussion on wordsworth and byron that wordsworth and all which that name imply belong to I as much as to he and he friend the failure of he health soon scatter all he plan of life and compel he to live at a distance from london so that after the first year or two of we acquaintance we only see each other at distant interval but -lrb- as he say himself in one of he letter to carlyle -rrb- when we do meet it be like brother though he be never in the full sense of the word a profound thinker he openness of mind and the moral courage in which he greatly surpass maurice make he outgrow the dominion which maurice and coleridge have once exercise over he intellect though he retain to the last a great but discriminate admiration of both and towards maurice a warm affection except in that short and transitory phasis of he life during which he make the mistake of become a clergyman he mind be ever progressive : and the advance he always seem to have make when i see he after a interval make I apply to he what goethe say of schiller er hatte eine furchtliche fortschreitung he and i start from intellectual point almost as wide apart as the pole but the distance between we be always diminish : if i make step towards some of he opinion he during he short life be constantly approximate more and more to several of mine : and if he have live and have health and vigor to prosecute he ever assiduous self-culture there be no know how much further this spontaneous assimilation might have proceed after 1829 i withdraw from attendance on the debate society i have have enough of speech-making and be glad to carry on my private study and meditation without any immediate call for outward assertion of they result i find the fabric of my old and teach opinion give way in many fresh place and i never allow it to fall to piece but be incessantly occupy in weave it anew i never in the course of my transition be content to remain for ever so short a time confused and unsettled when i have take in any new idea i could not rest till i have adjust its relation to my old opinion and ascertain exactly how far its effect ought to extend in modify or supersede they the conflict which i have so often have to sustain in defend the theory of government lay down in bentham 's and my father 's writings and the acquaintance i have obtain with other school of political thinking make I aware of many thing which that doctrine profess to be a theory of government in general ought to have make room for and do not but these thing as yet remain with I rather as correction to be make in apply the theory to practice than as defect in the theory i feel that politics could not be a science of specific experience and that the accusation against the benthamic theory of _ be _ a theory of proceed _ a priori _ by way of general reasoning instead of baconian experiment show complete ignorance of bacon 's principle and of the necessary condition of experimental investigation at this juncture appear in the _ edinburgh review _ macaulay 's famous attack on my father 's _ essay on government _ this give I much to think about i see that macaulay 's conception of the logic of politics be erroneous that he stand up for the empirical mode of treat political phenomenon against the philosophical that even in physical science he notion of philosophize might have recognize kepler but would have exclude newton and laplace but i could not help feeling that though the tone be unbecoming -lrb- a error for which the writer at a later period make the most ample and honorable amends -rrb- there be truth in several of he stricture on my father 's treatment of the subject that my father 's premise be really too narrow and include but a small number of the general truth on which in politics the important consequence depend identity of interest between the govern body and the community at large be not in any practical sense which can be attach to it the only thing on which good government depend neither can this identity of interest be secure by the mere condition of election i be not at all satisfy with the mode in which my father meet the criticism of macaulay he do not as i think he ought to have do justify himself by say i be not write a scientific treatise on politics i be write a argument for parliamentary reform he treat macaulay 's argument as simply irrational a attack upon the reasoning faculty a example of the say of hobbe that when reason be against a man a man will be against reason this make I think that there be really something more fundamentally erroneous in my father 's conception of philosophical method as applicable to politics than i have hitherto suppose there be but i do not at first see clearly what the error might be at last it flash upon I all at once in the course of other study in the early part of 1830 i have begin to put on paper the idea on logic -lrb- chiefly on the distinction among term and the import of proposition -rrb- which have be suggest and in part work out in the morning conversation already speak of have secure these thought from be lose i push on into the other part of the subject to try whether i could do anything further towards clear up the theory of logic generally i grapple at once with the problem of induction postpone that of reasoning on the ground that it be necessary to obtain premise before we can reason from they now induction be mainly a process for find the cause of effect : and in attempt to fathom the mode of trace cause and effect in physical science i soon see that in the more perfect of the science we ascend by generalization from particulars to the tendency of cause consider singly and then reason downward from those separate tendency to the effect of the same cause when combine i then ask myself what be the ultimate analysis of this deductive process the common theory of the syllogism evidently throw no light upon it my practice -lrb- learn from hobbe and my father -rrb- be to study abstract principle by means of the best concrete instance i could find the composition of force in dynamics occur to I as the most complete example of the logical process i be investigate on examine accordingly what the mind do when it apply the principle of the composition of force i find that it perform a simple act of addition it add the separate effect of the one force to the separate effect of the other and put down the sum of these separate effect as the joint effect but be this a legitimate process in dynamics and in all the mathematical branch of physics it be but in some other case as in chemistry it be not and i then recollect that something not unlike this be point out as one of the distinction between chemical and mechanical phenomenon in the introduction to that favorite of my boyhood thompson 's _ system of chemistry _ this distinction at once make my mind clear as to what be perplexing I in respect to the philosophy of politics i now see that a science be either deductive or experimental accord as in the province it deal with the effect of cause when conjoin be or be not the sum of the effect which the same cause produce when separate it follow that politics must be a deductive science it thus appear that both macaulay and my father be wrong the one in assimilate the method of philosophize in politics to the purely experimental method of chemistry while the other though right in adopt a deductive method have make a wrong selection of one have take as the type of deduction not the appropriate process that of the deductive branch of natural philosophy but the inappropriate one of pure geometry which not be a science of causation at all do not require or admit of any summing-up of effect a foundation be thus lay in my thought for the principal chapter of what i afterwards publish on the logic of the moral science and my new position in respect to my old political creed now become perfectly definite if i be ask what system of political philosophy i substitute for that which as a philosophy i have abandon i answer no system : only a conviction that the true system be something much more complex and many-sided than i have previously have any idea of and that its office be to supply not a set of model institution but principle from which the institution suitable to any give circumstance might be deduce the influence of european that be to say continental thought and especially those of the reaction of the nineteenth century against the eighteenth be now streaming in upon I they come from various quarter : from the writings of coleridge which i have begin to read with interest even before the change in my opinion from the coleridgian with whom i be in personal intercourse from what i have read of goethe from carlyle 's early article in the _ edinburgh _ and foreign review though for a long time i see nothing in these -lrb- as my father see nothing in they to the last -rrb- but insane rhapsody from these source and from the acquaintance i keep up with the french literature of the time i derive among other idea which the general turn upside down of the opinion of european thinker have bring uppermost these in particular : that the human mind have a certain order of possible progress in which some thing must precede other a order which government and public instructor can modify to some but not to a unlimited extent : that all question of political institution be relative not absolute and that different stage of human progress not only _ will _ have but _ ought _ to have different institution : that government be always either in the hand or pass into the hand of whatever be the strongest power in society and that what this power be do not depend on institution but institution on it : that any general theory or philosophy of politics suppose a previous theory of human progress and that this be the same thing with a philosophy of history these opinion true in the main be hold in a exaggerated and violent manner by the thinker with whom i be now most accustomed to compare note and who as usual with a reaction ignore that half of the truth which the thinker of the eighteenth century saw but though at one period of my progress i for some time undervalue that great century i never join in the reaction against it but keep as firm hold of one side of the truth as i take of the other the fight between the nineteenth century and the eighteenth always remind I of the battle about the shield one side of which be white and the other black i marvelled at the blind rage with which the combatant rush against one another i apply to they and to coleridge himself many of coleridge 's saying about half truth and goethe 's device many-sidedness be one which i would most willingly at this period have take for mine the writer by whom more than by any other a new mode of political thinking be bring home to I be those of the st simonian school in france in 1829 and 1830 i become acquaint with some of they writings they be then only in the earlier stage of they speculation they have not yet dress out they philosophy as a religion nor have they organize they scheme of socialism they be just begin to question the principle of hereditary property i be by no means prepare to go with they even this length but i be greatly strike with the connected view which they for the first time present to I of the natural order of human progress and especially with they division of all history into organic period and critical period during the organic period -lrb- they say -rrb- mankind accept with firm conviction some positive creed claim jurisdiction over all they action and contain more or less of truth and adaptation to the need of humanity under its influence they make all the progress compatible with the creed and finally outgrow it when a period follow of criticism and negation in which mankind lose they old conviction without acquire any new one of a general or authoritative character except the conviction that the old be false the period of greek and roman polytheism so long as really believe in by instruct greek and roman be a organic period succeed by the critical or sceptical period of the greek philosopher another organic period come in with christianity the corresponding critical period begin with the reformation have last ever since still last and can not altogether cease until a new organic period have be inaugurate by the triumph of a yet more advanced creed these idea i know be not peculiar to the st simonian on the contrary they be the general property of europe or at least of germany and france but they have never to my knowledge be so completely systematize as by these writer nor the distinguish characteristic of a critical period so powerfully set forth for i be not then acquaint with fichte 's _ lecture on the characteristic of the present age _ in carlyle indeed i find bitter denunciation of a age of unbelief and of the present age as such which i like most people at that time suppose to be passionate protest in favor of the old mode of belief but all that be true in these denunciation i think that i find more calmly and philosophically state by the st simonian among they publication too there be one which seem to I far superior to the rest in which the general idea be mature into something much more definite and instructive this be a early work of auguste comte who then call himself and even announce himself in the title-page as a pupil of saint simon in this tract m comte first put forth the doctrine which he afterwards so copiously illustrate of the natural succession of three stage in every department of human knowledge : first the theological next the metaphysical and lastly the positive stage and contend that social science must be subject to the same law that the feudal and catholic system be the conclude phasis of the theological state of the social science protestantism the commencement and the doctrine of the french revolution the consummation of the metaphysical and that its positive state be yet to come this doctrine harmonize well with my exist notion to which it seem to give a scientific shape i already regard the method of physical science as the proper model for political but the chief benefit which i derive at this time from the train of thought suggest by the st simonian and by comte be that i obtain a clearer conception than ever before of the peculiarity of a era of transition in opinion and cease to mistake the moral and intellectual characteristic of such a era for the normal attribute of humanity i look forward through the present age of loud dispute but generally weak conviction to a future which shall unite the best quality of the critical with the best quality of the organic period unchecked liberty of thought unbounded freedom of individual action in all mode not hurtful to other but also conviction as to what be right and wrong useful and pernicious deeply engraven on the feeling by early education and general unanimity of sentiment and so firmly ground in reason and in the true exigency of life that they shall not like all former and present creed religious ethical and political require to be periodically throw off and replace by other m comte soon leave the st simonian and i lose sight of he and he writings for a number of year but the st simonian i continue to cultivate i be keep _ au courant _ of they progress by one of they most enthusiastic disciple m gustave d'eichthal who about that time pass a considerable interval in england i be introduce to they chief bazard and enfantin in 1830 and as long as they public teaching and proselytism continue i read nearly everything they write they criticism on the common doctrine of liberalism seem to I full of important truth and it be partly by they writings that my eye be open to the very limited and temporary value of the old political economy which assume private property and inheritance as indefeasible fact and freedom of production and exchange as the _ dernier mot _ of social improvement the scheme gradually unfold by the st simonian under which the labor and capital of society would be manage for the general account of the community every individual be require to take a share of labor either as thinker teacher artist or producer all be class accord to they capacity and remunerate accord to they work appear to I a far superior description of socialism to owen 's they aim seem to I desirable and rational however they means might be inefficacious and though i neither believe in the practicability nor in the beneficial operation of they social machinery i feel that the proclamation of such a ideal of human society could not but tend to give a beneficial direction to the effort of other to bring society as at present constitute nearer to some ideal standard i honor they most of all for what they have be most cry down for -- the boldness and freedom from prejudice with which they treat the subject of the family the most important of any and need more fundamental alteration than remain to be make in any other great social institution but on which scarcely any reformer have the courage to touch in proclaim the perfect equality of man and woman and a entirely new order of thing in regard to they relation with one another the st simonian in common with owen and fourier have entitle themselves to the grateful remembrance of future generation in give a account of this period of my life i have only specify such of my new impression as appear to I both at the time and since to be a kind of turn point mark a definite progress in my mode of thought but these few select point give a very insufficient idea of the quantity of think which i carry on respect a host of subject during these year of transition much of this it be true consist in rediscover thing know to all the world which i have previously disbelieve or disregard but the rediscovery be to I a discovery give I plenary possession of the truth not as traditional platitude but fresh from they source and it seldom fail to place they in some new light by which they be reconcile with and seem to confirm while they modify the truth less generally know which lay in my early opinion and in no essential part of which i at any time waver all my new thinking only lay the foundation of these more deeply and strongly while it often remove misapprehension and confusion of idea which have pervert they effect for example during the later return of my dejection the doctrine of what be call philosophical necessity weigh on my existence like a incubus i feel as if i be scientifically prove to be the helpless slave of antecedent circumstance as if my character and that of all other have be form for we by agency beyond we control and be wholly out of we own power i often say to myself what a relief it would be if i could disbelieve the doctrine of the formation of character by circumstance and remember the wish of fox respect the doctrine of resistance to government that it might never be forget by king nor remembered by subject i say that it would be a blessing if the doctrine of necessity could be believe by all _ quoad _ the character of other and disbelieve in regard to they own i pondered painfully on the subject till gradually i see light through it i perceive that the word necessity as a name for the doctrine of cause and effect apply to human action carry with it a misleading association and that this association be the operative force in the depressing and paralysing influence which i have experience : i see that though we character be form by circumstance we own desire can do much to shape those circumstance and that what be really inspiriting and ennobling in the doctrine of freewill be the conviction that we have real power over the formation of we own character that we will by influence some of we circumstance can modify we future habit or capability of willing all this be entirely consistent with the doctrine of circumstance or rather be that doctrine itself properly understand from that time i draw in my own mind a clear distinction between the doctrine of circumstance and fatalism discard altogether the misleading word necessity the theory which i now for the first time rightly apprehend cease altogether to be discourage and besides the relief to my spirit i no longer suffer under the burden -- so heavy to one who aim at be a reformer in opinion -- of think one doctrine true and the contrary doctrine morally beneficial the train of thought which have extricate I from this dilemma seem to I in after year fit to render a similar service to other and it now form the chapter on liberty and necessity in the conclude book of my _ system of logic _ again in politics though i no longer accept the doctrine of the _ essay on government _ as a scientific theory though i cease to consider representative democracy as a absolute principle and regard it as a question of time place and circumstance though i now look upon the choice of political institution as a moral and educational question more than one of material interest think that it ought to be decide mainly by the consideration what great improvement in life and culture stand next in order for the people concern as the condition of they further progress and what institution be most likely to promote that nevertheless this change in the premise of my political philosophy do not alter my practical political creed as to the requirement of my own time and country i be as much as ever a radical and democrat for europe and especially for england i think the predominance of the aristocratic class the noble and the rich in the english constitution a evil worth any struggle to get rid of not on account of tax or any such comparatively small inconvenience but as the great demoralizing agency in the country demoralizing first because it make the conduct of the government a example of gross public immorality through the predominance of private over public interest in the state and the abuse of the power of legislation for the advantage of class secondly and in a still greater degree because the respect of the multitude always attach itself principally to that which in the exist state of society be the chief passport to power and under english institution riches hereditary or acquire be the almost exclusive source of political importance riches and the sign of riches be almost the only thing really respect and the life of the people be mainly devote to the pursuit of they i think that while the higher and richer class hold the power of government the instruction and improvement of the mass of the people be contrary to the self-interest of those class because tend to render the people more powerful for throw off the yoke : but if the democracy obtain a large and perhaps the principal share in the govern power it would become the interest of the opulent class to promote they education in order to ward off really mischievous error and especially those which would lead to unjust violation of property on these grounds i be not only as ardent as ever for democratic institution but earnestly hope that owenite st simonian and all other anti-property doctrine might spread widely among the poorer class not that i think those doctrine true or desire that they should be act on but in order that the higher class might be make to see that they have more to fear from the poor when uneducated than when educate in this frame of mind the french revolution of July find I : it rouse my utmost enthusiasm and give I as it be a new existence i go at once to pari be introduce to lafayette and lay the groundwork of the intercourse i afterwards keep up with several of the active chief of the extreme popular party after my return i enter warmly as a writer into the political discussion of the time which soon become still more exciting by the come in of lord gray 's ministry and the propose of the reform bill for the next few year i write copiously in newspaper it be about this time that fonblanque who have for some time write the political article in the _ examiner _ become the proprietor and editor of the paper it be not forget with what verve and talent as well as fine wit he carry it on during the whole period of lord gray 's ministry and what importance it assume as the principal representative in the newspaper press of radical opinion the distinguishing character of the paper be give to it entirely by he own article which form at least three-fourth of all the original writing contain in it : but of the remain fourth i contribute during those year a much larger share than anyone else i write nearly all the article on french subject include a weekly summary of french politics often extend to considerable length together with many lead article on general politics commercial and financial legislation and any miscellaneous subject in which i feel interested and which be suitable to the paper include occasional review of book mere newspaper article on the occurrence or question of the moment give no opportunity for the development of any general mode of thought but i attempt in the beginning of 1831 to embody in a series of article head the spirit of the age some of my new opinion and especially to point out in the character of the present age the anomaly and evil characteristic of the transition from a system of opinion which have wear out to another only in process of be form these article be i fancy lumber in style and not lively or striking enough to be at any time acceptable to newspaper reader but have they be far more attractive still at that particular moment when great political change be impend and engross all mind these discussion be ill-timed and miss fire altogether the only effect which i know to have be produce by they be that carlyle then live in a secluded part of scotland read they in he solitude and say to himself -lrb- as he afterwards tell I -rrb- here be a new mystic inquire on come to london that autumn respect they authorship a inquiry which be the immediate cause of we become personally acquaint i have already mention carlyle 's earlier writings as one of the channel through which i receive the influence which enlarged my early narrow creed but i do not think that those writings by themselves would ever have have any effect on my opinion what truth they contain though of the very kind which i be already receive from other quarter be present in a form and vesture less suit than any other to give they access to a mind train as mine have be they seem a haze of poetry and german metaphysics in which almost the only clear thing be a strong animosity to most of the opinion which be the basis of my mode of thought religious scepticism utilitarianism the doctrine of circumstance and the attach any importance to democracy logic or political economy instead of my have be teach anything in the first instance by carlyle it be only in proportion as i come to see the same truth through media more suit to my mental constitution that i recognize they in he writings then indeed the wonderful power with which he put they forth make a deep impression upon I and i be during a long period one of he most fervent admirer but the good he writings do I be not as philosophy to instruct but as poetry to animate even at the time when we acquaintance commence i be not sufficiently advance in my new mode of think to appreciate he fully a proof of which be that on he show I the manuscript of _ sartor resartus _ he best and greatest work which he just then finish i make little of it though when it come out about two year afterwards in _ fraser 's magazine _ i read it with enthusiastic admiration and the keenest delight i do not seek and cultivate carlyle less on account of the fundamental difference in we philosophy he soon find out that i be not another mystic and when for the sake of my own integrity i write to he a distinct profession of all those of my opinion which i know he most dislike he reply that the chief difference between we be that i be as yet consciously nothing of a mystic i do not know at what period he give up the expectation that i be destine to become one but though both he and my opinion undergo in subsequent year considerable change we never approach much nearer to each other 's mode of thought than we be in the first year of we acquaintance i do not however deem myself a competent judge of carlyle i feel that he be a poet and that i be not that he be a man of intuition which i be not and that as such he not only see many thing long before I which i could only when they be point out to I hobble after and prove but that it be highly probable he could see many thing which be not visible to I even after they be point out i know that i could not see round he and could never be certain that i see over he and i never presume to judge he with any definiteness until he be interpret to I by one greatly the superior of we both -- who be more a poet than he and more a thinker than i -- whose own mind and nature include he and infinitely more among the person of intellect whom i have know of old the one with whom i have now most point of agreement be the elder austin i have mention that he always set himself in opposition to we early sectarianism and latterly he have like myself come under new influence have be appoint professor of jurisprudence in the london university -lrb- now university college -rrb- he have live for some time at bonn to study for he lecture and the influence of german literature and of the german character and state of society have make a very perceptible change in he view of life he personal disposition be much soften he be less militant and polemic he taste have begin to turn themselves towards the poetic and contemplative he attach much less importance than formerly to outward change unless accompany by a better cultivation of the inward nature he have a strong distaste for the general meanness of english life the absence of enlarged thought and unselfish desire the low object on which the faculty of all class of the english be intent even the kind of public interest which englishmen care for he hold in very little esteem he think that there be more practical good government and -lrb- which be true enough -rrb- infinitely more care for the education and mental improvement of all rank of the people under the prussian monarchy than under the english representative government : and he hold with the french _ economiste _ that the real security for good government be un _ peuple clair _ which be not always the fruit of popular institution and which if it could be have without they would do they work better than they though he approve of the reform bill he predict what in fact occur that it would not produce the great immediate improvement in government which many expect from it the man he say who could do these great thing do not exist in the country there be many point of sympathy between he and I both in the new opinion he have adopt and in the old one which he retain like I he never cease to be a utilitarian and with all he love for the german and enjoyment of they literature never become in the smallest degree reconcile to the innate-principle metaphysics he cultivate more and more a kind of german religion a religion of poetry and feeling with little if anything of positive dogma while in politics -lrb- and here it be that i most differ with he -rrb- he acquire a indifference border on contempt for the progress of popular institution : though he rejoice in that of socialism as the most effectual means of compelling the powerful class to educate the people and to impress on they the only real means of permanently improve they material condition a limitation of they number neither be he at this time fundamentally oppose to socialism in itself as a ultimate result of improvement he profess great disrespect for what he call the universal principle of human nature of the political economist and insist on the evidence which history and daily experience afford of the extraordinary pliability of human nature -lrb- a phrase which i have somewhere borrow from he -rrb- nor do he think it possible to set any positive bound to the moral capability which might unfold themselves in mankind under a enlighten direction of social and educational influence whether he retain all these opinion to the end of life i know not certainly the mode of thinking of he later year and especially of he last publication be much more tory in they general character than those which he hold at this time my father 's tone of thought and feeling i now feel myself at a great distance from : greater indeed than a full and calm explanation and reconsideration on both side might have show to exist in reality but my father be not one with whom calm and full explanation on fundamental point of doctrine could be expect at least with one whom he might consider as in some sort a deserter from he standard fortunately we be almost always in strong agreement on the political question of the day which engross a large part of he interest and of he conversation on those matter of opinion on which we differ we talk little he know that the habit of think for myself which he mode of education have foster sometimes lead I to opinion different from he and he perceive from time to time that i do not always tell he _ how _ different i expect no good but only pain to both of we from discuss we difference : and i never express they but when he give utterance to some opinion or feeling repugnant to mine in a manner which would have make it disingenuousness on my part to remain silent it remain to speak of what i write during these year which independently of my contribution to newspaper be considerable in 1830 and 1831 i write the five essay since publish under the title of _ essay on some unsettled question of political economy _ almost as they now stand except that in 1833 i partially rewrite the fifth essay they be write with no immediate purpose of publication and when some year later i offer they to a publisher he decline they they be only print in 1844 after the success of the _ system of logic _ i also resume my speculation on this last subject and puzzle myself like other before I with the great paradox of the discovery of new truth by general reasoning as to the fact there could be no doubt as little could it be doubt that all reasoning be resolvable into syllogism and that in every syllogism the conclusion be actually contain and imply in the premise how be so contain and imply it could be new truth and how the theorem of geometry so different in appearance from the definition and axiom could be all contain in these be a difficulty which no one i think have sufficiently feel and which at all event no one have succeed in clear up the explanation offer by whately and other though they might give a temporary satisfaction always in my mind leave a mist still hang over the subject at last when read a second or third time the chapter on reasoning in the second volume of dugald stewart interrogate myself on every point and follow out as far as i know how every topic of thought which the book suggest i come upon a idea of he respect the use of axiom in ratiocination which i do not remember to have before notice but which now in meditate on it seem to I not only true of axiom but of all general proposition whatever and to be the key of the whole perplexity from this germ grow the theory of the syllogism propound in the second book of the _ logic _ which i immediately fix by write it out and now with greatly increase hope of be able to produce a work on logic of some originality and value i proceed to write the first book from the rough and imperfect draft i have already make what i now write become the basis of that part of the subsequent treatise except that it do not contain the theory of kind which be a later addition suggest by otherwise inextricable difficulty which meet I in my first attempt to work out the subject of some of the conclude chapter of the third book at the point which i have now reach i make a halt which last five year i have come to the end of my tether i could make nothing satisfactory of induction at this time i continue to read any book which seem to promise light on the subject and appropriate as well as i could the result but for a long time i find nothing which seem to open to I any very important vein of meditation in 1832 i write several papers for the first series of _ tait 's magazine _ and one for a quarterly periodical call the _ jurist _ which have be found and for a short time carry on by a set of friend all lawyer and law reformer with several of whom i be acquaint the paper in question be the one on the rights and duty of the state respect corporation and church property now stand first among the collect _ dissertation and discussion _ where one of my article in _ tait _ the currency juggle also appear in the whole mass of what i write previous to these there be nothing of sufficient permanent value to justify reprint the paper in the _ jurist _ which i still think a very complete discussion of the rights of the state over foundation show both side of my opinion assert as firmly as i should have do at any time the doctrine that all endowment be national property which the government may and ought to control but not as i should once have do condemn endowment in themselves and propose that they should be take to pay off the national debt on the contrary i urge strenuously the importance of a provision for education not dependent on the mere demand of the market that be on the knowledge and discernment of average parent but calculate to establish and keep up a higher standard of instruction than be likely to be spontaneously demand by the buyer of the article all these opinion have be confirm and strengthen by the whole of my subsequent reflection chapter vi commencement of the most valuable friendship of my life my father 's death writings and other proceedings up to 1840 it be the period of my mental progress which i have now reach that i form the friendship which have be the honor and chief blessing of my existence as well as the source of a great part of all that i have attempt to do or hope to effect hereafter for human improvement my first introduction to the lady who after a friendship of twenty year consent to become my wife be in 1830 when i be in my twenty-fifth and she in she twenty-third year with she husband 's family it be the renewal of a old acquaintanceship he grandfather live in the next house to my father 's in newington green and i have sometimes when a boy be invite to play in the old gentleman 's garden he be a fine specimen of the old scotch puritan stern severe and powerful but very kind to child on whom such man make a lasting impression although it be year after my introduction to mr taylor before my acquaintance with she become at all intimate or confidential i very soon feel she to be the most admirable person i have ever know it be not to be suppose that she be or that any one at the age at which i first see she could be all that she afterwards become least of all could this be true of she with whom self-improvement progress in the highest and in all sens be a law of she nature a necessity equally from the ardor with which she seek it and from the spontaneous tendency of faculty which could not receive a impression or a experience without make it the source or the occasion of a accession of wisdom up to the time when i first see she she rich and powerful nature have chiefly unfold itself accord to the receive type of feminine genius to she outer circle she be a beauty and a wit with a air of natural distinction feel by all who approach she : to the inner a woman of deep and strong feeling of penetrate and intuitive intelligence and of a eminently meditative and poetic nature marry at a early age to a most upright brave and honorable man of liberal opinion and good education but without the intellectual or artistic taste which would have make he a companion for she though a steady and affectionate friend for whom she have true esteem and the strongest affection through life and whom she most deeply lament when dead shut out by the social disability of woman from any adequate exercise of she highest faculty in action on the world without she life be one of inward meditation vary by familiar intercourse with a small circle of friend of whom one only -lrb- long since decease -rrb- be a person of genius or of capacity of feeling or intellect kindred with she own but all have more or less of alliance with she in sentiment and opinion into this circle i have the good fortune to be admit and i soon perceive that she possess in combination the quality which in all other person whom i have know i have be only too happy to find singly in she complete emancipation from every kind of superstition -lrb- include that which attribute a pretended perfection to the order of nature and the universe -rrb- and a earnest protest against many thing which be still part of the established constitution of society result not from the hard intellect but from strength of noble and elevated feeling and co-exist with a highly reverential nature in general spiritual characteristic as well as in temperament and organization i have often compare she as she be at this time to shelley : but in thought and intellect shelley so far as he power be develop in he short life be but a child compare with what she ultimately become alike in the highest region of speculation and in the smaller practical concern of daily life she mind be the same perfect instrument pierce to the very heart and marrow of the matter always seize the essential idea or principle the same exactness and rapidity of operation pervading as it do she sensitive as well as she mental faculty would with she gift of feeling and imagination have fit she to be a consummate artist as she fiery and tender soul and she vigorous eloquence would certainly have make she a great orator and she profound knowledge of human nature and discernment and sagacity in practical life would in the time when such a _ carrire _ be open to woman have make she eminent among the ruler of mankind she intellectual gift do but minister to a moral character at once the noblest and the best balanced which i have ever meet with in life she unselfishness be not that of a teach system of duty but of a heart which thoroughly identify itself with the feeling of other and often go to excess in consideration for they by imaginatively invest they feeling with the intensity of its own the passion of justice might have be think to be she strongest feeling but for she boundless generosity and a lovingness ever ready to pour itself forth upon any or all human being who be capable of give the smallest feeling in return the rest of she moral characteristic be such as naturally accompany these quality of mind and heart : the most genuine modesty combine with the loftiest pride a simplicity and sincerity which be absolute towards all who be fit to receive they the utmost scorn of whatever be mean and cowardly and a burning indignation at everything brutal or tyrannical faithless or dishonourable in conduct and character while make the broadest distinction between _ mala in se _ and mere _ mala prohibita _ -- between act give evidence of intrinsic badness in feeling and character and those which be only violation of convention either good or bad violation which whether in themselves right or wrong be capable of be commit by person in every other respect lovable or admirable to be admit into any degree of mental intercourse with a being of these quality could not but have a most beneficial influence on my development though the effect be only gradual and many year elapse before she mental progress and mine go forward in the complete companionship they at last attain the benefit i receive be far greater than any which i could hope to give though to she who have at first reach she opinion by the moral intuition of a character of strong feeling there be doubtless help as well as encouragement to be derive from one who have arrive at many of the same result by study and reasoning : and in the rapidity of she intellectual growth she mental activity which convert everything into knowledge doubtless draw from I as it do from other source many of its material what i owe even intellectually to she be in its detail almost infinite of its general character a few word will give some though a very imperfect idea with those who like all the best and wisest of mankind be dissatisfy with human life as it be and whose feeling be wholly identify with its radical amendment there be two main region of thought one be the region of ultimate aim the constituent element of the highest realizable ideal of human life the other be that of the immediately useful and practically attainable in both these department i have acquire more from she teaching than from all other source take together and to say truth it be in these two extreme principally that real certainty lie my own strength lay wholly in the uncertain and slippery intermediate region that of theory or moral and political science : respect the conclusion of which in any of the form in which i have receive or originate they whether as political economy analytic psychology logic philosophy of history or anything else it be not the least of my intellectual obligation to she that i have derive from she a wise scepticism which while it have not hinder I from follow out the honest exercise of my think faculty to whatever conclusion might result from it have put I on my guard against hold or announce these conclusion with a degree of confidence which the nature of such speculation do not warrant and have keep my mind not only open to admit but prompt to welcome and eager to seek even on the question on which i have most meditate any prospect of clearer perception and better evidence i have often receive praise which in my own right i only partially deserve for the greater practicality which be suppose to be find in my writings compare with those of most thinker who have be equally addict to large generalization the writings in which this quality have be observe be not the work of one mind but of the fusion of two one of they as pre-eminently practical in its judgment and perception of thing present as it be high and bold in its anticipation for a remote futurity at the present period however this influence be only one among many which be help to shape the character of my future development : and even after it become i may truly say the preside principle of my mental progress it do not alter the path but only make I move forward more boldly and at the same time more cautiously in the same course the only actual revolution which have ever take place in my mode of thinking be already complete my new tendency have to be confirm in some respects moderate in other : but the only substantial change of opinion that be yet to come related to politics and consist on one hand in a greater approximation so far as regard the ultimate prospects of humanity to a qualify socialism and on the other a shift of my political ideal from pure democracy as commonly understand by its partisan to the modified form of it which be set forth in my _ consideration on representative government _ this last change which take place very gradually date its commencement from my reading or rather study of m de tocqueville 's _ democracy in america _ which fall into my hand immediately after its first appearance in that remarkable work the excellence of democracy be point out in a more conclusive because a more specific manner than i have ever know they to be even by the most enthusiastic democrat while the specific danger which beset democracy consider as the government of the numerical majority be bring into equally strong light and subject to a masterly analysis not as reason for resist what the author consider as a inevitable result of human progress but as indication of the weak point of popular government the defence by which it need to be guard and the corrective which must be add to it in order that while full play be give to its beneficial tendency those which be of a different nature may be neutralize or mitigate i be now well prepare for speculation of this character and from this time onward my own thought move more and more in the same channel though the consequent modification in my practical political creed be spread over many year as would be show by compare my first review of _ democracy in america _ write and publish in 1835 with the one in 1840 -lrb- reprint in the _ dissertation _ -rrb- and this last with the _ consideration on representative government _ a collateral subject on which also i derive great benefit from the study of tocqueville be the fundamental question of centralization the powerful philosophic analysis which he apply to american and to french experience lead he to attach the utmost importance to the performance of as much of the collective business of society as can safely be so perform by the people themselves without any intervention of the executive government either to supersede they agency or to dictate the manner of its exercise he view this practical political activity of the individual citizen not only as one of the most effectual means of train the social feeling and practical intelligence of the people so important in themselves and so indispensable to good government but also as the specific counteractive to some of the characteristic infirmity of democracy and a necessary protection against its degenerate into the only despotism of which in the modern world there be real danger -- the absolute rule of the head of the executive over a congregation of isolate individual all equal but all slave there be indeed no immediate peril from this source on the british side of the channel where nine-tenth of the internal business which elsewhere devolve on the government be transact by agency independent of it where centralization be and be the subject not only of rational disapprobation but of unreasoning prejudice where jealousy of government interference be a blind feeling prevent or resist even the most beneficial exertion of legislative authority to correct the abuse of what pretend to be local self-government but be too often selfish mismanagement of local interest by a jobbing and _ born _ local oligarchy but the more certain the public be to go wrong on the side oppose to centralization the greater danger be there lest philosophic reformer should fall into the contrary error and overlook the mischief of which they have be spare the painful experience i be myself at this very time actively engage in defend important measure such as the great poor law reform of 1834 against a irrational clamor ground on the anti-centralization prejudice : and have it not be for the lesson of tocqueville i do not know that i might not like many reformer before I have be hurry into the excess opposite to that which be the one prevalent in my own country it be generally my business to combat as it be i have steer carefully between the two error and whether i have or have not draw the line between they exactly in the right place i have at least insist with equal emphasis upon the evil on both side and have make the means of reconcile the advantage of both a subject of serious study in the meanwhile have take place the election of the first reform parliament which include several of the most notable of my radical friend and acquaintance -- grote roebuck buller sir william molesworth john and edward romilly and several more besides warburton strutt and other who be in parliament already those who think themselves and be call by they friend the philosophic radical have now it seem a fair opportunity in a more advantageous position than they have ever before occupy for show what be in they and i as well as my father found great hope on they these hope be destine to be disappoint the man be honest and faithful to they opinion as far as vote be concerned often in spite of much discouragement when measure be propose flagrantly at variance with they principle such as the irish coercion bill or the canada coercion in 1837 they come forward manfully and brave any amount of hostility and prejudice rather than desert the right but on the whole they do very little to promote any opinion they have little enterprise little activity : they leave the lead of the radical portion of the house to the old hand to hume and o'connell a partial exception must be make in favor of one or two of the younger man and in the case of roebuck it be he title to permanent remembrance that in the very first year during which he sit in parliament he originate -lrb- or re-originate after the unsuccessful attempt of mr brougham -rrb- the parliamentary movement for national education and that he be the first to commence and for year carry on almost alone the contest for the self-government of the colony nothing on the whole equal to these two thing be do by any other individual even of those from whom most be expect and now on a calm retrospect i can perceive that the man be less in fault than we suppose and that we have expect too much from they they be in unfavourable circumstance they lot be cast in the ten year of inevitable reaction when the reform excitement be over and the few legislative improvement which the public really call for have be rapidly effect power gravitate back in its natural direction to those who be for keep thing as they be when the public mind desire rest and be less disposed than at any other period since the peace to let itself be move by attempt to work up the reform feeling into fresh activity in favor of new thing it would have require a great political leader which no one be to be blame for not be to have effect really great thing by parliamentary discussion when the nation be in this mood my father and i have hope that some competent leader might arise some man of philosophic attainment and popular talent who could have put heart into the many younger or less distinguished man that would have be ready to join he -- could have make they available to the extent of they talent in bring advanced idea before the public -- could have use the house of common as a rostrum or a teacher 's chair for instruct and impel the public mind and would either have force the whig to receive they measure from he or have take the lead of the reform party out of they hand such a leader there would have be if my father have be in parliament for want of such a man the instruct radical sink into a mere _ ct gauche _ of the whig party with a keen and as i now think a exaggerated sense of the possibility which be open to the radical if they make even ordinary exertion for they opinion i labor from this time till 1839 both by personal influence with some of they and by writings to put idea into they head and purpose into they heart i do some good with charle buller and some with sir william molesworth both of whom do valuable service but be unhappily cut off almost in the beginning of they usefulness on the whole however my attempt be vain to have have a chance of succeed in it require a different position from mine it be a task only for one who be himself in parliament could have mix with the radical member in daily consultation could himself have take the initiative and instead of urge other to lead could have summon they to follow what i could do by write i do during the year 1833 i continue work in the _ examiner _ with fonblanque who at that time be zealous in keep up the fight for radicalism against the whig ministry during the session of 1834 i write comment on pass event of the nature of newspaper article -lrb- under the title note on the newspaper -rrb- in the _ monthly repository _ a magazine conduct by mr fox well know as a preacher and political orator and subsequently as member of parliament for oldham with whom i have lately become acquaint and for whose sake chiefly i write in he magazine i contribute several other article to this periodical the most considerable of which -lrb- on the theory of poetry -rrb- be reprint in the dissertation altogether the writings -lrb- independently of those in newspaper -rrb- which i publish from 1832 to 1834 amount to a large volume this however include abstract of several of plato 's dialogue with introductory remark which though not publish until 1834 have be write several year earlier and which i afterwards on various occasion find to have be read and they authorship know by more people than be aware of anything else which i have write up to that time to complete the tale of my writings at this period i may add that in 1833 at the request of bulwer who be just then complete he _ england and the english _ -lrb- a work at that time greatly in advance of the public mind -rrb- i write for he a critical account of bentham 's philosophy a small part of which he incorporate in he text and print the rest -lrb- with a honorable acknowledgment -rrb- as a appendix in this along with the favourable a part also of the unfavourable side of my estimation of bentham 's doctrine consider as a complete philosophy be for the first time put into print but a opportunity soon offer by which as it seem i might have it in my power to give more effectual aid and at the same time stimulus to the philosophic radical party than i have do hitherto one of the project occasionally talk of between my father and I and some of the parliamentary and other radical who frequent he house be the foundation of a periodical organ of philosophic radicalism to take the place which the _ westminster review _ have be intend to fill : and the scheme have go so far as to bring under discussion the pecuniary contribution which could be look for and the choice of a editor nothing however come of it for some time : but in the summer of 1834 sir william molesworth himself a laborious student and a precise and metaphysical thinker capable of aid the cause by he pen as well as by he purse spontaneously propose to establish a review provide i would consent to be the real if i could not be the ostensible editor such a proposal be not to be refuse and the review be found at first under the title of the _ london review _ and afterwards under that of the _ london and westminster _ molesworth have buy the _ westminster _ from its proprietor general thompson and merge the two into one in the year between 1834 and 1840 the conduct of this review occupy the greater part of my spare time in the begin it do not as a whole by any means represent my opinion i be under the necessity of concede much to my inevitable associate the _ review _ be establish to be the representative of the philosophic radical with most of whom i be now at issue on many essential point and among whom i could not even claim to be the most important individual my father 's co-operation as a writer we all deem indispensable and he write largely in it until prevent by he last illness the subject of he article and the strength and decision with which he opinion be express in they make the _ review _ at first derive its tone and color from he much more than from any of the other writer i could not exercise editorial control over he article and i be sometimes oblige to sacrifice to he portion of my own the old _ westminster review _ doctrine but little modified thus form the staple of the _ review _ but i hope by the side of these to introduce other idea and another tone and to obtain for my own shade of opinion a fair representation along with those of other member of the party with this end chiefly in view i make it one of the peculiarity of the work that every article should bear a initial or some other signature and be hold to express the opinion solely of the individual writer the editor be only responsible for its be worth publishing and not in conflict with the object for which the _ review _ be set on foot i have a opportunity of put in practice my scheme of conciliation between the old and the new philosophic radicalism by the choice of a subject for my own first contribution professor sedgwick a man of eminence in a particular walk of natural science but who should not have trespass into philosophy have lately publish he _ discourse on the study of cambridge _ which have as its most prominent feature a intemperate assault on analytic psychology and utilitarian ethic in the form of a attack on locke and paley this have excite great indignation in my father and other which i think it fully deserve and here i imagine be a opportunity of at the same time repel a unjust attack and insert into my defense of hartleianism and utilitarianism a number of the opinion which constitute my view of those subject as distinguish from that of my old associate in this i partially succeed though my relation to my father would have make it painful to I in any case and impossible in a review for which he write to speak out my whole mind on the subject at this time i be however incline to think that my father be not so much oppose as he seem to the mode of think in which i believe myself to differ from he that he do injustice to he own opinion by the unconscious exaggeration of a intellect emphatically polemical and that when think without a adversary in view he be willing to make room for a great portion of the truth he seem to deny i have frequently observe that he make large allowance in practice for consideration which seem to have no place in he theory he _ fragment on mackintosh _ which he write and publish about this time although i greatly admire some part of it i read as a whole with more pain than pleasure yet on read it again long after i find little in the opinion it contain but what i think in the main just and i can even sympathize in he disgust at the _ verbiage _ of mackintosh though he asperity towards it go not only beyond what be judicious but beyond what be even fair one thing which i think at the time of good augury be the very favourable reception he give to tocqueville 's _ democracy in america _ it be true he say and think much more about what tocqueville say in favor of democracy than about what he say of its disadvantage still he high appreciation of a book which be at any rate a example of a mode of treat the question of government almost the reverse of he -- wholly inductive and analytical instead of purely ratiocinative -- give I great encouragement he also approve of a article which i publish in the first number follow the junction of the two review the essay reprint in the _ dissertation _ under the title civilization into which i throw many of my new opinion and criticise rather emphatically the mental and moral tendency of the time on grounds and in a manner which i certainly have not learn from he all speculation however on the possible future development of my father 's opinion and on the probability of permanent co-operation between he and I in the promulgation of we thought be doom to be cut short during the whole of 1835 he health have be decline : he symptom become unequivocally those of pulmonary consumption and after linger to the last stage of debility he die on the 23rd of June 1836 until the last few day of he life there be no apparent abatement of intellectual vigor he interest in all thing and person that have interested he through life be undiminished nor do the approach of death cause the smallest wavering -lrb- as in so strong and firm a mind it be impossible that it should -rrb- in he conviction on the subject of religion he principal satisfaction after he know that he end be near seem to be the thought of what he have do to make the world better than he find it and he chief regret in not live longer that he have not have time to do more he place be a eminent one in the literary and even in the political history of he country and it be far from honorable to the generation which have benefit by he worth that he be so seldom mention and compare with man far he inferior so little remembered this be probably to be ascribe mainly to two cause in the first place the thought of he merge too much in the deservedly superior fame of bentham yet he be anything but bentham 's mere follower or disciple precisely because he be himself one of the most original thinker of he time he be one of the earliest to appreciate and adopt the most important mass of original thought which have be produce by the generation precede he he mind and bentham 's be essentially of different construction he have not all bentham 's high quality but neither have bentham all he it would indeed be ridiculous to claim for he the praise of have accomplish for mankind such splendid service as bentham 's he do not revolutionize or rather create one of the great department of human thought but leave out of the reckon all that portion of he labor in which he benefit by what bentham have do and count only what he achieve in a province in which bentham have do nothing that of analytic psychology he will be know to posterity as one of the greatest name in that most important branch of speculation on which all the moral and political science ultimately rest and will mark one of the essential stage in its progress the other reason which have make he fame less than he deserve be that notwithstanding the great number of he opinion which partly through he own effort have now be generally adopt there be on the whole a marked opposition between he spirit and that of the present time as brutus be call the last of the roman so be he the last of the eighteenth century : he continue its tone of thought and sentiment into the nineteenth -lrb- though not unmodified nor unimproved -rrb- partaking neither in the good nor in the bad influence of the reaction against the eighteenth century which be the great characteristic of the first half of the nineteenth the eighteenth century be a great age a age of strong and brave man and he be a fit companion for its strongest and bravest by he writings and he personal influence he be a great center of light to he generation during he later year he be quite as much the head and leader of the intellectual radical in england as voltaire be of the _ philosophe _ of france it be only one of he minor merit that he be the originator of all sound statesmanship in regard to the subject of he largest work indium he write on no subject which he do not enrich with valuable thought and except the _ element of political economy _ a very useful book when first write but which have now for some time finish its work it will be long before any of he book will be wholly superseded or will cease to be instructive reading to student of they subject in the power of influence by mere force of mind and character the conviction and purpose of other and in the strenuous exertion of that power to promote freedom and progress he leave as far as my knowledge extend no equal among man and but one among woman though acutely sensible of my own inferiority in the quality by which he acquire he personal ascendancy i have now to try what it might be possible for I to accomplish without he : and the _ review _ be the instrument on which i build my chief hope of establish a useful influence over the liberal and democratic section of the public mind deprive of my father 's aid i be also exempt from the restraint and reticence by which that aid have be purchase i do not feel that there be any other radical writer or politician to whom i be bind to defer further than consist with my own opinion : and have the complete confidence of molesworth i resolve henceforth to give full scope to my own opinion and mode of thought and to open the _ review _ widely to all writer who be in sympathy with progress as i understand it even though i should lose by it the support of my former associate carlyle consequently become from this time a frequent writer in the _ review _ sterling soon after a occasional one and though each individual article continue to be the expression of the private sentiment of its writer the general tone conform in some tolerable degree to my opinion for the conduct of the _ review _ under and in conjunction with I i associate with myself a young scotchman of the name of robertson who have some ability and information much industry and a active scheming head full of device for make the _ review _ more saleable and on whose capacity in that direction i found a good deal of hope : insomuch that when molesworth in the beginning of 1837 become tired of carry on the _ review _ at a loss and desirous of get rid of it -lrb- he have do he part honourably and at no small pecuniary cost -rrb- i very imprudently for my own pecuniary interest and very much from reliance on robertson 's device determine to continue it at my own risk until he plan should have have a fair trial the device be good and i never have any reason to change my opinion of they but i do not believe that any device would have make a radical and democratic review defray its expense include a pay editor or sub-editor and a liberal payment to writer i myself and several frequent contributor give we labor gratuitously as we have do for molesworth but the pay contributor continue to be remunerate on the usual scale of the _ edinburgh _ and _ quarterly review _ and this could not be do from the proceeds of the sale in the same year 1837 and in the midst of these occupation i resume the _ logic _ i have not touch my pen on the subject for five year have be stop and bring to a halt on the threshold of induction i have gradually discover that what be mainly want to overcome the difficulty of that branch of the subject be a comprehensive and at the same time accurate view of the whole circle of physical science which i fear it would take I a long course of study to acquire since i know not of any book or other guide that would spread out before I the generality and process of the science and i apprehend that i should have no choice but to extract they for myself as i best could from the detail happily for I dr whewell early in this year publish he _ history of the inductive science _ i read it with eagerness and find in it a considerable approximation to what i want much if not most of the philosophy of the work appear open to objection but the material be there for my own thought to work upon : and the author have give to those material that first degree of elaboration which so greatly facilitate and abridge the subsequent labor i have now obtain what i have be wait for under the impulse give I by the thought excite by dr whewell i read again sir j herschel 's _ discourse on the study of natural philosophy _ : and i be able to measure the progress my mind have make by the great help i now find in this work -- though i have read and even review it several year before with little profit i now set myself vigorously to work out the subject in thought and in write the time i bestow on this have to be steal from occupation more urgent i have just two month to spare at this period in the interval of write for the _ review _ in these two month i complete the first draft of about a third the most difficult third of the book what i have before write i estimate at another third so that one-third remain what i write at this time consist of the remainder of the doctrine of reasoning -lrb- the theory of train of reasoning and demonstrative science -rrb- and the greater part of the book on induction when this be do i have as it seem to I untie all the really hard knot and the completion of the book have become only a question of time have get thus far i have to leave off in order to write two article for the next number of the _ review _ when these be write i return to the subject and now for the first time fall in with comte 's _ cours de philosophie positive _ or rather with the two volume of it which be all that have at that time be publish my theory of induction be substantially complete before i know of comte 's book and it be perhaps well that i come to it by a different road from he since the consequence have be that my treatise contain what he certainly do not a reduction of the inductive process to strict rule and to a scientific test such as the syllogism be for ratiocination comte be always precise and profound on the method of investigation but he do not even attempt any exact definition of the condition of proof : and he writings show that he never attain a just conception of they this however be specifically the problem which in treat of induction i have propose to myself nevertheless i gain much from comte with which to enrich my chapter in the subsequent rewrite : and he book be of essential service to I in some of the part which still remain to be think out as he subsequent volume successively make they appearance i read they with avidity but when he reach the subject of social science with vary feeling the fourth volume disappoint I : it contain those of he opinion on social subject with which i most disagree but the fifth contain the connected view of history rekindle all my enthusiasm which the sixth -lrb- or conclude -rrb- volume do not materially abate in a merely logical point of view the only lead conception for which i be indebted to he be that of the inverse deductive method as the one chiefly applicable to the complicated subject of history and statistics : a process differ from the more common form of the deductive method in this -- that instead of arrive at its conclusion by general reasoning and verify they by specific experience -lrb- as be the natural order in the deductive branch of physical science -rrb- it obtain its generalization by a collation of specific experience and verify they by ascertain whether they be such as would follow from known general principle this be a idea entirely new to I when i find it in comte : and but for he i might not soon -lrb- if ever -rrb- have arrive at it i have be long a ardent admirer of comte 's writings before i have any communication with himself nor do i ever to the last see he in the body but for some year we be frequent correspondent until we correspondence become controversial and we zeal cool i be the first to slacken correspondence he be the first to drop it i find and he probably find likewise that i could do no good to he mind and that all the good he could do to mine he do by he book this would never have lead to discontinuance of intercourse if the difference between we have be on matter of simple doctrine but they be chiefly on those point of opinion which blended in both of we with we strongest feeling and determine the entire direction of we aspiration i have fully agree with he when he maintain that the mass of mankind include even they ruler in all the practical department of life must from the necessity of the case accept most of they opinion on political and social matter as they do on physical from the authority of those who have bestow more study on those subject than they generally have it in they power to do this lesson have be strongly impress on I by the early work of comte to which i have advert and there be nothing in he great treatise which i admire more than he remarkable exposition of the benefit which the nation of modern europe have historically derive from the separation during the middle age of temporal and spiritual power and the distinct organization of the latter i agree with he that the moral and intellectual ascendancy once exercise by priest must in time pass into the hand of philosopher and will naturally do so when they become sufficiently unanimous and in other respects worthy to possess it but when he exaggerate this line of think into a practical system in which philosopher be to be organize into a kind of corporate hierarchy invest with almost the same spiritual supremacy -lrb- though without any secular power -rrb- once possess by the catholic church when i find he rely on this spiritual authority as the only security for good government the sole bulwark against practical oppression and expect that by it a system of despotism in the state and despotism in the family would be render innocuous and beneficial it be not surprising that while as logician we be nearly at one as sociologist we could travel together no further m comte live to carry out these doctrine to they extremest consequence by plan in he last work the _ systme de politique positive _ the completest system of spiritual and temporal despotism which ever yet emanate from a human brain unless possibly that of ignatius loyolum : a system by which the yoke of general opinion wield by a organize body of spiritual teacher and ruler would be make supreme over every action and as far as be in human possibility every thought of every member of the community as well in the thing which regard only himself as in those which concern the interest of other it be but just to say that this work be a considerable improvement in many point of feeling over comte 's previous writings on the same subject : but as a accession to social philosophy the only value it seem to I to possess consist in put a end to the notion that no effectual moral authority can be maintain over society without the aid of religious belief for comte 's work recognize no religion except that of humanity yet it leave a irresistible conviction that any moral belief concur in by the community generally may be bring to bear upon the whole conduct and life of its individual member with a energy and potency truly alarming to think of the book stand a monumental warning to thinker on society and politics of what happen when once man lose sight in they speculation of the value of liberty and of individuality to return to myself the _ review _ engross for some time longer nearly all the time i could devote to authorship or to think with authorship in view the article from the _ london and westminster review _ which be reprint in the _ dissertation _ be scarcely a fourth part of those i write in the conduct of the _ review _ i have two principal object one be to free philosophic radicalism from the reproach of sectarian benthamism i desire while retain the precision of expression the definiteness of mean the contempt of declamatory phrase and vague generality which be so honourably characteristic both of bentham and of my father to give a wider basis and a more free and genial character to radical speculation to show that there be a radical philosophy better and more complete than bentham 's while recognize and incorporate all of bentham 's which be permanently valuable in this first object i to a certain extent succeed the other thing i attempt be to stir up the educate radical in and out of parliament to exertion and induce they to make themselves what i think by use the proper means they might become -- a powerful party capable of take the government of the country or at least of dictate the term on which they should share it with the whig this attempt be from the first chimerical : partly because the time be unpropitious the reform fervor be in its period of ebb and the tory influence powerfully rally but still more because as austin so truly say the country do not contain the man among the radical in parliament there be several qualify to be useful member of a enlighten radical party but none capable of form and lead such a party the exhortation i address to they find no response one occasion do present itself when there seem to be room for a bold and successful stroke for radicalism lord durham have leave the ministry by reason as be think of they not be sufficiently liberal he afterwards accept from they the task of ascertain and remove the cause of the canadian rebellion he have show a disposition to surround himself at the outset with radical adviser one of he earliest measure a good measure both in intention and in effect have be disapprove and reverse by the government at home he have resign he post and place himself openly in a position of quarrel with the minister here be a possible chief for a radical party in the person of a man of importance who be hate by the tory and have just be injure by the whig any one who have the most elementary notion of party tactic must have attempt to make something of such a opportunity lord durham be bitterly attack from all side inveigh against by enemy give up by timid friend while those who would willingly have defend he do not know what to say he appear to be return a defeat and discredit man i have follow the canadian event from the beginning i have be one of the prompter of he prompter he policy be almost exactly what mine would have be and i be in a position to defend it i write and publish a manifesto in the _ review _ in which i take the very highest ground in he behalf claim for he not mere acquittal but praise and honor instantly a number of other writer take up the tone : i believe there be a portion of truth in what lord durham soon after with polite exaggeration say to I -- that to this article might be ascribe the almost triumphal reception which he meet with on he arrival in england i believe it to have be the word in season which at a critical moment do much to decide the result the touch which determine whether a stone set in motion at the top of a eminence shall roll down on one side or on the other all hope connect with lord durham as a politician soon vanish but with regard to canadian and generally to colonial policy the cause be gain : lord durham 's report write by charle buller partly under the inspiration of wakefield begin a new era its recommendation extend to complete internal self-government be in full operation in canada within two or three year and have be since extend to nearly all the other colony of european race which have any claim to the character of important community and i may say that in successfully uphold the reputation of lord durham and he adviser at the most important moment i contribute materially to this result one other case occur during my conduct of the _ review _ which similarly illustrate the effect of take a prompt initiative i believe that the early success and reputation of carlyle 's _ french revolution _ be considerably accelerate by what i write about it in the _ review _ immediately on its publication and before the commonplace critic all whose rule and mode of judgment it set at defiance have time to pre-occupy the public with they disapproval of it i write and publish a review of the book hail it as one of those production of genius which be above all rule and be a law to themselves neither in this case nor in that of lord durham do i ascribe the impression which i think be produce by what i write to any particular merit of execution : indeed in at least one of the case -lrb- the article on carlyle -rrb- i do not think the execution be good and in both instance i be persuade that anybody in a position to be read who have express the same opinion at the same precise time and have make any tolerable statement of the just grounds for it would have produce the same effect but after the complete failure of my hope of put a new life into radical politics by means of the _ review _ i be glad to look back on these two instance of success in a honest attempt to do mediate service to thing and person that deserve it after the last hope of the formation of a radical party have disappear it be time for I to stop the heavy expenditure of time and money which the _ review _ cost I it have to some extent answer my personal purpose as a vehicle for my opinion it have enable I to express in print much of my altered mode of thought and to separate myself in a marked manner from the narrower benthamism of my early writings this be do by the general tone of all i write include various purely literary article but especially by the two papers -lrb- reprint in the _ dissertation _ -rrb- which attempt a philosophical estimate of bentham and of coleridge in the first of these while do full justice to the merit of bentham i point out what i think the error and deficiency of he philosophy the substance of this criticism _ i _ still think perfectly just but i have sometimes doubt whether it be right to publish it at that time i have often feel that bentham 's philosophy as a instrument of progress have be to some extent discredit before it have do its work and that to lend a hand towards lower its reputation be do more harm than service to improvement now however when a counter-reaction appear to be set in towards what be good in benthamism i can look with more satisfaction on this criticism of its defect especially as i have myself balance it by vindication of the fundamental principle of bentham 's philosophy which be reprint along with it in the same collection in the essay on coleridge i attempt to characterize the european reaction against the negative philosophy of the eighteenth century : and here if the effect only of this one paper be to be consider i might be think to have err by give undue prominence to the favourable side as i have do in the case of bentham to the unfavourable in both case the impetus with which i have detach myself from what be untenable in the doctrine of bentham and of the eighteenth century may have carry I though in appearance rather than in reality too far on the contrary side but as far as relate to the article on coleridge my defense be that i be write for radical and liberal and it be my business to dwell most on that in writer of a different school from the knowledge of which they might derive most improvement the number of the _ review _ which contain the paper on coleridge be the last which be publish during my proprietorship in the spring of 1840 i make over the _ review _ to mr hickson who have be a frequent and very useful unpaid contributor under my management : only stipulate that the change should be mark by a resumption of the old name that of _ westminster review _ under that name mr hickson conduct it for ten year on the plan of divide among contributor only the net proceeds of the _ review _ give he own labor as writer and editor gratuitously under the difficulty in obtain writer which arise from this low scale of payment it be highly creditable to he that he be able to maintain in some tolerable degree the character of the _ review _ as a organ of radicalism and progress i do not cease altogether to write for the _ review _ but continue to send it occasional contribution not however exclusively for the greater circulation of the _ edinburgh review _ induce I from this time to offer article to it also when i have anything to say for which it appear to be a suitable vehicle and the conclude volume of _ democracy in america _ have just then come out i inaugurate myself as a contributor to the _ edinburgh _ by the article on that work which head the second volume of the _ dissertation _ chapter vii general view of the remainder of my life from this time what be worth relate of my life will come into a very small compass for i have no further mental change to tell of but only as i hope a continued mental progress which do not admit of a consecutive history and the result of which if real will be best find in my writings i shall therefore greatly abridge the chronicle of my subsequent year the first use i make of the leisure which i gain by disconnect myself from the _ review _ be to finish the _ logic _ in July and August 1838 i have find a interval in which to execute what be still undo of the original draft of the third book in work out the logical theory of those law of nature which be not law of causation nor corollary from such law i be lead to recognize kind as reality in nature and not mere distinction for convenience a light which i have not obtain when the first book be write and which make it necessary for I to modify and enlarge several chapter of that book the book on language and classification and the chapter on the classification of fallacy be draft in the autumn of the same year the remainder of the work in the summer and autumn of 1840 from April follow to the end of 1841 my spare time be devote to a complete rewrite of the book from its commencement it be in this way that all my book have be compose they be always write at least twice over a first draft of the entire work be complete to the very end of the subject then the whole begin again _ de novo _ but incorporate in the second write all sentence and part of sentence of the old draft which appear as suitable to my purpose as anything which i could write in lieu of they i have find great advantage in this system of double redaction it combine better than any other mode of composition the freshness and vigor of the first conception with the superior precision and completeness result from prolonged thought in my own case moreover i have find that the patience necessary for a careful elaboration of the detail of composition and expression cost much less effort after the entire subject have be once go through and the substance of all that i find to say have in some manner however imperfect be get upon paper the only thing which i be careful in the first draft to make as perfect as i be able be the arrangement if that be bad the whole thread on which the idea string themselves become twisted thought place in a wrong connection be not expound in a manner that suit the right and a first draft with this original vice be next to useless as a foundation for the final treatment during the re-writing of the _ logic _ dr whewell 's _ philosophy of the inductive science _ make its appearance a circumstance fortunate for I as it give I what i greatly desire a full treatment of the subject by a antagonist and enable I to present my idea with greater clearness and emphasis as well as fuller and more varied development in defend they against definite objection or confront they distinctly with a opposite theory the controversy with dr whewell as well as much matter derive from comte be first introduce into the book in the course of the re-writing at the end of 1841 the book be ready for the press i offer it to murray who keep it until too late for publication that season and then refuse it for reason which could just as well have be give at first but i have have no cause to regret a rejection which lead to my offer it to mr parker by whom it be publish in the spring of 1843 my original expectation of success be extremely limited archbishop whately have indeed rehabilitate the name of logic and the study of the form rule and fallacy of ratiocination and dr whewell 's writings have begin to excite a interest in the other part of my subject the theory of induction a treatise however on a matter so abstract could not be expect to be popular it could only be a book for student and student on such subject be not only -lrb- at least in england -rrb- few but addict chiefly to the opposite school of metaphysics the ontological and innate principle school i therefore do not expect that the book would have many reader or approver and look for little practical effect from it save that of keep the tradition unbroken of what i think a better philosophy what hope i have of exciting any immediate attention be mainly ground on the polemical propensity of dr whewell who i think from observation of he conduct in other case would probably do something to bring the book into notice by reply and that promptly to the attack on he opinion he do reply but not till 1850 just in time for I to answer he in the third edition how the book come to have for a work of the kind so much success and what sort of person compose the bulk of those who have buy i will not venture to say read it i have never thoroughly understand but take in conjunction with the many proof which have since be give of a revival of speculation speculation too of a free kind in many quarter and above all -lrb- where at one time i should have least expect it -rrb- in the university the fact become partially intelligible i have never indulge the illusion that the book have make any considerable impression on philosophical opinion the german or _ a priori _ view of human knowledge and of the know faculty be likely for some time longer -lrb- though it may be hope in a diminish degree -rrb- to predominate among those who occupy themselves with such inquiry both here and on the continent but the system of logic supplies what be much want a text-book of the opposite doctrine -- that which derive all knowledge from experience and all moral and intellectual quality principally from the direction give to the association i make as humble a estimate as anybody of what either a analysis of logical process or any possible canon of evidence can do by themselves towards guide or rectify the operation of the understanding combine with other requisite i certainly do think they of great use but whatever may be the practical value of a true philosophy of these matter it be hardly possible to exaggerate the mischief of a false one the notion that truth external to the mind may be know by intuition or consciousness independently of observation and experience be i be persuade in these time the great intellectual support of false doctrine and bad institution by the aid of this theory every inveterate belief and every intense feeling of which the origin be not remember be enable to dispense with the obligation of justify itself by reason and be erect into its own all-sufficient voucher and justification there never be such a instrument devise for consecrate all deep-seated prejudice and the chief strength of this false philosophy in moral politics and religion lie in the appeal which it be accustom to make to the evidence of mathematics and of the cognate branch of physical science to expel it from these be to drive it from its stronghold : and because this have never be effectually do the intuitive school even after what my father have write in he _ analysis of the mind _ have in appearance and as far as publish writings be concern on the whole the best of the argument in attempt to clear up the real nature of the evidence of mathematical and physical truth the _ system of logic _ meet the intuitive philosopher on ground on which they have previously be deem unassailable and give its own explanation from experience and association of that peculiar character of what be call necessary truth which be adduce as proof that they evidence must come from a deeper source than experience whether this have be do effectually be still _ sub judice _ and even then to deprive a mode of think so strongly root in human prejudice and partiality of its mere speculative support go but a very little way towards overcome it but though only a step it be a quite indispensable one for since after all prejudice can only be successfully combate by philosophy no way can really be make against it permanently until it have be show not to have philosophy on its side be now release from any active concern in temporary politics and from any literary occupation involve personal communication with contributor and other i be enable to indulge the inclination natural to think person when the age of boyish vanity be once past for limit my own society to a very few person general society as now carry on in england be so insipid a affair even to the person who make it what it be that it be keep up for any reason rather than the pleasure it afford all serious discussion on matter on which opinion differ be consider ill-bred and the national deficiency in liveliness and sociability have prevent the cultivation of the art of talk agreeably on trifle in which the french of the last century so much excel the sole attraction of what be call society to those who be not at the top of the tree be the hope of be aid to climb a little higher in it while to those who be already at the top it be chiefly a compliance with custom and with the suppose requirement of they station to a person of any but a very common order in thought or feeling such society unless he have personal object to serve by it must be supremely unattractive : and most people in the present day of any really high class of intellect make they contact with it so slight and at such long interval as to be almost consider as retire from it altogether those person of any mental superiority who do otherwise be almost without exception greatly deteriorate by it not to mention loss of time the tone of they feeling be lower : they become less in earnest about those of they opinion respect which they must remain silent in the society they frequent : they come to look upon they most elevated object as unpractical or at least too remote from realization to be more than a vision or a theory and if more fortunate than most they retain they higher principle unimpaired yet with respect to the person and affair of they own day they insensibly adopt the mode of feeling and judgment in which they can hope for sympathy from the company they keep a person of high intellect should never go into unintellectual society unless he can enter it as a apostle yet he be the only person with high object who can safely enter it at all person even of intellectual aspiration have much better if they can make they habitual associate of at least they equal and as far as possible they superior in knowledge intellect and elevation of sentiment moreover if the character be form and the mind make up on the few cardinal point of human opinion agreement of conviction and feeling on these have be feel in all time to be a essential requisite of anything worthy the name of friendship in a really earnest mind all these circumstance unite make the number very small of those whose society and still more whose intimacy i now voluntarily seek among these by far the principal be the incomparable friend of whom i have already speak at this period she live mostly with one young daughter in a quiet part of the country and only occasionally in town with she first husband mr taylor i visit she equally in both place and be greatly indebted to the strength of character which enable she to disregard the false interpretation liable to be put on the frequency of my visit to she while live generally apart from mr taylor and on we occasionally travel together though in all other respect we conduct during those year give not the slightest ground for any other supposition than the true one that we relation to each other at that time be one of strong affection and confidential intimacy only for though we do not consider the ordinance of society binding on a subject so entirely personal we do feel bind that we conduct should be such as in no degree to bring discredit on she husband nor therefore on herself in this third period -lrb- as it may be term -rrb- of my mental progress which now go hand in hand with hers my opinion gain equally in breadth and depth i understand more thing and those which i have understand before i now understand more thoroughly i have now completely turn back from what there have be of excess in my reaction against benthamism i have at the height of that reaction certainly become much more indulgent to the common opinion of society and the world and more willing to be content with second the superficial improvement which have begin to take place in those common opinion than become one whose conviction on so many point differ fundamentally from they i be much more inclined than i can now approve to put in abeyance the more decidedly heretical part of my opinion which i now look upon as almost the only one the assertion of which tend in any way to regenerate society but in addition to this we opinion be far _ more _ heretical than mine have be in the day of my most extreme benthamism in those day i have see little further than the old school of political economist into the possibility of fundamental improvement in social arrangement private property as now understand and inheritance appear to I as to they the _ dernier mot _ of legislation : and i look no further than to mitigate the inequality consequent on these institution by get rid of primogeniture and entail the notion that it be possible to go further than this in remove the injustice -- for injustice it be whether admit of a complete remedy or not -- involve in the fact that some be bear to riches and the vast majority to poverty i then reckon chimerical and only hope that by universal education lead to voluntary restraint on population the portion of the poor might be make more tolerable in short i be a democrat but not the least of a socialist we be now much less democrat than i have be because so long as education continue to be so wretchedly imperfect we dread the ignorance and especially the selfishness and brutality of the mass : but we ideal of ultimate improvement go far beyond democracy and would class we decidedly under the general designation of socialist while we repudiate with the greatest energy that tyranny of society over the individual which most socialistic system be suppose to involve we yet look forward to a time when society will no longer be divide into the idle and the industrious when the rule that they who do not work shall not eat will be apply not to pauper only but impartially to all when the division of the produce of labor instead of depend as in so great a degree it now do on the accident of birth will be make by concert on a acknowledged principle of justice and when it will no longer either be or be think to be impossible for human being to exert themselves strenuously in procure benefit which be not to be exclusively they own but to be share with the society they belong to the social problem of the future we consider to be how to unite the greatest individual liberty of action with a common ownership in the raw material of the globe and a equal participation of all in the benefit of combine labor we have not the presumption to suppose that we could already foresee by what precise form of institution these object could most effectually be attain or at how near or how distant a period they would become practicable we see clearly that to render any such social transformation either possible or desirable a equivalent change of character must take place both in the uncultivated herd who now compose the labor mass and in the immense majority of they employer both these class must learn by practice to labor and combine for generous or at all event for public and social purpose and not as hitherto solely for narrowly interested one but the capacity to do this have always exist in mankind and be not nor be ever likely to be extinct education habit and the cultivation of the sentiment will make a common man dig or weave for he country as readily as fight for he country true enough it be only by slow degree and a system of culture prolong through successive generation that man in general can be bring up to this point but the hindrance be not in the essential constitution of human nature interest in the common good be at present so weak a motive in the generality not because it can never be otherwise but because the mind be not accustom to dwell on it as it dwell from morning till night on thing which tend only to personal advantage when call into activity as only self-interest now be by the daily course of life and spur from behind by the love of distinction and the fear of shame it be capable of produce even in common man the most strenuous exertion as well as the most heroic sacrifice the deep-rooted selfishness which form the general character of the exist state of society be _ so _ deeply root only because the whole course of exist institution tend to foster it and modern institution in some respects more than ancient since the occasion on which the individual be call on to do anything for the public without receive its pay be far less frequent in modern life than the smaller commonwealth of antiquity these consideration do not make we overlook the folly of premature attempt to dispense with the inducement of private interest in social affair while no substitute for they have be or can be provide : but we regard all exist institution and social arrangement as be -lrb- in a phrase i once hear from austin -rrb- merely provisional and we welcome with the greatest pleasure and interest all socialistic experiment by select individual -lrb- such as the co-operative society -rrb- which whether they succeed or fail could not but operate as a most useful education of those who take part in they by cultivate they capacity of act upon motive point directly to the general good or make they aware of the defect which render they and other incapable of do so in the _ principle of political economy _ these opinion be promulgate less clearly and fully in the first edition rather more so in the second and quite unequivocally in the third the difference arise partly from the change of time the first edition have be write and send to press before the french revolution of 1848 after which the public mind become more open to the reception of novelty in opinion and doctrine appear moderate which would have be think very startling a short time before in the first edition the difficulty of socialism be state so strongly that the tone be on the whole that of opposition to it in the year or two which follow much time be give to the study of the best socialistic writer on the continent and to meditation and discussion on the whole range of topic involve in the controversy : and the result be that most of what have be write on the subject in the first edition be cancel and replace by argument and reflection which represent a more advanced opinion the _ political economy _ be far more rapidly execute than the _ logic _ or indeed than anything of importance which i have previously write it be commence in the autumn of 1845 and be ready for the press before the end of 1847 in this period of little more than two year there be a interval of six month during which the work be lay aside while i be write article in the _ morning chronicle _ -lrb- which unexpectedly enter warmly into my purpose -rrb- urge the formation of peasant property on the waste land of ireland this be during the period of the famine the winter of 1846-47 when the stern necessity of the time seem to afford a chance of gain attention for what appear to I the only mode of combine relief to immediate destitution with permanent improvement of the social and economical condition of the irish people but the idea be new and strange there be no english precedent for such a proceeding : and the profound ignorance of english politician and the english public concern all social phenomenon not generally meet with in england -lrb- however common elsewhere -rrb- make my endeavor a entire failure instead of a great operation on the waste land and the conversion of cottier into proprietor parliament pass a poor law for maintain they as pauper : and if the nation have not since find itself in inextricable difficulty from the joint operation of the old evil and the quack remedy it be indebted for its deliverance to that most unexpected and surprising fact the depopulation of ireland commence by famine and continue by emigration the rapid success of the _ political economy _ show that the public want and be prepare for such a book publish early in 1848 a edition of a thousand copy be sell in less than a year another similar edition be publish in the spring of 1849 and a third of 1250 copy early in 1852 it be from the first continually cite and refer to as a authority because it be not a book merely of abstract science but also of application and treat political economy not as a thing by itself but as a fragment of a greater whole a branch of social philosophy so interlinked with all the other branch that its conclusion even in its own peculiar province be only true conditionally subject to interference and counteraction from cause not directly within its scope : while to the character of a practical guide it have no pretension apart from other class of consideration political economy in truth have never pretend to give advice to mankind with no light but its own though people who know nothing but political economy -lrb- and therefore know that ill -rrb- have take upon themselves to advise and could only do so by such light as they have but the numerous sentimental enemy of political economy and its still more numerous interested enemy in sentimental guise have be very successful in gain belief for this among other unmerited imputation against it and the _ principle _ have in spite of the freedom of many of its opinion become for the present the most popular treatise on the subject have help to disarm the enemy of so important a study the amount of its worth as a exposition of the science and the value of the different application which it suggest other of course must judge for a considerable time after this i publish no work of magnitude though i still occasionally write in periodical and my correspondence -lrb- much of it with person quite unknown to I -rrb- on subject of public interest swell to a considerable bulk during these year i write or commence various essay for eventual publication on some of the fundamental question of human and social life with regard to several of which i have already much exceed the severity of the horatian precept i continue to watch with keen interest the progress of public event but it be not on the whole very encourage to I the european reaction after 1848 and the success of a unprincipled usurper in December 1851 put a end as it seem to all present hope for freedom or social improvement in france and the continent in england i have see and continue to see many of the opinion of my youth obtain general recognition and many of the reform in institution for which i have through life contend either effect or in course of be so but these change have be attend with much less benefit to human well-being than i should formerly have anticipate because they have produce very little improvement in that which all real amelioration in the lot of mankind depend on they intellectual and moral state : and it might even be question if the various cause of deterioration which have be at work in the meanwhile have not more than counterbalance the tendency to improvement i have learn from experience that many false opinion may be exchange for true one without in the least alter the habit of mind of which false opinion be the result the english public for example be quite as raw and undiscerning on subject of political economy since the nation have be convert to free-trade as they be before and be still further from have acquire better habit of thought and feeling or be in any way better fortify against error on subject of a more elevated character for though they have throw off certain error the general discipline of they mind intellectually and morally be not altered i be now convince that no great improvement in the lot of mankind be possible until a great change take place in the fundamental constitution of they mode of think the old opinion in religion moral and politics be so much discredit in the more intellectual mind as to have lose the greater part of they efficacy for good while they have still life enough in they to be a powerful obstacle to the grow up of any better opinion on those subject when the philosophic mind of the world can no longer believe its religion or can only believe it with modification amount to a essential change of its character a transitional period commence of weak conviction paralyse intellect and grow laxity of principle which can not terminate until a renovation have be effect in the basis of they belief lead to the evolution of some faith whether religious or merely human which they can really believe : and when thing be in this state all think or write which do not tend to promote such a renovation be of very little value beyond the moment since there be little in the apparent condition of the public mind indicative of any tendency in this direction my view of the immediate prospects of human improvement be not sanguine more recently a spirit of free speculation have spring up give a more encouraging prospect of the gradual mental emancipation of england and concur with the renewal under better auspices of the movement for political freedom in the rest of europe have give to the present condition of human affair a more hopeful aspect -lrb- 3 -rrb- between the time of which i have now speak and the present take place the most important event of my private life the first of these be my marriage in April 1851 to the lady whose incomparable worth have make she friendship the greatest source to I both of happiness and of improvement during many year in which we never expect to be in any closer relation to one another ardently as i should have aspire to this complete union of we life at any time in the course of my existence at which it have be practicable i as much as my wife would far rather have foregone that privilege for ever than have owe it to the premature death of one for whom i have the sincerest respect and she the strongest affection that event however have take place in July 1849 it be grant to I to derive from that evil my own greatest good by add to the partnership of thought feeling and write which have long exist a partnership of we entire existence for seven and a-half year that blessing be mine for seven and a-half only i can say nothing which could describe even in the faintest manner what that loss be and be but because i know that she would have wish it i endeavor to make the best of what life i have leave and to work on for she purpose with such diminish strength as can be derive from thought of she and communion with she memory when two person have they thought and speculation completely in common when all subject of intellectual or moral interest be discuss between they in daily life and probe to much greater depths than be usually or conveniently sound in writings intend for general reader when they set out from the same principle and arrive at they conclusion by process pursue jointly it be of little consequence in respect to the question of originality which of they hold the pen the one who contribute least to the composition may contribute more to the think the writings which result be the joint product of both and it must often be impossible to disentangle they respective part and affirm that this belong to one and that to the other in this wide sense not only during the year of we married life but during many of the year of confidential friendship which precede all my publish writings be as much here work as mine she share in they constantly increase as year advance but in certain case what belong to she can be distinguish and specially identify over and above the general influence which she mind have over mine the most valuable idea and feature in these joint production -- those which have be most fruitful of important result and have contribute most to the success and reputation of the work themselves -- originate with she be emanation from she mind my part in they be no greater than in any of the thought which i find in previous writer and make my own only by incorporate they with my own system of think during the greater part of my literary life i have perform the office in relation to she which from a rather early period i have consider as the most useful part that i be qualify to take in the domain of thought that of a interpreter of original thinker and mediator between they and the public for i have always a humble opinion of my own power as a original thinker except in abstract science -lrb- logic metaphysics and the theoretic principle of political economy and politics -rrb- but think myself much superior to most of my contemporary in willingness and ability to learn from everybody as i find hardly anyone who make such a point of examine what be say in defense of all opinion however new or however old in the conviction that even if they be error there might be a substratum of truth underneath they and that in any case the discovery of what it be that make they plausible would be a benefit to truth i have in consequence mark this out as a sphere of usefulness in which i be under a special obligation to make myself active the more so as the acquaintance i have form with the idea of the coleridgian of the german thinker and of carlyle all of they fiercely oppose to the mode of think in which i have be bring up have convince I that along with much error they possess much truth which be veil from mind otherwise capable of receive it by the transcendental and mystical phraseology in which they be accustom to shut it up and from which they neither care nor know how to disengage it and i do not despair of separate the truth from the error and expose it in term which would be intelligible and not repulsive to those on my own side in philosophy thus prepare it will easily be believe that when i come into close intellectual communion with a person of the most eminent faculty whose genius as it grow and unfold itself in think continually strike out truth far in advance of I but in which i could not as i have do in those other detect any mixture of error the greatest part of my mental growth consist in the assimilation of those truth and the most valuable part of my intellectual work be in build the bridge and clear the path which connect they with my general system of thought -lrb- 4 -rrb- the first of my book in which she share be conspicious be the _ principle of political economy _ the _ system of logic _ owe little to she except in the minuter matter of composition in which respect my writings both great and small have largely benefit by she accurate and clear-sighted criticism -lrb- 5 -rrb- the chapter of the _ political econonomy _ which have have a greater influence on opinion than all the rest that on ` the probable future of the labor class ' be entirely due to she in the first draft of the book that chapter do not exist she point out the need of such a chapter and the extreme imperfection of the book without it she be the cause of my write it and the more general part of the chapter the statement and discussion of the two opposite theory respect the proper condition of the labor class be wholly a exposition of she thought often in word take from she own lip the purely scientific part of the _ political economy _ i do not learn from she but it be chiefly she influence that give to the book that general tone by which it be distinguish from all previous exposition of political economy that have any pretension to be scientific and which have make it so useful in conciliate mind which those previous exposition have repel this tone consist chiefly in make the proper distinction between the law of the production of wealth -- which be law of nature dependent on the property of object -- and the mode of its distribution which subject to certain condition depend on human will the commom run of political economist confuse these together under the designation of economic law which they deem incapable of be defeat or modify by human effort ascribe the same necessity to thing dependent on the unchangeable condition of we earthly existence and to those which be but the necessary consequence of particular social arrangement be merely co-extensive with these give certain institution and custom wages profit and rent will be determine by certain cause but this class of political economist drop the indispensable presupposition and argue that these cause must by a inherent necessity against which no human means can avail determine the share which fall in the division of the produce to labourer capitalist and landlord the _ principle of political economy _ yield to none of its predecessor in aim at the scientific appreciation of the action of these cause under the condition which they presuppose but it set the example of not treat those condition as final the economic generalization which depend not on necessaty of nature but on those combine with the exist arrangement of society it deal with only as provisional and as liable to be much alter by the progress of social improvement i have indeed partially learn this view of thing from the thought awaken in I by the speculation of the st simonian but it be make a living principle pervading and animate the book by my wife 's prompting this example illustrate well the general character of what she contribute to my writings what be abstract and purely scientific be generally mine the properly human element come from she : in all that concern the application of philosophy to the exigency of human society and progress i be she pupil alike in boldness of speculation and cautiousness of practical judgment for on the one hand she be much more courageous and far-sighted than without she i should have be in anticipation of a order of thing to come in which many of the limited generalization now so often confound with universal principle will cease to be applicable those part of my writings and especially of the _ political economy _ which contemplate possibility in the future such as when affirm by socialist have in general be fiercely deny by political economist would but for she either have be absent or the suggestion would have be make much more timidly and in a more qualified form but while she thus render I bolder in speculation on human affair she practical turn of mind and she almost unerring estimate of practical obstacle repress in I all tendency that be really visionary she mind invest all idea in a concrete shape and form to itself a conception of how they would actually work : and she knowledge of the exist feeling and conduct of mankind be so seldom at fault that the weak point in any unworkable suggestion seldom escape she -lrb- 6 -rrb- during the two year which immediately precede the cessation of my official life my wife and i be work together at the liberty i have first plan and write it as a short essay in 1854 it be in mount the step of the capitol in January 1855 that the thought first arise of convert it into a volume none of my writings have be either so carefully compose or so sedulously correct as this after it have be write as usual twice over we keep it by we bring it out from time to time and go through it _ de novo _ reading weigh and criticize every sentence its final revision be to have be a work of the winter of 1858-9 the first after my retirement which we have arrange to pass in the south of europe that hope and every other be frustrate by the most unexpected and bitter calamity of she death -- at avignon on we way to montpellier from a sudden attack of pulmonary congestion since then i have seek for such allevation as my state admit of by the mode of life which most enable I to feel she still near I i buy a cottage as close as possible to the place where she be bury and there she daughter -lrb- my fellow-sufferer and now my chief comfort -rrb- and i live constantly during a great portion of the year my object in life be solely those which be hers my pursuit and occupation those in which she share or sympathize and which be indissolubly associate with she she memory be to I a religion and she approbation the standard by which sum up as it do all worthiness i endeavor to regulate my life after my irreparable loss one of my earliest care be to print and publish the treatise so much of which be the work of she whom i have lose and consecrate it to she memory i have make no alteration or addition to it nor shall i ever though it want the last touch of she hand no substitute for that touch shall ever be attempt by mine the _ liberty _ be more directly and literally we joint production than anything else which bear my name for there be not a sentence of it that be not several time go through by we together turn over in many way and carefully weed of any fault either in thought or expression that we detect in it it be in consequence of this that although it never undergo she final revision it far surpass as a mere specimen of composition anything which have proceed from I either before or since with regard to the thought it be difficult to identify any particular part or element as be more hers than all the rest the whole mode of thinking of which the book be the expression be emphatically hers but i also be so thoroughly imbue with it that the same thought naturally occur to we both that i be thus penetrate with it however i owe in a great degree to she there be a moment in my mental progress when i might easily have fall into a tendency towards over-government both social and political as there be also a moment when by reaction from a contrary excess i might have become a less thorough radical and democrat than i be in both these point as in many other she benefit I as much by keep I right where i be right as by lead I to new truth and rid I of error my great readiness and eagerness to learn from everybody and to make room in my opinion for every new acquisition by adjust the old and the new to one another might but for she steadying influence have seduce I into modify my early opinion too much she be in nothing more valuable to my mental development than by she just measure of the relative importance of different consideration which often protect I from allow to truth i have only recently learn to see a more important place in my thought than be properly they due the _ liberty _ be likely to survive longer than anything else that i have write -lrb- with the possible exception of the _ logic _ -rrb- because the conjunction of she mind with mine have render it a kind of philosophic text-book of a single truth which the change progressively take place in modern society tend to bring out into ever stronger relief : the importance to man and society of a large variety in type of character and of give full freedom to human nature to expand itself in innumerable and conflicting direction nothing can better show how deep be the foundation of this truth than the great impression make by the exposition of it at a time which to superficial observation do not seem to stand much in need of such a lesson the fear we express lest the inevitable growth of social equality and of the government of public opinion should impose on mankind a oppressive yoke of uniformity in opinion and practice might easily have appear chimerical to those who look more at present fact than at tendency for the gradual revolution that be take place in society and institution have thus far be decidedly favourable to the development of new opinion and have procure for they a much more unprejudiced hearing than they previously meet with but this be a feature belong to period of transition when old notion and feeling have be unsettled and no new doctrine have yet succeed to they ascendancy at such time people of any mental activity have give up they old belief and not feeling quite sure that those they still retain can stand unmodified listen eagerly to new opinion but this state of thing be necessarily transitory : some particular body of doctrine in time rally the majority round it organize social institution and mode of action conformably to itself education impress this new creed upon the new generation without the mental process that have lead to it and by degree it acquire the very same power of compression so long exercise by the creed of which it have take the place whether this noxious power will be exercise depend on whether mankind have by that time become aware that it can not be exercise without stunt and dwarf human nature it be then that the teaching of the _ liberty _ will have they greatest value and it be to be fear that they will retain that value a long time as regard originality it have of course no other than that which every thoughtful mind give to its own mode of conceive and express truth which be common property the lead thought of the book be one which though in many age confine to insulate thinker mankind have probably at no time since the beginning of civilization be entirely without to speak only of the last few generation it be distinctly contain in the vein of important thought respect education and culture spread through the european mind by the labor and genius of pestalozzus the unqualified championship of it by wilhelm von humboldt be refer to in the book but he by no means stand alone in he own country during the early part of the present century the doctrine of the rights of individuality and the claim of the moral nature to develop itself in its own way be push by a whole school of german author even to exaggeration and the writings of goethe the most celebrated of all german author though not belong to that or to any other school be penetrate throughout by view of moral and of conduct in life often in my opinion not defensible but which be incessantly seek whatever defense they admit of in the theory of the right and duty of self-development in we own country before the book _ on liberty _ be write the doctrine of individuality have be enthusiastically assert in a style of vigorous declamation sometimes remind one of fichte by mr william maccall in a series of writings of which the most elaborate be entitle _ element of individualism _ : and a remarkable american mr warren have frame a system of society on the foundation of _ the sovereignty of the individual _ have obtain a number of follower and have actually commence the formation of a village community -lrb- whether it now exist i know not -rrb- which though bear a superficial resemblance to some of the project of socialist be diametrically opposite to they in principle since it recognize no authority whatever in society over the individual except to enforce equal freedom of development for all individuality as the book which bear my name claim no originality for any of its doctrine and be not intend to write they history the only author who have precede I in they assertion of whom i think it appropriate to say anything be humboldt who furnish the motto to the work although in one passage i borrow from the warrenite they phrase the sovereignty of the individual it be hardly necessary here to remark that there be abundant difference in detail between the conception of the doctrine by any of the predecessor i have mention and that set forth in the book the political circumstance of the time induce I shortly after to complete and publish a pamphlet -lrb- _ thought on parliamentary reform _ -rrb- part of which have be write some year previously on the occasion of one of the abortive reform bill and have at the time be approve and revise by she its principal feature be hostility to the ballot -lrb- a change of opinion in both of we in which she rather precede I -rrb- and a claim of representation for minority not however at that time go beyond the cumulative vote propose by mr garth marshall in finish the pamphlet for publication with a view to the discussion on the reform bill of lord derby 's and mr disraelus 's government in 1859 i add a third feature a plurality of vote to be give not to property but to prove superiority of education this recommend itself to I as a means of reconcile the irresistible claim of every man or woman to be consult and to be allow a voice in the regulation of affair which vitally concern they with the superiority of weight justly due to opinion ground on superiority of knowledge the suggestion however be one which i have never discuss with my almost infallible counsellor and i have no evidence that she would have concur in it as far as i have be able to observe it have find favor with nobody all who desire any sort of inequality in the electoral vote desire it in favor of property and not of intelligence or knowledge if it ever overcome the strong feeling which exist against it this will only be after the establishment of a systematic national education by which the various grade of politically valuable acquirement may be accurately define and authenticate without this it will always remain liable to strong possibly conclusive objection and with this it would perhaps not be need it be soon after the publication of _ thought on parliamentary reform _ that i become acquaint with mr hare 's admirable system of personal representation which in its present shape be then for the first time publish i saw in this great practical and philosophical idea the greatest improvement of which the system of representative government be susceptible a improvement which in the most felicitous manner exactly meet and cure the grand and what before seem the inherent defect of the representative system that of give to a numerical majority all power instead of only a power proportional to its number and enable the strongest party to exclude all weaker party from make they opinion hear in the assembly of the nation except through such opportunity as may be give to they by the accidentally unequal distribution of opinion in different locality to these great evil nothing more than very imperfect palliation have seem possible but mr hare 's system afford a radical cure this great discovery for it be no less in the political art inspire I as i believe it have inspire all thoughtful person who have adopt it with new and more sanguine hope respect the prospects of human society by free the form of political institution towards which the whole civilized world be manifestly and irresistibly tend from the chief part of what seem to qualify or render doubtful its ultimate benefit minority so long as they remain minority be and ought to be outvote but under arrangement which enable any assemblage of voter amount to a certain number to place in the legislature a representative of its own choice minority can not be suppress independent opinion will force they way into the council of the nation and make themselves hear there a thing which often can not happen in the exist form of representative democracy and the legislature instead of be weed of individual peculiarity and entirely make up of man who simply represent the creed of great political or religious party will comprise a large proportion of the most eminent individual mind in the country place there without reference to party by voter who appreciate they individual eminence i can understand that person otherwise intelligent should for want of sufficient examination be repel from mr hare 's plan by what they think the complex nature of its machinery but any one who do not feel the want which the scheme be intend to supply any one who throw it over as a mere theoretical subtlety or crotchet tend to no valuable purpose and unworthy of the attention of practical man may be pronounce a incompetent statesman unequal to the politics of the future i mean unless he be a minister or aspire to become one : for we be quite accustomed to a minister continue to profess unqualified hostility to a improvement almost to the very day when he conscience or he interest induce he to take it up as a public measure and carry it have i meet with mr hare 's system before the publication of my pamphlet i should have give a account of it there not have do so i write a article in _ fraser 's magazine _ -lrb- reprint in my miscellaneous writings -rrb- principally for that purpose though i include in it along with mr hare 's book a review of two other production on the question of the day one of they a pamphlet by my early friend mr john austin who have in he old age become a enemy to all further parliamentary reform the other a able and vigourous though partially erroneous work by mr lorimer in the course of the same summer i fulfil a duty particularly incumbent upon I that of help -lrb- by a article in the _ edinburgh review _ -rrb- to make known mr bain 's profound treatise on the mind just then complete by the publication of its second volume and i carry through the press a selection of my minor writings form the first two volume of _ dissertation and discussion _ the selection have be make during my wife 's lifetime but the revision in concert with she with a view to republication have be barely commence and when i have no longer the guidance of she judgment i despaired of pursue it further and republish the papers as they be with the exception of strike out such passage as be no longer in accordance with my opinion my literary work of the year be terminate with a essay in _ fraser 's magazine _ -lrb- afterwards republish in the third volume of _ dissertation and discussion _ -rrb- entitle a few word on non-intervention i be prompt to write this paper by a desire while vindicate england from the imputation commonly bring against she on the continent of a peculiar selfishness in matter of foreign policy to warn englishman of the color give to this imputation by the low tone in which english statesman be accustom to speak of english policy as concern only with english interest and by the conduct of lord palmerston at that particular time in oppose the suez canal and i take the opportunity of express idea which have long be in my mind -lrb- some of they generate by my indian experience and other by the international question which then greatly occupy the european public -rrb- respect the true principle of international morality and the legitimate modification make in it by difference of time and circumstance a subject i have already to some extent discuss in the vindication of the french provisional government of 1848 against the attack of lord brougham and other which i publish at the time in the _ westminster review _ and which be reprint in the _ dissertation _ i have now settle as i believe for the remainder of my existence into a purely literary life if that can be call literary which continue to be occupy in a pre-eminent degree with politics and not merely with theoretical but practical politics although a great part of the year be spend at a distance of many hundred mile from the chief seat of the politics of my own country to which and primarily for which i write but in truth the modern facility of communication have not only remove all the disadvantage to a political writer in tolerably easy circumstance of distance from the scene of political action but have convert they into advantage the immediate and regular receipt of newspaper and periodical keep he _ au courant _ of even the most temporary politics and give he a much more correct view of the state and progress of opinion than he could acquire by personal contact with individual : for every one 's social intercourse be more or less limited to particular set or class whose impression and no other reach he through that channel and experience have teach I that those who give they time to the absorb claim of what be call society not have leisure to keep up a large acquaintance with the organ of opinion remain much more ignorant of the general state either of the public mind or of the active and instruct part of it than a recluse who read the newspaper need be there be no doubt disadvantage in too long a separation from one 's country -- in not occasionally renew one 's impression of the light in which man and thing appear when see from a position in the midst of they but the deliberate judgment form at a distance and undisturbed by inequality of perspective be the most to be depend on even for application to practice alternate between the two position i combine the advantage of both and though the inspirer of my best thought be no longer with I i be not alone : she have leave a daughter my stepdaughter -lrb- miss helen taylor the inheritor of much of she wisdom and of all she nobleness of character -rrb- whose ever grow and ripen talent from that day to this have be devote to the same great purpose -lrb- and have already make she name better and more widely known than be that of she mother though far less so than i predict that if she live it be destine to become of the value of she direct cooperation with I something will be say hereafter of what i owe in the way of instruction to she great power of original thought and soundness of practical judgment it would be a vain attempt to give a adequate idea -rrb- surely no one ever before be so fortunate as after such a loss as mine to draw another prize in the lottery of life -lrb- -- another companion stimulator adviser and instructor of the rarest quality -rrb- whoever either now or hereafter may think of I and of the work i have do must never forget that it be the product not of one intellect and conscience but of three -lrb- the least considerable of whom and above all the least original be the one whose name be attach to it -rrb- the work of the year 1860 and 1861 consist chiefly of two treatise only one of which be intend for immediate publication this be the _ consideration on representative government _ a connected exposition of what by the thought of many year i have come to regard as the best form of a popular constitution along with as much of the general theory of government as be necessary to support this particular portion of its practice the volume contain many mature view of the principal question which occupy the present age within the province of purely organic institution and raise by anticipation some other question to which grow necessity will sooner or later compel the attention both of theoretical and of practical politician the chief of these last be the distinction between the function of make law for which a numerous popular assembly be radically unfit and that of get good law make which be its proper duty and can not be satisfactorily fulfil by any other authority : and the consequent need of a legislative commission as a permanent part of the constitution of a free country consist of a small number of highly train political mind on whom when parliament have determine that a law shall be make the task of make it should be devolve : parliament retain the power of pass or reject the bill when draw up but not of alter it otherwise than by send propose amendment to be deal with by the commission the question here raise respect the most important of all public function that of legislation be a particular case of the great problem of modern political organization state i believe for the first time in its full extent by bentham though in my opinion not always satisfactorily resolve by he the combination of complete popular control over public affair with the greatest attainable perfection of skilled agency the other treatise write at this time be the one which be publish some year -lrb- 7 -rrb- later under the title of _ the subjection of woman _ it be write -lrb- at my daughter 's suggestion -rrb- that there might in any event be in existence a write exposition of my opinion on that great question as full and conclusive as i could make it the intention be to keep this among other unpublished papers improve it from time to time if i be able and to publish it at the time when it should seem likely to be most useful as ultimately publish -lrb- it be enrich with some important idea of my daughter 's and passage of she writing but -rrb- in what be of my own composition all that be most striking and profound belong to my wife come from the fund of thought which have be make common to we both by we innumerable conversation and discussion on a topic which fill so large a place in we mind soon after this time i take from they repository a portion of the unpublished papers which i have write during the last year of we married life and shape they with some additional matter into the little work entitle _ utilitarianism _ which be first publish in three part in successive number of _ fraser 's magazine _ and afterwards reprint in a volume before this however the state of public affair have become extremely critical by the commencement of the american civil war my strongest feeling be engage in this struggle which i feel from the beginning be destine to be a turn point for good or evil of the course of human affair for a indefinite duration have be a deeply interested observer of the slavery quarrel in america during the many year that precede the open breach i know that it be in all its stage a aggressive enterprise of the slave-owner to extend the territory of slavery under the combined influence of pecuniary interest domineering temper and the fanaticism of a class for its class privilege influence so fully and powerfully depict in the admirable work of my friend professor cairne _ the slave power _ they success if they succeed would be a victory of the power of evil which would give courage to the enemy of progress and damp the spirit of its friend all over the civilized world while it would create a formidable military power ground on the worst and most anti-social form of the tyranny of man over man and by destroy for a long time the prestige of the great democratic republic would give to all the privileged class of europe a false confidence probably only to be extinguish in blood on the other hand if the spirit of the north be sufficiently rouse to carry the war to a successful termination and if that termination do not come too soon and too easily i foresaw from the law of human nature and the experience of revolution that when it do come it would in all probability be thorough : that the bulk of the northern population whose conscience have as yet be awaken only to the point of resist the further extension of slavery but whose fidelity to the constitution of the united state make they disapprove of any attempt by the federal government to interfere with slavery in the state where it already exist would acquire feeling of another kind when the constitution have be shake off by armed rebellion would determine to have do for ever with the accursed thing and would join they banner with that of the noble body of abolitionist of whom garrison be the courageous and single-minded apostle wendell phillip the eloquent orator and john brown the voluntary martyr -lrb- 8 -rrb- then too the whole mind of the united state would be let loose from its bond no longer corrupt by the suppose necessity of apologize to foreigner for the most flagrant of all possible violation of the free principle of they constitution while the tendency of a fixed state of society to stereotype a set of national opinion would be at least temporarily check and the national mind would become more open to the recognition of whatever be bad in either the institution or the custom of the people these hope so far as related to slavery have be completely and in other respects be in course of be progressively realize foresee from the first this double set of consequence from the success or failure of the rebellion it may be imagine with what feeling i contemplate the rush of nearly the whole upper and middle class of my own country even those who pass for liberal into a furious pro-southern partisanship : the work class and some of the literary and scientific man be almost the sole exception to the general frenzy i never before feel so keenly how little permanent improvement have reach the mind of we influential class and of what small value be the liberal opinion they have get into the habit of profess none of the continental liberal commit the same frightful mistake but the generation which have extort negro emancipation from we west indium planter have pass away another have succeed which have not learn by many year of discussion and exposure to feel strongly the enormity of slavery and the inattention habitual with englishman to whatever be go on in the world outside they own island make they profoundly ignorant of all the antecedent of the struggle insomuch that it be not generally believe in england for the first year or two of the war that the quarrel be one of slavery there be man of high principle and unquestionable liberality of opinion who think it a dispute about tariff or assimilate it to the case in which they be accustom to sympathize of a people struggle for independence it be my obvious duty to be one of the small minority who protest against this perverted state of public opinion i be not the first to protest it ought to be remember to the honor of mr hughe and of mr ludlow that they by writings publish at the very beginning of the struggle begin the protestation mr bright follow in one of the most powerful of he speech follow by other not less striking i be on the point of add my word to theirs when there occur towards the end of 1861 the seizure of the southern envoy on board a british vessel by a officer of the united state even english forgetfulness have not yet have time to lose all remembrance of the explosion of feeling in england which then burst forth the expectation prevail for some week of war with the united state and the warlike preparation actually commence on this side while this state of thing last there be no chance of a hearing for anything favourable to the american cause and moreover i agree with those who think the act unjustifiable and such as to require that england should demand its disavowal when the disavowal come and the alarm of war be over i write in January 1862 the paper in _ fraser 's magazine _ entitle the contest in america -lrb- and i shall always feel grateful to my daughter that she urgency prevail on I to write it when i do for we be then on the point of set out for a journey of some month in greece and turkey and but for she i should have defer write till we return -rrb- write and publish when it be this paper help to encourage those liberal who have feel overborne by the tide of illiberal opinion and to form in favor of the good cause a nucleus of opinion which increase gradually and after the success of the north begin to seem probable rapidly when we return from we journey i write a second article a review of professor cairne ' book publish in the _ westminster review _ england be pay the penalty in many uncomfortable way of the durable resentment which she ruling class stir up in the united state by they ostentatious wish for the ruin of america as a nation they have reason to be thankful that a few if only a few known writer and speaker stand firmly by the american in the time of they greatest difficulty effect a partial diversion of these bitter feeling and make great britain not altogether odious to the american this duty have be perform my principal occupation for the next two year be on subject not political the publication of mr austin 's _ lecture on jurisprudence _ after he decease give I a opportunity of pay a deserve tribute to he memory and at the same time express some thought on a subject on which in my old day of benthamism i have bestow much study but the chief product of those year be the _ examination of sir william hamilton 's philosophy _ he _ lecture _ publish in 1860 and 1861 i have read towards the end of the latter year with a half-formed intention of give a account of they in a review but i soon find that this would be idle and that justice could not be do to the subject in less than a volume i have then to consider whether it would be advisable that i myself should attempt such a performance on consideration there seem to be strong reason for do so i be greatly disappoint with the _ lecture _ i read they certainly with no prejudice against sir william hamilton i have up to that time defer the study of he _ note to reid _ on account of they unfinished state but i have not neglect he _ discussion in philosophy _ and though i know that he general mode of treat the fact of mental philosophy differ from that of which i most approve yet he vigorous polemic against the later transcendentalist and he strenuous assertion of some important principle especially the relativity of human knowledge give I many point of sympathy with he opinion and make I think that genuine psychology have considerably more to gain than to lose by he authority and reputation he _ lecture _ and the _ dissertation on reid _ dispel this illusion : and even the _ discussion _ read by the light which these throw on they lose much of they value i find that the point of apparent agreement between he opinion and mine be more verbal than real that the important philosophical principle which i have think he recognize be so explain away by he as to mean little or nothing or be continually lose sight of and doctrine entirely inconsistent with they be teach in nearly every part of he philosophical writings my estimation of he be therefore so far alter that instead of regard he as occupy a kind of intermediate position between the two rival philosophy hold some of the principle of both and supply to both powerful weapon of attack and defense i now look upon he as one of the pillar and in this country from he high philosophical reputation the chief pillar of that one of the two which seem to I to be erroneous now the difference between these two school of philosophy that of intuition and that of experience and association be not a mere matter of abstract speculation it be full of practical consequence and lie at the foundation of all the greatest difference of practical opinion in a age of progress the practical reformer have continually to demand that change be make in thing which be support by powerful and widely-spread feeling or to question the apparent necessity and indefeasibleness of established fact and it be often a indispensable part of he argument to show how those powerful feeling have they origin and how those fact come to seem necessary and indefeasible there be therefore a natural hostility between he and a philosophy which discourage the explanation of feeling and moral fact by circumstance and association and prefer to treat they as ultimate element of human nature a philosophy which be addict to hold up favorite doctrine as intuitive truth and deem intuition to be the voice of nature and of god speaking with a authority higher than that of we reason in particular i have long feel that the prevail tendency to regard all the marked distinction of human character as innate and in the main indelible and to ignore the irresistible proof that by far the greater part of those difference whether between individual race or sex be such as not only might but naturally would be produce by difference in circumstance be one of the chief hindrance to the rational treatment of great social question and one of the greatest stumbling block to human improvement this tendency have its source in the intuitional metaphysics which characterize the reaction of the nineteenth century against the eighteenth and it be a tendency so agreeable to human indolence as well as to conservative interest generally that unless attack at the very root it be sure to be carry to even a greater length than be really justify by the more moderate form of the intuitional philosophy that philosophy not always in its moderate form have rule the thought of europe for the greater part of a century my father 's _ analysis of the mind _ my own _ logic _ and professor bain 's great treatise have attempt to re-introduce a better mode of philosophize latterly with quite as much success as could be expect but i have for some time feel that the mere contrast of the two philosophy be not enough that there ought to be a hand-to-hand fight between they that controversial as well as expository writings be need and that the time be come when such controversy would be useful consider then the writings and fame of sir w hamilton as the great fortress of the intuitional philosophy in this country a fortress the more formidable from the impose character and the in many respects great personal merit and mental endowment of the man i think it might be a real service to philosophy to attempt a thorough examination of all he most important doctrine and a estimate of he general claim to eminence as a philosopher and i be confirm in this resolution by observe that in the writings of at least one and he one of the ablest of sir w hamilton 's follower he peculiar doctrine be make the justification of a view of religion which i hold to be profoundly immoral -- that it be we duty to bow down in worship before a be whose moral attribute be affirm to be unknowable by we and to be perhaps extremely different from those which when we be speak of we fellow-creature we call by the same name as i advance in my task the damage to sir w hamilton 's reputation become greater than i at first expect through the almost incredible multitude of inconsistency which show themselves on compare different passage with one another it be my business however to show thing exactly as they be and i do not flinch from it i endeavor always to treat the philosopher whom i criticize with the most scrupulous fairness and i know that he have abundance of disciple and admirer to correct I if i ever unintentionally do he injustice many of they accordingly have answer I more or less elaborately and they have point out oversight and misunderstanding though few in number and mostly very unimportant in substance such of those as have -lrb- to my knowledge -rrb- be point out before the publication of the latest edition -lrb- at present the third -rrb- have be correct there and the remainder of the criticism have be as far as seem necessary reply to on the whole the book have do its work : it have show the weak side of sir william hamilton and have reduce he too great philosophical reputation within more moderate bound and by some of its discussion as well as by two expository chapter on the notion of matter and of mind it have perhaps throw additional light on some of the dispute question in the domain of psychology and metaphysics after the completion of the book on hamilton i apply myself to a task which a variety of reason seem to render specially incumbent upon I that of give a account and form a estimate of the doctrine of auguste comte i have contribute more than any one else to make he speculation know in england and in consequence chiefly of what i have say of he in my _ logic _ he have reader and admirer among thoughtful man on this side of the channel at a time when he name have not yet in france emerge from obscurity so unknown and unappreciated be he at the time when my _ logic _ be write and publish that to criticize he weak point might well appear superfluous while it be a duty to give as much publicity as one could to the important contribution he have make to philosophic thought at the time however at which i have now arrive this state of affair have entirely change he name at least be know almost universally and the general character of he doctrine very widely he have take he place in the estimation both of friend and opponent as one of the conspicuous figure in the thought of the age the better part of he speculation have make great progress in work they way into those mind which by they previous culture and tendency be fit to receive they : under cover of those better part those of a worse character greatly develop and add to in he later writings have also make some way have obtain active and enthusiastic adherent some of they of no inconsiderable personal merit in england france and other country these cause not only make it desirable that some one should undertake the task of sift what be good from what be bad in m comte 's speculation but seem to impose on myself in particular a special obligation to make the attempt this i accordingly do in two essay publish in successive number of the _ westminster review _ and reprint in a small volume under the title _ auguste comte and positivism _ the writings which i have now mention together with a small number of papers in periodical which i have not deem worth preserve be the whole of the product of my activity as a writer during the year from 1859 to 1865 in the early part of the last-mentioned year in compliance with a wish frequently express to I by work man i publish cheap people 's edition of those of my writings which seem the most likely to find reader among the work class viz _ principle of political economy _ _ liberty _ and _ representative government _ this be a considerable sacrifice of my pecuniary interest especially as i resign all idea of derive profit from the cheap edition and after ascertain from my publisher the lowest price which they think would remunerate they on the usual term of a equal division of profit i give up my half share to enable the price to be fix still lower to the credit of messr longman they fix unasked a certain number of year after which the copyright and stereotype plate be to revert to I and a certain number of copy after the sale of which i should receive half of any further profit this number of copy -lrb- which in the case of the _ political economy _ be 10000 -rrb- have for some time be exceed and the people 's edition have begin to yield I a small but unexpected pecuniary return though very far from a equivalent for the diminution of profit from the library edition in this summary of my outward life i have now arrive at the period at which my tranquil and retired existence as a writer of book be to be exchange for the less congenial occupation of a member of the house of common the proposal make to I early in 1865 by some elector of westminster do not present the idea to I for the first time it be not even the first offer i have receive for more than ten year previous in consequence of my opinion on the irish land question mr luca and mr duffy in the name of the popular party in ireland offer to bring I into parliament for a irish county which they could easily have do : but the incompatibility of a seat in parliament with the office i then hold in the indium house preclude even consideration of the proposal after i have quit the indium house several of my friend would gladly have see I a member of parliament but there seem no probability that the idea would ever take any practical shape i be convince that no numerous or influential portion of any electoral body really wish to be represent by a person of my opinion and that one who possess no local connection or popularity and who do not choose to stand as the mere organ of a party have small chance of be elect anywhere unless through the expenditure of money now it be and be my fixed conviction that a candidate ought not to incur one farthing of expense for undertake a public duty such of the lawful expense of a election as have no special reference to any particular candidate ought to be bear as a public charge either by the state or by the locality what have to be do by the supporter of each candidate in order to bring he claim properly before the constituency should be do by unpaid agency or by voluntary subscription if member of the electoral body or other be willing to subscribe money of they own for the purpose of bring by lawful means into parliament some one who they think would be useful there no one be entitle to object : but that the expense or any part of it should fall on the candidate be fundamentally wrong because it amount in reality to buy he seat even on the most favourable supposition as to the mode in which the money be expend there be a legitimate suspicion that any one who give money for leave to undertake a public trust have other than public end to promote by it and -lrb- a consideration of the greatest importance -rrb- the cost of election when bear by the candidate deprive the nation of the service as member of parliament of all who can not or will not afford to incur a heavy expense i do not say that so long as there be scarcely a chance for a independent candidate to come into parliament without comply with this vicious practice it must always be morally wrong in he to spend money provide that no part of it be either directly or indirectly employ in corruption but to justify it he ought to be very certain that he can be of more use to he country as a member of parliament than in any other mode which be open to he and this assurance in my own case i do not feel it be by no means clear to I that i could do more to advance the public object which have a claim on my exertion from the bench of the house of common than from the simple position of a writer i feel therefore that i ought not to seek election to parliament much less to expend any money in procure it but the condition of the question be considerably alter when a body of elector seek I out and spontaneously offer to bring I forward as they candidate if it should appear on explanation that they persist in this wish know my opinion and accept the only condition on which i could conscientiously serve it be questionable whether this be not one of those call upon a member of the community by he fellow-citizen which he be scarcely justified in reject i therefore put they disposition to the proof by one of the frankest explanation ever tender i should think to a electoral body by a candidate i write in reply to the offer a letter for publication say that i have no personal wish to be a member of parliament that i think a candidate ought neither to canvass nor to incur any expense and that i could not consent to do either i say further that if elect i could not undertake to give any of my time and labor to they local interest with respect to general politics i tell they without reserve what i think on a number of important subject on which they have ask my opinion : and one of these be the suffrage i make know to they among other thing my conviction -lrb- as i be bind to do since i intend if elect to act on it -rrb- that woman be entitle to representation in parliament on the same term with man it be the first time doubtless that such a doctrine have ever be mention to english elector and the fact that i be elect after propose it give the start to the movement which have since become so vigorous in favor of woman 's suffrage nothing at the time appear more unlikely than that a candidate -lrb- if candidate i could be call -rrb- whose profession and conduct set so completely at defiance all ordinary notion of electioneering should nevertheless be elect a well-known literary man -lrb- who be also a man of society -rrb- be hear to say that the almighty himself would have no chance of be elect on such a program i strictly adhere to it neither spend money nor canvassing nor do i take any personal part in the election until about a week precede the day of nomination when i attend a few public meeting to state my principle and give to any question which the elector might exercise they just right of put to I for they own guidance answer as plain and unreserved as my address on one subject only my religious opinion i announce from the beginning that i would answer no question a determination which appear to be completely approve by those who attend the meeting my frankness on all other subject on which i be interrogate evidently do I far more good than my answer whatever they might be do harm among the proof i receive of this one be too remarkable not to be record in the pamphlet _ thought on parliamentary reform _ i have say rather bluntly that the work class though differ from those of some other country in be ashamed of lie be yet generally liar this passage some opponent get print in a placard which be hand to I at a meeting chiefly compose of the work class and i be ask whether i have write and publish it i at once answer i do scarcely be these two word out of my mouth when vehement applause resound through the whole meeting it be evident that the work people be so accustomed to expect equivocation and evasion from those who seek they suffrage that when they find instead of that a direct avowal of what be likely to be disagreeable to they instead of be affront they conclude at once that this be a person whom they could trust a more striking instance never come under my notice of what i believe be the experience of those who best know the work class that the most essential of all recommendation to they favor be that of complete straightforwardness its presence outweigh in they mind very strong objection while no amount of other quality will make amends for its apparent absence the first work man who speak after the incident i have mention -lrb- it be mr odger -rrb- say that the work class have no desire not to be tell of they fault they want friend not flatterer and feel under obligation to any one who tell they anything in themselves which he sincerely believe to require amendment and to this the meeting heartily respond have i be defeat in the election i should still have have no reason to regret the contact it have bring I into with large body of my countryman which not only give I much new experience but enable I to scatter my political opinion rather widely and by make I know in many quarter where i have never before be hear of increase the number of my reader and the presumable influence of my writings these latter effect be of course produce in a still greater degree when as much to my surprise as to that of any one i be return to parliament by a majority of some hundred over my conservative competitor i be a member of the house during the three session of the parliament which pass the reform bill during which time parliament be necessarily my main occupation except during the recess i be a tolerably frequent speaker sometimes of prepared speech sometimes extemporaneously but my choice of occasion be not such as i should have make if my lead object have be parliamentary influence when i have gain the ear of the house which i do by a successful speech on mr gladstone 's reform bill the idea i proceed on be that when anything be likely to be as well do or sufficiently well do by other people there be no necessity for I to meddle with it as i therefore in general reserved myself for work which no other be likely to do a great proportion of my appearance be on point on which the bulk of the liberal party even the advanced portion of it either be of a different opinion from mine or be comparatively indifferent several of my speech especially one against the motion for the abolition of capital punishment and another in favor of resume the right of seize enemy ' goods in neutral vessel be oppose to what then be and probably still be regard as the advanced liberal opinion my advocacy of woman 's suffrage and of personal representation be at the time look upon by many as whim of my own but the great progress since make by those opinion and especially the response make from almost all part of the kingdom to the demand for woman 's suffrage fully justify the timeliness of those movement and have make what be undertake as a moral and social duty a personal success another duty which be particularly incumbent on I as one of the metropolitan member be the attempt to obtain a municipal government for the metropolis : but on that subject the indifference of the house of common be such that i find hardly any help or support within its wall on this subject however i be the organ of a active and intelligent body of person outside with whom and not with I the scheme originate and who carry on all the agitation on the subject and draw up the bill my part be to bring in bill already prepare and to sustain the discussion of they during the short time they be allow to remain before the house after have take a active part in the work of a committee preside over by mr ayrton which sit through the greater part of the session of 1866 to take evidence on the subject the very different position in which the question now stand -lrb- 1870 -rrb- may justly be attribute to the preparation which go on during those year and which produce but little visible effect at the time but all question on which there be strong private interest on one side and only the public good on the other have a similar period of incubation to go through the same idea that the use of my be in parliament be to do work which other be not able or not willing to do make I think it my duty to come to the front in defense of advanced liberalism on occasion when the obloquy to be encounter be such as most of the advanced liberal in the house prefer not to incur my first vote in the house be in support of a amendment in favor of ireland move by a irish member and for which only five english and scotch vote be give include my own : the other four be mr bright mr mclaren mr tb potter and mr hadfield and the second speech i deliver -lrb- 9 -rrb- be on the bill to prolong the suspension of the habeas corpus in ireland in denounce on this occasion the english mode of govern ireland i do no more than the general opinion of england now admit to have be just but the anger against fenianism be then in all its freshness any attack on what fenian attack be look upon as a apology for they and i be so unfavourably receive by the house that more than one of my friend advise I -lrb- and my own judgment agree with the advice -rrb- to wait before speak again for the favourable opportunity that would be give by the first great debate on the reform bill during this silence many flattered themselves that i have turn out a failure and that they should not be trouble with I any more perhaps they uncomplimentary comment may by the force of reaction have help to make my speech on the reform bill the success it be my position in the house be further improve by a speech in which i insist on the duty of pay off the national debt before we coal supplies be exhaust and by a ironical reply to some of the tory leader who have quote against I certain passage of my writings and call I to account for other especially for one in my _ consideration on representative government _ which say that the conservative party be by the law of its composition the stupidest party they gain nothing by draw attention to the passage which up to that time have not excite any notice but the _ sobriquet _ of the stupid party stick to they for a considerable time afterwards have now no longer any apprehension of not be listen to i confine myself as i have since think too much to occasion on which my service seem specially need and abstain more than enough from speak on the great party question with the exception of irish question and those which concern the work class a single speech on mr disraelus 's reform bill be nearly all that i contribute to the great decisive debate of the last two of my three session i have however much satisfaction in look back to the part i take on the two class of subject just mention with regard to the work class the chief topic of my speech on mr gladstone 's reform bill be the assertion of they claim to the suffrage a little later after the resignation of lord russell 's ministry and the succession of a tory government come the attempt of the work class to hold a meeting in hyde park they exclusion by the police and the break down of the park railing by the crowd though mr beale and the leader of the work man have retire under protest before this take place a scuffle ensue in which many innocent person be maltreat by the police and the exasperation of the work man be extreme they show a determination to make another attempt at a meeting in the park to which many of they would probably have come arm the government make military preparation to resist the attempt and something very serious seem impend at this crisis i really believe that i be the means of prevent much mischief i have in my place in parliament take the side of the work man and strongly censure the conduct of the government i be invite with several other radical member to a conference with the lead member of the council of the reform league and the task fall chiefly upon myself of persuade they to give up the hyde park project and hold they meeting elsewhere it be not mr beale and colonel dickson who need persuade on the contrary it be evident that these gentleman have already exert they influence in the same direction thus far without success it be the work man who hold out and so bent be they on they original scheme that i be oblige to have recourse to _ les grands moyens _ i tell they that a proceeding which would certainly produce a collision with the military could only be justifiable on two condition : if the position of affair have become such that a revolution be desirable and if they think themselves able to accomplish one to this argument after considerable discussion they at last yield : and i be able to inform mr walpole that they intention be give up i shall never forget the depth of he relief or the warmth of he expression of gratitude after the work man have concede so much to I i feel bind to comply with they request that i would attend and speak at they meeting at the agricultural hall the only meeting call by the reform league which i ever attend i have always decline be a member of the league on the avowed ground that i do not agree in its program of manhood suffrage and the ballot : from the ballot i dissent entirely and i could not consent to hoist the flag of manhood suffrage even on the assurance that the exclusion of woman be not intend to be imply since if one go beyond what can be immediately carry and profess to take one 's stand on a principle one should go the whole length of the principle i have enter thus particularly into this matter because my conduct on this occasion give great displeasure to the tory and tory-liberal press who have charge I ever since with have show myself in the trial of public life intemperate and passionate i do not know what they expect from I but they have reason to be thankful to I if they know from what i have in all probability preserve they and i do not believe it could have be do at that particular juncture by any one else no other person i believe have at that moment the necessary influence for restrain the work class except mr gladstone and mr bright neither of whom be available : mr gladstone for obvious reason mr bright because he be out of town when some time later the tory government bring in a bill to prevent public meeting in the park i not only speak strongly in opposition to it but form one of a number of advanced liberal who aid by the very late period of the session succeed in defeat the bill by what be call talk it out it have not since be renew on irish affair also i feel bind to take a decide part i be one of the foremost in the deputation of member of parliament who prevail on lord derby to spare the life of the condemn fenian insurgent general burke the church question be so vigorously handle by the leader of the party in the session of 1868 as to require no more from I than a emphatic adhesion : but the land question be by no means in so advance a position the superstition of landlordism have up to that time be little challenge especially in parliament and the backward state of the question so far as concern the parliamentary mind be evidence by the extremely mild measure bring in by lord russell 's government in 1866 which nevertheless could not be carry on that bill i deliver one of my most careful speech in which i attempt to lay down some of the principle of the subject in a manner calculate less to stimulate friend than to conciliate and convince opponent the engrossing subject of parliamentary reform prevent either this bill or one of a similar character bring in by lord derby 's government from be carry through they never get beyond the second reading meanwhile the sign of irish disaffection have become much more decide the demand for complete separation between the two country have assume a menacing aspect and there be few who do not feel that if there be still any chance of reconcile ireland to the british connection it could only be by the adoption of much more thorough reform in the territorial and social relation of the country than have yet be contemplate the time seem to I to have come when it would be useful to speak out my whole mind and the result be my pamphlet _ england and ireland _ which be write in the winter of 1867 and publish shortly before the commencement of the session of 1868 the lead feature of the pamphlet be on the one hand a argument to show the undesirableness for ireland as well as england of separation between the country and on the other a proposal for settle the land question by give to the exist tenant a permanent tenure at a fix rent to be assess after due inquiry by the state the pamphlet be not popular except in ireland as i do not expect it to be but if no measure short of that which i propose would do full justice to ireland or afford a prospect of conciliate the mass of the irish people the duty of propose it be imperative while if on the other hand there be any intermediate course which have a claim to a trial i well know that to propose something which would be call extreme be the true way not to impede but to facilitate a more moderate experiment it be most improbable that a measure concede so much to the tenantry as mr gladstone 's irish land bill would have be propose by a government or could have be carry through parliament unless the british public have be lead to perceive that a case might be make and perhaps a party form for a measure considerably stronger it be the character of the british people or at least of the higher and middle class who pass muster for the british people that to induce they to approve of any change it be necessary that they should look upon it as a middle course : they think every proposal extreme and violent unless they hear of some other proposal go still farther upon which they antipathy to extreme view may discharge itself so it prove in the present instance my proposal be condemn but any scheme for irish land reform short of mine come to be think moderate by comparison i may observe that the attack make on my plan usually give a very incorrect idea of its nature it be usually discuss as a proposal that the state should buy up the land and become the universal landlord though in fact it only offer to each individual landlord this as a alternative if he like better to sell he estate than to retain it on the new condition and i fully anticipate that most landlord would continue to prefer the position of landowner to that of government annuitant and would retain they exist relation to they tenant often on more indulgent term than the full rent on which the compensation to be give they by government would have be base this and many other explanation i give in a speech on ireland in the debate on mr maguire 's resolution early in the session of 1868 a correct report of this speech together with my speech on mr fortescue 's bill have be publish -lrb- not by I but with my permission -rrb- in ireland another public duty of a most serious kind it be my lot to have to perform both in and out of parliament during these year a disturbance in jamaica provoke in the first instance by injustice and exaggerate by rage and panic into a premeditated rebellion have be the motive or excuse for take hundred of innocent life by military violence or by sentence of what be call courts-martial continue for week after the brief disturbance have be put down with many add atrocity of destruction of property log woman as well as man and a general display of the brutal recklessness which usually prevail when fire and sword be let loose the perpetrator of those deed be defend and applaud in england by the same kind of people who have so long uphold negro slavery : and it seem at first as if the british nation be about to incur the disgrace of let pass without even a protest excess of authority as revolting as any of those for which when perpetrate by the instrument of other government englishman can hardly find term sufficient to express they abhorrence after a short time however a indignant feeling be rouse : a voluntary association form itself under the name of the jamaica committee to take such deliberation and action as the case might admit of and adhesion pour in from all part of the country i be abroad at the time but i send in my name to the committee as soon as i hear of it and take a active part in the proceedings from the time of my return there be much more at stake than only justice to the negro imperative as be that consideration the question be whether the british dependency and eventually perhaps great britain itself be to be under the government of law or of military licence whether the life and person of british subject be at the mercy of any two or three officer however raw and inexperienced or reckless and brutal whom a panic-stricken governor or other functionary may assume the right to constitute into a so-called court-martial this question could only be decide by a appeal to the tribunal and such a appeal the committee determine to make they determination lead to a change in the chairmanship of the committee as the chairman mr charle buxton think it not unjust indeed but inexpedient to prosecute governor eyre and he principal subordinate in a criminal court : but a numerously attend general meeting of the association have decide this point against he mr buxton withdraw from the committee though continue to work in the cause and i be quite unexpectedly on my own part propose and elect chairman it become in consequence my duty to represent the committee in the house of common sometimes by put question to the government sometimes as the recipient of question more or less provocative address by individual member to myself but especially as speaker in the important debate originate in the session of 1866 by mr buxton : and the speech i then deliver be that which i should probably select as the best of my speech in parliament -lrb- 10 -rrb- for more than two year we carry on the combat try every avenue legally open to we to the court of criminal justice a bench of magistrate in one of the most tory county in england dismiss we case : we be more successful before the magistrate at bow street which give a opportunity to the lord chief justice of the queen 's bench sir alexander cockburn for deliver he celebrated charge which settle the law of the question in favor of liberty as far as it be in the power of a judge 's charge to settle it there however we success end for the old bailey grand jury by throw out we bill prevent the case from come to trial it be clear that to bring english functionary to the bar of a criminal court for abuse of power commit against negro and mulatto be not a popular proceeding with the english middle class we have however redeem so far as lay in we the character of we country by show that there be at any rate a body of person determine to use all the means which the law afford to obtain justice for the injure we have elicit from the highest criminal judge in the nation a authoritative declaration that the law be what we maintain it to be and we have give a emphatic warning to those who might be tempt to similar guilt hereafter that though they might escape the actual sentence of a criminal tribunal they be not safe against be put to some trouble and expense in order to avoid it colonial governor and other person in authority will have a considerable motive to stop short of such extremity in future as a matter of curiosity i keep some specimen of the abusive letter almost all of they anonymous which i receive while these proceedings be go on they be evidence of the sympathy feel with the brutality in jamaica by the brutal part of the population at home they graduate from coarse joke verbal and pictorial up to threat of assassination among other matter of importance in which i take a active part but which excite little interest in the public two deserve particular mention i join with several other independent liberal in defeat a extradition bill introduce at the very end of the session of 1866 and by which though surrender avowedly for political offence be not authorize political refugee if charge by a foreign government with act which be necessarily incident to all attempt at insurrection would have be surrender to be deal with by the criminal court of the government against which they have rebel : thus make the british government a accomplice in the vengeance of foreign despotism the defeat of this proposal lead to the appointment of a select committee -lrb- in which i be include -rrb- to examine and report on the whole subject of extradition treaty and the result be that in the extradition act which pass through parliament after i have cease to be a member opportunity be give to any one whose extradition be demand of be hear before a english court of justice to prove that the offence with which he be charge be really political the cause of european freedom have thus be save from a serious misfortune and we own country from a great iniquity the other subject to be mention be the fight keep up by a body of advanced liberal in the session of 1868 on the bribery bill of mr disraelus 's government in which i take a very active part i have take counsel with several of those who have apply they mind most carefully to the detail of the subject -- mr wd christie serjeant pull mr chadwick -- as well as bestow much thought of my own for the purpose of frame such amendment and additional clause as might make the bill really effective against the numerous mode of corruption direct and indirect which might otherwise as there be much reason to fear be increase instead of diminish by the reform act we also aim at engraft on the bill measure for diminish the mischievous burden of what be call the legitimate expense of election among we many amendment be that of mr fawcett for make the return officer 's expense a charge on the rate instead of on the candidate another be the prohibition of pay canvasser and the limitation of pay agent to one for each candidate a third be the extension of the precaution and penalty against bribery to municipal election which be well know to be not only a preparatory school for bribery at parliamentary election but a habitual cover for it the conservative government however when once they have carry the lead provision of they bill -lrb- for which i vote and speak -rrb- the transfer of the jurisdiction in election from the house of common to the judge make a determine resistance to all other improvement and after one of we most important proposal that of mr fawcett have actually obtain a majority they summon the strength of they party and throw out the clause in a subsequent stage the liberal party in the house be greatly dishonour by the conduct of many of its member in give no help whatever to this attempt to secure the necessary condition of a honest representation of the people with they large majority in the house they could have carry all the amendment or better one if they have better to propose but it be late in the session member be eager to set about they preparation for the impending general election : and while some -lrb- such as sir robert anstruther -rrb- honourably remain at they post though rival candidate be already canvass they constituency a much greater number place they electioneering interest before they public duty many liberal also look with indifference on legislation against bribery thinking that it merely divert public interest from the ballot which they consider -- very mistakenly as i expect it will turn out -- to be a sufficient and the only remedy from these cause we fight though keep up with great vigor for several night be wholly unsuccessful and the practice which we seek to render more difficult prevail more widely than ever in the first general election hold under the new electoral law in the general debate on mr disraelus 's reform bill my participation be limit to the one speech already mention but i make the bill a occasion for bring the two great improvement which remain to be make in representative government formally before the house and the nation one of they be personal or as it be call with equal propriety proportional representation i bring this under the consideration of the house by a expository and argumentative speech on mr hare 's plan and subsequently i be active in support of the very imperfect substitute for that plan which in a small number of constituency parliament be induce to adopt this poor makeshift have scarcely any recommendation except that it be a partial recognition of the evil which it do so little to remedy as such however it be attack by the same fallacy and require to be defend on the same principle as a really good measure and its adoption in a few parliamentary election as well as the subsequent introduction of what be call the cumulative vote in the election for the london school board have have the good effect of convert the equal claim of all elector to a proportional share in the representation from a subject of merely speculative discussion into a question of practical politics much sooner than would otherwise have be the case this assertion of my opinion on personal representation can not be credit with any considerable or visible amount of practical result it be otherwise with the other motion which i make in the form of a amendment to the reform bill and which be by far the most important perhaps the only really important public service i perform in the capacity of a member of parliament : a motion to strike out the word which be understand to limit the electoral franchise to male and thereby to admit to the suffrage all woman who as householder or otherwise possess the qualification require of male elector for woman not to make they claim to the suffrage at the time when the elective franchise be be largely extend would have be to abjure the claim altogether and a movement on the subject be begin in 1866 when i present a petition for the suffrage sign by a considerable number of distinguished woman but it be as yet uncertain whether the proposal would obtain more than a few stray vote in the house : and when after a debate in which the speaker 's on the contrary side be conspicuous by they feebleness the vote record in favor of the motion amount to 73 -- make up by pair and teller to above 80 -- the surprise be general and the encouragement great : the greater too because one of those who vote for the motion be mr bright a fact which could only be attribute to the impression make on he by the debate as he have previously make no secret of he nonconcurrence in the proposal -lrb- the time appear to my daughter miss helen taylor to have come for form a society for the extension of the suffrage to woman the existence of the society be due to my daughter 's initiative its constitution be plan entirely by she and she be the soul of the movement during its first year though delicate health and superabundant occupation make she decline to be a member of the executive committee many distinguished member of parliament professor and other and some of the most eminent woman of whom the country can boast become member of the society a large proportion either directly or indirectly through my daughter 's influence she have write the greater number and all the best of the letter by which adhesion be obtain even when those letter bear my signature in two remarkable instance those of miss nightingale and miss mary carpenter the reluctance those lady have at first feel to come forward -lrb- for it be not on they past difference of opinion -rrb- be overcome by appeal write by my daughter though sign by I association for the same object be form in various local centre manchester edinburgh birmingham bristol and glasgow and other which have do much valuable work for the cause all the society take the title of branch of the national society for woman 's suffrage but each have its own govern body and act in complete independence of the other -rrb- i believe i have mention all that be worth remember of my proceedings in the house but they enumeration even if complete would give but a inadequate idea of my occupation during that period and especially of the time take up by correspondence for many year before my election to parliament i have be continually receive letter from stranger mostly address to I as a writer on philosophy and either propound difficulty or communicate thought on subject connect with logic or political economy in common i suppose with all who be know as political economist i be a recipient of all the shallow theory and absurd proposal by which people be perpetually endeavor to show the way to universal wealth and happiness by some artful reorganization of the currency when there be sign of sufficient intelligence in the writer to make it worth while attempt to put they right i take the trouble to point out they error until the growth of my correspondence make it necessary to dismiss such person with very brief answer many however of the communication i receive be more worthy of attention than these and in some oversight of detail be point out in my writings which i be thus enable to correct correspondence of this sort naturally multiply with the multiplication of the subject on which i write especially those of a metaphysical character but when i become a member of parliament i begin to receive letter on private grievance and on every imaginable subject that related to any kind of public affair however remote from my knowledge or pursuit it be not my constituent in westminster who lay this burthen on I : they keep with remarkable fidelity to the understanding on which i have consent to serve i receive indeed now and then a application from some ingenuous youth to procure for he a small government appointment but these be few and how simple and ignorant the writer be be show by the fact that the application come in about equally whichever party be in power my invariable answer be that it be contrary to the principle on which i be elect to ask favor of any government but on the whole hardly any part of the country give I less trouble than my own constituent the general mass of correspondence however swell into a oppressive burthen -lrb- at this time and thenceforth a great proportion of all my letter -lrb- include many which find they way into the newspaper -rrb- be not write by I but by my daughter at first merely from she willingness to help in dispose of a mass of letter greater than i could get through without assistance but afterwards because i think the letter she write superior to mine and more so in proportion to the difficulty and importance of the occasion even those which i write myself be generally much improve by she as be also the case with all the more recent of my prepared speech of which and of some of my publish writings not a few passage and those the most successful be hers -rrb- while i remain in parliament my work as a author be unavoidably limit to the recess during that time i write -lrb- besides the pamphlet on ireland already mention -rrb- the essay on plato publish in the _ edinburgh review _ and reprint in the third volume of _ dissertation and discussion _ and the address which conformably to custom i deliver to the university of st andrew 's whose student have do I the honor of elect I to the office of rector in this discourse i give expression to many thought and opinion which have be accumulate in I through life respect the various study which belong to a liberal education they use and influence and the mode in which they should be pursue to render they influence most beneficial the position take up vindicate the high educational value alike of the old classic and the new scientific study on even stronger grounds than be urge by most of they advocate and insist that it be only the stupid inefficiency of the usual teaching which make those study be regard as competitor instead of ally be i think calculate not only to aid and stimulate the improvement which have happily commence in the national institution for higher education but to diffuse juster idea than we often find even in highly educate man on the condition of the highest mental cultivation during this period also i commence -lrb- and complete soon after i have leave parliament -rrb- the performance of a duty to philosophy and to the memory of my father by prepare and publish a edition of the _ analysis of the phenomenon of the human mind _ with note bring up the doctrine of that admirable book to the latest improvement in science and in speculation this be a joint undertaking : the psychological note be furnish in about equal proportion by mr bain and myself while mr grote supply some valuable contribution on point in the history of philosophy incidentally raise and dr andrew findlater supply the deficiency in the book which have be occasion by the imperfect philological knowledge of the time when it be write have be originally publish at a time when the current of metaphysical speculation run in a quite opposite direction to the psychology of experience and association the _ analysis _ have not obtain the amount of immediate success which it deserve though it have make a deep impression on many individual mind and have largely contribute through those mind to create that more favourable atmosphere for the association psychology of which we now have the benefit admirably adapt for a class book of the experience metaphysic it only require to be enriched and in some case correct by the result of more recent labor in the same school of think to stand as it now do in company with mr bain 's treatise at the head of the systematic work on analytic psychology in the autumn of 1868 the parliament which pass the reform act be dissolve and at the new election for westminster i be throw out not to my surprise nor i believe to that of my principal supporter though in the few day precede the election they have become more sanguine than before that i should not have be elect at all would not have require any explanation what excite curiosity be that i should have be elect the first time or have be elect then should have be defeat afterwards but the effort make to defeat I be far greater on the second occasion than on the first for one thing the tory government be now struggle for existence and success in any contest be of more importance to they then too all person of tory feeling be far more embittered against I individually than on the previous occasion many who have at first be either favourable or indifferent be vehemently oppose to my re-election as i have show in my political writings that i be aware of the weak point in democratic opinion some conservative it seem have not be without hope of find I a opponent of democracy : as i be able to see the conservative side of the question they presume that like they i could not see any other side yet if they have really read my writings they would have know that after give full weight to all that appear to I well ground in the argument against democracy i unhesitatingly decide in its favor while recommend that it should be accompany by such institution as be consistent with its principle and calculate to ward off its inconvenience : one of the chief of these remedy be proportional representation on which scarcely any of the conservative give I any support some tory expectation appear to have be found on the approbation i have express of plural voting under certain condition : and it have be surmise that the suggestion of this sort make in one of the resolution which mr disraelus introduce into the house preparatory to he reform bill -lrb- a suggestion which meeting with no favor he do not press -rrb- may have be occasion by what i have write on the point : but if so it be forget that i have make it a express condition that the privilege of a plurality of vote should be annex to education not to property and even so have approve of it only on the supposition of universal suffrage how utterly inadmissible such plural voting would be under the suffrage give by the present reform act be prove to any who could otherwise doubt it by the very small weight which the work class be find to possess in election even under the law which give no more vote to any one elector than to any other while i thus be far more obnoxious to the tory interest and to many conservative liberal than i have formerly be the course i pursue in parliament have by no means be such as to make liberal generally at all enthusiastic in my support it have already be mention how large a proportion of my prominent appearance have be on question on which i differ from most of the liberal party or about which they care little and how few occasion there have be on which the line i take be such as could lead they to attach any great value to I as a organ of they opinion i have moreover do thing which have excite in many mind a personal prejudice against I many be offend by what they call the persecution of mr eyre : and still greater offence be take at my send a subscription to the election expense of mr bradlaugh have refuse to be at any expense for my own election and have have all its expense defray by other i feel under a peculiar obligation to subscribe in my turn where fund be deficient for candidate whose election be desirable i accordingly send subscription to nearly all the work class candidate and among other to mr bradlaugh he have the support of the work class have hear he speak i know he to be a man of ability and he have prove that he be the reverse of a demagogue by place himself in strong opposition to the prevail opinion of the democratic party on two such important subject as malthusianism and personal representation man of this sort who while share the democratic feeling of the work class judge political question for themselves and have courage to assert they individual conviction against popular opposition be need as it seem to I in parliament and i do not think that mr bradlaugh 's anti-religious opinion -lrb- even though he have be intemperate in the expression of they -rrb- ought to exclude he in subscribe however to he election i do what would have be highly imprudent if i have be at liberty to consider only the interest of my own re-election and as might be expect the utmost possible use both fair and unfair be make of this act of mine to stir up the elector of westminster against I to these various cause combine with a unscrupulous use of the usual pecuniary and other influence on the side of my tory competitor while none be use on my side it be to be ascribe that i fail at my second election after have succeed at the first no sooner be the result of the election know than i receive three or four invitation to become a candidate for other constituency chiefly county but even if success could have be expect and this without expense i be not dispose to deny myself the relief of return to private life i have no cause to feel humiliate at my rejection by the elector and if i have the feeling would have be far outweigh by the numerous expression of regret which i receive from all sort of person and place and in a most marked degree from those member of the liberal party in parliament with whom i have be accustom to act since that time little have occur which there be need to commemorate in this place i return to my old pursuit and to the enjoyment of a country life in the south of europe alternate twice a year with a residence of some week or month in the neighborhood of london i have write various article in periodical -lrb- chiefly in my friend mr morley 's _ fortnightly review _ -rrb- have make a small number of speech on public occasion especially at the meeting of the woman 's suffrage society have publish the _ subjection of woman _ write some year before with some addition -lrb- by my daughter and myself -rrb- and have commence the preparation of matter for future book of which it will be time to speak more particularly if i live to finish they here therefore for the present this memoir may close note : -lrb- 1 -rrb- in a subsequent stage of boyhood when these exercise have cease to be compulsory like most youthful writer i write tragedy under the inspiration not so much of shakspeare as of joanna baillie whose _ constantine paleologus _ in particular appear to I one of the most glorious of human composition i still think it one of the best drama of the last two century -lrb- 2 -rrb- the continuation of this article in the second number of the _ review _ be write by I under my father 's eye and -lrb- except as practice in composition in which respect it be to I more useful than anything else i ever write -rrb- be of little or no value -lrb- 3 -rrb- write about 1861 -lrb- 4 -rrb- the step in my mental growth for which i be indebted to she be far from be those which a person wholly uninformed on the subject would probably suspect it might be suppose for instance that my strong conviction on the complete equality in all legal political social and domestic relation which ought to exist between man and woman may have be adopt or learn from she this be so far from be the fact that those conviction be among the earliest result of the application of my mind to political subject and the strength with which i hold they be as i believe more than anything else the originate cause of the interest she feel in I what be true be that until i know she the opinion be in my mind little more than a abstract principle i see no more reason why woman should be hold in legal subjection to other people than why man should i be certain that they interest require fully as much protection as those of man and be quite as little likely to obtain it without a equal voice in make the law by which they be bind but that perception of the vast practical bearing of woman 's disability which find expression in the book on the _ subjection of woman _ be acquire mainly through she teaching but for she rare knowledge of human nature and comprehension of moral and social influence though i should doubtless have hold my present opinion i should have have a very insufficient perception of the mode in which the consequence of the inferior position of woman intertwine themselves with all the evil of exist society and with all the difficulty of human improvement i be indeed painfully conscious of how much of she best thought on the subject i have fail to reproduce and how greatly that little treatise fall short of what it would have be if she have put on paper she entire mind on this question or have live to revise and improve as she certainly would have do my imperfect statement of the case -lrb- 5 -rrb- the only person from whom i receive any direct assistence in the preparation of the _ system of logic _ be mr bain since so justly celebrate for he philosophical writings he go carefully through the manuscript before it be send to the press and enriched it with a great number of additional example and illustration from science many of which as well as some detach remark of he own in confirmation of my logical view i insert nearly in he own word -lrb- 6 -rrb- a few dedicatory line acknowledge what the book owe to she be prefix to some of the presentation copy of the _ political economy _ on iet first publication she dislike of publicity alone prevent they insertion in the other copy of the work during the year which intervene between the commencement of my married life and the catastrophe which close it the principal occurrence of my outward existence

position in the indium house in 1856 i be promote to the rank of chief of the office in which i have serve for upward of thirty-three year the appointment that of examiner of indium correspondence be the highest next to that of secretary in the east indium company 's home service involve the general superintendence of all the correspondence with the indian government except the military naval and

branch of the government of indium under the crown and convert the administration of that country into a thing to be scramble for by the second and third class of english parliamentary politician i be the chief manager of the resistance which the company make to they own political extinction and to the letter and petition i write for they and the conclude chapter of my treatise on representative government i must refer for my opinion on the folly and mischief of this ill-considered change personally i consider myself a gainer by it as i have give enough of my life to indium and be not
