publication _ April 1916 \* \* \* \* \* contents some point concern the origin of islâm the religious development of islâm the political development of islâm islâm and modern thought index mohammedanism i some point concern the origin of islâm there be more than two hundred million people who call themselves after the name of mohammed would not relinquish that name at any price and can not imagine a greater blessing for the remainder of humanity than to be incorporate into they communion they ideal be no less than that the whole earth should join in the faith that there be no god but allah and that mohammed be allah 's last and most perfect messenger who bring the latest and final revelation of allah to humanity in allah 's own word this alone be enough to claim we special interest for the prophet who in the seventh century stir all arabium into agitation and whose follower soon after he death found a empire extend from morocco to china even those who -- to my mind not without gross exaggeration -- would seek the explanation of the mighty stream of humanity pour out by the arabian peninsula since 630 over western and middle asia northern africa and southern europe principally in geographic and economic cause do not ignore the fact that it be mohamm who open the sluice gate it would indeed be difficult to maintain that without he preach the arab of the seventh century would have be induce by circumstance to swallow up the empire of the sasanid and to rob the byzantine empire of some of its richest province however great a weight one may give to political and economic factor it be religion islâm which in a certain sense unite the hitherto hopelessly divide arab islâm which enable they to find a enormous international community it be islâm which bind the speedily convert nation together even after the shatter of its political power and which still bind they today when only a miserable remnant of that power remain the aggressive manner in which young islâm immediately put itself in opposition to the rest of the world have the natural consequence of awaken a interest which be far from be of a friendly nature moreover man be still very far from such a strive towards universal peace as would have induce a patient study of the means of bring the different people into close spiritual relationship and therefore from a endeavor to understand the spiritual life of race different to they own the christianity of that time be itself by no means averse to the forcible extension of its faith and in the community of mohammedan which systematically attempt to reduce the world to its authority by force of arm it see only a enemy whose annihilation be to its regret beyond its power such a enemy it could no more observe impartially than one modern nation can another upon which it consider it necessary to make war everything maintain or invent to the disadvantage of islâm be greedily absorb by europe the picture which we forefather in the middle age form of mohammed 's religion appear to we a malignant caricature the rare theologian -lrb- 1 -rrb- who before attack the false faith try to form a clear notion of it be not listen to and they merit have only become appreciate in we own time a vigorous combate of the prevalent fiction concern islâm would have expose a scholar to a similar treatment to that which fifteen year ago fall to the lot of any englishman who maintain the cause of the boer he would have be as much of a outcast as a modern inhabitant of mecca who try to convince he compatriot of the virtue of european policy and social order -lrb- footnote 1 : see for instance the reference to the exposition of the paderborn bishop oliver -lrb- 1227 -rrb- in the paderborn review _ theologie und glaube _ jahrg iv p 535 etc -lrb- _ islâm _ iv p 186 -rrb- also some of the account mention in güterbock _ der islâm im lichte der byzantinischen polemik _ etc -rrb- two and a half century ago a prominent orientalist -lrb- 2 -rrb- who write a exposition of mohammed 's teaching feel himself oblige to give a elaborate justification of he undertaking in he dedicatio he appeal to one or two celebrated predecessor and to learn colleague who have expressly instigate he to this work amongst other thing he quote a letter from the leiden professor l'empereur in which he conjure breitinger by the bowels of jesus christ -lrb- per viscera jesu christus -rrb- to give the young man every opportunity to complete he study of the religion of mohammed which so far have only be treat in a senseless way as a fruit of this study l'empereur think it necessary to mention in the first place the better understanding of the -lrb- christian -rrb- holy scripture by the extension of we knowledge of oriental manners and custom besides such promotion of christian exegesis and apologetic and the improvement of the work on general history hottinger himself contemplate a double purpose in he _ historium orientali _ the roman catholic often vilify protestantism by compare the reform doctrine to that of mohammedanism this reproach of crypto-mohammedanism hottinger wish talionis lege to fling back at the catholic and he devote a whole chapter -lrb- cap 6 -rrb- of he book to the demonstration that bellarminius ' proof of the truth of the church doctrine might have be copy from the moslim dogma in the second place conform to the spirit of the time he wish just as bibliander have do in he refutation of the qorân to combine the combat against mohammedan unbelief with that against the turkish empire -lrb- in oppugnationem mahometanae perfidiae et turcici regnus -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : jh hottinger _ historium orientali _ zürich 1651 -lrb- 2d edition 1660 -rrb- -rrb- the turk be fear by the europe of that time and the significance of they religion for they worldly power be well know thus the political side of the question give hottinger 's work a special claim to consideration yet in spite of all this hottinger fear that he labor would be regard as useless or even wicked especially when he be oblige to say anything favourable of mohammed and he follower he think it necessary to protect himself against misconstruction by the addition of some select term of abuse when mention mohammed 's name he say : at the mention of whom the mind shudder -lrb- ad cujus profecto mentionem inhorrescere nobi debet animus -rrb- the learn abbé maraccus who in 1698 produce a latin translation of the qorân accompany by a elaborate refutation be no less than hottinger imbue with the necessity of shudder at every mention of the false prophet and dr prideaux whose _ vie de mahomet _ appear in the same year in amsterdam abused and shudder with they and hold up he biography of mohamm as a mirror to unbeliever atheist deist and libertine it be a dutch scholar h reland the utrecht professor of theology who in the beginning of the eighteenth century frankly and warmly recommend the application of historical justice even towards the mohammedan religion in he short latin sketch of islâm -lrb- 1 -rrb- he allow the mohammedan authority to speak for themselves in he dedicatio to he brother and in he extensive preface he explain he then new method be it to be suppose he ask that a religion as ridiculous as the islâm describe by christian author should have find million of devotee let the moslim themselves describe they own religion for we just as the jewish and christian religion be falsely represent by the heathen and protestantism by catholic so every religion be misrepresent by its antagonist we be mortal subject to error especially where religious matter be concern we often allow ourselves to be grossly mislead by passion although it may cause evil-minded reader to doubt the writer 's orthodoxy he continue to maintain that truth can only be serve by combate she opponent in a honorable way -lrb- footnote 1 : _ h relandi de religione mohammedica libri duo _ utrecht 1704 -lrb- 2d ed 1717 -rrb- -rrb- no religion say reland have be more calumniated than islâm although the abbé maraccus himself could give no better explanation of the turning of many jew and christian to this religion than the fact that it contain many element of natural truth evidently borrow from the christian religion which seem to be in accordance with the law and the light of nature -lrb- quae naturae legi ac luminus consentanea videntur -rrb- more will be gain for christianity by friendly intercourse with mohammedan than by slander above all christian who live in the east must not as be too often the case give cause to one turk to say to another who suspect he of lie or deceit : ` do you take I for a christian ' -lrb- putasne I christianum esse -rrb- in truth the mohammedan often put we to shame by they virtue and a better knowledge of islâm can only help to make we irrational pride give place to gratitude to god for the undeserved mercy which he bestow upon we in christianity reland have no illusion that he scientific justice will find acceptance in a wide circle as he become daily more and more convinced that the world wish to be deceive and be govern by prejudice -lrb- qui quotidie magis magisque experior mundum decipi velle et praeconceptis opinionibus regus -rrb- it be not long before the scale be turn in the opposite direction and islâm be make by some people the object of panegyric as devoid of scientific foundation as the former calumny in 1730 appear in london the incomplete posthumous work of count de boulainvillier _ vie de mahomet _ in which amongst other thing he say of the arabian prophet that all that he have say concern the essential religious dogma be true but he have not say all that be true and it be only therein that he religion differ from ours de boulainvilliers tell we with particular satisfaction that mohamm who respect the devotion of hermit and monk proceed with the utmost severity against the official clergy condemn its member either to death or to the abjuration of they faith this _ vie de mahomet _ be as a matter of fact a anti-clerical romance the material of which be supply by a superficial knowledge of islâm draw from secondary source that a work with such a tendency be sure to arouse interest at that time be show by a letter from the publisher coderc to professor gagnier at oxford in which he write : he -lrb- de boulainvilliers -rrb- mix up he history with many political reflection which by they newness and boldness be sure to be well receive -lrb- il mêle son histoire de plusieurs réflexions politique et qui par leur hardiesse ne manqueront pas d'être très bien reçues -rrb- jean gagnier however consider these bold novelty very dangerous and endeavor to combat they in another _ vie de mahomet _ which appear from he hand in 1748 at amsterdam he strive after a juste milieu between the too violent partisanship of maraccus and prideaux and the ridiculous acclamation of de boulainvilliers yet this do not prevent he in he preface from call mohamm the greatest villain of mankind and the most mortal enemy of god -lrb- le plus scélérat de tous les hommes et le plus mortel ennemi de dieu -rrb- he desire to make he contemporary proof against the poison of de boulainvilliers ' dangerous book gain the mastery over the pure love of truth for which reland have so bravely strive although sale in he preliminary discourse to he translation of the qorân endeavor to contribute to a fair estimation of mohammed and he work of which he motto borrow from augustine there be no false doctrine that do not contain some truth -lrb- nulla falsa doctrina est quae non aliquid verus permisceat -rrb- be proof still the prejudicial view remain for a considerable time the prevalent one mohammed be brand as _ imposteur _ even in circle where christian fanaticism be out of the question voltaire do not write he tragedy _ mahomet ou le fanatisme _ as a historical study he be aware that he fiction be in many respects at variance with history in write he work he be as he himself express it inspire by l'amour du genre humain et l'horreur du fanatisme he want to put before the public a armed tartufe and think he might lay the part upon mohamm for say he be not the man who make war against he own country and dare to do it in the name of god capable of any ill the dislike that voltaire have conceive for the qorân from a superficial acquaintance with it ce livre inintelligible quus fait frémir le sen commun à chaque page probably increase he unfavourable opinion but the principal motive of he choice of a representative must have be that the general public still regard mohamm as the incarnation of fanaticism and priestcraft almost a century lie between gagnier 's biography of mohammed and that of the heidelberg professor weil -lrb- _ mohammed der prophet sein leben and seine lehre _ stuttgart 1843 -rrb- and yet weil do well to call gagnier he last independent predecessor weil 's great merit be that he be the first in he field who institute a extensive historico-critical investigation without any preconceived opinion he final opinion of mohammed be with the necessary reservation : in so far as he bring the most beautiful teaching of the old and the new testament to a people which be not illuminate by one ray of faith he may be regard even by those who be not mohammedan as a messenger of god four year later caussin de perceval in he _ essaus sur l'histoire des arabes _ write quite independently of weil express the same idea in these word : it would be a injustice to mohamm to consider he as no more than a clever impostor a ambitious man of genius he be in the first place a man convince of he vocation to deliver he nation from error and to regenerate it about twenty year later the biography of mohammed make a enormous advance through the work of muir sprenger and nôldeke on the ground of much wider and at the same time deeper study of the source than have be possible for weil and caussin de perceval each of these three scholar give in he own way a account of the origin of islâm nôldeke be much sharper and more cautious in he historical criticism than muir or sprenger while the biography write by these two man have now only historical value nôldeke 's _ history of the qorân _ be still a indispensable instrument of study more than half a century after its first appearance number of more or less successful effort to make mohammed 's life understand by the nineteenth century intellect have follow these without much permanent gain mohamm who be represent to the public in turn as deceiver as a genius mislead by the devil as epileptic as hysteric and as prophet be oblige later on even to submit to play on the one hand the part of socialist and on the other hand that of a defender of capitalism these point of view be principally characteristic of the temperament of the scholar who hold they they do not really advance we understanding of the event that take place at mecca and medina between 610 and 632 ad that prologue to a perplexing historical drama the principal source from which all biographer start and to which they always return be the qorân the collection of word of allah speak by mohamm in those twenty-two year hardly anyone amongst the faithful and the unfaithful doubt the generally authentic character of its contents except the parisian professor casanova -lrb- 1 -rrb- he try to prove a little while ago that mohammed 's revelation originally contain the announcement that the hour the final catastrophe the last judgment would come during he life when he death have therefore falsify this prophecy accord to casanova the leader of the young community find themselves oblige to submit the revelation preserve in write or memory to a thorough revision to add some which announce the mortality even of the last prophet and finally to console the disappointed faithful with the hope of mohammed 's return before the end of the world this doctrine of the return mention neither in the qorân nor in the eschatological tradition of later time accord to casanova be afterwards change again into the expectation of the mahdî the last of mohammed 's deputy a guide of god who shall be descend from mohammed bear he name resemble he in appearance and who shall fill the world once more before its end with justice as it be now fill with injustice and tyranny -lrb- footnote 1 : paul casanova _ mohamm et la fin du monde _ pari 1911 he hypothesis be found upon weil 's doubt of the authenticity of a few verse of the _ qorân _ -lrb- iii 138 xxxix 31 etc -rrb- which doubt be sufficiently refute half a century ago by nôldeke in he _ geschichte des qorâns _ 1st edition p 197 etc -rrb- in we sceptical time there be very little that be above criticism and one day or other we may expect to hear that mohammed never exist the argument for this can hardly be weaker than those of casanova against the authenticity of the qorân here we may acknowledge the great power of what have be believe in all time in all place by all the member of the community -lrb- quod semper quod ubique quod ab omnibus creditum est -rrb- for after the death of mohammed there immediately arise a division which none of the lead personality be able to escape and the opponent spare each other no possible kind of insult scorn or calumny the enemy of the first leader of the community could have wish for no more powerful weapon for they attack than a well-founded accusation of falsify the word of god yet this accusation be never bring against the first collector of the scatter revelation the only reproach that be make against they in connexion with this labor be that verse in which the holy family -lrb- alus and fatimah -rrb- be mention with honor and which therefore would have serve to support the claim of the alid to the succession of mohamm be suppress by they this be maintain by the shi'ite who be unsurpassed in islâm as falsifier of history and the passage which accord to they be omit from the official qorân would involve precisely on account of they reference to the succession the mortality of mohamm all sect and party have the same text of the qorân this may have its error and defect but intentional alteration or mutilation of real importance be not to blame for this now this rich authentic source -- this collection of wild poetic representation of the day of judgment of strive against idolatry of story from sacred history of exhortation to the practice of the cardinal virtue of the old and new testament of precept to reform the individual domestic and tribal life in the spirit of these virtue of incantation and form of prayer and a hundred thing besides -- be not always comprehensible to we even for the part which we do understand we be not able to make out the chronological arrangement which be necessary to gain a insight into mohammed 's personality and work this be not only due to the form of the oracle which purposely differ from the usual tone of mortal by its unctuousness and rhyme prose but even more to the circumstance that all that the hearer could know be assume to be know so the qorân be full of reference that be enigmatical to we we therefore need additional explanation and this can only be derive from tradition concern the circumstance under which each revelation be deliver and truly the sacred tradition of islâm be not deficient in datum of this sort in the canonical and half-canonical collection of tradition concern what the prophet have say do and omit to do in biographical work a answer be give to every question which may arise in the mind of the reader of the qorân and there be many qorân-commentary in which these answer be append to the verse which they be suppose to elucidate sometimes the explanation appear to we even at first sight improbable and unacceptable sometimes they contradict each other a good many seem quite reasonable the critical biographer of mohamm have therefore begin they work of sift by eliminate the improbable and by choose between contradictory datum by means of critical comparison here the gradually increase knowledge of the spirit of the different party in islâm be a important aid as of course each group represent the fact in the way which best serve they own purpose however cautiously and acutely weil and he successor have proceed the continual progress of the analysis of the legislative as well as of the historical tradition of islam since 1870 have necessitate a renew investigation in the first place it have become ever more evident that the thousand of tradition about mohammed which together with the qorân form the foundation upon which the doctrine and life of the community be base be for the most part the conventional expression of all the opinion which prevail amongst he follower during the first three century after the hijrah the fiction originate a long time after mohammed 's death during the turbulent period of the great conquest there be no leisure for such work we own conventional insincerity differ so much -- externally at least -- from those of that date that it be difficult for we to realize a spiritual atmosphere where pious fraud be practice on such a scale yet this be literally true : in the first century of islâm no one could have dream of any other way of gain acceptance for a doctrine or a precept than by circulate a tradition accord to which mohamm have preach the doctrine or dictate it or have live accord to the precept the whole individual domestic social and political life as it develop in the three century during which the simple arabian religion be adjust to the complicated civilization of the great nation of that time that all life be theoretically justify by represent it as the application of minute law suppose to have be elaborate by mohamm by precept and example thus tradition give invaluable material for the knowledge of the conflict of opinion in the first century a strife the sharpness of which have be blunt in later time by a most resourceful harmonistic method but it be vain to endeavor to construct the life and teaching of mohamm from such spurious account they can not even afford we a reliable illustration of he life in the form of table talk as a english scholar rather naïvely try to derive from they in a collection of this sort support by good external evidence there would be attribute to the prophet of mecca saying from the old and new testament wise saw from classical and arabian antiquity prescription of roman law and many other thing each text of which be as authentic as its fellow anyone who warn by goldziher and other have realize how matter stand in this respect will be careful not to take the legislative tradition as a direct instrument for the explanation of the qorân when after a most careful investigation of thousand of tradition which all appear equally old we have select the oldest then we shall see that we have before we only witness of the first century of the hijrah the connect thread with the time of mohammed must be supply for a great part by imagination the historical or biographical tradition in the proper sense of the word have only lately be submit to a keener examination it be know for a long time that here too besides theological and legendary element there be tradition originate from party motive intend to give a appearance of historical foundation to the particular interest of certain person or family but it be think that after some sift there yet remain enough to enable we to form a much clearer sketch of mohammed 's life than that of any other of the founder of a universal religion it be especially prince caetanus and father lammen who have disturb this illusion accord to they even the datum which have be pretty generally regard as objective rest chiefly upon tendentious fiction the generation that work at the biography of the prophet be too far remove from he time to have true datum or notion and moreover it be not they aim to know the past as it be but to construct a picture of it as it ought to have be accord to they opinion upon the bare canvass of verse of the qorân that need explanation the traditionist have embroider with great boldness scene suitable to the desire or ideal of they particular group or to use a favorite metaphor of lammen they fill the empty space by a process of stereotype which permit the critical observer to recognize the origin of each picture in the sîrah -lrb- biography -rrb- the distance of the first describer from they object be the same as in the hadîth -lrb- legislative tradition -rrb- in both we get image of very distant thing perceive by means of fancy rather than by sight and take different shape accord to the inclination of each circle of describer now it may be true that the latest judge have here and there examine the mohammedan tradition too sceptically and too suspiciously nevertheless it remain certain that in the light of they research the method of examination can not remain unchanged we must endeavor to make we explanation of the qorân independent of tradition and in respect to portion where this be impossible we must be suspicious of explanation however apparently plausible during the last few year the accessible source of information have considerably increase the study of they have become much deeper and more methodical and the result be that we can tell much less about the teaching and the life of mohammed than could we predecessor half a century ago this apparent loss be of course in reality nothing but gain those who do not take part in new discovery nevertheless wish to know now and then the result of the observation make with constantly improve instrument let I endeavor very briefly to satisfy this curiosity that the report of the bookkeeping might make a somewhat different impression if another accountant have examine it go without say and sometimes i shall draw particular attention to my personal responsibility in this respect of mohammed 's life before he appearance as the messenger of god we know extremely little compare to the legendary biography as treasured by the faithful practically nothing not to mention he pre-existence as a light which be with god and for the sake of which god create the world the light which as the principle of revelation live in all prophet from adam onward and the final revelation of which in mohammed be prophesy in the scripture of the jew and the christian not to mention the wonderful and mysterious sign which announce the birth of the seal of the prophet and many other feature which the later sîrahs -lrb- biography -rrb- and maulid -lrb- pious history of he birth most in rhymed prose or in poetic metre -rrb- produce in imitation of the gospel even the elaborate discourse of the older biography on occurrence which in themselves might quite well come within the limit of sub-lunary possibility do not belong to history fiction play such a great part in these story that we be never sure of be on historical ground unless the qorân give we a firm foot the question whether the family to which mohamm belong be regard as noble amongst the qoraishite the ruling tribe in mecca be answer in the affirmative by many but by other this answer be question not without good grounds the matter be not of prime importance as there be no doubt that mohamm grow up as a poor orphan and belong to the needy and the neglect even a long time after he first appearance the unbeliever reproach he accord to the qorân with he insignificant worldly position which fit ill with a heavenly message the same scornful reproach accord to the qorân be hurl at mohammed 's predecessor by sceptic of earlier generation and it be well know that the story of older time in the qorân be principally reflection of what mohamm himself experience the legend of mohammed 's relation to various member of he family be too closely connect with the pretension of they descendant to have any value for biographic purpose he marry late a elderly woman who it be say be able to lighten he material care she give he the only daughter by whom he have descendant descendant who from the arabian point of view do not count as such as accord to they genealogical theory the line of descent can not pass through a woman they have make a exception for the prophet as male offspring the only blessing of marriage appreciate by arab be withhold from he in the materialistic commercial town of mecca where lust of gain and usury reign supreme where woman wine and gamble fill up the leisure time where might be right and widow orphan and the feeble be treat as superfluous ballast a unfortunate be like mohamm if he constitution be sensitive must have experience most painful emotion in the intellectual advantage that the place offer he could find no solace the highly develop arabian art of word poetry with its fictitious amourette its polished description of portion of arabian nature its venal vain praise and satire might serve as dessert to a well-filled dish they be unable to compensate for the lack of material prosperity mohamm feel he misery as a pain too great to be endure in some way or other he must be deliver from it he desire to be more than the greatest in he surroundings and he know that in that which they count for happiness he could never even equal they rather than envy they regretfully he prefer to despise they value of life but on that very account he have to oppose these value with better one it be not unknown in mecca that elsewhere community exist acquaint with such high ideal of life spiritual goods accessible to the poor even to they in particular apart from commerce which bring the inhabitant of mecca into contact with abyssinian syrian and other there be far to the south and less far to the north and north-east of mecca arabian tribe who have embrace the jewish or the christian religion perhaps this circumstance have help to make the inhabitant of mecca familiar with the idea of a creator allah but this have little significance in they life as in the maker of the universe they do not see they lawgiver and judge but hold themselves dependent for they good and evil fortune upon all manner of being which they render favourable or harmless by animistic practice thoroughly conservative they do not take great interest in the conception of the people of the scripture as they call the jew christian and perhaps some other sect arise from these community but mohammed 's deeply feel misery awaken he interest in they whether this have be the case with a few other before he in the milieu of mecca we need not consider as it do not help to explain he action if wide circle have be anxious to know more about the contents of the scripture mohamm would not have feel in the dark in the way that he do we shall probably never know by intercourse with whom it really be that mohamm at last gain some knowledge of the contents of the sacred book of judaism and christianity probably through various people and over a considerable length of time it be not letter man who satisfy he awaken curiosity otherwise the quite confused idea especially in the beginning of the revelation concern the mutual relation between jew and christian could not be explain confusion between miryam the sister of mose and mary the mother of jesus between saul and gideon mistake about the relationship of abraham to isaac ishmael and jacob might be put down to misconception of mohammed himself who could not all at once master the strange material but he representation of judaism and christianity and a number of other form of revelation as almost identical in they contents differ only in the place where the time wherein and the messenger of god by whom they come to man this idea which run like a crimson thread through all the revelation of the first twelve year of mohammed 's prophecy could not have exist if he have have a intimate acquaintance with jewish or christian man of letter moreover the many post-biblical feature and story which the qorân contain concern the past of mankind indicate a vulgar origin and especially as regard the christian legend communication from people who live outside the communion of the great christian church this be sufficiently prove by the docetical representation of the death of jesus and the many story about he life take from apocryphal source or from popular oral legend mohamm 's unlearned imagination work all such material together into a religious history of mankind in which adam 's descendant have become divide into innumerable group of people differ in speech and place of abode whose aim in life at one period or another come to resemble wonderfully that of the inhabitant of west - and central-arabium in the seventh century ad hereby they stray from the true path in strife with the command give by allah the whole of history therefore be for he a long series of repetition of the antithesis between the foolishness of man as this be now embody in the social state of mecca and the wisdom of god as know to the people of the scripture to bring the err one back to the true path it be allah 's plan to send they messenger from out of they midst who deliver he ritual and he moral direction to they in he own word who demand the acknowledgment of allah 's omnipotence and if they refuse to follow the true guidance threaten they with allah 's temporary or even more with he eternal punishment the antithesis be always the same from adam to jesus and the enumeration of the scene be therefore rather monotonous the only variety be in the detail borrow from biblical and apocryphal legend in all the thousand of year the messenger of allah play the same part as mohammed finally see himself call upon to play towards he people mohamm 's account of the past contain more element of jewish than of christian origin and he ignore the principal dogma of the christian church in spite of he supernatural birth jesus be only a prophet like mose and other and although he miracle surpass those of other messenger mohamm at a later period of he life be incline to place abraham above jesus in certain respects yet the influence of christianity upon mohammed 's vocation be very great without the christian idea of the final scene of human history of the resurrection of the dead and the last judgment mohammed 's mission would have no meaning it be true monotheism in the jewish sense and after the contrast have become clear to mohammed accompany by a express rejection of the son of god and of the trinity have become one of the principal dogma of islâm but in mohammed 's first preach the announcement of the day of judgment be much more prominent than the unity of god and it be against he revelation concern doomsday that he opponent direct they satire during the first twelve year it be not love of they half-dead god but anger at the wretch who be never tire of tell they in the name of allah that all they life be idle and despicable that in the other world they would be the outcast which open the floodgate of irony and scorn against mohamm and it be mohamm 's anxiety for he own lot and that of those who be dear to he in that future life that force he to seek a solution of the question : who shall bring my people out of the darkness of antithesis into the light of obedience to allah we should _ a posteriori _ be incline to imagine a simpler answer to the question than that which mohamm find he might have become a missionary of judaism or of christianity to the meccan however natural such a conclusion may appear to we from the premise with which we be acquaint it do not occur to mohamm he begin -- the qorân tell we expressly -- by regard the arab or at all event _ he _ arab as heretofore destitute of divine message -lrb- 1 -rrb- : to whom we have send no warner before you mose and jesus -- not to mention any other -- have not be send for the arab and as allah would not leave any section of mankind without a revelation they prophet must still be to come apparently mohamm regard the jewish and christian tribe in arabium as exception to the rule that a ethnical group -lrb- _ ummah _ -rrb- be at the same time a religious unity he do not imagine that it could be in allah 's plan that the arab be to conform to a revelation give in a foreign language no god must speak to they in arabic -lrb- 2 -rrb- through whose mouth -lrb- footnote 1 : _ qorân _ xxxii 2 xxxiv 43 xxxvi 5 etc -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ ibid _ xii 2 xiii 37 xx 112 xxvi 195 xli 44 etc -rrb- a long and severe crisis precede mohammed 's call he be convince that if he be the man mighty sign from heaven must be reveal to he for he conception of revelation be mechanical allah himself or at least angel must speak to he the time of wait the process of objectify the subjective live through by the help of a overstrained imagination all this lay great demand upon the psychical and physical constitution of mohamm at length he see and hear that which he think he ought to hear and see in feverish dream he find the form for the revelation and he do not in the least realize that the contents of he inspiration from heaven be nothing but the result of what he have himself absorb he realize it so little that the identity of what be reveal to he with what he hold to be the contents of the scripture of jew and christian be a miracle to he the only miracle upon which he rely for the support of he mission in the course of the twenty-three year of mohammed 's work as god 's messenger the over-excited state or inspiration or whatever we may call the peculiar spiritual condition in which he revelation be bear gradually give place to quiet reflection especially after the hijrah when the prophet have to provide the state establish by he at medina with inspired regulation the word of god become in almost every respect different from what they have be at first only the form be retain in connection with this evolution some of we biographer of mohamm even where they do not deny the obvious honesty of he first vision represent he in the second half of he work as a sort of actor who play with that which have be most sacred to he this accusation be in my opinion unjust mohammed who twelve year long in spite of derision and contempt continue to inveigh in the name of allah against the frivolous conservatism of the heathen in mecca to preach allah 's omnipotence to they to hold up to they allah 's command and he promise and threat regard the future life without ask any reward for such exhausting work be really not another man than the acknowledged messenger of allah in medina who see he power gradually increase who be teach by experience the value and the use of the material mean of extend it and who finally by the force of arm compel all arab to obedience to allah and he messenger in we own society real enthusiasm in the propagation of a idea generally consider as absurd if crown by success may in the course of time end in cold prosaic calculation without a trace of hypocrisy nowhere in the life of mohammed can a point of turn be show there be a gradual change of aim and a readjustment of the means of attain they from the first the outcast feel himself superior to the well-to-do people who look down upon he and with all he power he seek for a position from which he could force they to acknowledge he superiority this he find in the next and better world of which the jew and christian know after a crisis which some consider as psychopathologic he know himself to be send by allah to call the materialistic community which he hate and despise to the alternative either in follow he to find eternal blessedness or in deny he to be doom to eternal fire powerless against the scepticism of he hearer after twelve year of preach follow only by a few dozen most of they outcast like himself he hope now and then that allah would strike the recalcitrant multitude with a earthly doom as he know from revelation have happen before this hope be also unfulfilled as other messenger of god have do in similar circumstance he seek for a more fruitful field than that of he birthplace he set out on the hijrah _ ie _ emigration to medina here circumstance be more favourable to he : in a short time he become the head of a considerable community allah who have give he power soon allow he to use it for the protection of the interest of the faithful against the unbeliever once become militant mohammed turn from the purely defensive to the aggressive attitude with such success that a great part of the arab tribe be compel to accept islâm obedience to allah and he messenger the rule formerly insist upon : no compulsion in religion be sacrifice since experience teach he that the truth be more easily force upon man by violence than by threat which would be fulfil only after the resurrection naturally the religious value of the conversion sink in proportion as they number increase the prophet of world renouncement in mecca wish to win soul for he faith the prophet-prince in medina need subject and fighter for he army yet he be still the same mohammed parallel with he altered position towards the heathen arab go a readjustment of he point of view towards the follower of scripture mohamm never pretend to preach a new religion he demand in the name of allah the same islâm -lrb- submission -rrb- that mose jesus and former prophet have demand of they nation in he earlier revelation he always point out the identity of he qorâns with the contents of the sacred book of jew and christian in the sure conviction that these will confirm he assertion if ask in medina he be disillusion by find neither jew nor christian prepare to acknowledge a arabian prophet not even for the arab only so he be lead to distinguish between the _ true _ contents of the bible and that which have be make of it by the falsification of later jew and christian he prefer now to connect he own revelation more immediately with those of abraham no book of whom could be cite against he and who be acknowledge by jew and christian without be himself either a jew or a christian this turn this particular connection of islâm with abraham make it possible for he by means of a adaptation of the biblical legend concern abraham hagar and ishmael to include in he religion a set of religious custom of the meccan especially the hajj -lrb- 1 -rrb- thus islâm become more arabian and at the same time more independent of the other reveal religion whose degeneracy be demonstrate by they refusal to acknowledge mohammed -lrb- footnote 1 : a complete explanation of the gradual development of the abraham legend in the qorân can be find in my book _ het mekkaansche feest _ -lrb- the feast of mecca -rrb- leiden 1880 -rrb- all this be to be explain without the supposition of conscious trickery or dishonesty on the part of mohammed there be no other way for the unlettered prophet whose belief in he mission be unshaken to overcome the difficulty entail by he closer acquaintance with the tenet of other religion how then be we to explain the starting-point of it all -- mohamm 's sense of vocation be it a disease of the spirit a kind of madness at all event the datum be insufficient upon which to form a serious diagnosis some have call it epilepsy sprenger with a exaggerated display of certainty base upon he former medical study give mohammed 's disorder the name of hysteria other try to find a connection between mohammed 's extraordinary interest in the fair sex and he prophetic consciousness but after all be it explain the spiritual life of a man who be certainly unique if we put a label upon he and thus class he with other who at the most share with he certain abnormality a normal man mohamm certainly be not but as soon as we try to give a positive name to this negative quality then we do the same as the heathen of mecca who be violently awaken by he thunder prophecy : he be nothing but one possess a poet a soothsayer a sorcerer they say whether we say with the old european biographer impostor or with the modern one put epileptic or hysteric in its place make little difference the meccan end by submit to he and conquer a world under the banner of he faith we with the diffidence which true science imply feel obliged merely to call he mohamm and to seek in the qorân and with great cautiousness in the tradition a few principal point of he life and work in order to see how in he mind the intense feeling of discontent during the misery of he youth together with a great self-reliance a feeling of spiritual superiority to he surroundings develop into a call the form of which be largely decide by jewish and christian influence while be strike by various weakness which disfigure this great personality and which he himself freely confess we must admire the perseverance with which he retain he faith in he divine mission not discourage by twelve year of humiliation nor by the repudiation of the people of scripture upon whom he have rely as he principal witness nor yet by number of temporary rebuff during he struggle for the dominion of allah and he messenger which he carry on through the whole of arabium be mohamm conscious of the universality of he mission in the beginning he certainly conceive he work as merely the arabian part of a universal task which for other part of the world be lay upon other messenger in the medina period he ever more decidedly choose the direction of force to comply he be content only when the heathen perceive that further resistance to allah 's host be useless they understanding of he clear arabic qorân be no longer the principal object of he strive _ such _ a islâm could equally well be force upon _ non-arabian _ heathen and as regard the people of scripture since mohammed 's endeavor to be recognize by they have fail he have take up he position oppose to they even above they with the rise of he power he become hard and cruel to the jew in north-arabium and from jew and christian alike in arabium he demand submission to he authority since it have prove impossible to make they recognize he divine mission this demand could quite logically be extend to all christian in the first place to those of the byzantine empire but do mohammed himself come to these conclusion in the last part of he life be the word in which allah speak to he : we have send thee to man in general -lrb- 1 -rrb- and a few expression of the same sort to be take in that sense or do humanity here as in many other place in the qorân mean those with whom mohamm have especially to do nôldeke be strongly of opinion that the principal line of the program of conquest carry out after mohammed 's death have be draw by the prophet himself lammen and other deny with equal vigor that mohamm ever look upon the whole world as the field of he mission this show that the solution be not evident -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ qorân _ xxxiv 27 the translation of this verse have always be a subject of great difference of opinion at the time of its revelation -- as fix by mohammedan as well as by western authority -- the universal conception of mohammed 's mission be quite out of question -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : professor tw arnold in the 2d edition -lrb- london 1913 -rrb- of he valuable work _ the preaching of islâm _ -lrb- especially pp 28-31 -rrb- warmly endeavor to prove that mohamm from the begin consider he mission as universal he weaken he argument more than be necessary by place the tradition upon a almost equal footing with the qorân as a source and by ignore the historical development which be obvious in the qorân itself in this way he do not perceive the great importance of the history of the abraham legend in mohammed 's conception moreover the translation of the verse of the qorân on p 29 sometimes say more than the original _ lil-nâs _ be not _ to mankind _ but _ to man _ in the sense of _ to everybody _ _ qorân _ xvi 86 do not say : one day we will raise up a witness out of every nation but : on the day -lrb- _ ie _ the day of resurrection -rrb- when we will raise up etc which would seem to refer to the theme so constantly repeat in the qorân that each nation will be confront on the day of judgment with the prophet send to it when the qorân be call a admonition to the world -lrb- _ ' âlamîn _ -rrb- and mohammed 's mission a mercy to the world -lrb- _ ' âlamîn _ -rrb- then we must remember that ' âlamîn be one of the most misuse rhymeword in the qorân -lrb- eg _ qorân _ xv 70 -rrb- and we should not therefore translate it emphatically as all create being unless the universality of mohammed 's mission be firmly establish by other proof and this be far from be the case -rrb- in we valuation of mohammed 's saying we can not lay too much stress upon he incapability of look far ahead the final aim which mohamm set himself be consider by sane person as unattainable he firm belief in the realization of the vague picture of the future which he have conceive nay which allah hold before he drive he to the uttermost exertion of he mental power in order to surmount the innumerable unexpected obstacle which he encounter hence the variability of the practical direction contain in the qorân they be constantly alter accord to circumstance allah 's word during the last part of mohammed 's life : this day have i perfect you religion for you and have i fill up the measure of my favor towards you and choose islâm for you as you religion have in no way the meaning of the exclamation : it be finish of the die christ they be only a cry of jubilation over the degradation of the heathen arab by the triumph of allah 's weapon at mohammed 's death everything be still unstable and the vital question for islâm be subject of contention between the leader even before the prophet have be bury the expedient of new revelation complete alter or abrogate former one have play a important part in the legislative work of mohamm now he have never consider that by he death the spring would be stop although completion be want in every respect for without doubt mohammed feel he weakness in systematize and he absence of clearness of vision into the future and therefore he postpone the promulgation of divine decree as long as possible and he solve only such question of law as frequently recur when further hesitation would have be dangerous to he authority and to the peace of the community at mohammed 's death all arab be not yet subdue to he authority the expedition which he have undertake or arrange beyond the northern boundary of arabium be direct against arab although they be likely to rouse conflict with the byzantine and persian empire it would have be contrary to mohammed 's usual method if this have lead he to form a general definition of he attitude towards the world outside arabium as little as mohammed when he invoke the meccan in wild poetic inspiration to array themselves behind he to seek the blessedness of future life have dream of the possibility that twenty year later the whole of arabium would acknowledge he authority in this world as little nay much less could he at the close of he life have have the faintest premonition of the fabulous development which he state would reach half a century later the subjugation of the mighty persium and of some of the richest province of the byzantine empire only to mention these be never a part of he program although legend have it that he send out write challenge to the six prince of the world best know to he yet we may say that mohammed 's successor in the guidance of he community by continue they expansion towards the north after the suppression of the apostasy that follow he death remain in mohammed 's line of action there be even more evident continuity in the development of the empire of the omayyad out of the state of mohammed than in the series of event by which we see the dreaded prince-prophet of medina grow out of the possess one of mecca but if mohamm have be able to foresee how the unity of arabium which he nearly accomplish be to bring into be a formidable international empire we should expect some indubitable trace of this in the qorân not a few verse of dubious interpretation but some certain sign that the revelation which have repeatedly and with the greatest emphasis call itself a plain arabic qorân intend for those to whom no warner have yet be send should in future be valid for the ` ajam the barbarian as well as for the arab even if we ascribe to mohammed something of the universal program which the later tradition make he to have draw up he certainly could not foresee the success of it for this in the first place the economic and political factor to which some scholar of we day would attribute the entire explanation of the islâm movement must be take into consideration mohamm do to some extent prepare the universality of he religion and make it possible but that islâm which come into the world as the arabian form of the one true religion have actually become a universal religion be due to circumstance which have little to do with its origin -lrb- 1 -rrb- this extension of the domain to be subdue to its spiritual rule entail upon islâm about three century of development and accommodation of a different sort to be sure but not less drastic in character than that of the christian church -lrb- footnote 1 : sir william muir be not wrong when he say : from first to last the summons be to arab and to none other the seed of a universal creed have indeed be sow but that it ever germinate be due to circumstance rather than design -rrb- ii the religious development of islâm we can hardly imagine a poorer more miserable population than that of the south-arabian country hadramaut all moral and social progress be there impede by the continuance of the worst element of jâhiliyyah -lrb- arabian paganism -rrb- side by side with those of islâm a secular nobility be form by group of people who grudge each other they very live and fight each other accord to the rule of retaliation unmitigated by any more humane feeling the religious nobility be represent by descendant of the prophet arduous patron of a most narrow-minded orthodoxy and of most bigoted fanaticism in a well-ordered society make the most of all the means offer by modern technical science the dry barren soil might be make to yield sufficient harvest to satisfy the want of its member but among these inhabitant paralyse by anarchy chronic famine prevail foreigner wisely avoid this miserable country and if they do visit it would not be hospitably receive hunger force many hadramite to emigrate throughout the century we find they in all the country of islâm in the sacred city of western-arabium in syrium egypt indium indonesium where they often occupy important position in the dutch indy for instance they live in the most important commercial town and though the government have never favor they and though they have have to compete with chinese and with european they have succeed in make they position sufficiently strong before european influence prevail they even found state in some of the larger island or they obtain political influence in exist native state under a strong european government they be among the quietest most industrious subject all earn they own living and save something for they poor relation at home they come penniless and without any of that theoretical knowledge or practical skill which we be apt to consider as indispensable for a man who wish to try he fortune in a complicated modern colonial world yet i have know some who in twenty year ' time have become commercial potentate and even millionaire the strange spectacle of these latent talent and of the suppress energy of the people of hadramaut that seem to be wait only for transplantation into a more favourable soil to develop with amazing rapidity help we to understand the enormous consequence of the arabian migration in the seventh century the spiritual goods with which islâm set out into the world be far from impose it preach a most simple monotheism : allah the almighty creator and ruler of heaven and earth entirely self-sufficient so that it be ridiculous to suppose he to have partner or son and daughter to support he who have create the angel that they might form he retinue and man and genie -lrb- jinn -rrb- that they might obediently serve he who decide everything accord to he incalculable will and be responsible to nobody as the universe be he of whom he creature if they mind be not lead astray must therefore stand in respectful fear and awe he have make he will know to mankind beginning at adam but the spreading of mankind over the surface of the earth its seduction by satan and he emissary have cause most nation to become totally estrange from he and he service now and then when he consider that the time be come he cause a prophet to arise from among a nation to be he messenger to summon people to conversion and to tell they what blessedness await they as a reward of obedience what punishment would be inflict if they do not believe he message sometimes the disobedient have be strike by earthly judgment -lrb- the flood the drowning of the egyptian etc -rrb- and the faithful have be rescue in a miraculous way and lead to victory but such thing merely serve as indication of allah 's greatness one day the whole world will be overthrow and destroy then the dead will be awaken and lead before allah 's tribunal the faithful will have abode appoint they in well-watered shady garden with fruit-tree richly laden with luxurious couch upon which they may lie and enjoy the delicious food serve by the ministrant of paradise they may also freely indulge in sparkling wine that do not intoxicate and in intercourse with woman whose youth and virginity do not fade the unbeliever end they life in hell-fire or rather there be no end for the punishment as well as the reward be everlasting allah give to each one he due the action of he creature be all accurately write down and when judgment come the book be open moreover every creature carry the list of he own deed and misdeed the debit and credit side be carefully weigh against each other in the divine scale and many witness be hear before judgment be pronounced allah however be clement and merciful he gladly forgive those sinner who have believe in he who have sincerely accept islâm that be to say : who have acknowledge he absolute authority and have believe the message of the prophet send to they these prophet have the privilege of act as mediator on behalf of they follower not in the sense of redeemer but as advocate who receive gracious hearing naturally islâm submission to the lord of the universe ought to express itself in deed allah desire the homage of formal worship which must be perform several time a day by every individual and on special occasion by the assemble faithful lead by one of they this service -lrb- s -rrb- alât acquire its strictly bind rule only after mohammed 's time but already in he lifetime it consist chiefly of the same element as now : the recital of sacred text especially take from the revelation certain posture of the body -lrb- standing inclination kneel prostration -rrb- with the face towards mecca this last particular and the language of the revelation be the arabian element of the service which be for the rest a imitation of jewish and christian ritual so far as mohammed know they there be no sacrament consequently no priest to administer it islâm have always be the lay religion _ par excellence _ teaching and exhortation be the only spiritual help that the pious mohammedan want and this simple care of soul be exercise without any ordination or consecration fasting for a month if possible and longer if desire be also a integral part of religious life and by show disregard of earthly joy a proof of faith in allah 's promise for the world to come almsgive recommend above all other virtue be not only to be practice in obedience to allah 's law and in faith in retribution but it be to testify contempt of all earthly possession which might impede the strive after eternal happiness later mohamm be compel by the need of a public fund and the wane zeal of the faithful as they number increase to regulate the practice of this virtue and to exact certain minimum as tax -lrb- _ zakât _ -rrb- when mohamm take he stand as oppose to judaism and christianity have accentuate the arabian character of he religion the meccan rite of pagan origin be incorporate into islâm but only after the purification require by monotheism from that time forward the yearly celebration of the hajj be among the ritual duty of the moslim community in the first year of the strife yet another duty be most emphatically impressed on the faithful _ jihâd ie _ readiness to sacrifice life and possession for the defense of islâm understand since the conquest of mecca in 630 as the extension by force of arm of the authority of the moslim state first over the whole of arabium and soon after mohammed 's death over the whole world so far as allah grant he host the victory for the rest the legislative revelation regulate only such point as have become subject of argument or contest in mohammed 's lifetime or such as be particularly suggest by that antithesis of paganism and revelation which have determine mohammed 's prophetical career gambling and wine be forbid the latter after some hesitation between the inculcation of temperance and that of abstinence usury take in the sense of require any interest at all upon loan be also forbid all tribal feud with they consequence have henceforward to be consider as non-existent and retaliation provide that the offended party would not agree to accept compensation be put under the control of the head of the community polygamy and intercourse of master and female slave be restricted the obligation arise from blood-relationship or ownership be regulate these point suffice to remind we of the nature of the qorânic regulation reference to certain subject in this reveal law while other be ignore do not depend on they respective importance to the life of the community but rather on what happen to have be suggest by the event in mohammed 's lifetime for mohammed know too well how little qualified he be for legislative work to undertake it unless absolutely necessary this rough sketch of what islâm mean when it set out to conquer the world be not very likely to create the impression that its incredibly rapid extension be due to its superiority over the form of civilization which it supplant lammen 's assertion that islâm be the jewish religion simplify accord to arabic want and amplify by some christian and arabic tradition contain a great deal of truth if only we recognize the central importance for mohammed 's vocation and preaching of the christian doctrine of resurrection and judgment this explain the large number of weak point that the book of mohammed 's revelation write down by he first follower offer to jewish and christian polemic it be easy for the theologian of those religion to point out numberless mistake in the work of the illiterate arabian prophet especially where he maintain that he be repeat and confirm the contents of they bible the qorânic revelation about allah 's intercourse with man take from apocryphal source from profane legend like that of alexander the great sometimes even create by mohammed 's own fancy -- such as the story of the prophet sâlih say to have live in the north of arabium and that of the prophet hûd suppose to have live in the south all this could not but give they the impression of a clumsy caricature of true tradition the principal doctrine of synagogue and church have apparently be misunderstand or they be simply deny as corruption the conversion to islâm within a hundred year of such nation as the egyptian the syrian and the persian can hardly be attribute to anything but the latent talent the formerly suppress energy of the arabian race have find a favourable soil for its development talent and energy however not of a missionary kind if islâm be say to have be from its begin down to the present day a missionary religion -lrb- 1 -rrb- then mission be to be take here in a quite peculiar sense and special attention must be give to the preparation of the missionary field by the moslim army relate by history and consider as most important by the mohammedan themselves -lrb- footnote 1 : with extraordinary talent this thesis have be defend by professor tw arnold in the above quote work _ the preaching of islam _ which fully deserve the attention also of those who do not agree with the writer 's argument among the many objection that may be raise against prof arnold 's conclusion we point to the undeniable fact that the moslim scholar of all age hardly speak of mission at all and always treat the extension of the true faith by holy war as one of the principal duty of the moslim community -rrb- certainly the nation conquer by the arab under the first khalîfs be not oblige to choose between living as moslim or die as unbeliever the conqueror treat they as mohammed have treat jew and christian in arabium towards the end of he life and only exact from they submission to moslim authority they be allow to adhere to they religion provide they help with they tax to fill the moslim exchequer this rule be even extend to such religion as that of the parsîs although they could not be consider as belong to the people of scripture expressly recognize in the qorân but the social condition of these subject be gradually make so oppressive by the mohammedan master that rapid conversion in mass be a natural consequence the more natural because among the conquer nation intellectual culture be restricted to a small circle so that after the conquest they spiritual leader lack freedom of movement besides practically very little be require from the new convert so that it be very tempting to take the step that lead to full citizenship no those who in a short time subject million of non-arab to the state found by mohammed and thus prepare they conversion be no apostle they be general whose strategic talent would have remain hidden but for mohammed political genius especially from mecca and taif who before islâm would have excel only in the organization of commercial operation or in establish harmony between hostile family now they prove capable of unite the arab command by allah a unity still many a time endanger during the first century by the old party spirit and of devise a division of labor between the ruler and the conquer which make it possible for they to control the function of complicated machine of state without any technical knowledge moreover several circumstance favor they work both the large realm which extend north of arabium be in a state of political decline the christian inhabit the province that be to be conquer first belong for the larger part to heretical sect and be treat by the orthodox byzantine in such a way that other master if tolerant might be welcome the arabian army consist of hardened bedouin with few want whose longing for the treasure of the civilized world make they more ready to endure the pressure of a discipline hitherto unknown to they the use that the leader make of the occasion command we admiration although they plan be form in the course and under the influence of generally unforeseen event circumstance have change mohamm the prophet into mohamm the conqueror and the leader who continue the conqueror 's work though not drive by fanaticism or religious zeal still prepare the conversion of million of man to islâm it be only natural that the new master adopt with certain modification the administrative and fiscal system of the conquer country for similar reason islâm have to complete its spiritual store from the well-ordered wealth of that of its new adherent recent research show most clearly that islâm in after time so sharply oppose to other religion and so strongly arm against foreign influence in the first century borrow freely and simply from the people of scripture whatever be not evidently in contradiction to the qorân this be to be expect have not mohamm from the very begin refer to the people of the book as those who know when painful experience induce he afterwards to accuse they of corruption of they scripture this attitude necessitate a certain criticism but not rejection of they tradition the ritual only provisionally regulate and continually liable to change accord to prophetic inspiration in mohammed 's lifetime require unalterable rule after he death recent study -lrb- 1 -rrb- have show in a astounding way that the jewish ritual together with the religious rite of the christian strongly influence the definite shape give to that of islâm while indirect influence of the parsî religion be at least probable -lrb- footnote 1 : the study of professor ch becker e mittwoch and aj wensinck especially take in connection with older one of ignaz goldziher have throw much light upon this subject -rrb- so much for the rite of public worship and the ritual purity they require the method of fasting seem to follow the jewish model whereas the period of obligatory fasting depend on the christian usage mohamm 's fragmentary and unsystematic account of sacred history be freely draw from jewish and christian source and cover the whole period from the creation of the world until the first century of the christian era of course feature shocking to the moslim mind be drop and the whole adapt to the monotonous conception of the qorân with ever greater boldness the story of mohammed 's own life be exalt to the sphere of the supernatural here the gospel serve as example though mohammed have repeatedly declare himself to be a ordinary man choose by allah as the organ of he revelation and whose only miracle be the qorân posterity ascribe to he a whole series of wonder evidently invent in emulation of the wonder of christ the reason for this seem to have be the idea that none of the older prophet not even jesus of whom the qorân tell the greatest wonder could have work a miracle without mohamm the seal of the prophet have rival or surpass he in this respect only jesus be the messiah but this title do not exceed in value different title of other prophet and mohammed 's special epithet be of a higher order a relative sinlessness mohamm share with jesus the acceptance of this doctrine contradictory to the original spirit of the qorân have moreover a dogmatic motive : it be consider indispensable to raise the text of the qorân above all suspicion of corruption which suspicion would not be exclude if the organ of the revelation be fallible this period of naively adopt institution doctrine and tradition be soon follow by a awakening to the consciousness that islâm could not well absorb any more of such foreign element without endanger its independent character then a sort begin and the assimilation of the vast amount of borrow matter that have already become a integral part of islâm be complete by submit the whole to a peculiar treatment it be carefully divest of all mark of origin and label _ hadîth _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- so that henceforth it be regard as emanation from the wisdom of the arabian prophet for which he follower owe no thanks to foreigner -lrb- footnote 1 : _ hadîth _ the arabic word for record story have assume the technical meaning of tradition concern the word and deed of mohamm it be use as well in the sense of a single record of this sort as in that of the whole body of sacred tradition -rrb- at first it be only at medina that some pious people occupy themselves with register put in order and systematize the spiritual property of islâm afterwards similar circle be form in other centre such as mecca kufa basra misr -lrb- cairo -rrb- and elsewhere at the outset the collection of divine saying the qorân be the only guide the only source of decisive decree the only touchstone of what be true or false allow or forbid reluctantly but decidedly at last it be concede that the foundation lay by mohamm for the life of he community be by no means all to be find in the holy book rather that mohammed 's revelation without he explanation and practice would have remain a enigma it be understand now that the rule and law of islâm be found on god 's word and on the sunnah _ ie _ the way point out by the prophet 's word and example thus it have be from the moment that allah have cause he light to shine over arabium and thus it must remain if human error be not to corrupt islâm at the moment when this conservative instinct begin to assert itself among the spiritual leader so much foreign matter have already be incorporate into islâm that the theory of the sufficiency of qorân and sunnah could not have be maintain without the labeling operation which we have allude to so it be assume that as surely as mohammed must have surpass he predecessor in perfection and in wonder so surely must all the principle and precept necessary for he community have be formulate by he thus by a gigantic web of fiction he become after he death the organ of opinion idea and interest whose lawfulness be recognize by every influential section of the faithful all that could not be identify as part of the prophet 's sunnah receive no recognition on the other hand all that be accept have somehow to be incorporate into the sunnah it become a fundamental dogma of islâm that the sunnah be the indispensable completion of the qorân and that both together form the source of mohammedan law and doctrine so much so that every party assume the name of people of the sunnah to express its pretension to orthodoxy the _ contents _ of the sunnah however be the subject of a great deal of controversy so that it come to be consider necessary to make the prophet pronounce he authoritative judgment on this difference of opinion he be say to have call it a proof of god 's special mercy that within reasonable limit difference of opinion be allow in he community of that privilege mohammedan have always amply avail themselves when the difference touch on political question especially on the succession of the prophet in the government of the community schism be the inevitable consequence thus arise the party strife of the first century which lead to the establishment of the sect of the shî ` ite and the khârijites separate community sever from the great whole that lead they own life and therefore follow path different from those of the majority in matter of doctrine and law as well as in politics the sharpness of the political antithesis serve to accentuate the importance of the other difference in such case and to debar they acceptance as the legal consequence of the difference of opinion that god 's mercy allow that the political factor be indeed the great motive of separation be clearly show in we own day now that one mohammedan state after the other see its political independence disappear and effort be be make from all side to re-establish the unity of the mohammedan world by stimulate the feeling of religious brotherhood among the most cultivate moslim of different country a earnest endeavor be gain ground to admit shî ` ite khârijites and other formerly abuse as heretic into the great community now threaten by common foe and to regard they special tenet in the same way as the difference exist between the four law school : hanafite mâlikites shâfi'ites and hanbalite which for century have be consider equally orthodox although the difference that divide these school at first cause great excitement and give rise to violent discussion the strong catholic instinct of islâm always know how to prevent schism each new generation either find the golden mean between the extreme which have divide the precede one or it recognize the right of both opinion though the dogmatic difference be not necessarily so dangerous to unity as be political one yet they be more apt to cause schism than discussion about the law it be essential to put a end to dissension concern the theological root of the whole system of islâm mohamm have never express any truth in dogmatic form all systematic thinking be foreign to he nature it be again the non-arabic moslim especially those of christian origin who suggest such doctrinal question at first they meet with a vehement opposition that condemn all dogmatic discussion as a novelty of the devil in the long run however the contest of the conservative against specially objectionable feature of the dogmatist ' discussion force they to borrow arm from the dogmatic arsenal hence a method with a peculiar terminology come in vogue to which even the boldest imagination could not ascribe any connection with the sunnah of mohammed yet some tradition venture to put prophetic warning on mohammed 's lip against dogmatic innovation that be sure to arise and to make he pronounce the name of a couple of future sect but no one dare to make the prophet preach a orthodox system of dogmatic result from the controversy of several century all the term of which be foreign to the arabic speech of mohammed 's time indeed all the subject which have give rise to dogmatic controversy in the christian church except some too specifically christian be discuss by the _ mutakallim _ the dogmatist of islâm free will or predestination god omnipotent or first of all just and holy god 's word create by he or share he eternity god one in this sense that he be admit of no plurality of quality or possess of quality which in all eternity be inherent in he be in the world to come only bliss and doom or also a intermediate state for the neutral we might continue the enumeration and always show to the christian church-historian or theologian old acquaintance in moslim garb that be why maraccus and reland could understand jew and christian yield to the temptation of join islâm and that also explain why catholic and protestant dogmatist could accuse each other of crypto-mohammedanism not until the beginning of the tenth century ad do the orthodox mohammedan dogma begin to emerge from the clash of opinion into its definite shape the mu ` tazilite have advocate man 's free will have give prominence to justice and holiness in they conception of god have deny distinct quality in god and the eternity of god 's word have accept a place for the neutral between paradise and hell and for some time the favor of the power in authority seem to assure the victory of they system al-ash ` arî contradict all these point and he system have in the end be adopt by the great majority the mu ` tazilite doctrine for a long time still enthral many mind but they end by take refuge in the political heresy of shî ` itism in the most conservative circle opponent to all speculation be never want but they be oblige unconsciously to make large concession to systematic thought for in the moslim world as elsewhere religious belief without dogma have become as impossible as breathing be without air thus in islâm a whole system which could not even pretend to draw its authority from the sunnah have come to be accept it be not difficult to justify this deviation from the orthodox abhorrence against novelty islâm have always look at the world in a pessimistic way a view express in numberless prophetic saying the world be bad and will become worse and worse religion and morality will have to wage a ever more hopeless war against unbelief against heresy and ungodly way of live while this be surely no reason for enter into any compromise with doctrine which depart but a hair 's breadth from qorân and sunnah it necessitate method of defense against heresy as unknown in mohammed 's time as heresy itself necessity know no law be a principle fully accept in islam and heresy be a enemy of the faith that can only be defeat with dialectic weapon so the religious truth preach by mohamm have not be alter in any way but under the stress of necessity they have be clothe in modern armor which have somewhat change they aspect moreover islâm have a theory which alone be sufficient to justify the whole later development of doctrine as well as of law this theory whose importance for the system can hardly be overestimate and which nevertheless have until very recent time constantly be overlook by western student of islâm find its classical expression in the follow word put into the mouth of mohammed : my community will never agree in a error in term more familiar to we this mean that the mohammedan church take as a whole be infallible that all the decision on matter practical or theoretical on which it be agree be bind upon its member nowhere else be the catholic instinct of islâm more clearly express a faithful mohammedan student after have struggle through a handbook of law may be vex by a doubt as to whether these endless casuistic precept have be rightly deduce from the qorân and the sacred tradition he doubt however will at once be silence if he bear in mind that allah speak more plainly to he by this infallible agreement -lrb- _ ijmâ ' _ -rrb- of the community than through qorân and tradition nay that the contents of both those sacred source without this perfect intermediary would be to a great extent unintelligible to he even the difference between the school of law may be base on this theory of the ijmâ ' for do not the infallible agreement of the community teach we that a certain diversity of opinion be a merciful gift of god it be through the agreement that dogmatic speculation as well as minute discussion about point of law become legitimate the stamp of ijmâ ' be essential to every rule of faith and life to all manners and custom all sort of religious idea and practice which could not possibly be deduce from mohammed 's message enter the moslim world by the permission of ijmâ ' here we need think only of mysticism and of the cult of saint some passage of the qorân may perhaps be interpret in such a way that we hear the subtler string of religious emotion vibrate in they the chief impression that mohamm 's allah make before the hijrah be that of awful majesty at which man tremble from afar they fear he punishment dare hardly be sure of he reward and hope much from he mercy this impression be a lasting one but after the hijrah allah be also hear quietly reasoning with he obedient servant give they advice and command which they have to follow in order to frustrate all resistance to he authority and to deserve he satisfaction he be always the lord the king of the world who speak to he humble servant but the lamp which allah have cause mohamm to hold up to guide mankind with its light be raise higher and higher after the prophet 's death in order to shed its light over a ever increase part of humanity this be not possible however without its reservoir be replenish with all the different kind of oil that have from time immemorial give light to those different nation the oil of mysticism come from christian circle and its neo-platonic origin be quite unmistakable persium and indium also contribute to it there be those who by asceticism by different method of mortify the flesh liberate the spirit that it might rise and become unite with the origin of all be to such a extent that with some the profession of faith be reduce to the blasphemous exclamation : i be allah other try to become free from the sphere of the material and the temporal by certain method of thought combine or not combine with asceticism here the necessity of guidance be feel and congregation come into existence whose purpose it be to permit large group of people under the leadership of they sheikh to participate simultaneously in the mystic union the influence which spread most widely be that of leader like ghazâlî the father of the later mohammedan church who recommend moral purification of the soul as the only way by which man should come nearer to god he mysticism wish to avoid the danger of pantheism to which so many other be lead by they contemplation and which so often engendered disregard of the reveal law or even of morality some want to pass over the gap between the creator and the create along a bridge of contemplation and so drive by the fire of sublime passion precipitate themselves towards the object of they love in a kind of rapture which poet compare with intoxication the evil world say that the impossibility to accomplish this heavenly union often induce those people to imitate it for the time be with the earthly means of wine and the indulgence in sensual love characteristic of all these sort of mysticism be they esoteric pride all those emotion be mean only for a small number of choose one even ghazâlî 's ethical mysticism be not for the multitude the development of islâm as a whole from the hijrah on have always be greater in breadth than in depth and consequently its pedagogic have remain defective even some of the noblest mind in islâm restrict true religious life to a aristocracy and accept the ignorance of the multitude as a irremediable evil throughout the century pantheistic and animistic form of mysticism have find many adherent among the mohammedan but the infallible agreement have persist in call that heresy ethical mysticism since ghazâlî have be fully recognize and with law and dogma it form the sacred trio of science of islâm to the study of which the arabic humanistic art serve as preparatory instrument all other science however useful and necessary be of this world and have no value for the world to come the unfaithful appreciate and study they as well as do the mohammedan but on mohammedan soil they must be color with a mohammedan hue and they result may never clash with the three religious science physics astronomy and philosophy have often find it difficult to observe this restriction and therefore they use to be at least slightly suspect in pious circle mysticism do not only owe to ijmâ ' its place in the sacred trio but it succeed better than dogmatic in confirm its right with word of allah and he prophet in islâm mysticism and allegory be ally in the usual way for the _ illuminatus _ the word have quite a different meaning than for common every-day people so the qorân be make to speak the language of mysticism and mystic commentary of the holy book exist which with total disregard for philological and historical objection explain the verse of the revelation as expression of the profoundest soul experience clear utterance in this spirit be put into the prophet 's mouth and like the canonist the leader on the mystic way to god boast of a spiritual genealogy which go back to mohamm thus the prophet be say to have declare void all knowledge and fulfillment of the law which lack mystic experience of course only true mysticism be justify by ijmâ ' and confirm by the evidence of qorân and sunnah but about the bound between true and false or heretical mysticism there exist in a large measure the well-known diversity of opinion allow by god 's grace the ethical mysticism of al-ghazâlî be generally recognize as orthodox and the possibility of attain to a higher spiritual sphere by means of methodic asceticism and contemplation be doubt by few the follow opinion have come to prevail in wide circle : the law offer the bread of life to all the faithful the dogmatic be the arsenal from which the weapon must be take to defend the treasure of religion against unbelief and heresy but mysticism show the earthly pilgrim the way to heaven it be a much lower need that assure the cult of saint a place in the doctrine and practice of islâm as strange as be mohamm 's transformation from a ordinary son of man which he want to be into the incarnation of divine light as the later biographer represent he it be still more astounding that the intercession of saint should have become indispensable to the community of mohammed who accord to tradition curse the jew and christian because they worship the shrine of they prophet almost every moslim village have its patron saint every country have its national saint every province of human life have its own human ruler who be intermediate between the creator and common mortal in no other particular have islâm more fully accommodate itself to the religion it supplant the popular practice which be in many case hardly to be distinguish from polytheism be to a great extent favor by the theory of the intercession of the pious dead of whose friendly assistance people might assure themselves by do good deed in they name and to they eternal advantage the ordinary moslim visitor of the grave of saint do not trouble himself with this ingenious compromise between the severe monotheism of he prophet and the polytheism of he ancestor he be firmly convince that the best way to obtain the satisfaction of he desire after earthly or heavenly goods be to give the saint whose special care these be what he like best and he confidently leave it to the venerated one to settle the matter with allah who be far too high above the ordinary mortal to allow of direct contact in support even of this startling deviation from the original tradition have be devise moreover the veneration of human being be favor by some form of mysticism for like many saint many mystic have they eccentricity and it be much to the advantage of mystic theologian if the vulgar could be persuade to accept they aberration from normal rule of life as peculiarity of holy man but ijmâ ' do more even than tradition and mysticism to make the veneration of legion of saint possible in the temple of the very man who be oblige by they ritual law to say to allah several time daily : thee only do we worship and to thee alone do we cry for help in the tenth century of we era islâm 's process of accommodation be finish in all its essential from this time forward if circumstance be favourable it could continue the execution of its world conquer plan without be compel to assimilate any more foreign element against each spiritual asset that another universal religion could boast it could now put forward something of a similar nature but which still show characteristic of its own and the superiority of which it could sustain by argument perfectly satisfactory to its follower from that time on islâm strove to distinguish itself ever more sharply from its most important rival there be no absolute stagnation the evolution be not entirely stop but it move at a much quieter pace and its direction be govern by internal motive not by influence from outside moslim catholicism have attain its full growth we can not within the small compass of these lecture consider the excrescence of the normal islâm the shî ` itic ultra who venerate certain descendant of mohamm as infallible ruler of the world ishma'ilite qarmatian assassin nor the modern bastard of islâm such as the sheikhite the bâbî 's the behâ ' îs -- who have find some adherent in america -- and other sect which indeed spring up on moslim soil but deliberately turn to non-mohammedan source for they inspiration we must draw attention however to protest raise by certain minority against some of the idea and practice which have be definitely adopt by the majority in the midst of mohammedan catholicism there always live and move more or less freely protestant element the comparison may even be continue with certain qualification and we may speak also of a conservative and of a liberal protestantism in islâm the conservative protestantism be represent by the hanbalitic school and kindred spirit who most emphatically preach that the agreement -lrb- ijmâ ' -rrb- of every period should be base on that of the pious ancestor they therefore test every dogma and practice by the word and deed of the prophet he contemporary and the leader of the community in the first decade after mohammed 's death in they eye the church of later day have degenerate and they decline to consider the agreement of its doctor as justify the penetration into islâm of idea and usage of foreign origin the cult of saint be reject by they as altogether contradictory to the qorân and the genuine tradition these protestant of islâm may be compare to those of christianity also in this respect that they accept the result of the evolution and assimilation of the first three century of islâm but reject later addition as abuse and corruption when on the verge of we nineteenth century they try as true moslim to force by material mean they religious conception on other they be combate as heretic by the authority of catholic islâm central and western arabium form the battlefield on which these zealot call wahhâbites after they leader be defeat by mohammed ali the first khedive and he egyptian army since they have give up they effort at violent reconstitution of what they consider to be the original islâm they be leave alone and they idea have find adherent far outside arabia _ eg _ in british indium and in northern and central africa in still quite another way many moslim who find they freedom of thought or action impede by the prevail law and doctrine have return to the origin of they religion too much attach to the tradition of they faith deliberately to disregard these impediment they try to find in the qorân and tradition argument in favor of what be dictate to they by reason and they find those argument as easily as former generation have find the basis on which to erect they casuistry they dogma and they mysticism this imply a interpretation of the oldest source independent from the catholic development of islâm and in contradiction with the general opinion of the canonist accord to whom since the fourth or fifth century of the hijrah no one be qualify for such free research a certain degree of independence of mind together with a strong attachment to they spiritual past have give rise in the moslim world to this sort of liberal protestantism which in we age have many adherent among the mohammedan who have come in contact with modern civilization that the partisan of all these different conception could remain together as the child of one spiritual family be largely owing to the elastic character of ijmâ ' the importance of which be to some extent acknowledge by catholic and protestant by modern and conservative it have never be contest that the community whose agreement be the test of truth should not consist of the faithful mass but of the expert elect in a christian church we should have speak of the clergy with a further definition of the organ through which it be to express itself synod council or pope islâm have no clergy as we have see the qualification of a man to have he own opinion depend entirely upon the scope of he knowledge or rather of he erudition there be no lack of standard fix by mohammedan authority in which the requirement for a scholar to qualify he for ijmâ ' be detail the principal criterion be the knowledge of the canon law quite what we should expect from the history of the evolution of islâm but of course dogmatist and mystic have also they own agreement on the question concern they and through the compromise between law dogma and mysticism there could not fail to come into existence a kind of mixed ijmâ ' moreover the standard and definition could have only a certain theoretical value as there never have exist a body that could speak in the name of all the decision of ijmâ ' be therefore to be ascertain only in a vague and general way the speaker be individual whose own authority depend on ijmâ ' whereas ijmâ ' should have be they collective decision thus it be possible for innumerable shades of catholicism and protestantism to live under one roof with a good deal of friction it be true but without definite breach or schism no one sect be able to eject another from the community moslim political authority be bind not only to extend the domain of islâm but also to keep the community in the right path in its life and doctrine this task they have always conceive in accordance with they political interest islâm have have its religious persecution but tolerance be very usual and even official favor of heresy not quite exceptional with moslim ruler regular maintenance of religious discipline exist nowhere thus in the bond of political obedience element which might otherwise have be scatter be hold together the political decay of islâm in we a day have do away with what have be leave of official power to settle religious difference and any organization of spiritual authority never exist hence it be only natural that the diversity of opinion allow by the grace of allah now show itself on a greater scale than ever before iii the political development of islâm in the first period of islâm the function of what we call church and what we call state be exercise by the same authority its political development be therefore of great importance for the understanding of its religious growth the prophet when he speak in the name of god be the lawgiver of he community and it be rightly understand by the later faithful that he indispensable explanation of god 's word have also legislative power from the time of the hijrah the nature of the case make he the ruler the judge and the military commander of he theocratic state moreover allah expressly demand of the moslim that they should obey the messenger of god and those amongst they who have authority -lrb- 1 -rrb- we see by this expression that mohamm share he temporal authority with other he co-ruler be not appoint they number be nowhere define they be not a closed circle they be the notable of the tribe or other group who have array themselves under mohammed 's authority and a few who have gain influence by they personality in they council mohamm 's word have no decisive power except when he speak in the name of allah and we know how careful he be to give oracle only in case of extreme need -lrb- footnote 1 : qorân iv 62 -rrb- in the last year of mohammed 's life he authority become extend over a large part of arabium but he do very little in the way of centralization of government he send _ ' âmils ie _ agent to the conquer tribe or village who have to see that in the first place the most important regulation of the qorân be follow and secondly that the tax into which the duty of almsgive have be convert be promptly pay and that the portion of it intend for the central fund at medina be duly deliver after the great conquest the governor of province of the moslim empire who often exercise a despotic power be call by the same title of _ ' âmils _ the agent of mohammed however do not possess such unlimited authority it be only gradually that the arab learn the value of good discipline and submission to a strong guidance and adopt the form of orderly government as they find they in the conquer land through the death of mohammed everything become uncertain the combination under one leadership of such a heterogeneous mass as that of he arab would have be unthinkable a few year before it become quite natural though as soon as the prophet 's mouth be recognize as the organ of allah 's voice must this monarchy be continue after allah 's mouthpiece have cease to exist it be not at all certain the force of circumstance and the energy of some of mohammed 's counsellor soon lead to the necessary decision a number of the notable of the community succeed in force upon the hesitate or unwilling member the acceptance of the monarchy as a permanent institution there must be a khalîf a deputy of the prophet in all he function -lrb- except that of messenger of god -rrb- who would be ruler and judge and leader of public worship but above all _ amîr al-mu ` minîn _ commander of the faithful in the struggle both against the apostate arab and against the hostile tribe on the northern border but for the military success of the first khalif islâm would never have become a universal religion every exertion be make to keep the troops of the faithful complete the leader follow only mohamm 's example when they represent fight for allah 's cause as the most enviable occupation the duty of military service be constantly impressed upon the moslim the lust of booty and the desire for martyrdom to which the qorân assign the highest reward be excite to the utmost at a later period it become necessary in the interest of order to temper the result of this excitement by tradition in which those of the faithful who die in the exercise of a peaceful honest profession be declare to be witness to the faith as well as those who be slay in battle against the enemy of god -- tradition in which the real and greater holy war be describe as the struggle against evil passion the necessity of such a mitigating reaction the spirit in which the chapter on holy war of mohammedan lawbook be conceive and the galvanize power which down to we own day be contain in a call to arm in the name of allah all this show that in the beginning of islâm the love of battle have be instigate at the expense of everything else the institution of the khalifate have hardly be agree upon when the question of who should occupy it become the subject of violent dissension the first four khalîfs whose reign occupy the first thirty year after mohammed 's death be qoraishite tribesman of the prophet and moreover man who have be he intimate friend the sacred tradition relate a say of mohammed : the _ imâms _ be from qoraish intend to confine the khalifate to man from that tribe history however show that this edict be forge to give the stamp of legality to the result of a long political struggle for at mohammed 's death the medinese begin fiercely contest the claim of the qoraishite and during the reign of alî the fourth khalîf the khârijites rebel demand as democratic rigorist the free election of khalîfs without restriction to the tribe of qoraish or to any other descent they standard of requirement contain only religious and moral quality and they claim for the community the continual control of the choose leader 's behavior and the right of depose he as soon as they find he fail in the fulfilment of he duty they anarchistic revolution which during more than a century occasionally give much trouble to the khalifate cause islâm to accentuate the aristocratic character of its monarchy they be overcome and reduce to a sect the survivor of which still exist in south-eastern arabium in zanzibar and in northern africa however the actual life of these community resemble that of they spiritual forefather to a very remote degree another democratic doctrine still more radical than that of the khârijites make even non-arabs eligible for the khalifate it must have have a considerable number of adherent for the tradition which make the prophet responsible for it be to be find in the canonic collection later generation however render it harmless by exegesis they maintain that in this text commander mean only subordinate chief and not the commander of the faithful it become a dogma in the orthodox mohammedan world respect up to the sixteenth century that only member of the tribe of qoraish could take the place of the messenger of god the chance of success be greater for the legitimist than for the democratic party the former wish to make the khalifate the privilege of alî the cousin and son-in-law of the prophet and he descendant at first the community do not take much notice of that house of mohammed and it do not occur to any one to give they a special part in the direction of affair alî and fâtima themselves ask to be place in possession only of certain goods which have belong to mohammed but which the first khalîfs would not allow to be regard as he personal property they maintain that the prophet have have the disposal of they not as owner but as head of the state this narrow greed and absence of political insight seem to be hereditary in the descendant of alus and fâtima for there be no lack of superstitious reverence for they in later time and if one of they have possess something of the political talent of the best omayyad and abbasid he would certainly have be able to supplant they after the third khalîf othmân have be murder by he political opponent ali become he successor but he be more remote than any of he predecessor from enjoy general sympathy at that time the shî ` ah the party of the house of the prophet gradually arise which maintain that alus should have be the first khalîf and that he descendant should succeed he the veneration feel for those descendant increase in the same proportion as that for the prophet himself and moreover there be at all time malcontent whose advantage would be in join any revolution against the exist government yet the alid never succeed in accomplish anything against the dynasty of the omayyad the abbasid and the ottoman except in a few case of transitory importance only the fatimite dynasty of rather doubtful descent which rule a part of northern africa and egypt in the tenth century ad be completely suppress after some two and a half century the sherîfs who have rule morocco for more than 950 year be not chief of a party that consider the legality of they leadership a dogma they owe they local khalifate far more to the out-of-the-way position of they country which prevent abbasid and turk from meddle with they affair otherwise they would have be oblige at any rate to acknowledge the sovereignty of the great lord of constantinople this be the case with the sherîfs of mecca who ever since the twelfth century have regard the sacred territory as they domain they principality arise out of the general political disturbance and the division of the mohammedan empire into a number of kingdom whose mutual strife prevent they from undertake military operation in the desert these sherîfs raise no claim to the khalifate and the shî ` itic tendency they display in the middle age have no political significance although they have intimate relation with the zaidite of southern arabium as first egypt and afterwards turkey make they protectorate over the holy city more effective the prince of mecca become orthodox the zaidite who settle in yeman from the ninth century on be really shî ` ite although of the most moderate kind without strive after expansion outside arabium they firmly refuse to give up they own khalifate and to acknowledge the sovereignty of any non-alid ruler the effort of the turk to subdue they or to make a compromise with they have have no lasting result this be the principal obstacle against they be include in the orthodox community although they admission be defend even under present circumstance by many non-political moslim scholar the zaidite be the remnant of the original arabian shî ` ah which for century have count adherent in all part of the moslim world and some of whose tenet have penetrate mohammedan orthodoxy the almost general veneration of the sayyid and sherîfs as the descendant of mohamm be entitle be due to this influence the shî ` ah outside arabium whose adherent use to be persecute by the official authority not without good cause become the receptacle of all the revolutionary and heterodox idea maintain by the convert people alongside of the _ visible _ political history of islâm of the first century these circle build up they evolution of the _ unseen _ community the only true one guide by the holy family and the reality be to they a continuous denial of the postulate of religion they first _ imâm _ or successor of the prophet be alî whose divine right have be unjustly deny by the three usurper abu bakr omar and othmân and who have exercise actual authority for a few year in constant strife with khârijites and omayyad the effort of he legitimate successor to assert they authority be constantly drown in blood until at last there be no more candidate for the dangerous office this prosaic fact be convert by the adherent of the house of mohamm into the romance that the last _ imâm _ of a line of _ seven _ accord to some and _ twelve _ accord to other have disappear in a mysterious way to return at the end of day as mahdî the guide one who should restore the political order which have be disturb ever since mohammed 's death until he reappearance there be nothing leave for the community to do but to await he advent under the guidance of they secular ruler -lrb- eg the shâhs of persium -rrb- and enlighten by they authoritative scholar -lrb- _ mujtahid _ -rrb- who explain faith and law to they from the tradition of the sacred family the great majority of mohammedan as they do not accept this legitimist theory be count by the shî ` ah outside arabium as unclean heretic if not as unbeliever at the beginning of the fifteenth century this shî ` ah find its political center in persium and oppose itself fanatically to the sultan of turkey who at about the same time come to stand at the head of orthodox islâm all difference of doctrine be now sharpen and embittered by political passion and the effort of single enlighten prince or scholar to induce the various people to extend to each other across the political barrier the hand of brotherhood in the principle of faith all fail it be only in the last few year that the general political distress of islâm have incline the estrange relative towards reconciliation besides the veneration of the alid orthodox islâm have adopt another shîitic element the expectation of the mahdî which we have just mention most sunnite expect that at the end of the world there will come from the house of mohamm a successor to he guide by allah who will maintain the reveal law as faithfully as the first four khalîfs do accord to the idealized history and who will succeed with god 's help in make islâm victorious over the whole world that the chiliastic kingdom of the mahdî must in the end be destroy by anti-christ in order that jesus may be able once more to re-establish the holy order before the resurrection be a necessary consequence of the amalgamation of the political expectation form under shî ` itic influence with eschatological conception formerly borrow by islâm from christianity the orthodox mahdî differ from that of the shî ` ah in many way he be not a _ imâm _ return after century of disappearance but a descendant of mohammed come into the world in the ordinary way to fulfill the ideal of the khalifate he do not re-establish the legitimate line of successor of the prophet but he renew the glorious tradition of the khalifate which after the first thirty year be drag into the general deterioration common to all human thing the prophecy concern he appearance be sometimes of a equally supernatural kind as those of the shîites so that the period of he come have pass more and more from the political sphere to which it originally belong into that of eschatology yet naturally it be easier for a popular leader to make himself regard as the orthodox mahdî than to play the part of the return _ imâm _ mohammedan ruler have have more trouble than they care for with candidate for the dignity of the mahdî and it be not surprising that in official turkish circle there be a tendency to simplify the messianic expectation by give the fullest weight to this traditional saying of mohammed there be no mahdî but jesus see that jesus must come from the cloud whereas other mahdîs may arise from human society in the orthodox expectation of the mahdus the moslim theory have most sharply express its condemnation of the later political history of islâm in the course of the first century after the hijrah the qorân scholar -lrb- _ gârîs _ -rrb- arise and these in turn be succeed by the man of tradition -lrb- _ ahl al-hadîth _ -rrb- and by the canonist -lrb- _ faqîhs _ -rrb- of later time these learn man -lrb- _ ulamâ ' _ -rrb- would not endure any interference with they right to state with authority what islâm demand of its leader they lay claim to a interpretative authority concern the divine law which border upon supreme legislative power they agreement -lrb- ijmâ ' -rrb- be that of the infallible community but just as beside this legislative agreement a dogmatic and a mystic agreement grow up in the same way there be a separate ijmâ ' regard the political government upon which the canonist could exercise only a indirect influence in other word since the accession of the omayyad khalîfs the actual authority rest in the hand of dynasty and under the abbasid government assume even a despotic character this relation between the governor and govern originally alien to islâm be not change by the transference of the actual power into the hand of _ wezîrs _ and officer of the bodyguard nor yet by the disintegration of the empire into a number of small despotism the investiture of which by the khalîf become a mere formality dynastic and political question be settle in a comparatively small circle by court intrigue stratagem and force and the canonist like the people be bind to accept the result politically inclined interpreter of the law might try to justify they compulsory assent to the fact by theory about the ijmâ ' of the notable reside in the capital who take the urgent decision about the succession which decision be subsequently confirm by general homage to the new prince but they have no illusion about the real influence of the community upon the choice of its leader the most independent scholar make no attempt to disguise the fact that the course which political affair have take be the clearest proof of the moral degeneration which have set in and they pronounce a equally bold and merciless criticism upon the government in all its department it become a matter of course that a pious scholar must keep himself free from all intercourse with state official on pain of lose he reputation the bridge across the gulf that separate the spiritual from the temporal authority be form by those state official who for the practice of they office need a knowledge of the divine law especially the _ qâdhîs _ it be originally the duty of these judge to decide all legal difference between mohammedan or man of other creed under mohammedan protection who call for they decision the actual division between the ruler and the interpreter of the law cause a ever-increasing limitation of the authority of the _ qâdhîs _ the law of marriage family and inheritance remain however they inalienable territory and a number of other matter in which too great a religious interest be involve to leave they to the caprice of the governor or to the customary law outside islâm be usually include but as the _ qâdhîs _ be appoint by the governor they be oblige in the exercise of they office to give due consideration to the wish of they constituent and moreover they be often taint by what be regard in mohammedan country as inseparable from government employment : bribery on this account the canonist although it be from they rank that the official of the _ qâdhî _ court be to be draw consider no word too strong to express they contempt for the office of _ qâdhî _ in handbook of the law of all time the _ qâdhîs of we time _ be represent as unscrupulous being whose unreliable judgment be chiefly dictate by they greed such a opinion would not have acquire full force if it have not be ascribe to mohamm in fact the prophet accord to a tradition have say that out of three _ qâdhîs _ two be destine to hell anecdote of famous scholar who could not be prevail upon by imprisonment or castigation to accept the office of _ qâdhîs _ be innumerable those who succumb to the temptation forfeit the respect of the circle to which they have belong i once witness a case of this kind and the former friend of the _ qâdhî _ do not spare he they bitter reproach he remark that the judge whose duty it be to maintain the divine law verily hold a noble office they refute this by say that this defense be admissible only for earlier and better time but not for the _ qâdhîs _ of we time to which he cuttingly reply and ye be ye canonist of the better the ancient time in truth the student of sacred science be just as much of we time as the _ qâdhîs _ even in the eleventh century the great theologian ghazâlî count they all equal -lrb- 1 -rrb- not a few of they give they authoritative advice accord to the wish of the highest bidder or of he who have the greatest influence hustle for income from pious institution and vie with each other in a revel of casuistic subtlety but among those scholar there be and always have be some who in poverty and simplicity devote they life to the study of allah 's law with the sole object of please he among the _ qâdhîs _ such be not easily to be find amongst the other state official the title of _ qâdhî _ may count as a spiritual one and the public may to a certain extent share this reverence but in the eye of the pious and of the canonist such glory be only reflect from the clerical robe in which the worldle disguise himself -lrb- footnote 1 : ghazâlî _ ihya _ book i ch 6 quote the word of a pious scholar of the olden time : the ` ulamâ ' will -lrb- on the day of judgment -rrb- be gather amongst the prophet but the _ qâdhîs _ amongst the temporal ruler ghazâli add alike with these _ qâdhîs _ be all those canonist who make use of they learning for worldly purpose -rrb- to the _ muftî _ criticism be somewhat more favourable than to the _ qâdhî _ a muftî be not necessarily a official every canonist who at the request of a layman expound to he the meaning of the law on any particular point and give a _ fatwa _ act as a _ muftî _ be the question in reference to the behavior of the individual towards god or towards man with regard to he position in a matter of litigation in criticism of a state regulation or of a sentence of a judge or out of pure love of knowledge the scholar be morally oblige to the best of he knowledge to enlighten the enquirer he ought to do this for the love of god but he must live and the enquirer be expect to give he a suitable present for he trouble this again give rise to the danger that he who offer most be attend to first and that for the liberal rich man a dish be prepare from the casuistic store as far as possible accord to he taste the temptation be by no means so great as that to which the _ qâdhî _ be expose especially since the office of judge have become a article of commerce so that the very first step towards the possession of it be in the direction of hell moreover in these degenerate time -- which have exist for about ten century -- the acceptance of a appointment to the function of _ qâdhî _ be not regard as a duty while a competent scholar may only refuse to give a _ fatwa _ under exceptional circumstance still a unusually strong character be need by the _ muftî _ if he be not to fall into the snare of the world besides _ qâdhîs _ who settle legal dispute of a certain kind accord to the reveal law the state require its own adviser who can explain that law ie official _ muftîs _ firstly the government itself may be involve in a litigation moreover in some government regulation it may be necessary to avoid give offence to canonist and they strict disciple in such case it be better to be arm beforehand with a expert opinion than to be expose to dangerous criticism which might find a echo in a wide circle the official _ muftî _ must therefore be somewhat pliable to say the least moreover any private person have the right to put question to the state _ muftî _ and the _ qâdhî _ court be bind to take he answer into account in its decision in this way the _ muftîs _ have absorb a part of the duty of the _ qâdhîs _ and so they office be drag along in the degradation that the unofficial canonist denounce unweariedly in they writings and in they teaching the way in which the most important _ muftî _ place be fill and above all the position which the head - _ muftî _ of the turkish empire the sheikh-ul-islâm hold at any particular period may well serve as a touchstone of the influence of the canonist on public life if this be great then even the most powerful sultan have only the possibility of choice between a few great scholar put forward or at all event not disapprove of by they own guild strengthen by public opinion if on the other hand there be no keen interest feel in the sharî ` ah -lrb- divine law -rrb- then the temporal ruler can do pretty much what they like with these representative of the canon law under the tyrannical sway of sultan abd-ul-hamid the sheikh-ul-islâm be little more than a tool for he and he palace clique and for they own reason the member of the committee of union and progress who rule at constantinople since 1908 make no change in this : each new ministry have its own sheikh-ul-islâm who have to be above everything a faithful upholder of the constitutional theory hold by the committee the time be past when the sultan and the porte in frame even the most pressing reform must first anxiously assure themselves of the position that the _ hoja tolbas softa _ the theologian in a word would take towards it and of the influence that the sheikh-ul-islâm could use in opposition to they plan the political authority make its deference to the canonist dependent upon they strict obedience this important change be a natural consequence of the modernization of mohammedan political life a movement through which the expounder of a law which have endeavor to remain stationary since the year 1000 must necessarily get into strait this explain also why the religious life of mohammedan be in some respects freer in country under non-mohammedan authority than under a mohammedan government under english dutch or french rule the ` ulamâs be less interfere with in they teaching the _ muftîs _ in they recommendation and the _ qâdhîs _ in they judgment of question of marriage and inheritance than in turkey where the life of islâm as state religion lie under official control in indirectly govern native state the relation of mohammedan church and state may much more resemble that in turkey and this be sometimes to the advantage of the sovereign ruler under the direct government of a modern state the mohammedan group be treat as a religious community whose particular life have just the same claim to independence as that of other denomination the only justifiable limitation be that the program of the forcible reduction of the world to mohammedan authority be keep within the scholastic wall as a point of eschatology and not consider as a body of prescription the execution of which must be prepare the extensive political program of islâm develop during the first century of astounding expansion have yet not prevent million of mohammedan from resign themselves to reversed condition in which at the present time many more mohammedan live under foreign authority than under they own the acceptance of this change be facilitate by the historical pessimism of islâm which make the mind prepare for every sort of decay and by the true moslim habit of resignation to painful experience not through fatalism but through reverence for allah 's inscrutable will at the same time it would be a gross mistake to imagine that the idea of universal conquest may be consider as obliterated this be the case with the intellectual and with many practical commercial or industrial man but the canonist and the vulgar still live in the illusion of the day of islâm 's greatness the legist continue to grind they appreciation of every actual political condition on the law of the holy war which war ought never to be allow to cease entirely until all mankind be reduce to the authority of islâm -- the heathen by conversion the adherent of acknowledged scripture by submission even if they admit the improbability of this at present they be comfort and encourage by the recollection of the lengthy period of humiliation that the prophet himself have to suffer before allah bestow victory upon he arm and they fervently join with the Friday preacher when he pronounce the prayer take from the qorân : and lay not on we o we lord that for which we have not strength but blot out we sin and forgive we and have pity upon we thou art we master grant we then to conquer the unbeliever and the common people be willingly teach by the canonist and feed they hope of better day upon the innumerable legend of the olden time and the equally innumerable apocalyptic prophecy about the future the political blow that fall upon islâm make less impression upon they simple mind than the senseless story about the power of the sultan of stambul that would instantly be reveal if he be not surround by treacherous servant and the fantastic tiding of the miracle that allah work in the holy city of arabium which be inaccessible to the unfaithful the conception of the khalifate still exercise a fascinating influence regard in the light of a central point of union against the unfaithful apart from the _ ' âmils _ mohamm 's agent amongst the arabian tribe the khalifate be the only political institution which arise out of the necessity of the moslim community without foreign influence it rescue islâm from threaten destruction and it lead the faithful to conquest no wonder that in historic legend the first four occupier of that leadership who from medina accomplish such great thing have be glorified into saint and be hold up to all the follow generation as example to put they to shame in the omayyad the ancient aristocracy of mecca come to the helm and under they the mohammedan state be above all as wellhausen style it the arabian empire the best khalîfs of this house have the political wisdom to give the governor of the province sufficient independence to prevent schism and to secure to themselves the authority in important matter the reaction of the non-arabian convert against the suppression of they own culture by the arabian conqueror find support in the opposition party above all with the shî ` ah the abbasid cleverer politician than the notoriously unskillful alid make use of the alid propaganda to secure the booty to themselves at the right moment the means which serve the alid for the establishment only of a invisible dynasty of prince who die as martyr enable the descendant of mohammed 's uncle abba to overthrow the omayyad and to find they own khalifate at bagdad shine with the brilliance of a eastern despotism when it be say that the abbasid khalifate maintain itself from 750 till the mongol storm in the middle of the thirteenth century that only refer to external appearance after a brief success the actual power of these khalîfs be transfer to the hand first of the captain of they bodyguard then of sultan-dynasty whose forcibly acquire power be legalize by a formal investiture in the same way the large province develop into independent kingdom whose ruler consider the nomination-diploma from bagdad in the light of mere ornament compare to this irreparable disintegration of the empire temporary schism such as the omayyad khalifate in spain the fatimid khalifate in egypt and here and there a independent organization of the khârijites be of little significance it seem strange that the moslim people although the theory of islâm never attribute a hereditary character to the khalifate attach so high a value to the abbasid name that they continue unanimously to acknowledge the khalifate of bagdad for century during which it possess no influence but the idea of hereditary ruler be deeply root in most of the people convert to islâm and the glorious period of the first abbasid so strongly impressed itself on the mind of the vulgar that the _ appearance _ of continuation be easily take for _ reality _ its voidness would sooner have be realize if lack of energy have not prevent the later abbasid from try to recover the lose power by the sword or if amongst they rival who could also boast of a popular tradition -- eg the omayyad or still more the alid -- a political genius have succeed in form a powerful opposition but the sultan who rule the various state do not want to place all that they possess in the balance on the chance of gain the title of khalîf the moslim world become accustomed to the idea that the honor house of the prophet 's uncle abba exist for the purpose of lend a additional glory to mohammedan prince by a diploma even after the destruction of bagdad by the mongol in 1258 from which only a few abbasid escape alive indian prince continue to value visit or deed of appointment grant they by some beg descendant of the glorious house the sultan of egypt secure this luxury permanently for themselves by take a branch of the family under they protection who give the glamour of they approval to every new result of the never-ending quarrel of succession until in the beginning of the sixteenth century egypt together with so many other land be swallow up by the turkish conqueror these new ruler who add the byzantine empire to islâm who with egypt bring southern and western arabium with the holy city also under they authority and cause all the neighbouring prince moslim and christian alike to tremble on they throne think it be time to abolish the senseless survival of the abbasid glory the prestige of the ottoman be as great as that of the khalifate in its most palmy day have be and they would not be withhold from the assumption of the title there be a doubtful tale of the abdication of the abbasid in they favor but the question be of no importance the ottoman owe they khalifate to they sword and this be the only argument use by such canonist as think it worth they while to bring such a incontestable fact into reconciliation with the law this be not strictly necessary as they have be accustom for eight century to acquiesce in all sort of unlawful act which history demonstrate to be the will of allah the sense of the tradition that establish descent from the tribe of qoraish as necessary for the highest dignity in the community be capable of be weaken by explanation and even without that the leadership of the irresistible ottoman be of more value to islâm than the chimerical authority of a powerless qoraishite in we own time you can hear qoraishite and even alid warmly defend the claim of the turkish sultan to the khalifate as they regard these as the only moslim prince capable of champion the threaten rights of islâm even the sultan of stambul could not think of restore the authority of the khalîf over the whole mohammedan world this be prevent not only by the schismatic kingdom khalifate or imâmates like shî ` itic persium which be consolidated just in the sixteenth century by the unceasing opposition of the imâms of yeman and khârijite principality at the extremity of the mohammedan world besides these there be numerous prince in central asia in indium and in central africa whom either the khalifate have always be oblige to leave to themselves or who have become so estrange from it that unless they feel the power of the turkish arm they prefer to remain as they be moreover islâm have extend itself not only by political means but also by trade and colonization into country even the existence of which be hardly know in the political centre of islâm eg into central africa or the far east of asia without thinking of rival the abbasid or they successor some of the prince of such remote kingdom eg the sherîfs of morocco assume the title of commander of the faithful bestow upon they by they flatterer today there be petty prince in east indium under dutch sovereignty who decorate themselves with the title of khalîf without suspect that they be thereby guilty of a sort of arrogant blasphemy such exaggeration be not support by the canonist but these have devise a theory which give a foundation to the authority of mohammedan prince who never have a real or fictitious connection with a real or fictitious khalifate authority there must be everywhere and under all circumstance far from the center this should be exercise accord to they by the one who have be able to gain it and who know how to hold it and all the duty be lay upon he which in a normal condition would be discharge by the khalîf or he representative for this kind of authority the legist have even invent a special name : _ shaukah _ which mean actual influence the authority which have spontaneously arise in default of a chief who in one form or another can be consider as a mandatary of the khalifate now it be significant that many of those mohammedan governor who owe they existence to wild growth in this way seek especially in we day for connection with the khalifate or at least wish to be regard as naturally connect with the center the same be true of such whose former independence or adhesion to the turkish empire have be replace by the sovereignty of a western state even amongst the moslim people place under the direct government of european state a tendency prevail to be consider in some way or another subject of the sultan-khalîf some scholar explain this phenomenon by the spiritual character which the dignity of khalîf be suppose to have acquire under the later abbasid and retain since that time until the ottoman prince combine it again with the temporal dignity of sultan accord to this view the later abbasid be a sort of pope of islâm while the temporal authority in the central district as well as in the subordinate kingdom be in the hand of various sultan the sultan of constantinople govern then under this name as much territory as the political vicissitude allow they to govern -- _ ie _ the turkish empire as khalîfs they be the spiritual head of the whole of sunnite islâm though this view through the ignorance of european statesman and diplomatist may have find acceptance even by some of the great power it be nevertheless entirely untrue unless by spiritual authority we be to understand the empty appearance of worldly authority this appearance be all that the later abbasid retain after the loss of they temporal power spiritual authority of any kind they never possess the spiritual authority in catholic islâm repose in the legist who in this respect be call in a tradition the _ heir of the prophet _ since they could no longer regard the khalîfs as they leader because they walk in worldly way they have constitute themselves independently beside and even above they and the ruler have be oblige to conclude a silent contract with they each party binding itself to remain within its own limit -lrb- 1 -rrb- if this contract be observe the legist not only be ready to acknowledge the bad ruler of the world but even to preach loyalty towards they to the laity the most supremely popular part of the ideal of islâm the reduction of the whole world to moslim authority can only be attempt by a political power notwithstanding the destructive criticism of all moslim prince and state official by the canonist it be only from they that they could expect measure to uphold and extend the power of islâm and on this account they continually cherish the ideal of the khalifate -lrb- footnote 1 : that the khalifate be in no way to be compare with the papacy that islâm have never regard the khalif as its spiritual head i have repeatedly explain since 1882 -lrb- in nieuwe bijdragen tot de kennis van den islam in _ bijdr tot de taal landen volkenkunde van nederl indië _ volgr 4 deel vi in a article de islam in _ de gids _ may 1886 in _ question diplomatique et coloniales _ 5me année no 106 etc -rrb- i be pleased to find the same view express by prof m hartmann in _ die welt des islams _ bd i pp 147-8 -rrb- in the first century it be the duty of mohammedan who have become isolate and who have for instance be conquer by unbeliever to do _ hijrah ie _ emigration for allah 's sake as the convert arab have do in mohammed 's time by emigrate to medina to strengthen the rank of the faithful this soon become impracticable so that the legist relax the prescription by concession to the force of necessity resignation be thus permit even recommend but the submission to non-musulman be always to be regard as temporary and abnormal although the _ parte infidelium _ have grow larger and larger the eye must be keep fix upon the center the khalifate where every movement towards improvement must begin a western state that admit any authority of a khalîf over its mohammedan subject thus acknowledge _ not _ the authority of a pope of the moslim church but in simple ignorance be feed political program which however vain always have the power of stir mohammedan mass to confusion and excitement of late year mohammedan statesman in they intercourse with they western colleague be glad to take the latter 's point of view and in discussion accept the comparison of the khalifate with the papacy because they be aware that only in this form the khalifate can be make acceptable to power who have mohammedan subject but for these subject the khalif be then they true prince who be temporarily hinder in the exercise of he government but whose right be acknowledge even by they unbelieving master in yet another respect the canonist need the aid of the temporal ruler a alert police be count by they amongst the indispensable means of secure purity of doctrine and life they count it to the credit of prince and governor that they enforce by violent measure seclusion and veiling of the woman abstinence from drinking and that they punish by flog the negligent with regard to fasting or attend public worship the political decay of islâm the increase number of mohammedan under foreign rule appear to they therefore doubly dangerous as they have little faith in the proof of islam 's spiritual goods against life in a freedom which to they mean license they find that every political change in these terrible time be to the prejudice of islâm one moslim people after another lose its independent existence and they regard it as equally dangerous that moslim prince be induce to accommodate they policy and government to new international idea of individual freedom which threaten the very life of islâm they see the antagonism to all foreign idea formerly consider as a virtue by every true moslim daily lose ground and they be fill with consternation by observe in they own rank the contamination of modernist idea the brilliant development of the system of islâm follow the establishment of its material power so the rapid decline of that political power which we be witness make the question urgent whether islâm have a spiritual essence able to survive the fall of such a material support it be certainly not the canonist who will detect the kernel verily we be god 's and verily to he do we return they cry in helpless amazement and they consolation be in the old prayer : and lay not on we o we lord that for which we have no strength but blot out we sin and forgive we and have mercy upon we thou art we master grant we then to conquer the unbeliever iv islâm and modern think one of the most powerful factor of religious life in its higher form be the need of man to find in this world of change thing a imperishable essence to separate the eternal from the temporal and then to attach himself to the former where the possibility of this operation be despair of there may arise a pessimism which find no path of liberation from the painful vicissitude of life other than the annihilation of individuality a firm belief in a sphere of life free from the category of time together with the conviction that the poetic image of that superior world current among mankind be image and nothing else be likely to give rise to definition of the absolute by purely negative attribute and to mental effort have for they object the absorption of individual existence in the indescribable infinite generally speak a high development of intellectual life especially a intimate acquaintance with different religious system be not favourable to the continuance of elaborate conception of thing eternal it will rather increase the tendency to deprive the idea of the transcendent of all color and definiteness the naïve idea concern the other world in the clear-cut form outline for they by previous generation be most likely to remain unchanged in a religious community where intellectual intercourse be chiefly limit to that between member of the community there the belief be foster that thing most appreciate and cherish in this fading world by mankind will have a enduring existence in a world to come and that the best of the change phenomenon of life be eternal and will continue free from that change which be the principal cause of human misery material death will be follow by awaken to a purer life the idealized continuation of life on earth and for this reason already during this life the faithful will find they delight in those thing which they know to be everlasting the less faith be submit to the control of intellect the more numerous the object will be to which durable value be attribute this be true for different individual as well as for one religious community as compare to another there be christian attach only to the spirit of the gospel mohammedan attach only to the spirit of the qorân other give a place in they world of imperishable thing to a particular translation of the bible in its old-fashioned orthography or to a write qorân in preference to a print one orthodox judaism and orthodox islâm have mark with the stamp of eternity code of law whose influence have work as a impediment to the life of the adherent of those religion and to the free intercourse of other people with they as well so the roman catholic and many protestant church have in they organization and in they dogmatic system eternalize institution and idea whose unchangeableness have come to retard spiritual progress among all conservative factor of human life religion must necessarily be the most conservative be it only because its aim be precisely to store up and keep under its guardianship the treasure destine for eternity to which we have allude now every new period in the history of civilization oblige a religious community to undertake a general revision of the contents of its treasury it be unavoidable that the guardian on such occasion should be in a certain measure disappoint for they find that some of the goods under they care have give way to the waste influence of time whilst other be in a state which give rise to serious doubt as to they right of be classify with lasting treasure in reality the loss be only a apparent one far from impoverish the community it enhance the solidity of its possession what remains after the sift process may be less impose to the inexperienced mind gradually the consideration gain ground that what have be reject be nothing but useless rubbish which have be wrongly value sometimes it may happen that the general movement of spiritual progress go almost too fast so that one revision of the store of religion be immediately follow by another then dissension be likely to arise among the adherent of a religion some of they come to the conclusion that there must be a end of sift and think it better to lock up the treasury once for all and to stop the dangerous enquiry whereas other begin to entertain doubt concern the value even of such goods as do not yet show any trace of decay the treasury of islâm be excessively full of rubbish that have become entirely useless and for nine or ten century they have not be submit to a revision deserving that name if we wish to understand the whole or any important part of the system of islâm we must always begin by transport ourselves into the third or fourth century of the hijrah and we must constantly bear in mind that from the medina period downward islâm have always be consider by its adherent as bind to regulate all the detail of they life by means of prescription emanate directly or indirectly from god and therefore incapable of be reform at the time when these prescription acquire they definite form islâm rule a important portion of the world it consider the conquest of the rest as be only a question of time and therefore feel itself quite independent in the development of its law there be little reason indeed for the moslim canonist to take into serious account the interest of man not subject to mohammedan authority or to care for the opinion of devotee of other religion islâm might act and do almost act as if it be the only power in the world it do so in the way of a grand seigneur show a great amount of generosity towards its subjugated enemy the adherent of other religion be or would become subject of the commander of the faithful those subject be give a full claim on mohammedan protection and justice while the independent unbeliever be in general to be treat as enemy until in submission they spiritual life deserve not even so much attention as that of islâm receive from abbé maraccus or doctor prideaux the false doctrine of other people be of no interest whatever in themselves and since there be no fear of mohammedan be taint by they polemic against the abrogate religion be more of a pastime than a indispensable part of theology the mohammedan community be in a sense allah 's army with the conquest of the world as its object apostasy deserve the punishment of death in no lesser degree than desertion in the holy war nay more so for the latter might be the effect of cowardice whereas the former be a act of inexcusable treachery in the attitude of islâm towards other religion there be hardly one feature that have not its counterpart in the practice of christian state during the middle age the great difference be that the mohammedan community erect this medieval custom into a system unalterable like all prescription base on its infallible agreement -lrb- ijmâ ' -rrb- here lay the great difficulty when the nineteenth and twentieth century place the moslim world face to face with a civilization that have spring up outside its border and without its collaboration that be from a spiritual point of view by far its superior and at the same time possess of sufficient material power to thrust the mohammedan aside wherever they seem to be a impediment in its way a long series of the most painful experience mean as many encroachment upon the political independence of mohammedan territory end by teach islâm that it have definitely to change its line of conduct the time be go when relation with the non-musulman world quite different from those foresee by the mediaeval theory might be consider as exception to the rule as temporary concession to transitory necessity in ever wider circle a thorough revision of the system come to be consider as a requirement of the time the fact that the number of mohammedan subject to foreign rule increase enormously and by far surpass those of the citizen of independent mohammedan state make the problem almost as interesting to western nation as to the mohammedan themselves both party be almost equally concern in the question whether a way will be find to associate the moslim world to modern civilization without oblige it to empty its spiritual treasury altogether nobody can in earnest advocate the idea of leave the solution of the problem to rude force the moslim of yore go through the world with the qorân in one hand the sword in the other give unbeliever the choice between conversion or death be a creation of legendary fancy we can but hope that modern civilization will not be so fanatical against moslim as the latter be unjustly say to have be during the period of they power if the modern world be only to offer the mohammedan the choice between give up at once the tradition of they ancestor or be treat as barbarian there would be sure to ensue a struggle as bloody as have ever be witness in the world it be worth while indeed to examine the system of islâm from this special point of view and to try to find the term on which a durable _ modus vivendus _ might be establish between islâm and modern think the purely dogmatic part be not of great importance some of we may admire the tenet of the mohammedan doctrine other may as heartily despise they to the participation of mohammedan in the civilized life of we day they be as innoxious as any other mediaeval dogmatic system that count its million of adherent among ourselves the detail of mohammedan dogmatic have long cease to interest other circle than those of professional theologian the chief point arouse no discussion and the deviation in popular superstition as well as in philosophical thought which in practice meet with toleration be almost unlimited the mohammedan hell claim the soul of all heterodox people it be true but this do not prevent benevolent intercourse in this world and more enlighten moslim be incline to enlarge they definition of the word faithful so as to include they non-mohammedan friend the faith in a mahdî who will come to regenerate the world be apt to give rise to revolutionary movement lead by skilful demagogue pretend to act as the guide one or at least to prepare the way for he come most of the european power have mohammedan subject have have they disagreeable experience in this respect but moslim chief of state have they obvious good reason for not like such movement either and even the majority of ordinary moslim look upon candidate for mahdi-ship with suspicion a contented prosperous population offer such candidate little chance of success the ritual law of islâm be a heavy burden to those who strictly observe they a man who have to perform worship five time a day in a state of ritual purity and during a whole month in a year have to abstain from food and drink and other enjoyment from daybreak until sunset be at a disadvantage when he have to enter into competition with non-musulman for get work of any kind but since most of the moslim have become subject of foreign power and religious police have be practically abolish in mohammedan state there be no external compulsion the ever smaller minority of strict practiser make use of a right which nobody can contest drinking wine or other intoxicating drink take interest on money gambling -- include even insurance contract accord to the stricter interpretation -- be thing which a moslim may abstain from without hinder non-mohammedans or which in we day he may do notwithstanding the prohibition of divine law even without lose he good name those who want to accentuate the antithesis between islâm and modern civilization point rightly to the personal law here be indeed a great stumbling-block the allowance of polygamy up to a maximum of four wife be represent by mohammedan author as a progress if compare with the irregularity of pagan arabium and even with the acknowledgment of unlimited polygamy during certain period of biblical history the follow subtle argument be to be find in some schoolbook on mohammedan law : the law of mose be exceedingly benevolent to male by permit they to have a unlimited number of wife then come the law of jesus extreme on the other side by prescribe monogamy at last mohammed restore the equilibrium by concede one wife to each of the four humor which make up the male 's constitution this theory which leave the question what the woman be to do with three of she four humor undecided will hardly find fervent advocate among the present canonist at the same time very few of they would venture to pronounce they preference for monogamy in a general way polygamy form a part of the law that be to prevail accord to the infallible agreement of the community until the day of resurrection on the other side polygamy although _ allow _ be far from be _ recommend _ by the majority of theologian many of they even dissuade man capable of master they passion from marriage in general and censure a man who take two wife if he can live honestly with one in some mohammedan country social circumstance enforce practical monogamy the whole question lie in the education of woman when this have be raise to a higher level polygamy will necessarily come to a end it be therefore most satisfactory that among male mohammedan the persuasion of the necessity of a solid education for girl be daily gain ground this year -lrb- 1913 -rrb- a young egyptian take he doctor 's degree at the pari university by sustain a dissertation on the position of woman in the moslim world in which he tell he co-religionist the full truth concern this rather delicate subject -lrb- 1 -rrb- if social evolution take the right course the practice of polygamy will be abolish and the maintenance of its lawfulness in canonical work will mainly be a survival of a bygone phase of development -lrb- footnote 1 : mansor fahmy _ la condition de la femme dans la tradition et l'évolution de l'islamisme _ paris félix alcan 1913 the sometimes imprudent form in which the young reformer enounced he idea cause he to be very badly treat by he compatriot at he return from europe -rrb- the facility with which a man can divorce he wife at he pleasure contrast with she rights against he be a still more serious impediment to the development of family life than the institution of polygamy more serious also than veil and seclusion of woman where the general opinion be favourable to the improvement of the position of woman in society there be always find a way to secure it to they without conflict with the divine law but a radical reform will remain most difficult so long as that law which allow the man to repudiate he wife without any reason whereas it deliver the woman almost unarmed into the power of she husband be consider to be one of the permanent treasure of islâm it be a pity indeed that thus far woman vigorously strive for liberation from those mediaeval institution be rare exception in mohammedan country be mohammedan woman capable of the violent tactic of suffragette they would rather try to blow up the house of feminist than those of the patron of the old régime the ordinary mohammedan woman look upon the endeavor of she husband to induce she to partake freely in public life as a want of consideration it make on she about the same impression as that which a respectable woman in we society would receive from she husband encourage she to visit place generally frequent by people of bad reputation it be the girl ' school that will awaken those sleep one and so slowly and gradually prepare a better future when the moslim woman will be the worthy companion of she husband and the intelligent educator of she child this will be due then neither to the prophet 's sunnah nor to the infallible agreement of the community of the first century of islâm but to the irresistible power of the evolution of human society which be merciless to law even of divine origin and transfer they when they time be come from the treasury of everlasting goods to a museum of antiquity slavery and in its consequence free intercourse of a man with he own female slave without any limitation as to they number have also be incorporate into the sacred law and therefore have be place on the wrong side of the border that be to divide eternal thing from temporal one this should not be call a mediaeval institution the most civilized nation not have give it up before the middle of the nineteenth century the law of islâm regulate the position of slave with much equity and there be a great body of testimony from people who have spend a part of they life among mohammedan nation which do justice to the benevolent treatment which bondmen generally receive from they master there besides that we be bind to state that in many western country or country under western domination whole group of the population live under circumstance with which those of mohammedan slavery may be compare to advantage the only legal cause of slavery in islâm be prisonership of war or birth from slave parent the captivity of enemy of islâm have not at all necessarily the effect of enslave they for the competent authority may dispose of they in any other way also in the way prescribe by modern international law or custom in proportion to the realization of the political ideal of islâm the number of its enemy must diminish and the possibility of enslave man must consequently decrease set slave free be one of the most meritorious pious work and at the same time the regular atonement for certain transgression of the sacred law so accord to mohammedan principle slavery be a institution destine to disappear when in the last century mohammedan prince sign international treaty for the suppression of slavery from they point of view this be a premature anticipation of a future political and social development -- a step which they feel oblige to take out of consideration for the great power in arabium every effort of the turkish government to put such international agreement into execution have thus far give rise to popular sedition against the ottoman authority therefore the promulgation of decree of abolition be stop and slavery continue to exist the import of slave from africa have in fact considerably diminish but i be not quite sure of the proportional increase of the liberty which the native of that continent enjoy at home slavery as well as polygamy be in a certain sense to mohammedan a sacred institution be incorporate in they holy law but the practice of neither of the two institution be indispensable to the integrity of islâm all those antiquated institution if consider from the point of view of modern international intercourse be only a trifle in comparison with the legal prescription of islâm concern the attitude of the mohammedan community against the part of the world not yet subject to its authority the abode of war as they be technically call it be a principal duty of the khalif or of the chief consider as he substitute in different country to avail themselves of every opportunity to extend by force the dominion of allah and he messenger with unsubdued unbeliever _ peace _ be not _ allow _ a _ truce _ for a period not exceed ten year may be conclude if the interest of islâm require it the chapter of the mohammedan law on holy war and on the condition on which the submission of the adherent of tolerate religion be to be accept seem to be a foolish pretension if we consider they by the light of the actual division of political power in the world but here too to understand be better than to ridicule in the century in which the system of islâm acquire its maturity such a aspiration after universal dominion be not at all ridiculous and many christian state of the time be far from reach the mohammedan standard of tolerance against heterodox creed the delicate point be this that the petrification or at least the process of stiffen that have attack the whole spiritual life of islâm since about 1000 ad make its accommodation to the requirement of modern intercourse a most difficult problem but it be not only the mohammedan community that need misfortune and humiliation before it be able to appreciate liberty of conscience or that take a long time to digest those painful lesson of history there be still christian church which accept religious liberty only in circumstance that make supreme authority unattainable to they and which elsewhere would not disdain the use of material mean to subdue spirit to what they consider the absolute truth to judge such thing with equity we must remember that every man possess of a firm conviction of any kind be more or less a missionary and the belief in the possibility of win soul by violence have many adherent everywhere one of my friend among the young-turkish state official who wish to persuade I of the perfect religious tolerance of turkey of today conclude he argument by the follow reflection : formerly man use to behead each other for difference of opinion about the hereafter nowadays praise be to allah we be permit to believe what we like but people continue to kill each other for political or social dissension that be most pitiful indeed for the weapon in use be more terrible and more costly than before mankind lack the peace necessary to enjoy the liberty of conscience it have acquire the truthful irony of these word need not prevent we from consider the independence of spiritual life and the liberation of its development from material compulsion as one of the greatest blessing of we civilization we feel urge by missionary zeal of the better kind to make the mohammedan world partake in its enjoyment in the turkish empire in egypt in many mohammedan country under western control the progressive element of moslim society spontaneously meet we half-way but behind they be the million who firmly adhere to the old superstition and be support by the canonist those faithful guardian of what the infallible community declare almost one thousand year ago to be the doctrine and rule of life for all century to come will it ever prove possible to move in one direction a body compose of such different element or will this body be tear in piece when the movement have become irresistible we have more than once pointed to the catholic character of orthodox islâm in fact the diversity of spiritual tendency be not less in the moslim world than within the sphere of christian influence but in islâm apart from the political schism of the first century that diversity have not give rise to anything like the division of christianity into sect there be a prophetic say relate by tradition which later generation have generally misunderstand to mean that the mohammedan community would be split into seventy-three different sect moslim heresiologist have be induce by this prediction to fill up they list of seventy-three number with all sort of name many of which represent nothing but individual opinion of more or less famous scholar on subordinate point of doctrine or law almost ninety-five per cent of all mohammedan be indeed bind together by a spiritual unity that may be compare with that of the roman catholic church within whose wall there be also room for religious and intellectual life of very different origin and tendency in the sense of broadness islâm have this advantage that there be no generally recognize palpable authority able to stop now and then the progress of modernism or similar deviation from the trodden path with a imperative halt there be no lack indeed of mutual accusation of heresy but this remain without serious consequence because of the absence of a high ecclesiastical council competent to decide once for all the political authority who might be induce by fanatical theologian to settle dispute by violent inquisitorial means have be prevent for a long time from such interference by more press affair a knowledge alone of the orthodox system of islâm however complete would give we a even more inadequate idea of the actual world of catholic islâm than the notion we should acquire of the spiritual current move the roman catholic world by merely study the dogma and the canonical law of the church of rome nevertheless the unity of islamic thought be by no mean a word void of sense the idea of mohammedan philosopher borrow for a great part from neoplatonism the pantheism and the emanation theory of mohammedan mystic be certainly still further distant from the simplicity of qorânic religion than the orthodox dogmatic but all those conception alike show indubitable mark of have grow up on mohammedan soil in the work even of those mystic who efface the limit between thing human and divine who put judaism christianity and paganism on the same line with the revelation of mohammed and who be therefore duly anathematize by the whole orthodox world almost every page testify to the relation of the idea enounce with mohammedan civilization most of the treatise on science art or law write by egyptian student for they doctor 's degree at european university make no exception to this rule the manner in which these author conceive the problem and strive for they solution be in a certain sense in the broadest sense of course mohammedan thus if we speak of mohammedan think civilization spirit we have to bear in mind the great importance of the system which almost unchanged have be deliver for about one thousand year by one generation of doctor of islâm to the other although it have become ever more unfit to meet the need of the community on whose infallible agreement it rest but at the same time we ought to consider that beside the agreement of canonist of dogmatist and of mystic there be a dozen more agreement social political popular philosophical and so on and that however great may be the influence of the doctor who pretend to monopolize infallibility for the opinion on which they agree the real agreement of islâm be the least common measure of all the agreement of the group which make up the community it would require a large volume to review the principal current of thought pervade the moslim world in we day but a general notion may be acquire by a rapid glance at two centre geographically not far distant from each other but situate at the opposite pole of spiritual life : mecca and cairo in mecca yearly two or three hundred thousand moslim from all part of the world come together to celebrate the hajj that curious set of ceremony of pagan arabian origin which mohamm have incorporate into he religion a durable survival that in islâm make a impression as singular as that of jump procession in christianity mohamm never could have foresee that the consequence of he concession to deeply rooted arabic custom would be that in future century chinese malay indian tatar turk egyptian berber and negro would meet on this barren desert soil and carry home profound impression of the international significance of islâm still more important be the fact that from all those country young people settle here for year to devote themselves to the study of the sacred science from the second to the tenth month of the mohammedan lunar year the haram _ ie _ the mosque which be a open place with the ka ` bah in its midst and surround by large roof gallery have free room enough between the hour of public service to allow of a dozen or more circle of student sit down around they professor to listen to as many lecture on different subject generally deliver in a very loud voice arabic grammar and style prosody logic and other preparatory branch the sacred trivium canonic law dogmatic and mysticism and for the more advanced exegesis of qorân and tradition and some other branch of supererogation be teach here in the mediaeval way from mediaeval text-book or from more modern compilation reproduce they contents and complete they more or less by treat modern question accord to the same method it be now almost thirty year since i live the life of a meccan student during one university year after have become familiar with the matter teach by the professor of the temple of mecca the haram by privately study it so that i could freely use all my time in observe the mentality of people learn those thing not for curiosity but in order to acquire the only true direction for they life in this world and the salvation of they soul in the world to come for a modern man there could hardly be a better opportunity imagine for get a true vision of the middle age than be offer to the orientalist by a few month ' stay in the holy city of islâm in country like china tibet or indium there be sphere of spiritual life which present to we still more interesting material for comparative study of religion than that of mecca because they be so much more distant from we own but just on that account the western student would not be able to adapt he mind to they mental atmosphere as he may do in mecca no one would think for one moment of consider confucianism hinduism or buddhism as specially akin to christianity whereas islâm have be treat by some historian of the christian church as belong to the heretical offspring of the christian religion in fact if we be able to abstract ourselves for a moment from all dogmatic prejudice and to become a meccan with the meccan one of the neighbor of allah as they call themselves we feel in they temple the haram as if we be converse with we ancestor of five or six century ago here scholasticism with a rabbinical tint form the great attraction to the mind of thousand of intellectually highly gifted man of all age the most important lecture be deliver during the forenoon and in the evening a walk at one of those hour through the square and under the colonnade of the mosque with ear open to all side will enable you to get a general idea of the object of mental exercise of this international assembly here you may find a sheikh of pure arab descent explain to he audience compose of white syrian or circassian of brown and yellow abyssinian and egyptian of negro chinese and malay the probable and improbable legal consequence of marriage contract not except those between man and genie there a negro scholar be explain the ontological evidence of the existence of a creator and the logical necessity of he have twenty quality inseparable from but not identical with he essence in the midst of another circle a learn _ muftî _ of indeterminably mixed extraction demonstrate to he pupil from the standard work of al-ghazâlí the absolute vanity of law and doctrine to those whose heart be not purify from every attachment to the world most of the branch of mohammedan learning be represent within the wall of this temple by more or less famous scholar and still there be a great number of private lecture deliver at home by professor who do not like to be disturb by the unavoidable noise in the mosque which during the whole day serve as a meeting place for friend or business man as a exercise hall for qorân reciter and even as a passage for people go from one part of the town to the other in order to complete you mediaeval dream with a scene from daily life you have only to leave the mosque by the bâb dereybah one of its twenty-two gate where you may see human merchandise exhibit for sale by the slave-broker and then to have a glance outside the wall at a camel caravan bring firewood and vegetable into the town lead by beduin whose outward appearance have as little change as they mind since the day when mohamm begin here to preach the word of allah to the greater part of the world represent by this international exhibition of islâm as a modern musulman writer call it we modern world with all its problem its emotion its learning and science hardly exist on the other hand the average modern man do not understand much more of the mental life of the two hundred million to whom the barren mecca have become the great center in former day other centre be much more important although mecca have always be the goal of pilgrimage and the cherish abode of many learn man many capital of islâm offer the student a easier life and better accommodation for they study while in mecca four month of the year be devote to the foreign guest of allah by attend to whose various need all meccan gain they livelihood for century cairo have stand unrivalled as a seat of mohammedan learning of every kind and even now the uaram of mecca be not to be compare to the azhar-mosque as regard the number and the fame of its professor and the variety of branch cultivate in the last half-century however the ancient repute of the egyptian metropolis have suffer a good deal from the enormous increase of european influence in the land of the pharaoh the effect of which have make themselves feel even in the azhar modern program and method of instruction have be adopt and what be still worse modernism itself favor by the late muftî muhamm abduh have make its entrance into the sacred lecture-hall which until a few year ago seem inaccessible to the slightest deviation from the decree of the infallible agreement of the community strenuous effort have be make by eminent scholar to liberate islâm from the chain of the authority of the past age on the basis of independent interpretation of the qorân not in the way of the wahhâbî reformer who try a century before to restore the institution of mohammed 's time in they original purity but on the contrary with the object of adapt islâm by all means in they power to the requirement of modern life official protection of the bold innovator prevent they conservative opponent from cast they out of the azhar but the assent to they doctrine be more enthusiastic outside its wall than inside the ever more numerous adherent of modern thought in egypt do not generally proceed from the rank of the azhar student nor do they generally care very much in they later life for reform the method prevail there although they may be incline to applaud the effort of the modernist to the intellectual of the higher class the azhar have cease to offer great attraction if it be not for the important fund -lrb- _ wagf _ -rrb- for the benefit of professor and student the number of both class would have diminish much more than be already the case and the faithful cultivator of mediaeval mohammedan science would prefer to live in mecca free from western influence and control even as it be the predilection of foreign student of law and theology be turn more and more towards mecca as one of the numerous interesting specimen of the mental development effect in egypt in the last year i may mention a book that appear in cairo two year ago -lrb- 1 -rrb- contain a description of the present khedive 's pilgrimage to mecca and medina perform two year before the author evidently possess a good deal of the scholastic learning to be gather in the azhar and no european erudition in the stricter sense of the word in a introductory chapter he give a summary of the geography and history of the arabian peninsula describe the hijâz in a more detailed manner and in he very elaborate account of the journey on which he accompany he princely master the topography of the holy city the peculiarity of they inhabitant and of the foreign visitor the political institution and the social condition be treat almost as fully and accurately as we could desire from the hand of the most accomplished european scholar the work be illustrate by good map and plan and by a great number of excellent photograph expressly take for this purpose by the khedive 's order the author intersperse he account with many witty remark as well as serious reflection on religious and political topic thus make it very readable to those of we who be familiar with the arabic language he adorn he description of the holy place and of the pilgrimage-rite with the unctuous phrase use in handbook for the hajjus and he do not disturb the mind of the pious reader by any historical criticism of the tradition connect with the house of allah the black stone and the other sanctuary but he lose no opportunity to show he dislike of all superstition sometimes as if to prevent western reader from indulge in mockery he compare meccan rite or custom with superstitious practice current amongst jew or christian of today -lrb- footnote 1 : _ ar-rihlah al-hijaziyyah _ by muhammed labib al-batanunf 2d edition cairo 1329 hijrah -rrb- this book at whose contents many a meccan scholar of the old style will shake he head and exclaim : we seek refuge near allah from satan the curse have be adopt by the egyptian department of public instruction as a reading-book for the school what surprise I more than anything else be the author 's quote as he predecessor in the description of mecca and medina burckhardt burton and myself and he send I although personally unacquainted with he a presentation copy with a flattering dedication this author and he book would have be impossible in the moslim world not more than thirty year ago in egypt such a man be nowadays already consider as one of those more conservative modern who prefer the rationalistic explanation of the azhar lore to put it aside altogether within the azhar he book be sure to meet with hearty approval from the follower of muhammed abduh but not less hearty disapproval from the opponent of modernism who make up the majority of the professor as well as of the student in these very last year a new progress of modern thought have manifest itself in cairo in the foundation under the auspices of fu ' âd pasha a uncle of the present khedive of the egyptian university cairo have have for a long time its school of medicine and law which could be turn easily into university faculty therefore the founder of the university think it urgent to establish a faculty of art and if this prove a success to add a faculty of science in the meantime gifted young man be grant subsidy to learn at european university what they need to know to be the professor of a come generation and for the present christian as well as mohammedan native of egypt and european scholar live in the country be appoint as lecturer professor be borrow from the university of europe to deliver lecture in arabic on different subject choose more or less at random before a audience little prepared to digest the lesson offer to they the rather hasty start and the lack of a well-defined scheme have make the egyptian university a subject of severe criticism nevertheless its foundation be a unmistakable expression of the desire of intellectual egypt to translate modern think into its own language to adapt modern higher instruction to its own need this same aim be pursue in a perhaps more efficacious manner by the hundred of egyptian student of law science and medicine at french english and some other european university the turk could not freely follow such example before the revolution of 1908 but they have show since that time that they abstention be not voluntary england france holland and other country govern mohammedan population be all endeavor to find the right way to incorporate they mohammedan subject into they own civilization fully recognize that it be the material covetousness of past generation that submit those nation to they rule the so-called colonial power consider it they duty now to secure for they in international intercourse the place which they natural talent enable they to occupy the question whether it be better simply to leave the moslim to islâm as it be for century be no longer a object of serious discussion the reform process be at work everywhere -- in some part with surprising rapidity we can only try to prognosticate the solution which the near future reserve for the problem how the moslim world be to be associate with modern thought in this problem the whole civilized world and the whole world of islâm be concern the ethnic difference between indian north-africans malay etc may necessitate a difference of method in detail the islâm problem lie at the basis of the question for all of they on the other hand the future development of islâm do not only interest country with mohammedan dominion it claim as well the attention of all the nation partaking in the international exchange of material and spiritual goods this would be more generally recognize if some knowledge of islâm be more widely spread amongst ourselves if it be better realize that islâm be next akin to christianity it be the christian mission that show the deepest consciousness of this state of thing and the greatest activity in promote a association of mohammedan think with that of western nation the solid mass of experience due to the effort of numerous missionary be not of a encouraging nature there be no reasonable hope of the conversion of important number of mohammedan to any christian denomination broad-minded missionary society have therefore give up the old fruitless proselytizing method and have turn to social improvement in the way of education medical treatment and the like it can not be deny that what they want above all to bring to mohammedan be just what these most energetically decline to accept on the other hand the advocate of a purely civilizing mission be bind to acknowledge that but for rare exception the desire of incorporate mohammedan nation into we world of thought do not rouse the devoted self-denying enthusiasm inspire by the vocation of propagate a religious belief the ardor display by some missionary in establish in the dâr al-islâm christian centre from which they distribute to the mohammedan those element of we civilization which be acceptable to they deserve cordial praise the more so because they themselves entertain but little hope of attain they ultimate aim of conversion mohammedan who take any interest in christianity be teach by they own teacher that the revelation of jesus after have suffer serious corruption by the christian themselves have be purify and restore to its original simplicity by mohammed and be therefore inaccessible to missionary argument nay amongst uncivilized pagan the lay mission of islâm be the most formidable competitor of clerical propagation of the christian faith people who take no active part in missionary work be not competent to dissuade christian missionary from continue they seemingly hopeless labor among mohammedan nor to prescribe to they the method they be to adopt they full autonomy be to be respect but all agree that mohammedan disincline as they be to reject they own tradition of thirteen century and to adopt a new religious faith become ever better dispose to associate they intellectual social and political life with that of the modern world here lie the start point for two division of mankind which for century have live they own life separately in mutual misunderstanding from which to pursue they way arm in arm to the greater advantage of both we must leave it to the mohammedan themselves to reconcile the new idea which they want with the old one with which they can not dispense but we can help they in adapt they educational system to modern requirement and give they a good example by reject the detestable identification of power and right in politics which lie at the basis of they own canonical law on holy war as well as at the basis of the political practice of modern western state this be a work in which we all may collaborate whatever we own religious conviction may be the principal condition for a fruitful friendly intercourse of this kind be that we make the moslim world a object of continual serious investigation in we intellectual centre have spend a good deal of my life in seek for the right method of associate with modern think the thirty-five million of mohammedan whom history have place under the guardianship of my own country i could not help draw some practical conclusion from the lesson of history which i have try to reduce to they most abridged form there be no lack of pessimist whose wisdom have find its poetic form in the word of kipling : east be east and west be west and never the twain shall meet to I with regard to the moslim world these word seem almost a blasphemy the experience acquire by adapt myself to the peculiarity of mohammedan and by daily conversation with they for about twenty year have impress I with the firm conviction that between islâm and the modern world a understanding _ be _ to be attain and that no period have offer a better chance of further it than the time in which we be live to kipling 's poetical despair i think we have a right to prefer the word of a broad-minded modern hindu writer : the pity be that man lead astray by adventitious difference miss the essential resemblance -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : sm mitra _ anglo-indian
