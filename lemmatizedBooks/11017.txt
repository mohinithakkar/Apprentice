great value i dedicate this work it be the hour of fate and those who follow I reach every state mortal desire and conquer every foe save death but they who doubt or hesitate -- condemn to failure penury and woe -- seek I in vain and uselessly implore i hear they not and i return no more ingall _ opportunity _ preface arthur christopher benson in the introduction to he study in biography entitle the leaf of the tree say : -- but when it come to deal with man who have play upon the whole a noble part in life whose vision have be clear and whose heart have be wide who have not merely follow they own personal ambition but have really desire to leave the world better and happier than they find it -- in such case indiscriminate praise be not only foolish and untruthful it be positively harmful and noxious what one desire to see in the life of other be some sort of transformation some evidence of patient struggle with fault some hint of failing triumph over some gain of generosity and endurance and courage to slur over the fault and failing of the great be not only inartistic : it be also faint-hearted and unjust it alienate sympathy it substitute unreal adoration for wholesome admiration it afflict the reader conscious of frailty and struggle with a sense of hopeless despair in the presence of anything so supremely high-minded and flawless the judgment of a son may perhaps be bias in favor of a beloved father he may unconsciously slur over the fault and failing and lay emphasis only on the virtue in selecting and put together the letter diary etc of my father samuel fb morse i have try to avoid that fault my desire have be to present a true portrait of the man with both light and shadow duly emphasize but i can say with perfect truth that i have find but little to deplore he be human he have he fault and he make mistake while honestly differ from he on certain question i be yet convince that in all he belief he be absolutely sincere and the deeper i have delve into he correspondence the more i have be impress by the true nobility and greatness of the man he fame be now secure but like all great man he make enemy who pursue he with they calumny even after he death and other perfectly honest and sincere have question he right to be call the inventor of the telegraph i have try to give credit where credit be due with regard to certain point in the invention but i have also give the documentary evidence which i be confident will prove that he never claim more than be he right for many year after he invention be a proved success almost to the day of he death he be compel to fight for he rights but he be a good fighter a skilled controversialist and he have win out in the end he be bear and bring up in a deeply religious atmosphere in a faith which seem to we of the present day as narrow but as will appear from he correspondence he be perfectly sincere in he belief and unfalteringly hold himself to be a instrument divinely appoint to bestow a great blessing upon humanity it seem not to be generally know that he be a artist of great ability that for more than half he life he devote himself to painting and that he be rank with the best of we earlier painter in my selection of letter to be publish i have try to place much emphasis on this phase of he career a most interesting one i have find so many letter diary and sketch-book of those earlier year never before publish that seem to I of great human interest that i have venture to let a large number of these document chronicle the history of morse the artist many of the letter here publish have already appear in mr s irenaeus prime 's biography of morse but other be now print for the first time and i have omit many which mr prime include i must acknowledge my indebtedness to mr prime for the possibility of fill in certain gap in the correspondence and for much interesting material not now otherwise obtainable before the telegraph have demonstrate its practical utility its inventor be subject to ridicule most galling to a sensitive nature and after it be a proved success he be vilify by the enemy he be oblige to make on account of he own probity and by the unscrupulous man who try to rob he of the fruit of he genius but in this he be only pay the penalty of greatness and as the perspective of time enable we to render a more impartial verdict he character will be find to emerge triumphant he versatility and abound vitality be astounding he would have be a eminent man in he day have he never invent the telegraph but it be of absorb interest in follow he career to note how he be force to give up one ambition after another to suffer blow after blow which would have overwhelm a man of less indomitable perseverance until all he great energy be impel into the one channel which ultimately lead to undying fame in every great achievement in the history of progress one man must stand preëminent one name must symbolize to future generation the thing accomplish whether it be the founding of a empire the discovery of a new world or the invention of a new and useful art and this one man must be so endowed by nature as to be capable of carry to a successful issue the great enterprise be it what it may he must in short be a man of destiny that he should call to he assistance other man that he should legitimately make use of the labor of other in no wise detract from he claim to greatness it be futile to say that without this one or that one the enterprise would have be a failure that without he officer and he man the general could not have wage a successful campaign we must in every great accomplishment which have influence the history of the world search out the master mind to whom under heaven the epoch-making result be due and he must we crown with the laurel wreath of nothing be this more true than of invention for i venture to assert that no great invention have ever spring minerva-like from the brain of one man it have be the culmination of the discovery the research yes and the failure of other until the time be ripe and the destine man appear while due credit and all honor must be give to the other laborer in the field the niche in the temple of fame must be reserve for the one man whose genius have combine all the known element and add the connect link to produce the great result as a invention the telegraph be truly epoch-making it come at a time when steam navigation on land and water be yet in its infancy and it be idle to speculate on the slow progress which this would have make have it not be for the assistance of the electric spark the science of electricity itself be but a academic curiosity and it be not until the telegraph have demonstrate that this mysterious force could be harness to the use of man that other man of genius arise to extend its usefulness in other direction and this in turn stimulate invention in many other field and the end be not yet it have be necessary in select letter to omit many fully as interesting as those which have be include barely to touch on subject of research or of political and religious discussion which be worthy of be pursue further and to omit some subject entirely very probably another more experienced hand would have make a better selection but my aim have be to give through characteristic letter and contemporary opinion a accurate portrait of the man and a succinct history of he life and labor if i have succeed in throw a new light on some point which be still the subject of discussion if i have be able to call attention to any fact which until now have be overlook or unknown i shall be satisfy if i have be compel to use very plain language with regard to some of those who be he open or secret enemy or who have be posthumously glorify by other i have do so with regret such as it be i send the book forth in the hope that it may add to the knowledge and appreciation of the character of one of the world 's great man and that it may perhaps be a inspiration to other who be strive against great odds to benefit they fellow man or to those who be champion the cause of justice and truth

stick to one idea through discouragement and disappointment which would have overwhelm a weaker nature the follow extract be from a long letter from he mother date November 23 1805 : -- i be fearful

and i hope sincerely that it will have a good effect in change that thoughtless disposition which have ever be a striking trait in my character as i grow older i begin to think better of what you have always tell I when i be small i begin to know by experience that man be bear to trouble and that temptation to do evil be as countless as the star but i hope i shall be enable to shun they this be from a letter of January 9 1809 : -- i have be read the first volume of professor silliman 's ` journal ' which he keep during he passage to and residence in europe i be very much pleased with it i long for the time when i shall be able to travel with improvement to myself and society and hope it will be in you power to assist I i have a very ardent desire of travel but i consider that a

vacation in the philosophical chamber with mr dwight who be go to perform a number of experiment in _ electricity _ it be of course only a curious coincidence that these two sentence should have occur in the same letter but it be when travel many year afterwards that the first idea of the electric telegraph find lodgment in he brain and this certainly result in improvement to himself and society in February 1809 he write : my study be at present optics in philosophy dialling homer beside dispute compose attend lecture etc etc all which i find very interesting and especially mr day 's lecture who be now lecture on _ electricity _ young morse 's thought seem to have be gradually focus on the two subject to which he afterwards devote he life for in a letter of march 8 1809 he say : mr day 's lecture be very interesting they be upon electricity he have give we some very fine experiment the whole class take hold of hand form the circuit of communication and we all receive the shock apparently at the same moment i never take a electric shock before it feel as if some person have strike I a slight blow across the arm i think with pleasure that two third of this term only remain as soon as that be pass away i hope i shall again see home i really long to see charlestown again i have almost forget how it look i have some thought of take a view of boston from bunker 's hill when i

: -- mr mallory a few day since hand I a letter from you request I if possible to sketch a likeness of young mr daggett accordingly i have make the attempt and take the present opportunity of forwarding you the result the task be hard but pleasurable it be one of the most difficult undertaking to endeavor to take a portrait from recollection of one whose countenance have not be examine particularly for the purpose when i make the first attempt not a single feature could i recall distinctly to my memory and i almost despaired of a likeness but the thought of lessen the affliction of such a distressed family determine I to attempt it a second time the result be on the ivory i then show it to my brother to mr evart to mr hillhouse to mr mallory and to mr read all of whom have not the least suspicion of anything of the kind and they have severally and separately pronounce it a likeness of young mr daggett this encourage I and i make the two other sketch which be think likewise to be resemblance of he if these or any one of they can be recognize by the afflict family as a resemblance of he they have lose it will be a ample compensation to I to think that i have in any degree be the means of alleviate they suffering on December 8 1810 he write to he brother : i have almost complete my landscape it be ` proper handsome ' so they say and they want to make I believe it be so but i sha not yet awhile this show the right frame of mind for a artist and yet like most youthful painter he attempt more than he proficiency warrant for in this same letter he add : i be go to begin

self-sacrifice on they part to further in every way he ambition January 15 1811 my dear brother -- we have just receive richard 's letter of the 8th inst and i can have a pretty correct idea of you feeling at the beginning of a vacation you must not be melancholy and hang yourself if you do you will have a terrible scolding when you get home again as for richard 's get a appointment so low if i be in he situation i should not trouble myself one fig concern _ appointment _ they cost more than they be worth i shall not esteem he the less for not get a higher and not more than one millionth part of the world know what a appointment be you will both of you have a different opinion of appointment after you have be out of college a short time i have rather be richard with a dialogue than sanford with a dispute if appointment at college decide you fate forever you might possibly groan and wail but then consider where poor i should come -lrb- he get no appointment whatever -rrb- think of this richard and _ do not _ hang _ yourself _ -lrb- it may perhaps be well to explain that appointment be give at yale to those who excel in scholarship philosophical oration be the highest then come high oration oration etc etc -rrb- i have leave mr mallory 's store and be help papa in the geography shall remain at home till the latter part of next summer and then shall go to london with mr allston the following extract from two letter of a college friend i have introduce as throw some light on morse 's character at that time and also as curious example of the epistolary style of those day : -- new haven February 5 1811 dear finley -- yours of the 6th ult i receive together with the book enclose which i deliver personally accord to you request do i not know the nature of you disorder and the state of you _ gizzard _ i should really be surprise at the commencement and indeed the whole tenor of you letter but as it be i can excuse and feel for you have i commence a letter with the french _ hélas hélas _ it would have be no more than might reasonably have be expect consider the desolate situation of new haven and the gloomy prospects before I but for you who be in the very vortex of fashionable life and surround by the amusement and bustle of the metropolis of new england for you to exclaim how lonely i be be unpardonable or at most admit of but one excuse to wit that you can plead the feeling of the youth who exclaim god annihilate both time and space and make two lover happy you suppose i be so much take up with the lady and other good thing in new haven that i have not time to think of one of my old friend alas morse there be no lady or anything else to occupy my attention they be all go and we have no amusement even old value have desert we whose music though a assemblage of unharmonious sound be infinitely preferable to the harsh grating thunder of he brother new haven be indeed this winter a dreary place i write you about a month since and do then what you wish I now to do -- i mention all that be worth mention which by the way be very little about new haven and its inhabitant since then i have be to new york and see the miss radcliff and in pass through stamford the miss davenport the mention of the name of davenport would at one time have excite in you breast emotion unutterable but now though ann be as lovely as ever you heart require the influence of another hart to quicken its pulsation last but not least come the all-conquering the angelic queen of hart i have not see she since she leave new haven but have hear from she sister eliza that she be in good health and be go in April to new york with mr jarvi -lrb- she sister -rrb- to spend the summer and perhaps a longer time where she will probably break many a proud heart and bend many a stubborn knee i fear morse unless you have she firmly in you toil i fear she may not be able to withstand every attack for new york abound with elegant and accomplished young man you mention that you have again change you mind as to the business which you intend to pursue i really think that the plan of become a bookseller would be permanent because sanction by parental authority but i be now convince that you mind be so much bent upon painting that you will do nothing else effectually it be indeed a noble art and if pursue effectually lead to the highest eminence for painter rank with poet and to be place in the scale with milton and homer be a honor that few of mortal mould attain unto i wish finley that you would paint I a handsome piece for a keepsake as you be go to europe and may not be back in a hurry present my respects to mr hillhouse he father 's family be well adieu you affectionate friend jo p rossiter from this letter and from other we learn that young morse 's youthful affection be fix on a certain charming miss jannette hart but alas he prove a faithless lover for he friend rossiter thus reprove he in a letter of may 8 1811 : -- oh most amazing change can it be possible oh love and all ye cordial power of passion forbid it still still the dreadful word glare on my sight alas alas and be it then a fact if so ' t be pitiful ' t be wondrous pitiful cupid tear off you bandage new string you bow and tip you arrow with harder adamant oh shame upon you only hear the word of you exultant votarist -- ` even love which accord to the proverb conquer all thing when put in competition with painting must yield the palm and be a willing captive ' oh fie fie good master cupid you shoot but poorly if a victim so often wound can talk in term like these poor luckless jannette the epithet ` divine ' and ` heavenly ' which have so often be apply to thee be now transfer to miserable daubing with oil and clay dame nature you triumph have be short poor foolish beldam you think indeed when you have form you masterpiece and name she jannette that unqualified admiration would be extort from the lip of prejudice itself and that at least till age have wear off the first dazzling lustre from you favorite you sway would have be unlimited and you exultation immeasurable my good old dame hear for you comfort what a foolish fickle youth have dare to say of you darling jannette and that while she be yet in the first blush and bloom of virgin loveliness -- ' _ next _ to painting i love jannette the best ' insufferable blasphemy hear o heaven and be amaze tremble o earth and be horribly afraid in spite of this impassioned arraignment morse devoted himself exclusively to he art for the next few year and we have only occasional reference in the letter that follow to he first serious love affair we also hear nothing further of marius on the ruin of carthage but in February 1811 he write to he brother : i be painting my large piece the landing of we forefather at plymouth perhaps i shall have it finish by the time you come home in the spring my landscape i finish sometime since and it be frame and hang up in the front parlor at last in July 1811 the great ambition of the young man be about to be realize and he prepare to set sail for england with he friend and master washington allston he father have once make up he mind to allow he son to follow he bent do everything possible to further he ambition and assist he in he student year he give he many letter of introduction to well-known person in england and france one of which to he excellency cm talleyrand i shall quote in full sir -- i have the honor to introduce to you some year since a young friend of mine mr wilder who have since reside in you country you civility to he induce I to take the liberty to introduce to you my eldest son who visit europe for the purpose of perfect himself in the art of painting under the auspices of some of you eminent artist should he visit france as he intend i shall direct he to pay he respects to you sir assure that he will receive you protection and patronage so far as you can with convenience afford they in thus do you will much oblige sir with high consideration you most ob 'd ' t serv ' t jed morse in another letter of introduction to whom i can not say as the address on the copy be lack the father say : -- he parent have design he for a different profession but he inclination for the one he have choose be so strong and he talent for it in the opinion of some good judge so promising that we think it not proper to attempt to control he choice in this country young in the art there be few means of improvement these be to be find in they perfection only in older country and in none perhaps greater than in yours in compliance therefore with he earnest wish and those of he friend and patron mr allston -lrb- with whom he go to london -rrb- we have consent to make the sacrifice of feeling -lrb- not a small one -rrb- and a pecuniary exertion to the utmost of we ability for the purpose of place he under the best advantage of become eminent in he profession in hope that he will consecrate he acquisition to the glory of god and the best good of he fellow man morse arrive in new york on July 6 1811 after a several day ' journey from charlestown which he describe as very terrible on account of the heat and dust people be die from the heat in new york where the thermometer reach 98 ° in the shade he say : -- my ride to new haven be beyond everything disagreeable the sun beat down upon the stage -lrb- the side of which we be oblige to shut up on account of the sun -rrb- which be like a oven and the wind instead of be in we face as papa suppose be at we back and bring into we face such column of dust as to hinder we from see the other side of the stage i never be so completely cover with dust in my life before mama perhaps will think that i experience some inconvenience from such a fatiguing journey but i never feel better in my life than now the optimism of youth when it be do what it want to do he have take passage on the good ship lydium with mr and

the voyage to england and again resume it when he return to america in 1815 the voyage out be most propitious and last but twenty-two day in all : a very short one for that time as the diary contain nothing of importance relate to the eastern voyage be simply a record of good weather fair wind and pleasant companion i shall not quote from it at present it be all pleasure to the young man who have never before be away from home and he see no reason why people should dread a sea voyage the journal of the return trip tell a different story as we shall see later on for the passage last fifty-seven day and head wind gale and even hurricane be encounter all the way across and he wonder why any one should go to sea who can remain safely on land liverpool August 7 1811 my dear parent -- you see from the date that i have at length arrive in england i have have a most delightful passage of twenty day from land to land and two in come up the channel as this be a letter merely to inform you of my safe arrival i shall not enter into the particulars of we voyage until i get to london to which place i shall proceed as soon as possible suffice it to say that i have not be sick a moment of the passage but on the contrary have never enjoy my health better i have not as yet get my trunk from the custom-house but presume i shall meet with no difficulty i be now at the liverpool arm inn it be the same inn that mr silliman put up at it be however very expensive they charge the enormous sum i believe of a guinea or a guinea and a half a day if i should be detain a day or two in this place i shall endeavor to find out other lodgings at present however it be unavoidable as all the other passenger be at the same place with I you may rest assure i shall do everything in my power to be economical but to avoid imposition of some kind or other can not be expect since every one who have be in england and speak of the subject to I have be impose upon in some way or other you can not think how many time i have express a wish that you know exactly how i be situate my passage have be so perfectly agreeable i know not of a single circumstance that have interfere to render it otherwise through the whole passage there have be but one day in which we have not have fair wind mr and mr allston be perfectly well she have be seasick but have be greatly benefit by it she be grow quite healthy i have grow about three shades darker in consequence of my voyage i have a great deal to tell you which i must defer till i arrive in london oh how i wish you know at this moment that i be safe and well in england good-bye do write soon and often as i shall you very affectionate son saml fb morse everything be new and interesting to the young artist and he critical observation on people and place on manners and custom be naïve and often very keen the follow be extract from he diary : -- as to the manners of the people it can not be expect that i should form a correct opinion of they since my intercourse with they have be so short but from what little i have see i be induce to entertain a very favorable opinion of they hospitality the appearance of the woman as i meet they in the street strike I on account of the beauty of they complexion they face may be say to be handsome but they figure be very indifferent and they gait in walk be very bad on Friday the 9th of August i go to the mayor to get leave to go to london he give I ten day to get there and tell I if he find I in liverpool after that time he should put I in prison at which i could not help smile he name be drinkwater but from the appearance of he face i should judge it might be drinkbrandy on account of he limit we to ten day we prepare to set out for london immediately as we should be oblige to travel slowly mr and mr allston and myself order a post-chaise and at twelve o'clock we set out for manchester intend to stay there the first night the people great number of whom we pass have cheerful healthy countenance they be neat in they dress and appear perfectly happy much have be say concern the miserable state in which the lower class of people live in england but especially in large manufacturing city that they be so unhappy as some would think i conceive to be erroneous we be apt to suppose people be unhappy for the reason that be we take from we present situation of independence and place in they situation of dependence we should be unhappy not consider that contentment be the foundation of happiness as far as my own observation extend and from what i can learn on inquiry the lower class of people generally be contented nb i have alter my opinion since write this thus far on we journey we have have a very pleasant time there be great difference i find in the treatment of traveller they be treat accord to the style in which they travel if a man arrive at the door of a inn in a stage-coach he be suffer to alight without notice and it be take for grant that common fare will answer for he but if he come in a post-chaise the whole inn be in a uproar the whole house come to the door from the landlord down to boot one hold he hand to help you to alight another be very officious in show you to the parlor and another get in the baggage whilst the landlord and landlady be quite in a bustle to know what the gentleman will please to have this attention however be very pleasant you be sure to be wait upon well and can have everything you will call for and that of the nicest kind it be the custom in this country to hire no servant at inn they on the contrary pay for they place and the only wages they get be from the generosity of traveller this circumstance at first would strike a person unacquainted with the custom of england as a very great imposition i think so but since i have consider the subject better i believe that there could not be a wiser plan form it make servant civil and oblige and always ready to do anything for know that they depend altogether on the bounty of traveller they would fear to do anything which would in the least offend they and as there be a customary price for each grade of servant a person who be travel can as well calculate the expense of he journey as though they be nothing of the kind _ london August 15 1811 _ you see from the date that i have at length arrive at the place of my destination i have be in the city about three hour so you see what be my first object mr and mr allston with myself take a post-chaise which indeed be much more expensive than a stage-coach but on account of mr allston 's health which you know be not very good when in boston -lrb- although she be much benefit by she voyage -rrb- we be oblige to travel slowly and in this manner it have cost we perhaps double the sum which it would have do have we come in a stage-coach but necessity oblige I to act as i have do i find myself in a land of stranger liable to be cheat out of my tooth almost and if i have go to london without mr allston by wait at a boarding-house totally unacquainted with any live creature i should probably have expend the difference by the time he have arrive i trust you will not think it extravagant in I for do as i have do for i assure you i shall endeavor to be as economical as possible i also mention in my letter that i could scarcely expect to steer free from imposition since none of my predecessor have be able to do it since write that letter i have find -lrb- in spite of all my care to the contrary -rrb- my observation true in go from the liverpool arm to mr woolsey 's which be over a mile i be under the necessity of get into a hackney-coach upon ask what be to pay he tell I a shilling i offer he half a guinea to change which i know to be good have take it at the hank in new york he toss it into the air and catch it in he mouth very dexterously and hand it to I back again tell I it be a bad one i look at it and tell he i be sure it be good but appeal to a gentleman who be pass i find it be bad of course i be oblige to give he other money when i get to my lodgings i related the circumstance to some of my friend and they tell I he have cheat I in this way : that it be common for they to carry bad money about they in they mouth and when this fellow have catch the good half-guinea in he mouth he change it for a bad one this be one of the thousand trick they play every day i have likewise receive eleven bad shilling on the road between liverpool and this place and it be hardly to be wonder at for the shilling piece here be just like old button without eye without the sign of a impression on they and one who be not accustom to this sort of money will never know the difference i find as mama use to tell I that i must watch my very tooth or they will cheat I out of they _ Friday 16th 1811 _ this morning i call on mr bromfield and deliver my letter he receive I very cordially enquire after you particularly and invite I to dine with he at 5 o'clock which invitation i accept i find i have arrive in england at a very critical state of affair if such a state continue much longer england must fall american measure affect this country more than you can have any idea of the embargo if it have continue six week longer it be say would have force this country into any measure _ Saturday 17th _ i have be unwell to-day in some degree so that i have not be able to go out all day it be a return of the colic i send my letter of introduction to dr lettsom with a request that he would call on I which he do and prescribe a medicine which cure I in a hour or two and this evening i feel well enough to resume my letter dr lettsom be a very singular man he look considerably like the print you have of he he be a moderate quaker but not precise and stiff like the quaker of philadelphium he be a very pleasant and sociable man and withal very blunt in he address he be a man of excellent information and be consider among the greatest literary character here there be one peculiarity however which he have in conversation that of use the verb in the third person singular with the pronoun in the first person singular and plural as instead of ' i show ' or ` we show ' he say ' i show ' ` we show ' etc upon which peculiarity the famous mr sheridan make the follow line in ridicule of he : -- if patient call both one and all i bleeds 'em and i sweats 'em and if they die why what care i -- i lettsom this be a liberty i suppose great man take with each other perhaps you may have be strike at the lateness of the hour set by mr bromfield for dinner -lrb- 5 o'clock -rrb- but that be consider quite early in london i will tell you the fashionable hour a person to be genteel must rise at twelve o'clock breakfast at two dine at six and sup at the same time and go to bed about three o'clock the next morning this may appear extravagant but it be actually practice by the greatest of the fashionable of london i think you will not complain of the shortness of this letter i only wish you now have it to relieve you mind from anxiety for while i be write i can imagine mama wish that she could hear of my arrival and thinking of thousand of accident that may have befall I and _ i wish that in a instant i could communicate the information _ but three thousand mile be not pass over in a instant and we must wait four long week before we can hear from each other -lrb- the italics be mine for on the outside of this letter write by morse in pencil be the word : -- a longing for the telegraph even in this letter -rrb- there have a ghost make its appearance a few street only from I which have alarm the whole city it appear every night in the form of shrieking and groaning there be crowd at the house every night and although they all hear the noise none can discover from whence they come the family have quit the house i suppose ` tis only a hoax by some rogue which will be bring out in time chapter iii August 24 1811 -- December 1 1811

through he connection with washington allston and by letter of introduction be dazzle and fill with enthusiasm for the work of the master he consider he one of the greatest of painter if not the greatest of all time the verdict of posterity do not grant he quite so exalt a niche in the temple of fame but he painting have many solid merit and he friendship and favor be a source of great inspiration to the young artist mr prime in he biography of morse relate this interesting anecdote : -- during the war of american independence west remain true to he native country enjoy the continue confidence of the king and be actually engage upon he portrait when the declaration of independence be hand to he mr morse receive the fact from the lip of west himself and communicate they to I in these word : -- ' i call upon mr west at he house in newman street one morning and in conformity with the order give to he servant robert always to admit mr leslie and myself even if he be engage in he private study i be show into he studio ` as i enter a half-length portrait of george iii stand before I upon a easel and mr west be sit with back toward I copy from it upon canvas my name have be mention to he he do not turn but point with the pencil he have in he hand to the portrait from which he be copy he say : -- ` do you see that picture mr morse ` yes sir i say i perceive it be the portrait of the king ` well say mr west the king be sit to I for that portrait when the box contain the american declaration of independence be hand to he ` indeed i answer what appear to be the emotion of the king what do he say ` well sir say mr west he make a reply characteristic of the goodness of he heart or word to that effect ` well if they can be happier under the government they have choose than under mine i shall be happy '' on August 24 1811 morse write to he parent : -- i have begin my study the first part of which be draw i be draw from the head of demosthene at present to get accustom to handle black and white chalk i shall then commence a drawing for the purpose of try to enter the royal academy it be a much harder task to enter now than when mr allston be here as they now require a pretty accurate knowledge of anatomy before they suffer they to enter and i shall find the advantage of my anatomical lecture i feel rather encourage from this circumstance since the harder it be to gain admittance the greater honor it will be should i enter i have likewise begin a large landscape which at a bold push i intend for the exhibition though i run the risk of be refuse i be introduce to mr west by mr allston and likewise give he you letter he be very glad to see I and say he would render I every assistance in he power at the british institution i see he famous piece of christ healing the sick he say to I : ` this be the piece i intend for america but the british would have it themselves but i shall give america the better one ' he have begin a copy which i likewise see and there be several alteration for the better if it be possible to be better a sight of that piece be worth a voyage to england of itself when it go to america if you do not go to see it i shall think you have not the least taste for painting the encomium which mr west have receive on account of that piece have give he new life and some say he be at least ten year younger he be now likewise about another piece which will probably be superior to the other he favor I with a sight of the sketch which he say he grant to I because i be a american he have not show it to anybody else mr allston be with I and tell I afterwards that however superior he last piece be this would far exceed it the subject be christ before pilate it will contain about fifty or sixty figure the size of life mr west be in he seventy-sixth year -lrb- i think -rrb- but to see he you would suppose he only about five-and-forty he be very active a flight of step at the british gallery he run up as nimbly as i could i walk through he gallery of painting of he own production there be upward of two hundred consist principally of the original sketch of he large piece he have paint in all upward of six hundred picture which be more than any artist ever do with the exception of ruben the celebrated dutch painter i be surprise on enter the gallery of painting in the british institution at see eight or ten _ lady _ as well as gentleman with they easel and palette and oil color employ in copy some of the picture you can see from this circumstance in what estimation the art be hold here since lady of distinction without hesitation or reserve be willing to draw in public by the way i digress a little to inform you how i get my segar on shore when we first go ashore i fill my pocket and hat as full as i could and leave the rest in the top of my trunk intend to come and get they immediately i come back and take another pocket load and leave about eight or nine dozen on the top of my clothes i go up into the city again and forget the remainder until it be too late either to take they out or hide they under the clothes so i wait tremble -lrb- for contraband goods subject the whole trunk to seizure -rrb- but the custom-house officer be very good-natured and clever see they and take they up i tell he they be only for my own smoking and there be so few that they be not worth seize ` oh ' say he ' i sha not touch they i will not know they be here ' and then shut down the trunk again as he smoke i give he a couple of dozen for he kindness what a curious commentary on human nature it be that even the most pious up to we own time can see no harm in smuggling and bribery and as another instance of how the standard of right and wrong change with the change year further on in this same letter to he strict and pious parent young morse say : -- i have just receive letter and papers from you by the galen which have arrive i be glad to see american papers again i see by they that the lottery be do draw how have my ticket turn out if the weight will not be too great for one shipload i wish you would send the money by the next vessel the lottery be for the benefit of harvard college _ September 3 1811 _ i have finish a drawing which i intend to offer at the academy for admission mr allston tell I it would undoubtedly admit I as it be better than two third of those generally offer but advise I to draw another and remedy some defect in handle the chalk -lrb- to which i be not at all accustomed -rrb- and he say i shall enter with some éclat i show it to mr west and he tell I it be a extraordinary production that i have talent and only want knowledge of the art to make a great painter in a letter to he friend mr and mr jarvi dated September 17 1811 he say : -- i be astonish to find such a difference in the encouragement of art between this country and america in america it seem to lie neglect and only think to be a employment suit to a lower class of people but here it be the constant subject of conversation and the exhibition of the several painter be fashionable resort no person be esteem accomplished or well educate unless he possess almost a enthusiastic love for painting to possess a gallery of picture be the pride of every nobleman and they seem to vie with each other in possess the most choice and most numerous collection i visit mr copley a few day since he be very old and infirm i think he age be upward of seventy nearly the age of mr west he power of mind have almost entirely leave he he late painting be miserable it be really a lamentable thing that a man should outlive he faculty he have be a first-rate painter as you well know i see at he room some exquisite piece which he paint twenty or thirty year ago but he painting of the last four or five year be very bad he be very pleasant however and agreeable in he manners mr west i visit now and then he be very liberal to I and give I every encouragement he be a very friendly man he talk with I like a father and wish I to call and see he often and be intimate with he age instead of impair he faculty seem rather to have strengthen they as he last great piece testify he be soon come out with another which mr allston think will far surpass even this last the subject be christ before pilate i go last week to burlington house in piccadilly about forty-five minute ' walk the residence of lord elgin to see some of the ruin of athen lord elgin have be at a immense expense in transport the great collection of splendid ruin among they some of the original statue of phidia the celebrated ancient sculptor they be very much mutilate however and impair by time still there be enough remain to show the inferiority of all subsequent sculpture even those celebrated work the apollo belvedere venus di medicis and the rest of those noble statue must yield to they the cry of london of which you have doubtless hear be very annoying to I as indeed they be to all stranger the noise of they be constantly in one 's ear from morning till midnight and with the exception of one or two they all appear to be the cry of distress i do not know how many time i have run to the window expect to see some poor creature in the agony of death but find to my surprise that it be only a old woman cry ` fardin ' apple ' or something of the kind hogarth 's picture of the enraged musician will give you a excellent idea of the noise i hear every day under my window there be a singular custom with respect to knock at the door of house here which be strictly adhere to a servant belong to the house ring the bell only a strange servant knock once a market man or woman knock once and ring the penny post knock twice and a gentleman or lady half a dozen quick knock or any number over two a nobleman generally knock eight or ten tune very loud the account lately receive from america look rather gloomy they be think here to wear a more threatening aspect than they have heretofore do from my own observation and opportunity of hear the opinion of the people generally they be extremely desirous of a amicable adjustment of difference and seem as much oppose to the idea of war as the better part of the american people in this letter you will perceive all the variety of feeling which i have have for a fortnight past sometimes in very low sometimes in very high spirit and sometimes a balance of each which latter though very desirable i seldom have but generally be at one extreme or the other i write this in the evening of the last two week and this will account and i hope apologize for its great want of connection in a long letter to a friend dated September 17 1811 he thus describe some of the sight of london : -- a few day since i walk about four mile out of town to a village of the name of hackney to witness the ascension of a mr sadler and another gentleman in a balloon it be a very grand sight and the next day the aeronaut return to hackney have go nearly fifty mile in about a hour and a half the number of people who attend on this occasion might be fairly estimate at 300000 such a concourse as i never before witness when the balloon be out of sight the crowd begin to return home and such a confusion it be almost impossible for I to describe a gang of pickpocket have contrived to block up the way which be across a bridge with carriage and cart etc and as soon as the people begin to move it create such a obstruction that in a few moment this great crowd in the midst of which i have unfortunately get be stop this give the pickpocket a opportunity and the people be plunder to a great amount i be detain in this manner almost suffocate in a great shower of rain for about a hour and what add to the misery of the scene there be a great many woman and child cry and scream in all direction and no one able to assist they not even have a finger at liberty they be wedge in in such a manner i have often hear of the danger of a london crowd but never before experienced it and i think once be amply sufficient and shall rest satisfied with it a few evening since i visit the celebrated vauxhall garden of which you have doubtless often hear i must say they far exceed my expectation i never before have a idea of such splendor the moment i go in i be almost strike blind with the blaze of light proceeding from thousand of lamp and those of every color in the midst of the garden stand the orchestra box in the form of a large temple and most beautifully illuminate in this the principal band of music be place at a little distance be another smaller temple in which be place the turkish band on one side of the garden you enter two splendid saloon illuminate in the same brilliant manner in one of they the pandean band be place and in the other the scotch band all around the garden be a walk with a covered top but open on the side under curtain in festoon and these form the most splendid illuminated part of the whole garden the amusement of the evening be music waterworks firework and dance the principal band play till about ten o'clock when a little bell be ring and the whole concourse of people -lrb- the greater part of which be female -rrb- run to a dark part of the garden where there be a admirable deception of waterworks a bridge be see over which stage and wagon man and horse be see pass bird fly across and the water in great cataract fall down from the mountain and pass over smaller fall under the bridge man be see rowing a boat across and indeed everything which could be devise in such a exhibition be perform this continue for about fifteen minute when they all return into the illuminate part of the garden and be amuse by music from the same orchestra till eleven o'clock they then be call away again to the dark part of the garden where be a exhibition of the most splendid firework sky-rockets serpent wheel and fountain of fire in the greatest abundance occupy twenty minute more of the time after this exhibition be close they again return into the illuminate part of the garden where the music strike up from the chief orchestra and hundred of group be immediately form for dancing respectable lady however seldom join in this dance although gentleman of the first distinction sometimes for amusement lend a hand or rather a foot to the general cheerfulness all now be gayety throughout the garden every one be in motion and care that bane of human happiness for a time seem to have lose she dominion over the human heart have the eastern sage who be in search of the land of happiness at this moment be introduce into vauxhall i think he most exalted conception of happiness would have be surpass and he would rest contented in have at last find the object of he wish in a few minute the chief orchestra cease and be relieve in turn by the other band the company follow the music the scotch band principally play scotch reel and dance the music and this course of dancing continue till about four o'clock in the morning when the light be extinguish and the company disperse on this evening which be by no means consider as a full night the company consist of perhaps three thousand person i have the pleasure a few day since of witness one of the oddest exhibition perhaps in the world it be no other than _ st bartholomew 's fair _ it be hold here in london once a year and continue three day there be a ceremony in open it by the lord mayor which i do not see at this fair the lower order of society be let loose and allow to amuse themselves in any lawful way they please the fair be hold in smithfield market about the center of the city the principal amusement appear to be swing there be large box capable of hold five or six suspend in large frame in such manner as to vibrate nearly through a semicircle there be to speak within bound three hundred of these they be place all round the square and it almost make I giddy only to see they all in motion they be so much press for room that one of these swing would clear another but about two inch and it seem almost miraculous to I that they do not meet with more accident than they do another amusement be large wheel about thirty or forty foot in diameter on the circumference of which be four and sometimes six box capable of hold four person these be set in slow motion and they gradually rise to the top of the wheel and as gradually descend and so on in succession there be various other machine on the same principle which i have not time to describe in the center of the square be a assemblage of everything in the world theater wild beast _ lusus naturoe _ mountebank buffoon dancer on the slack wire fighting and swearing pocket-picking and steal music and dancing and hubbub and confusion in every confused shape the theater be worth describe they be temporary building put up and ornamented very richly on the exterior to attract attention while the interior like many person ' head be but very poorly furnish stroll company of player occupy these and between the play the actor and actress exhibit themselves on a stage before the theater in all they spangled robe and false jewel and strut and flourish about till the theater be fill then they go in and turn perhaps a very serious tragedy into one of the most ridiculous farce they occupy about fifteen minute in recite a play and then a fresh audience be collect and so they proceed through the three day and night so that the poor actor and actress be kill about fifty time in the course of a day a person who go into one of these theater must not expect to hear a syllable of the tragedy if he can look upon the stage it be as much as he can expect for there be such a confused noise without of drum and fife clarionet bassoon hautboy triangle fiddle bass-viol and in short every possible instrument that can make a noise that if a person get safe from the fair without the total loss of he hearing for three week he may consider himself fortunate contiguous to the theater be the exhibition room of the juggler and buffoon who also between they exhibition display they trick on stage before the populace and show as many antic as so many monkey but be i to attempt a description of everything i see at bartholomew fair my letter instead of be a few sheet would swell to as many quire so i must close it i shall probably soon witness a exhibition of a more interesting nature i mean a coronation the king be now so very low that he can not survive more than a week or two longer and immediately on he death the ceremony of the coronation take place if i should see it i shall certainly describe it to you the king george iii do not however die until 1820 in a letter of September 20 to he parent he say : i endeavor to be as economical as possible and be get into the habit very fast it must be learn by degree i shall not say as salmagundus say -- ' i shall spare no expense in discover the most economical way of spend money ' but shall endeavor to practice it immediately _ September 24 1811 _ you will see by the papers which accompany this what a report respect the capture of the we frigate president by melampus frigate prevail here it be sufficient to say it be not in the least credit in case of war i shall be order out of the country if so instead of return home have i not better go to pari as it be cheaper living there even than in london and there be great advantage there i only ask the question in case of war i be go on swimmingly next week on Monday the royal academy open and i shall present my draw _ October 21 1811 _ i write you by the galen about three week ago and have this moment hear she be still in the downs i be really provoke there be great deception about vessel they advertise for a certain day and perhaps do not sail under a month after the galen have be go and go till i be sick of hear she have not go _ November 6 1811 _ after leave this letter so long as you see by the different date i again resume it perhaps you will be surprise when i tell you that but yesterday i hear that the galen be still wind-bound it make my letter which be on board of she about five or six week old besides the prospect of a long voyage however it be not she fault there be three or four hundred vessel in the same predicament the wind have be such that it have be impossible for any of they to get under weigh but i must confess i feel considerably anxious on you account i mention in one of my other letter that i have draw a figure -lrb- the gladiator -rrb- to admit I into the academy after i have finish it i be displeased with it and conclude not to offer it but to attempt another i have accordingly draw another from the laocoon statue the most difficult of all the statue have show it to the keeper of the academy and _ be admit for a year _ without the least difficulty mr allston be please to compliment I upon it by say that it be better than two third of the drawing of those who have be draw at the academy for two year _ November 85 1811 _ i mention in my last letter that i have enter the royal academy which information i hope will give you pleasure i now employ my day in painting at home and in the evening in draw at the academy as be customary i have finish a landscape and almost finish a copy of a portrait which mr west lend I mr allston have see it and compliment I by say it be just a hundred tune better than he have any idea i could do and that i should astonish mr west very much i have also begin a landscape a morning scene at sunrise which mr allston be very much pleased with all these thing encourage I and as every day pass away i feel increase enthusiasm distress be increase in this country and disturbance riot etc have commence as you will see by the papers which accompany this they be consider very alarming _ December 1 1811 _ i be pursue my study with increase enthusiasm and hope before the three year be out to relieve you from further expense on my account mr allston encourage I to think thus from the rapid improvement he say i have make you may rest assure i shall use all my endeavor to do it as soon as may be this country appear to I to be in a very bad state i judge from the increase disturbance at nottingham and more especially from the startling murder lately commit in this city a few morning since be publish a account of the murder of a family consist of four person and this moment there be another account of the murder of one consist of three person make the twelfth murder commit in that part of the city within three month and not one of the murderer as yet have be discover although a reward of more than seven hundred pound have be offer for the discovery the inhabitant be very much alarmed and hereafter i shall sleep with pistol at the head of my bed although there be little to apprehend in this part of the city still as i find many of my acquaintance adopt that plan i choose rather to be on the safe side and join with

englishman who be friend of he father among the former be charle r leslie he room-mate and devoted friend who afterwards become one of the best of the american painter of those day in he autobiography leslie say : -- my new acquaintance allston king and morse be very kind but still they be _ new _ acquaintance i thought of the happy circle round my mother 's fireside and there be moment in which but for my obligation to mr bradford and my other kind patron i could have be content to forfeit all the advantage i expect from my visit to england and return immediately to america the two year i be to remain in london seem in prospect a age mr morse who be but a year or two older than myself and who have be in london but six month when i arrive feel very much as i do and we agree to take apartment together for some time we paint in one room he at one window and i at the other we draw at the royal academy in the evening and work at home in the day we mentor be allston and king nor could we have be better provide allston a most amiable and polished gentleman and a painter of the purest taste and king warm-hearted sincere sensible prudent and the strictest of economist when allston be suffer extreme depression of spirit after the loss of he wife he be haunt during sleepless night by horrid thought and he tell I that diabolical imprecation force themselves into he mind the distress of this to a man so sincerely religious as allston may be imagine he wish to consult coleridge but could not summon resolution he desire therefore that i should do it and i go to highgate where coleridge be at that time live with mr gillman i find he walk in the garden he hat in he hand -lrb- as it generally be in the open air -rrb- for he tell I that have be one of the bluecoat boy among whom it be the fashion to go bareheaded he have acquire a dislike to any cover of the head i explain the cause of my visit and he say : ` allston should say to himself _ nothing be I but my will _ these thought therefore that force themselves on my mind be no part of _ I _ and there can be no guilt in they if he will make a strong effort to become indifferent to they recurrence they will either cease or cease to trouble he ' he say much more but this be the substance and after it be repeat to allston i do not hear he again complain of the same kind of disturbance mr cb king the other friend mention by leslie return to america in 1812 and write from philadelphia January 3 1813 : -- my dear friend this will be hand you by mr payne of boston who intend pass some time in england i have not be here sufficiently long to forget the delightful time when we could meet in the evening with novel coffee and _ music by morse _ with the conversation of that dear fellow allston the reflection that it will not again take place come across my mind accompany with the same painful sensation as the thought that i must die that morse be not forget by the good people at home be evidence by a letter from he brother sidney edward of January 18 1812 part of which i transcribe : -- dear brother -- i be sit in the parlor in the armchair on the right of the fireplace and as i hold my paper in my hand with my foot sprawl out before the fire and with my body recline in a oblique position against the back of the chair i be pen you a letter such as it be and for the inverted position of the letter of which i beg to apologize as i turn my eye upward and opposite i behold the family picture paint by a ingenious artist who i understand be at present reside in london if you be acquaint with he give my love to he and my best wish for he prosperity and success in the art to which if report say true he have devote himself with much diligence richard sit before I write to you and mama say -lrb- for i have just ask she the question -rrb- that she be engage in the same business papa be upstairs very much engage in the selfsame employment four right hand be at this instant write to give you at some future moment the pleasure of peruse the product of they present labor four imagination be now employ in conceive of a son or a brother in a distant land therefore we may draw the conclusion that you be not universally forget and consequently all do not forget you i have write you this long letter because i know that you would be anxious for the information it contain because papa tell I i must write because mama say i have better write because i have nothing else to do and because i have not time to write a shorter i trust for these special reason you will excuse I for this once especially when you consider that you ask I to write you long letter when you consider that it be my natural disposition to express my sentiment fully that i commonly say most when i have least to say that i promise reformation in future and that you shall hereafter hear from I on this subject as to news i be sorry to say we be entirely out we send you the last we have by the sally ann we hope to get some ready by the time the next ship sail and then we will furnish you with the best the country afford from a letter of January 30 1812 to he parent i select the follow passage : -- on Tuesday last i dine at mr west 's who request to be particularly remember to you he be extremely attentive and polite to I he call on I a few day ago which i consider a very marked attention as he keep so confine that he seldom pay any visit i have change my lodgings to no 82 in the same street -lrb- great titchfield street -rrb- and have room with young leslie of philadelphium who have just arrive he be very promising and a very agreeable room-mate we be in the same stage of advancement in art i have paint five piece since i have be here two landscape and three portrait one of myself one a copy from mr west 's copy from vandyke and the other a portrait of mr leslie who be also take mine i call a day or two since on sir william beechy a artist of great eminence to see he painting they be beautiful beyond anything i ever imagine he principal excellence be in color which to the many be the most attractive part of art sir william be consider the best colorist now live you may be apt to ask ` if sir william be so great and even the best what be mr west 's great excellence ' mr west be a bad colorist in general but he excel in the grandeur of he thought mr west be to paint what milton be to poetry and sir william beechy to mr west as pope to milton so that by compare or rather illustrate the one art by the other i can give you a better idea of the art of painting than in any other way for as some poet excel in the different species of poetry and stand at the head of they different kind in the same manner do painter have they particular branch of they art and as epic poetry excel all other kind of poetry because it address itself to the sublimer feeling of we nature so do historical painting stand preëminent in we art because it call forth the same feeling for poet ' and painter ' mind be the same and i infer that painting be superior to poetry from this : -- that the painter possess with the poet a vigorous imagination where the poet stop while the painter exceed he in the mechanical and very difficult part of the art that of handle the pencil i give you a hint in letter number 12 and a particular account in number 13 of the horrid murder commit in this city it have be pretty well ascertain from a variety of evidence that all of they have be commit by one man who be apprehend and put a end to he life in prison very horrid attempt at robbery and murder have be very frequent of late in all part of the city and even so near as within two door of I in the same street but do not be alarm you have nothing to fear on my account leslie and myself sleep in the same room and sleep arm with a pair of pistol and a sword and alarm at we door and window so we be safe on that score in my next i shall give you some account of politics here and as it respect america the federalist be certainly wrong in very many thing p i wish you would keep my letter in which i enumerate all my friend and when i say ` give my love to my friend ' imagine i write they all over and distribute it out to all as you think i ought always particularize miss russell my patroness my brother relation and mr brown and nancy -lrb- he old nurse -rrb- this will save I time ink trouble and paper concern the portrait which morse and leslie be painting of each other the follow letter to morse 's mother from a friend in philadelphium and sign rw snow will be find interesting : -- my dear friend -- i have this moment receive a letter from miss vaughan in london date February 20 1812 and know the passage below would be interesting to you i transcribe it with pleasure and add my very sincere wish that all you hope may be realize dr morse 's son be consider a young man of very promising talent by mr allston and mr west and by those who have see he painting we have see he and think he modesty and apparent amiableness promise as much happiness to he friend as he talent may procure distinction for himself he be peculiarly fortunate not only in have mr allston for a adviser and friend but in he companion in painting mr leslie a young man from philadelphium highly recommend by my uncle there and whose extreme diffidence add to the most promising talent the patient industry and desire of improvement which be necessary to bring they to perfection they have be draw each other 's picture mr leslie be in the spanish costume and mr morse in highland dress they be in a unfinished state but striking resemblance this highland lad i hope my dear friend you will see and in due time be again bless with the interesting original at this time the good father be sore distressed financially he be generous to a fault and have by endorse note and give to other cripple he own means he say in a letter to he son date march 21 1812 : -- the parkman case remain yet undecided and i know not that it ever will be there be a strange mystery surround the business which i be not able to unravel the court be now in session in boston which be expect to decide the case in a few day we shall be able to determine what we have to expect from this case if we lose it you mother and i have make up we mind to sit down contented with the loss i trust we shall be enable to pay we honest debt without it and to support ourselves as to you and you brother i trust with you education you will be able to maintain yourselve and you parent too should they need it in they old age probably this necessity lay on you for exertion industry and economy in early life will be better for you in the end than to be support by you parent in nine case out of ten those who begin the world with nothing be richer and more useful man in life than those who inherit a large estate we have just hear from you brother who be well and in fine spirit edward write that he think of stay in new haven another year and of pursue _ general science _ and afterwards of purchase a plantation and become a planter in some one of the southern state perhaps he intend to marry some rich planter 's daughter and to get he plantation and negro in that way this i imagine will be he only way to do it the newspaper which i shall send with this will inform you of the state of we public affair we have high hope that governor strong will be we governor next year i have no belief that we _ war hawk _ will be able to involve the country in a war with great britain nor do i believe that the president really wish it it be think that all the war talk and preparation be intend to effect the reëlection of mr madison the _ henry plot _ be a farce intend for the same purpose but it can never be get up it will operate against its promoter while the father be thus write on march 21 of the political condition in america from he point of view almost at the same moment the son in england be express himself as follow : -- _ march 25 1812 _ with respect to politics i know very little my time be occupy with much pleasanter subject i however can answer you question whether party spirit be conduct with such virulence here as in america it be by no mean the case for although it be in some few instance very violent still for the most part they debate be conduct with great coolness as to the prince regent you have perhaps hear how unpopular he have make himself he have disappoint the expectation of very many among the most unpopular of he measure may be place the retention of the order in council which order notwithstanding the declaration of mr perceval -lrb- the prime minister -rrb- and other in the ministry to the contrary be fast very fast reduce this country to ruin and it be the opinion of some of the best politician in this country that should the united state either persist in the non-intercourse law or declare war this country would be reduce to the lowest extremity -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : order in council be issue by the sovereign with the advice of the privy council in period of emergency trust to they future ratification by parliament in this case while promulgate as a retaliatory measure against bonaparte 's continental system they bear heavily upon the commerce of the united state -rrb- bankruptcy be daily increase and petition from all part of the kingdom pray for the repeal of the order in council have be present to the prince but he have decline hear any of they also the catholic cause remain undecided and he refuse hear anything on that subject but no more of politics i be sure you must have more than sufficient at home i will turn to a more pleasant subject and give you a slight history of the american artist now in london at the head stand mr west he stand and have stand so long preëminent that i could relate but little of he history that would be new to you so that i shall confine myself only to what have fall under my own observation and of course my remark will be few as a painter mr west can be accuse of as few fault as any artist of ancient or modern time in he study he have be indefatigable and the result of those study be a perfect knowledge of the philosophy of he art there be not a line or a touch in he picture which he can not account for on philosophical principle they be not the production of accident but of study he principal excellence be consider composition design and elegant grouping and he fault be say to be a hard and harsh outline and bad color these fault he have of late in a great degree amend he outline be softer and he coloring in some picture in which he have attempt truth of color be not surpass by any artist now live and some have even say that titian himself do not surpass it however that may be he picture of a late date be admirable even in this particular and it evince that if in general he neglect that fascinating branch of art in some of he painting he still possess a perfect knowledge of all its artifice he have just complete a picture a historical landscape which for clearness of color combine with grandeur of composition have never be excel in he private character he be unimpeachable he be a man of tender feeling but of a mind so noble that it soar above the slander of he enemy and he express pity rather than revenge towards those who through wantonness or malice plan to undermine he character no man perhaps ever pass through so much abuse and none i be confident ever bear up against its virulence with more nobleness of spirit with a steady perseverance in the pursuit of the sublimest of human profession he have travel on heedless of the sneer the ridicule or the detraction of he enemy and he have arrive at that point where the lustre of he work will not fail to illuminate the dark region of barbarism and distaste long after they bright author have cease to exist excuse my fervor in the praise of this man he be not a common man not such a one as can be meet with in every age he be one of those genius who be doom in they lifetime to endure the malice the ridicule and neglect of the world and at they death to receive the praise and adoration of this same inconsistent world i think there can not be a stronger proof that human nature be always the same than that man of genius in all age have be compel to undergo the same disappointment and to pass through the same routine of calumny and abuse the rest of this letter be miss which be a great pity as it would be interesting to read what morse have to say of allston leslie and the other be it a presentiment of the calumny and abuse to which he himself be to be subject in after life which lead he to express himself so heartily in sympathy with he master west and be it the inspiring remembrance of he master 's calm bearing under these affliction which hearten he to maintain a noble serenity under even greater provocation _ April 21 1812 _ i mention in my last letter that i should probably exceed my allowance this year by a few pound but i now begin to think that i shall not i be try every method to be economical and hope it will not be long before i shall relieve you from further expense on my account with respect to politics they appear gloomy on both side you may depend on it england have injure we sorely and we non-intercourse be a just retaliation for those wrong perhaps you will believe what be say in some of the federal papers that that measure have no effect on this country you may be assure the effect be great and severe i be myself a eye-witness of the effect the country be in a state of rebellion from literal starvation account be daily receive which grow more and more alarming from the great manufacturing town troops be in motion all over the country and but last week measure be adopt by parliament to prevent this metropolis from rise to rebellion by order troops to be station round the city to be ready at a moment 's warning this i call a alarming period everybody think so and mr perceval himself be frightened and a committee be appoint to take into consideration the order in council now when you consider that i come to this country prejudice against we government and its measure and that i can have no bad motive in tell you these fact you will not think hard of I when i say that i hope that we non-intercourse law will be enforce with all its rigor as i firmly believe it be the only way to bring this country to term and that if persist in it will certainly bring they to term i know it must make some misery at home but it will be follow by a corresponding happiness after it some of you at home i suppose will call I a democrat but fact be stubborn thing and i can not deny the truth of what i see every day before my eye a man to judge properly of he country must like judge of a picture view it at a distance _ may 12 1812 _ i write in great haste to inform you of a dreadful event which happen here last evening and rumor of which will probably reach you before this not to keep you in suspense it be no less than the _ assassination of mr perceval _ the prime minister of great britain as he be enter the house of common last evening a little past five o'clock he be shoot directly through the heart by a man from behind the door he stagger forward and fall and expire in about ten minute i have just return from the house of common there be a immense crowd assemble and very riotous in the hall be write in large letter ` peace or the head of the regent ' this country be in a very alarming state and there be no doubt but great quantity of blood will be spill before it be restore to order even while i be write a party of life guard be patrolling the street london must soon be the scene of dreadful event last night i have a opportunity of study the public mind it be at the theater the play be ` venice preserved or the plot discover ' if you will take the trouble just to read the first act you will see what relation it have to the present state of affair when pierre say to jaffier ` can ' t thou kill a senator ' there be three cheer and so through the whole whenever anything be say concern conspiracy and in favor of it the audience applaud and when anything be say against it they hiss when pierre ask the conspirator if brutus be not a good man the audience be in a great uproar applaud so as to prevent for some minute the progress of the performance this i think show the public mind to be in great agitation the play of ` venice preserve ' be not a moral play and i should not ask you to read any part of it if i could better explain to you the feeling of the public a few day later on may 17 he say in a letter to he brother : -- the assassin bellingham be immediately take into custody he be try on Friday and condemn to be execute to-morrow morning -lrb- Monday 18th -rrb- i shall go to the place to see the concourse of people for to see he execute i know i could not bear in a postscript write the day after he say : -- i go this morning to the execution a very violent rain prevent so great a crowd as be expect a few minute before eight o'clock bellingham ascend the scaffold he be very genteelly dress he bow to the crowd who cry out ` god bless you ' repeatedly i see he draw the cap over he face and shake hand with the clergyman i stay no longer but immediately turn my back and be return home i have take but a few step when the clock strike eight and on turn back i see the crowd begin to disperse i have feel the effect of this sight all day and shall probably not get over it for week it be a dreadful sight there be no accident in spite of all these momentous occurrence the young artist be faithfully pursue he study for in this same letter to he brother he say : -- but enough of this you will probably hear the whole account before this reach you i be wholly absorb in the study of my profession it be a slow and arduous undertaking i never know till now the difficulty of art and no one can duly appreciate it unless he have try it difficulty however only increase my ardor and make I more determine than ever to conquer they mr west be very kind to I i visit he occasionally of a morning to hear he converse on art he appear quite attach to I as he be indeed to all young american artist it seem to give he the greatest pleasure to think that one day the art will flourish in america he say that philadelphium will be the athen of the world that city certainly give the greatest encouragement of any place in the united state boston be most backward so if ever i should return to america philadelphium or new york would probably be my place of abode i have just see mr stephen van rensselaer who you know be at college with we and with whom i be intimate he be very glad to see I and call on I every day while i be painting he keep he carriage and horse and be in the first circle here i ride out occasionally with he shall begin he portrait next week like a breath of fresh air in all the heat and dust of these troublous time come this request from he gentle mother in a letter of may 8 1812 : -- miss c dexter request the favor of you to take a sketch of the face of mr southey and send it she he be a favorite writer with she and she have a great desire to see the style of he countenance if you can get it enclose it in a genteel note to she with a brief account of he he age and character etc the next letter of may 25 1812 be from morse to he parent i have tell you in former letter that my lodgings be at 82 great titchfield street and that my room-mate be leslie the young man who be so much talk of in philadelphium we have live together since December and have not as yet have a fall out i find he thought of art agree perfectly with my own he be enthusiastic and so be i and we have not time scarcely to think of anything else everything we do have a reference to art and all we plan be for we mutual advancement in it we amusement be walk _ occasionally _ attend the theater and the company of mr allston and a few other gentleman consist of three or four painter and poet we meet by turn at each other 's room and converse and laugh mr allston be we most intimate friend and companion i can not feel too grateful to he for he attention to I he call every day and superintend all we be do when i be at a stand and perplexed in some part of the picture he put I right and encourage I to proceed by praise those part which he think good but he be faithful and always tell I when anything be bad it be a mortifying thing sometimes to I when i have be paint all day very hard and begin to be please with what i have do on show it to mr allston with the expectation of praise and not only of praise but a score of ` excellent ' ` well done ' and ` admirable ' i say it be mortify to hear he after a long silence say : ` very bad sir that be not flesh it be mud sir it be paint with brick dust and clay ' i have feel sometimes ready to dash my palette knife through it and to feel at the moment quite angry with he but a little reflection restore I i see that mr allston be not a flatterer but a friend and that really to improve i must see my fault what he say after this always put I in good humor again he tell I to put a few flesh tint here a few gray one there and to clear up such and such a part by such and such color and not only that but take the palette and brush and show I how and in this way he assist I i think it one of the greatest blessing that i be under he eye i do not know how many error i might have fall into if it have not be for he attention i be painting portrait alone at present we sitter be among we acquaintance we paint they if they defray the expense of canvas and color mama wish I to send some specimen of my painting home that you might see my improvement the picture that i now paint would be uninteresting to you they consist merely of study and drawing from plaster figure hand and foot and such thing the portrait be take by those for whom they be paint i shall soon begin a portrait of myself and will try and send that to you _ June 8 1812 _ mama ask in one of she letter if we make we own tea we do the tea-kettle be bring to we boil in the morning and evening and we make we own coffee -lrb- which by the way be very cheap here -rrb- and tea we live quite in the old bachelor style i do not know but it will be best for I to live in this style through life my profession seem to require all my time mr hurd will take a diploma to you with other to different person near boston i suppose it confer some title on you of consequence as i see at he house a great number to be send to all part of the world to distinguish man i find papa be know here pretty extensively some one hearing my name and that i be a american immediately ask if i be related to you the administration be at length form and to the great sorrow of everybody the old minister be reelect the order in council be the subject of debate at the house of common this evening it be a important crisis though there be scarcely any hope of they repeal if not i sincerely hope that america will declare war what lord castlereagh say at a public meeting a few day ago ought to be know in america respect the order in council when some one say unless they be repeal war with america must be the consequence he reply that ' _ if the people would but support the ministry in those measure for a short time america would be compel to submit for she be not able to go to war _ ' but i say and so do every american here who see how thing be go with this country that should america but declare war before hostility commence great britain would sue for peace on any term great britain be jealous of we and would trample on we if she could and i feel ashamed when i see she support through everything by some of the federal editor i wish they could be here a few month and they would be ashamed of themselves they be injure they country for it be _ they _ violence that induce this government to persist in they measure by hold out hope that the party will change and that then they can compel america to do anything if america lose in this contest and soften she measure towards this country she never need expect to hold up she head again _ June 15 1812 _ the queen hold a drawing-room a short time since and i go to st jame 's palace to see those who attend it be a singular sight to see the lady and gentleman in they court dress the gentleman be dress in buckram skirt coat without cape long waistcoat cock hat bag-wigs sword and large buckle on they shoe the lady in monstrous hoop so that in get into they carriage they be oblige to go edgewise they dress be very rich some lady i suppose have about they to adorn they # 20000 or # 30000 worth of diamond i have a sight of the prince regent as he pass in he splendid state carriage draw by six horse he be very corpulent he feature be good but he be very red and considerably bloated i likewise see the princess charlotte of wale who be handsome the duke of kent cambridge clarence and cumberland admiral duckworth and many other the prince hold a levee a few day since at which mr van rensselaer be present i occasionally attend the theater at covent garden there be the best acting in the world mr kemble be the first tragic actor now in england cook be a rival and excel he in some character mr siddon be the first tragic actress perhaps that ever live she be now advance in life and be about to retire from the stage on the 29th of this month she make she last appearance i must say i admire she act very much she be rather corpulent but have a remarkably fine face the grecian character be finely portray in it she excel to admiration in deep tragedy in mr beverly in the play of the ` gamester ' a few night ago she so arrest the attention of the house that you might hear you watch tick in you fob and at the close of the play when she utter a hysteric laugh for joy that she husband be not a murderer there be different lady in the box who actually go into hysteric and be oblige to be carry out of the theater this i think be proof of good act mr siddon be a woman of irreproachable character and move in the first circle the stage will never again see she equal you must not think because i praise the act that i be partial to theater i think in a certain degree they be harmless but too much attend they dissipate the mind there be no danger of my loving they too much i like to go once in awhile after study hard all day last night as i be pass through tottenham court road i see a large collection of people of the lower class make a most terrible noise by beat on something of the sound genus upon go nearer and enquire the cause i find that a butcher have just be marry and that it be always the custom on such occasion for he brethren by trade to serenade the couple with _ marrow-bone _ and _ cleaver _ perhaps you have hear of the phrase ` musical as marrow-bone and cleaver ' this be the origin of it if you wish to experience the sound let each one in the family take a pair of tong and a shovel and then stand all together let each one try to outdo the other in noise and this will give you some idea of it how this custom originate i do not know i hope it be not symbolical of the _ harmony _ which be to exist between the party marry among those eminent englishman to whom young morse have letter of introduction be zachary macaulay editor of the christian observer and father of the historian the follow note from he will be find of a delightful old-time flavor : -- mr macaulay present he compliment to mr morse and beg to express he regret at not have yet be so fortunate as to meet with he mr macaulay will be particularly happy if it should suit mr morse to dine with he at he house at clapham on Saturday next at five o'clock mr m 's house be five door beyond the plough at the entrance of clapham common a coach go daily to clapham from the ship at chare cross at a quarter past three and several leave grace church street in the city every day at four the distance from london bridge to mr macaulay 's house be about four mile 23d June 1812 in a letter from he mother of June 28 1812 the anxious parent say : -- although we long to see you yet we rejoice that you be so happily situate at so great a distance from we at present wretched miserably distract country whose mad ruler be plunge we into a unnecessary war with a country that i shall always revere as do more to spread the glorious gospel of jesus christ to the benighted heathen and those that be famish from lack of knowledge than any other nation on the globe we heart bleed at every pore to think of again be at war we have not yet forget the wormwood and gall of the last revolution we hope you will steer clear of any of the difficulty of the contest that be about to take place we wish you to be very prudent and guard in all you conversation and action and not to make yourself a party man on either side have you opinion but have they to yourself and be sure you do not commit they to paper it may do you great injury either on one side or the other and you be not in you present situation as a politician but as a artist in this same letter he father add : -- the die be cast and we country plunge in war there be great opposition to it in the country the papers which you will have opportunity to see will inform you of the state of party you mother have give you sound advice as respects the course you should pursue be the _ artist _ wholly and let _ politics _ alone i rejoice that you be where you be at the present time you will do what you can without delay to support yourself as i know not how we shall be able to procure fund to transmit to you and if we have they how we could transmit they should the war continue to this the son answer in a letter of August 6 1812 : -- i be improve perhaps the last opportunity i shall have for some time to write you mr wheeler a american who have be here some time study portrait painting have kindly offer to deliver this to you we political affair it seem have come to a crisis which i sincerely hope will turn to the advantage of america it certainly will not to this country war be a evil which no man ought to think lightly of but if ever it be just it now be the english acknowledge it and what can be more convincing proof than the confession of a enemy i be sorry to hear of the riotous proceedings in boston if they know what a injury they be do they country in the opinion of foreign nation they certainly would refrain from they i assert -lrb- because i have proof -rrb- that the federalist in the northern state have do more injury to they country by they violent opposition measure than even a french alliance could they proceedings be copy into the english papers read before parliament and circulate through the country and what do they say of they do they say the federalist be patriot and be firm in assert the rights of they country no they call they _ coward _ a _ base set _ say they be traitor to they country and ought to be hang like traitor these thing i have hear and read and therefore must believe they i wish i could have a talk with you papa i be sure i could convince you that neither federalist nor democrat be american that war with this country be just and that the present administration of we country have act with perfect justice in all they proceedings against this country to observe the contempt with which america be speak of and the epithet of a _ ` nation of cheat ' ` spring from convict ' ` pusillanimous ' ` cowardly ' _ and such like -- these i think be sufficient to make any true american 's blood boil these be not use by individual only but on the floor of the house of common the good effect of we declaration of war begin to be perceive already the tone of they public print here be a little softer and more submissive not one have call in question the justice of the declaration of war all say ` we be in the wrong and we shall do well to get out of it as soon as possible ' i could tell you volume but i have not time and it would perhaps be impolitic in the present state of affair i only wish that among the infatuated party man i may not find

influence on the course of international event i shall quote but sparingly from that portion of the correspondence just enough to show that whatever cause he espouse then and at all time during he long life he throw himself into it heart and soul and thoroughly believe in its righteousness he be absolutely sincere although he may sometimes have be mistake in a letter dated September 20 1812 he

you that i have not be idle since i have be here my passion for my art be so firmly root that i be confident no human power could destroy it -lrb- and yet as we shall see later on human injustice so discourage he that he drop the brush forever -rrb- the more i study it the greater i think be its claim to the appellation of ' _ divine _ ' and i never shall be able sufficiently to show my gratitude to my parent for they indulgence in so greatly enable I to pursue that profession without which i be sure i would be miserable if ever it be my destiny to become great and worthy of a biographical memoir my biographer will never be able to charge upon my parent that bigote attachment to any individual profession the exercise of which spirit by parent toward they child have be the ruin of some of the greatest genius and the biography of man of genius have too often contain that reflection on they parent if ever the contrary spirit be evident it have certainly be show by my parent towards I indeed they have be almost too indulgent they have watch every change of my capricious inclination and seem to have make it a object to study they with the greatest fondness but i think they will say that when my desire for change do cease it always settle on painting i hope that one day my success in my profession will reward you in some measure for the trouble and inconvenience i have so long put you to i be now go to begin a picture of the death of hercule from this figure as large as life the figure i shall send to you as soon as it be practicable and also one of the same to

you last letter be of October 2 via halifax accompany you sermon on fast day the letter give I great pleasure but i must confess that the sentiment in the sermon appear very _ strange _ to I know what i as well as every american here do respect the cause of the present war ` tis the character of englishman to be haughty proud and overbearing if this conduct meet with no resistance they treatment become more imperious and the more submissive and conciliate be the object of they imperiousness the more tyrannical be they towards it this have be they uniform treatment towards we and this character pervade all rank of society whether in public or private life the only way to please john bull be to give he a good beating and such be the singularity of he character that the more you beat he the greater be he respect for you and the more he will esteem you if after all i have now write you still think that this war be unjust and think it worth the trouble in order to ascertain the truth i wish papa would take a trip across the atlantic if he be not convince of the truth of what i have write in less than two month i will agree to support myself all the time i be in england after this date and never be a farthing 's more expense to you i be glad to hear that cousin samuel breese be in the navy i really envy he very much i hope one day as a painter i may be able to hand he down to posterity as a american nelson as to my letter of introduction i find that a painter and a visitor can not be unite be i to deliver my letter the acquaintance could not be keep up and the bare thought of encounter the english reserve be enough to deter any one this objection however might be get over do it not take up so much time every moment be precious to I now i do not know how soon i may be oblige to return home for want of means to support I for the difficulty which be increase in this country take off the attention of the people from the fine art and they withhold that patronage from young artist which they would from they liberality in other circumstance freely bestow you mention that some of the ralston family be in boston on a visit and that mr codman be attach to eliza once in my life you know if you have tell I this and i have be a very bloody-minded young man who know but mr codman might have be challenge but i suppose he take advantage of my be in england if it be as you say i be very happy to hear it for elizabeth be a girl whom i very much esteem and there be no doubt that she will make a excellent wife in a letter from he mother of July 6 1818 she thus reassure he : mr codman be marry he marry a miss wheeler of newburyport so you will have no need of challenge he on account of eliza ralston in a postscript to the letter of November 1 morse add : -- i have just read the political part of this letter to my good friend mr a -- n and he not only approve of the sentiment in it but pay I a compliment by say that i have express the truth and nothing but the truth in a very clear and proper manner and hope it may do good among young morse 's friend in england at that time be henry thornton philanthropist and member of parliament in a letter to he parent of January 1 1813 he say : -- last Thursday week i receive a very polite invitation from henry thornton esq to dine with he which i accept i have no introduction to he but hear that you son be in the country he find I out and have show I every attention he be a very pleasant sensible man but he character be too well know to you to need any eulogium from I at he table be a son of mr stephen who be the author of the odious order in council mr thornton ask I at table if i think that if the order in council have be repeal a month or two sooner it would not have prevent the war i tell he i think it would at which he be much pleased and turn to mr stephen he say : ` do you hear that mr stephen i always tell you so ' last Wednesday i dine at mr wilberforce 's i be extremely pleased with he at he house i meet mr grant and mr thornton member of parliament in the course of conversation they introduce america and mr wilberforce regret the war extremely he say it be like two of the same family quarrel that he think it a judgment on this country for its wickedness and that they have be justly punish for they arrogance and insolence at sea as well as the american for they vaunt on land as mr thornton be go he invite I to spend a day or two at he seat at clapham a few mile out of town i accordingly go and be very civilly treat the _ reserve _ which i mention in a former letter be evident however here and i feel a degree of embarrassment arise from it which i never feel in america the second day i be a little more at my ease at dinner be the two son of the mr grant i mention above they be perhaps the most promising young man in the country and you may possibly one day hear of they as at the head of the nation -lrb- one of these young man be afterwards raise to the peerage as lord glenelg -rrb- after dinner i get into conversation with they and with mr thornton when america again become the topic they ask I a great many question respect america which i answer to the best of my ability they at length ask I if i do not think that the rule party in america be very much under french influence i reply ` no ' that i believe on the contrary that nine tenth of the american people be prepossess strongly in favor of this country as a proof i urge the universal prevalence of english fashion in preference to french and english manners and custom the universal rejoicing on the success of the english over the french the marked attention show to english traveller and visitor the neglect with which they treat they own literary production on account of the strong prejudice in favor of english work that everything in short be enhance in its value by have attach to it the name english on the other hand i tell they that the french be a people almost universally despise in america and by at least one half hate as in england they be esteem the common enemy of mankind that french fashion be discountenance and loathe that a frenchman be consider as a man always to be suspect that young man be forbid by they parent in many instance to associate with they they consider they company and habit as tend to subvert they moral and to render they frivolous and insincere i add that in america as well as everywhere else there be bad man man of no principle whose conscience never stand in the way of they ambition or avarice but that i firmly believe that as a body the american congress be as pure from corruption and foreign influence as any body of man in the world they be much pleased with what i tell they and acknowledge that america and american visitor generally have be treat with too much contempt and neglect in the course of the day i ask mr thornton what be the object that the english government have in view when they lay the order in council he tell I in direct term ' _ the universal monopoly of commerce _ ' that they have long desire a excuse for such measure as the order in council and that the french decree be exactly what they wish and the opportunity be seize with avidity the moment it be offer they know that the order in council bear hard upon the american but they consider that as merely _ incidental _ to this i reply that if such be the case as he represent it what blame could be attach to the american government for declare war he say that it be urge that america ought to have consider the circumstance of the case and that great britain be fight for the liberty of the world that america be in a great degree interested in the decision of the contest and that she ought to be content to suffer a little i tell he that england have no right whatever to infringe on the neutrality of america or to expect because she -lrb- england -rrb- suppose herself to have justice on she side in the contest with france that of course the american should think the same the moment america declare this opinion she neutrality cease ` besides ' say i ` how can they have the face to make such a declaration when you just now say that they object be universal monopoly and they long for a excuse to adopt measure to that end ' i tell he that it show that all the noise about england 's fight for the liberty of mankind prove to be but a thirst a selfish desire for _ universal monopoly _ this he say seem to be the case he could not deny it he be go on to observe something respect the french decree when we be interrupted and i have not be able again to resume the conversation i return to town with he shortly after in he carriage where as there be stranger i could not introduce it again after this follow two long page give further reason for the stand he have take which i shall not include only quote the follow sentence towards the end of the letter : -- you will have hear before this arrive of the glorious news from russium bonaparte be for once _ defeat _ and will probably never again recover from it my regard to mr stuart -lrb- gilbert stuart -rrb- i feel quite flatter at he remembrance of I tell he that by come to england i know how more justly to appreciate he great merit there be really no one in england who equal he accompany this be some newspaper some of cobbett 's a man of no principle and a great rascal yet a man of sense and say many good thing i have quote at length from this letter in order that we may gain a clearer insight into the character of the man while in no wise neglect he main object in life he yet could not help take a deep interest in public affair he be frank and outspoken in he opinion but courteous withal he abhor hypocrisy and vice and be unsparing in he condemnation of both he enjoy a controversy and be quick to discover the weak point in he opponent 's argument and to make the most of they these characteristic he carry with he through life become however broader-minded and more tolerant as he grow in year and experience morse 's father have give he many letter of introduction to eminent man in england most of these he neglect to deliver plead in extenuation of he apparent carelessness that he could not spare the time from he artistic study to fulfill all the duty that would be expect of he in society and that he also could not afford the expense necessary to a well-dressed man the follow note from william wilberforce explain itself but there seem to be some confusion of date for morse have just say in he letter of January 1st that he dine at mr wilberforce 's over a week before kensington gore January 4 1813 sir -- i can not help entertain some apprehension of my not have receive some letter or some card which you may have do I the favor of leave at my house be this however as it may i gladly avail myself of the sanction of a letter from you father for introduce myself to you and as many call be mere matter of form i take the liberty of beg the favor of you company at dinner on Wednesday next at a quarter before five o'clock at kensington gore -lrb- one mile from hyde park corner -rrb- and of thereby secure the pleasure of a acquaintance with you the high respect which i have always entertain for you father in addition to the many oblige mark of attention which i have receive from he render I desirous of become personally know to you and enable I with truth to assure you i be with good will sir you faithful servant w wilberforce among morse 's friend in london during the period of he student year be coleridge roger lamb and other whose name be familiar one in the literary world while the letter of those day give only hint of the delightful intercourse between these congenial soul the recollection of they be enshrine in the memory of some of they contemporary and the follow reminiscence preserve by mr jame wynne and record by mr prune in he biography will be find interesting : -- coleridge who be a visitor at the room of leslie and morse frequently make he appearance under the influence of those fit of despondency to which he be subject on these occasion by a preconcerted plan they often draw he from this state to one of brilliant imagination ' i be just wish to see you ' say morse on one of these occasion when coleridge enter with a hesitating step and reply to they frank salutation with a gloomy aspect and deep-drawn sigh ` leslie and myself have have a dispute about certain line of beauty which be right ' and then each argue with the other for a few moment until coleridge become interested and rousing from he fit of despondency speak with a eloquence and depth of metaphysical reasoning on the subject far beyond the comprehension of he auditor they point however be gain and coleridge be again the eloquent the profound the gifted be which he remarkable production show he to be ` on one occasion ' say morse ' i hear he improvise for half a hour in blank verse what he state to be a strange dream which be full of those wonderful creation that glitter like diamond in he poetical production ' ` all of which ' remark i ` be undoubtedly lose to the world ' ` not all ' reply mr morse ` for i recognize in the ancient mariner some of the thought of that evening but doubtless the greater part which would have make the reputation of any other man perish with the moment of inspiration never again to be recall ' when he tragedy of ` remorse ' which have a run of twenty-one night be first bring out washington allston charle king leslie lamb morse and coleridge go together to witness the performance they occupy a box near the stage and each of the party be as much interested in its success as coleridge himself the effect of the frequent applause upon coleridge be very manifest but when at the end of the piece he be call for by the audience the intensity of he emotion be such as none but one gifted with the fine sensibility of a poet could experience fortunately the audience be satisfy with a mere presentation of himself he emotion would have preclude the idea of he speak on such a occasion allston soon after this become so much out of health that he think a change of air and a short residence in the country might relieve he he accordingly set out on he journey accompany by leslie and morse when he reach salt hill near oxford he become so ill as to be unable to proceed and request morse to return to town for he medical attendant dr tuthill and coleridge to whom he be ardently attach morse accordingly return and procure a post-chaise immediately set out for salt hill a distance of twenty-two mile accompany by coleridge and dr tuthill they arrive late in the evening and be busy with allston until midnight when he become easier and morse and coleridge leave he for the night upon repair to the sitting-room of the hotel morse open knickerbocker 's ` history of new york ' which he have throw into the carriage before leave town coleridge ask he what work he have ` oh ' reply he ` it be only a american book ' ` let I see it ' say coleridge he accordingly hand it to he and coleridge be soon bury in its page mr morse overcome by the fatigue of the day soon after retire to he chamber and fall asleep on awaken next morning he repair to the sitting-room when what be he astonishment to find it still close with the light burn and coleridge busy with the book he have lend he the previous night ` why coleridge ' say he approach he ` have you be read the whole night ' ` why ' remark coleridge abstractedly ` it be not late ' morse reply by throw open the blind and permit the broad daylight for it be now ten o'clock to stream in upon they ` indeed ' say coleridge ' i have no conception of this but the work have please I exceedingly it be admirably write pray who be its author ' he be inform that it be the production of washington irve it be needless to say that during the long residence of irving in london they become warm friend at this period mr abernethy be in the full tide of he popularity as a surgeon and allston who have for some little time have a grumble pain in he thigh propose to morse to accompany he to the house of the distinguished surgeon to consult he on the cause of the ailment as allston have he hand on the bell-pull the door be open and a visitor pass out immediately follow by a coarse-looking person with a large shaggy head of hair whom allston at once take for a domestic he accordingly enquire if mr abernethy be in ` what do you want of mr abernethy ' demand this uncouth-looking person with the harshest possible scotch accent ' i wish to see he ' gently reply allston somewhat shock by the coarseness of he reception ` be he at home ' ` come in come in mon ' say the same uncouth personage ` but he may be engage ' respond allston ` perhaps i have better call another time ' ` come in mon i say ' reply the person address and partly by persuasion and partly by force allston follow by morse be induce to enter the hall which they have no sooner do than the person who admit they close the street door and place he back against it say : -- ` now tell I what be you business with mr abernethy i be mr abernethy ' ' i have come to consult you ' reply allston ` about a affection -- ' ` what the de'il hae i to do with you affection ' bluntly interpose abernethy ` perhaps mr abernethy ' say allston by this time so completely overcome by the apparent rudeness of the eminent surgeon as to regret call on he at all ` you be engage at present and i have better call again ' ` de'il the bit de'il the bit mon ' say abernethy ` come in come in ' and he precede they to he office and examine he case which prove to be a slight one with such gentleness as almost to lead they to doubt whether abernethy within he consulting-room and abernethy whom they have encounter in the passage be really the same personage while morse be enjoy all these new experience in england the good people at home be jogging along in they accustomed rut but be deeply interested in the doings of the absent son and brother he mother write on January 11 1813 : -- you letter be read with great pleasure by you acquaintance i do not show those in which you say anything on _ politics _ as i do not approve you _ change _ and think it would only prejudice other for that reason i do not wish you to write on that subject as i love to read all you observation to you friend we can not get edward to be a lady ' man at all he will not visit among the young lady he be as old as fifty at least this same youthful misogynist and philosopher also write to he brother on January 11 : i intend soon write another letter in which i shall prove to you satisfaction that poetry be much superior to painting you assert the contrary in one of you letter and bring a argument to prove it i shall show the fallacy of that argument and bring those to support my doctrine which be incontrovertible a letter from he friend mr jarvis the sister of he erstwhile flame miss jannette hart inform he of the marriage of another sister to captain hull of the navy commander of the constitution in this letter write on march 4 1813 at bloomingdale new york city mr jarvi say : -- i be in general proud of the spirit of my countryman but there be too little attention pay to the fine art to man of taste and science man here be weigh by he purse not by he mind and accord to the preponderance of that he rise or sink in the scale of individual opinion a fine painting or marble statue be very rare in the house of the rich of this city and those individual who would not pay fifty pound for either expend double that sum to vie with a neighbor in a piece of furniture but do not tell tale i would not say this to a englishman and i trust you have not yet become one this however be poor encouragement for you to return to you native country i hope better thing of that country before you may return a friend in philadelphium write to he on may 3 1813 : -- you favor i receive from the hand of mr king and have be very much gratify with the introduction it afford I to this worthy gentleman you have doubtless hear of he safe arrival in we city and of he have commence he career in america where i be sorry to say the art be not as yet so much patronize as i hope to see they those of we who love they be too poor and those who be wealthy regard they but little i think however i have already witness a improvement in this respect and the rich merchant and professional man be become more and more liberal in they patronage of genius when they find it among native american from the favorable circumstance under which you study be progress from the unrivalled talent of the gentleman who conduct they and without flattery suffer I to add from the early proof of you own genius i anticipate in common with many of we fellow citizen the addition of one artist to we present roll whose name shall stand high among those of american painter in you companion leslie we also calculate on a very distinguished character we academy of fine art have begin the all-important study of the live figure mr sully mr peale mr fainnan mr king and several other have devote much attention to this branch of the school and i hope to see it in they hand highly useful and improve the last annual exhibition be very splendid _ for we _ some very capital landscape be produce many admirable portrait and one or two historical picture the most conspicuous painting be mr peale 's picture of the ` roman charity ' -lrb- or if you please the ` grecian daughter ' for murphy have it so -rrb- and mr sully 's ` lady of the lake ' in a letter of may 30 1818 to a friend morse say : -- you ask in you letter what book i read and what i be paint the little time that i can spare from painting i employ in reading and study the old poet spenser chaucer dante tasso etc these be necessary to a painter as to painting i have just finish a large picture eight foot by six foot six inch the subject the ` death of hercule ' which be now in the royal academy exhibition at somerset house i have be flatter by the newspaper which seldom praise young artist and they do I the honor to say that my picture with that of another young man by the name of monroe form a distinguish trait in this year 's exhibition this praise i consider much exaggerated mr west however who see it as soon as i have finish it pay I many compliment and tell I that be i to live to he age i should never make a better composition this i consider but a compliment and as mean only to encourage I and as such i receive it i mention these circumstance merely to show that i be get along as well as can be expect and if any credit attach to I i willingly resign it to my country and feel happy that i can contribute a mite to she honor the american character stand high in this country as to the production of artist but in nothing else -lrb- except indeed i may now say _ bravery _ -rrb- mr west now stand at the head and have stand ever since the art begin to flourish in this country which be only about fifty year mr copley next then colonel trumbull stuart in america have no rival here as these be now old man and go off the stage mr allston succeed in the prime of life and will in the opinion of the greatest connoisseur in this country carry the art to greater perfection than it ever have be carry either in ancient or modern time after he be a young man from philadelphium by the name of leslie who be my room-mate how fallible be contemporary judgment on the claim of so-called genius to immortality for many be call but few be choose in another letter to he parent write about this time after tell of he economy in order to make the money advance so cheerfully but at the cost of so much self-sacrifice on they part last as long as possible he add : my greatest expense next to _ living _ be for canvas frame color etc and visit gallery the frame of my large picture which i have just finish cost nearly twenty pound besides the canvas and color which cost nearly eight pound more and the frame be the cheapest i could possibly get mr allston 's frame cost he sixty guinea frame be very expensive thing and on that account i shall not attempt another large picture for some time although mr west advise I to paint _ large _ as much as possible the picture which i have finish be ` the death of hercule ' the size be eight foot by six foot six inch this picture i show to mr west a few week ago and he be extremely pleased with it and pay I very many high compliment but as praise come better from another than from one 's self i shall send you a complimentary note which mr west have promise to send I on the occasion i send the picture to the exhibition at somerset house which open on the 3d of may and have the satisfaction not only of have it receive but of have the praise of the council who decide on the admission of picture six hundred be refuse admission this year so you may suppose that a picture -lrb- of the size of mine too -rrb- must possess some merit to be receive in preference to six hundred a small picture may be receive even if it be not very good because it will serve to fill up some little space which would otherwise be empty but a large one from its exclude many smaller one must possess a great deal in its favor in order to be receive if you recollect i tell you i have complete a model of a single figure of the same subject this i send to the society of art at the adelphus to stand for the prize -lrb- which be offer every year for the best performance in painting sculpture and architecture and be a _ gold medal _ -rrb- yesterday i receive the note accompany this by which you will see that it be adjudge to I in sculpture this year it will be deliver to I in public on the 13th of may or June i do not know which but i shall give you a particular account of the whole process as soon as i have receive it i can not close this letter without tell you how much i be indebted to that excellent man mr allston he be extremely partial to I and have often tell I that he be proud of call I he pupil he visit I every evening and we conversation be generally upon the inexhaustible subject of we divine art and upon _ home _ which be next in we thought i know not in what term to speak of mr allston i can truly say i do not know the slightest imperfection in he he be amiable affectionate learn possess of the greatest power of mind and genius modest unassuming and above all a religious man i could write a quire of paper in he praise but all i could say of he would give you but a very imperfect idea of he you must recollect when you tell friend that i be study in england that i be a pupil of allston and not mr west they will not long ask who mr allston be he will very soon astonish the world he claim I as he pupil and tell I a day or two since in a jocose manner that he should have a battle with mr west unless he give up all pretension to I we gain further information concern morse 's first triumph he painting and he statuette from the follow reminiscence of a friend mr dunlap : -- it be about the year 1812 that allston commence he celebrated picture of the ` dead man restore to life by touch the bone of elisha ' which be now in the pennsylvanium academy of art in the study of this picture he make a model in clay of the head of the dead man to assist he in paint the expression this be the practice of the most eminent old master morse have begin a large picture to come out before the british public at the royal academy exhibition the subject be the ` die hercule ' and in order to paint it with the more effect he follow the example of allston and determine to model the figure in clay it be he first attempt at model he original intention be simply to complete such part of the figure as be useful in the single view necessary for the purpose of painting but have do this he be encourage by the approbation of allston and other artist to finish the entire figure after complete it he have it cast in plaster of pari and carry it to show to west who seem more than please with it after survey it all round critically with many exclamation of surprise he send he servant to call he son raphael as soon as raphael make he appearance west point to the figure and say : ` look there sir i have always tell you any painter can make a sculptor ' from this model morse paint he picture of the ` die hercule ' of colossal size and send it in may 1813 to the royal academy exhibition at somerset house the picture be well receive a critic of one of the journal of that day in speaking of the royal academy thus notice morse : -- of the academician two or three have distinguish themselves in a preëminent degree besides few have add much to they fame perhaps they have hardly sustain it but the great feature in this exhibition be that it present several work of very high merit by artist with whose performance and even with whose name we be hitherto unacquainted at the head of this class be messr monroe and morse

write to he parent : -- i have just hear of the unfortunate capture of the chesapeake be we infant hercule to be strangle at he birth where be the spirit of former time which kindle in the heart of the bostonian will they still be unmoved or must they learn from more bitter experience that britain be not for peace and that the only way to procure it be to join heart and hand in a vigorous prosecution of the war it be not the time now to think of party the country be in danger but i hope to hear soon that the honor of we navy be retrieve the brave captain lawrence will never i be sure be forget he career of glory have be short but brilliant all be rejoice here illuminations and firework and _ feux de joie _ for the capture of the chesapeake and a victory in spain imagine yourself if possible in my situation in a enemy 's country and hearing song of triumph and exultation on the misfortune of my countryman and this too on the 4th of July a less ardent spirit than mine might perhaps tolerate it but i can not i do long to be at home to be in the navy and teach these insolent englishman how to respect we the marquis wellington have achieve a great victory in spain and bid fair to drive the french out very soon at this i rejoice as ought every man who abhor tyranny and love liberty i wish the british success against everything but _ my country _ i often say with cowper : ` england with all thy fault i love thee still ' i be longing for edward ' comparison between poetry and painting and to know how he will prove the former superior to the latter a painter _ must _ be a poet but a poet need not be a painter how will he get over this argument by the way mr allston have just publish a volume of poem a copy of which i will endeavor to send you they be but just publish so that the opinion of the public be not yet ascertain but there be no doubt they will forever put at rest the calumny that america have never produce a poet i have lately be enquire for the coat-of-arm which belong to the morse family for this purpose i wish to know from what part of this kingdom the morse emigrate and if you can recollect anything that belong to the arm if you will answer these question minutely i can for half a crown ascertain the arm and crest which belong to the family which -lrb- as there be a degree of importance attach to heraldry in this country -rrb- may be well to know i have see the arm of one morse which have be in the family three hundred year so we can trace we antiquity as far as any family a letter from a college-mate mr joseph hillhouse write in boston on July 12 1813 give a pretty picture of morse 's home and contain some quaint gossip which i shall transcribe : -- on Saturday afternoon the beauty of the weather invite my cousin catherine borland my sister mary -lrb- who be here on a visit -rrb- and myself to take a walk over to charlestown for the purpose of pay a visit to you good parent we find they just prepare tea and at once

and emily on my knee i deprecate you wrath i have substitute william for henry and henry for william no henry be nancy 's and william emily 's they be twin and i forsooth must make they changeling in a letter of July 30 1813 he mother thus exhort he : -- i hope my dear son you success in you profession will not have a tendency to make you vain or embolden you to look down on any in you profession whom providence may have be less favorable to in point of talent for this particular business and that you will observe a modesty in the reception of premium and praise on account of you talent that shall show to those who bestow they that you be worthy of they in more sens than merely as a artist it will likewise convince those who be less favor that you be far from exult in they disappointment -- as i hope be truly the case -- and prevent that jealousy and envy that too often discover itself in those of the same profession we exceedingly rejoice in all you success and hope you will persevere remember my son it be easier to get a reputation than to keep it unspotted in the midst of so much pollution as we be surround by c dexter thanks you for you attention to she request as it respect southey 's likeness she do not wish you to take too much pain and trouble to get it but she i know would be greatly pleased if you should send she one of he if you should get acquaint with he inform he that a very sensible fine young lady in america request it -lrb- but do not tell he she name -rrb- from have read he work in a long letter of August 10 and 26 1813 after again give free rein to he political feeling he return to the subject of he art : -- mr west promise I a note to you but he be a old man and very forgetful and i suppose he have forget it i do not wish to remind he of it directly but if in the course of conversation i can contrive to mention it i will with respect to return home next summer mr allston and mr west think it would be a injury to I mr allston say i ought not to return till i be a _ painter _ i long to return as much as you can wish to have I but if you can spare I a little longer i should wish it i abide you decision however completely mr allston will write you fully on this subject and i will endeavor to persuade mr west also to do it france i could not at present visit with advantage that be to say for perhaps a year mr allston think i ought to be previously well ground in the principle of the english school to resist the corruption of the french school for they be corrupt in the principle of painting as in religion and everything else but when well ground in the good principle of this school i could study and select the few beauty of the french without be in danger of follow they many error the louvre also would in about a year be of the greatest advantage to I and also the fine work in italy mama have amuse I very much in she letter where she write on politics she say that next to change one 's religion she would dislike a man for change he politics mama perhaps be not aware that she would in this way shut the door completely to conviction in anything it would imply that because a man be educate in error he must forever live in error i know exactly how mama feel she think as i do when at home that it be impossible for the federalist to be in the wrong but as all man be fallible i think they may stand a chance of be wrong as well as any other class of people mama think my ' _ error _ ' arise from wrong information i will ask mama which of we be likely to get at the truth i who be in england and can see and hear all they motive for act as they have do or mama who get she information from the federal papers second-hand with numerous addition and improvement make to answer party purpose distort and misrepresent but to give you a instance in the massachusett remonstrance they attribute the repeal of the order in council to the kind disposition of the english government and a wish on they part to do justice whereas it be notorious in this country that they repeal they on account of the injury it be do themselves and take america into consideration about as much as they do the inhabitant of kamschatka the conditional repeal of the berlin and milan decree be a back door for they and they avail themselves of it to sneak out of it this necessity this act of dire necessity the federal papers cry up as evince a most forbearing spirit towards we and really astonish the english themselves who never dream that it could be twist in that way mama assign as a reason for my think well of the english that they have be very polite to I and that it be ingratitude in I if i do otherwise a few individual have treat I politely and i do feel thankful and gratified for it but a little politeness from a individual of one nation to a individual of another be certainly not a reason that the former 's government should be esteem incapable of wrong by the latter i esteem the english as a nation i rejoice in they conquest on the continent and would love they heartily if they would let I but i be afraid to tell they this they be already too proud they treatment of america be the worse for it they be like a poor man who have get a lottery ticket and draw a great prize and when he poor neighbor come sincerely to congratulate he on he success he hold up he head and turn up he nose tell he that now he be he superior and then kick he out of door papa say he expect peace in six month it may be in the disposition of america to make peace but not in the will of the english it be in the power of the federalist to force she to peace but they will not do it so she will force we to do it as in most discussion political or otherwise neither party seem to have be convince by the argument of the other for the parent continue to urge he to leave politics alone indeed they insist on he do so they also urge he to make every effort to support himself if he should decide to spend another year abroad for they fear that they will be unable to send he any more money however the father when he become convinced that it be really to he son 's interest to spend another year abroad contrived to send he another thousand dollar this be do at the cost of great self-sacrifice on the part of himself and he family and be all the more praiseworthy on that account in a letter from he brother edward write also on the 17th of November be this passage : i must defer give my reason for think poetry superior to painting i will mention only a few of the principle upon which i find my judgment genius in both these art be the power of make impression the question then be : which be capable of make the strongest impression which can impress upon the mind most strongly a sublime or a beautiful idea do the sublimest passage in milton excite a stronger sensation in the mind of a man of taste than the sublimest painting of michael angelo or to make the parallel more complete do michael angelo convey to you a stronger impression of the last judgment by he painting than milton could by he poetry could michael angelo convey a more sublime idea of death by he painting than milton have in he ` paradise lose ' these be the principle upon which you ` divine art ' be to be degrade below poetry this be rather acute reasoning for a boy of twenty who have spend he life in the boston and new haven of those early day the fact that he have never see a great painting whereas he have greedily read the poet will probably account for he strong partisanship the pious mother write on November 25 1813 : -- with regard to the american be despise and hate in england you be apprise by you uncle salisbury and other before you leave this country that that be the case and you ought not to be surprise when you realize it the reason give be that a large portion of those who visit europe be _ dissipate infidel _ which have justly give the english a bad opinion of we as a nation but we be happy to find that there be many exception to these who do honor to the country which give they birth such as a west a allston and many other among whom i be happy to say we hope that you my son will be enrol at no very distant day you mention be acquaint with young payne the play actor i would guard you against any acquaintance with that description of people as it will sooner or later have a most corrupting effect on the moral and as a man be know by the company he keep i should be very sorry to have you enrol with such society however pure you may believe he moral to be you father and myself be eleven day in company with he in come from charleston south carolina he behavior be quite unexceptionable then but he be in a situation to ruin the best moral i hope you do not attend the theater as i have ever consider it a most bewitching amusement and ruinous both to soul and body i would therefore guard you against it he brother richard join the rest of the family in urge the young and impulsive artist to leave politics alone as we learn from the follow word which begin a letter of November 27 1813 : -- my dear brother -- you letter by the neptune and also the medal give we great pleasure the politics however be very disagreeable and occupied no inconsiderable part of you letter you kind wish for _ we _ reformation we must beg leave to retort by hope for _ you _ speedy amendment there be gap in the correspondence of this period many of the letter from both side of the atlantic seem never to have reach they destination owe to the disturbed state of affair arise from the war between the two country the young artist have go in October 1813 to bristol at the earnest solicitation of friend in that city and seem to have spend a pleasant and profitable five month there paint a number of portrait he refer to letter write from bristol but they be either never receive or not preserve of other letter i have only fragment and some that be quote by mr prime in he biography have vanish utterly still from what remain we can glean a fairly good idea of the life of the young man at that period he parent continually beg he to leave politics alone and to tell they more of he artistic life of he visit to interesting place and of he intercourse with the literary and artistic celebrity of the day we too must regret that he do not write more fully on these subject for there must have be a mine of interesting material at he disposal we also learn that there seem to have be a strange fatality attach to the little statuette of the die hercule for although he pack it carefully and send it to liverpool on June 18 1813 to be forward to he parent it never reach they until over two year later the superstitious will say that the date of send may have have something to do with this up to this time everything except the attitude of england towards america have be _ couleur de rise _ to the enthusiastic young artist he be make rapid progress in he study and be receive the encomium of he fellow artist and of the critic he parent be deny themselves in order to provide the means for he support and while he be duly appreciative of they goodness he could not help take it more or less as a matter of course he be optimistic with regard to the future fall into the common error of gifted young artist that because of they artistic success financial success must of necessity follow he have yet to be prove in the school of adversity and he have not long to wait but i shall let the letter tell the story better than i can the last letter from he to he parent from which i have quote be write on August 12 and 26 1813 on march 12 1814 he write from london after he return from bristol : -- there be a great drawback to my write long letter to you i mean the uncertainty of they reach you mama 's long letter give I particular pleasure some of she observation however make I smile especially the reason she assign for the contempt and hatred of england for america first i be incline to doubt the fact of there be so many _ infidel _ american in the country second if there be there be not so many _ religious _ people here who would take the pain to enquire whether they have religion or not and third it be not by see the individual american that a opinion unfavorable to we be prevalent in england with respect to my religious sentiment they be unshaken they influence i hope will always guide I through life i hear various preaching on sunday sometimes mr burder but most commonly the church of england clergy as a church be in my neighborhood and mr b 's three mile distant i most commonly hear dr biddulph of st jame 's church a most excellent orthodox evangelical man i be on the point many time of go to hear mr lowell who be one of the dissent clergyman of bristol but as the weather prove very unfavorable uncommonly so every Sunday i be there and i be at a great distance from he church i be disappointed i shall endeavor to hear he preach when i go back to bristol again this be in reply to many long exhortation in he parent ' letter and especially in he mother 's couch in the extravagant language of the very pious of those day to seek first the welfare of he never-dying soul i have return from bristol to attend the exhibition and to endeavor to get a picture into somerset house my stay in bristol be very pleasant indeed as well as profitable i be there five month and in may shall probably go again and stay all summer i be get into good business in the portrait way there and if i return shall be enable probably to support myself as long as i stay in england the attention show I by mr harman visger and family whom i have mention in a former letter i shall never forget he be a rich merchant a american -lrb- cousin to captain visscher my fellow passenger by whom i be introduce to he -rrb- he have a family of seven child i live within a few door of he and be in and out of he house ever day four page of this letter be unfortunately miss it begin again abruptly : -- prevent by illness from write you before i shall endeavor to support myself if not necessity will compel I to return home a unfinished painter it depend altogether on circumstance i may get a good run of portrait or i may not it depend so much on the whim of the public if they should happen to fancy my picture i shall succeed if not why i shall not succeed i be however encourage to hope if i be prohibit from write or think of politics i hope my brother will not be so ungenerous as to give I any mr allston 's large picture be now exhibit in the british gallery it have excite a great deal of curiosity and he have obtain a wonderful share of praise for it the picture be very deservedly rank among the highest production of art either in ancient or modern time it be really a pleasant consideration that the palm of painting still rest with america and be in all probability destine to remain with we all we wish be a taste in the country and a little more wealth in order to create a taste however picture first-rate picture must be introduce into the country for taste be only acquire by a close study of the merit of the old master in philadelphium i be happy to find they have successfully begin i wish american would unite in the thing throw aside local prejudice and give they support to _ one _ institution let it be in philadelphium since it be so happily begin there and let every american feel a pride in support that institution let it be a national not a city institution then might the art be so encouraged that american might remain at home and not as at present be under the painful necessity of exile themselves from they country and they friend this will come to pass in the course of time but not in my day i fear unless there be more exertion make to forward the art than at present in this he prove a true prophet and as we shall see later he exertion be a potent factor in establish the fine art on a firm basis in new york i be in very good health and i hope i feel grateful for it i have not be ill for two day together since i have be in england i be however of the _ walking-stick _ order and think i be thinner than i be at home they all tell I so i be not so good-looking either i be tell i have lose my color grow more sallow and have a face approach to the hatchet class but none of these thing concern I if i can paint good-looking plump lady and gentleman i shall feel satisfied we have have a dreadfully severe winter here in england such as have not be know for twenty-two year when i come from bristol the snow be up on each side of the road as high as the top of the coach in many place especially on marlborough down and hounslow heath he friend mr visger thus write to he from bristol on April 1 1814 : -- it give I pleasure to learn that mr leslie sell he picture of saul etc at so good a price i hope it will stimulate a friend of he to use he best exertion and time to endeavor even to excel the ` witch of endor ' i think i perceive a few symptom of amendment in he and the request of he father that he must support himself be in the opinion of he friend here the best thing that could have befall he he will now have the pleasure to taste the sweet of he own labor and i hope will in reality know what true independence be let he not despair and he will certainly succeed excuse my have take up so much of you time in read what i have write about mr leslie 's friend i hope it will not make the pencil work less smoothly it give we all great pleasure to hear that mr allston 's ` dead and alive man ' get the prize it would be a great addition to we pleasure to hear that those encourager of the fine art have offer he fifteen hundred or two thousand guinea for it there be a old lady wait you return to have she portrait paint bangley say one or two more be enquire for mr morse you seem to have forget you friend in stapleton prison do you not succeed in obtain he release this refer to a certain mr benjamin burritt a american prisoner of war morse use every effort through he friend henry thornton to secure the release of mr burritt on December 30 1813 he write to mr thornton from bristol : -- respected sir -- i take the liberty of address you in behalf of a american prisoner of war now in the stapleton depot and i address you sir under the conviction that a petition in the cause of humanity will not be consider by you as obtrusive the prisoner i allude to be a gentleman of the name of burritt a native of new haven in the state of connecticut he connection be of the highest respectability in that city which be notorious for its adherence to federal principle he friend and relative be among my father 's friend and although i be not until now personally acquaint with he yet he face be familiar to I and many of he relative be my particular friend while i be receive my education at yale college in new haven from that college he be graduate in the year -- a classmate of he be the reverend mr stuart who be one of the professor of the andover theological institution and of whom i think my father have speak in some of he letter to mr wilberforce mr burritt after he leave college apply himself to study so much so as to injure he health and by the advice of he physician he take to the sea as the only remedy leave for he this have the desire effect and he be restore to health in a considerable degree upon the break out of the war with this country all the american coast trade be destroy he take a situation as second mate in the schooner revenge bind to france and be capture on the 10th of may 1813 since that time he have be a prisoner and from the enclosed certificate you will ascertain what have be he conduct he be a man of excellent religious principle and i firmly believe of the strictest integrity so well assure be i of this that in case it should be require _ i will hold myself bind to answer for he in my own person _ he health be suffer by he confinement and the unprincipled society which he be oblige to endure be peculiarly disagreeable to a man of he education my object in state these particulars to you sir be -lrb- if possible and consistent with the law of the country -rrb- to obtain for he through you influence he liberty on he parole of honor by so do you will probably be the means of preserve the life of a good man and will lay he friend my father and myself under the greatest obligation trust to you goodness to pardon this intrusion upon you time i be sir with the highest consideration you most humble obedient servant samuel fb morse to this mr thornton reply : -- dear sir -- you will perceive by the enclose that there be unhappily no prospect of we effect we wish in respect to you poor friend at bristol i shall be glad to know whether you have have any success in obtain a passport for dr cushing i be dear sir yours etc h thornton the enclosure refer to by mr thornton be the following letter address to he by lord melville : -- sir -- mr hay have communicate to I a letter which he receive from you on the subject of benjamin burritt a american prisoner of war in the depot at stapleton i regret much that after consult on this case with sir rupert george and ascertain the usual course of procedure in similar instance i can not discover any circumstance that would justify a departure from the rule observe toward other prisoner of the same description there can be no question that he case be a hard one but i be afraid that it be inseparable from a state of war it be not only not a solitary instance among the french and american prisoner but unless we be prepare to adopt the system of release all other of the same description we should find that the number who might justly complain of undue partiality to this man would be very considerable i have the honor to be sir you most obedient and very humble servant melville this be a great disappointment to morse who have set he heart on be the means of secure the liberty of this unfortunate man he be compel to bow to the inevitable however and after this he do what he could to make the unhappy situation of the prisoner more bearable by extend to he financial assistance although he have but little to spare at that time himself and could but ill afford the luxury of give great event be occur on the continent at this time and it be interesting to note how the intelligence of they be receive in england by a enthusiastic student not only of the fine art but of the humanities who feel that in this case he sympathy and those of he family be in accord : -- April 6 1814 my dear parent -- i write in much haste but it be to inform you of a most glorious event no less than the capture of pari by the ally they enter it last Thursday and you may conceive the sensation of the people of england on the occasion as the cartel be the first vessel which will arrive in america to carry the news i hope i shall have the great satisfaction of hearing that i be the first who shall inform you of this great event the particulars you will see nearly as soon as this i congratulate you and the rest of the good people of the world on the occasion _ despotism _ and _ usurpation _ be fall never i hope to rise again but what give I the greatest pleasure in the contemplation of this occurrence be the spirit of religion and consequently of humanity which have constantly mark the conduct of the ally they moderation through all they unparallelled success can not be too much extol they merit the grateful remembrance of posterity who will bless they as the restorer of a blessing but little enjoy by the greater part of mankind for century i mean the inestimable blessing of _ peace _ but i must cut short my feeling on the subject be i to give they scope they would fill quire they be as ardent as yours possibly can be suffice it to say that i see the hand of providence so strongly in it that i think a infidel must be convert by it and i hope i feel as a christian should on such a occasion i be well in excellent spirit and shall use my utmost endeavor to support myself for now more than ever be it necessary for I to stay in europe peace be inevitable and the easy access to the continent and the fine work of art there render it doubly important that i should improve they to my utmost i can not ask more of my parent than they have do for I but the struggle will be hard for I to get along and improve myself at the same time portrait be the only thing which can support I at present but it be insipid indeed for one who wish to be at the head of the first branch of the art to be stop halfway and be oblige to struggle with the difficulty of maintain himself in addition to the other difficulty attendant on the profession but it be impossible to place this in a clear light in a letter i wish i could talk with you on the subject and i could in a short time make it clear to you i can not ask it of you and i do not till i try what i can do you have already do more than i deserve and it would be ingratitude in I to request more of you and i do not only i say these thing that you may not expect so much from I in the way of improvement as you may have be lead to suppose morse seem to have make a excursion into dramatic literature at about this time as the follow draft of a letter without date but evidently write to the celebrated actor charle mathew will testify : -- not have the honor of a personal acquaintance with you i have take the liberty of enclose to you a farce which if on perusal you should think worthy of the stage i beg you to accept to be perform if consistent with you plan on the night appoint for you benefit if i should be so much favor as to obtain you good opinion of it the approbation alone of mr mathew will be a sufficient reward for the task of write it the pleasure which i have so often receive from you in the exercise of you comic power would alone prompt I to make some return which might show you at least that i can be grateful to those who have at any time afford I pleasure with respect to you accept or not accept it i wish you to act you pleasure entirely if you think it will be of benefit to you by draw a full house or in any other way it be perfectly at you service if you think it will not succeed will you have the goodness to enclose it under cover and direct to mr tg artist 82 great titchfield street and i assure you beforehand that you need be under no apprehension of give I mortification by refuse it it would only convince I that i have not dramatic talent and would serve perhaps to increase my ardor in the pursuit of my professional study if however it should meet with you approbation and you should wish to see I on the subject a line direct as above enclose you address shall receive immediate attention i be as yet undecided what shall be its name the character of oxyd i have design for you the farce be a first attempt and have receive the approbation not only of my theatrical friend generally but of some confess critic by whom it have be commend with sentiment of respect and esteem i remain you most obedient humble servant tg as no further mention of this play be make i fear that the great charle mathew do not find it available there be also no trace of the play itself among the papers which be rather to be regret we can only surmise that morse come to the conclusion -lrb- very wisely -rrb- that he have no dramatic talent and that he turn to the pursuit of he professional study with increase

from a letter of washington allston to the anxious parent at home : -- with regard to the progress which you son have make i have the pleasure to say that it be unusually great for the time he have be study and indeed such as to make I proud of he as a pupil and to give every promise of future eminence should he be oblige to return _ now _ to america i much fear that all which he have acquire would be render abortive it be true he could there paint very good portrait but i should grieve to hear at any future period that on the foundation now lay he shall have be able to raise no higher superstructure than the fame of a portrait-painter i do not intend here any disrespect to portrait-painting i know it require no common talent to excel in it in addition to this _ professional report _ i have the sincere satisfaction to give my testimony to he conduct as a man which be such as to render he still worthy of be affectionately remember by he moral and religious friend in america this be say a great deal for a young man of two-and-twenty in london but be not more than justice require I to say of he on may 2 1814 morse write home : -- you ask if you be to expect I the next summer this lead I to a little enlargement on the peculiar circumstance in which i be now place mr allston 's letter by the same cartel will convince you that industry and application have not be want on my part that i have make greater progress than young man generally etc etc and of how great importance it be to I to remain in europe for some time yet to come indeed i feel it so much so myself that i shall endeavor to stay at all risk if i find that i can not support myself that i be contract debt which i have no prospect of pay i shall then return home and settle down into a mere portrait-painter for some time till i can obtain sufficient to return to europe again for i can not be happy unless i be pursue the intellectual branch of the art portrait have none of it landscape have some of it but history have it wholly i be certain you would not be satisfy to see I sit down quietly spend my time in painting portrait throw away the talent which heaven have give I for the higher branch of art and devote my time only to the inferior i need not tell you what a difficult profession i have undertake it have difficulty in itself which be sufficient to deter any man who have not firmness enough to go through with it at all hazard without meeting with any obstacle aside from it the more i study it the more i be enchant with it and the greater my progress the more be i strike with its beauty and the perseverance of those who have dare to pursue it through the thousand of natural hindrance with which the art abound i never can feel too grateful to my parent for have assist I thus far in my profession they have do more than i have any right to expect they have conduct themselves with a liberality towards I both in respect to money and to countenance I in the pursuit of one of the noblest of profession which have not many equal in this country i can not ask of they more it would be ingratitude i be now in the midst of my study when the great work of ancient art be of the utmost service to I political event have just throw open the whole continent the whole world will now leave war and bend they attention to the cultivation of the art of peace a golden age be in prospect and art be probably destine to again revive as in the fifteenth century the american at present stand unrivalled and it be my great ambition -lrb- and it be certainly a commendable one -rrb- to stand among the first my country have the most prominent place in my thought how shall i raise she name how can i be of service in refute the calumny so industriously spread against she that she have produce no man of genius it be this more than anything -lrb- aside from painting -rrb- that inspire I with a desire to excel in my art it arouse my indignation and give I tenfold energy in the pursuit of my study i should like to be the greatest painter _ purely out of revenge _ but what a damper be throw upon my enthusiasm when i find that the moment when all the treasure of art be before I just within my reach that advantage to the artist be never greater than now pari with all its splendid depository of the greatest work but a day or two 's journey from I and open to my free inspection -- what a damper i say be it to find that my three year ' allowance be just expire that while all my contemporary student and companion be revel in these enjoyment and rapidly advance in they noble study they be leave I behind either to return to my country or by painting portrait in bristol just to be able to live through the year the thought make I melancholy and for the first time since i leave home have i have one of my desponding fit i have get over it now for i would not write to you in that mood for the world my object in state this be to request patronage from some rich individual or individual for a year or two longer at the rate of # 250 per year this to be advance to I and if require to be return in money as soon as i shall be able or by picture to the amount when i have complete my study if uncle salisbury or miss russell could do it it would be much more grateful to I than from any other the box contain my plaster cast i find on enquiry be still at liverpool where it have be to my great disappointment now nearly a year i have give order to have it send by the first opportunity mr wilder will tell you that he come near take out my great picture of the hercule to you it seem as though it be destine that nothing of mine shall reach you i pack it up at a moment 's warning and send it to liverpool to go by the cartel and i find it arrive the day after she have sail i hope it will not be long before both the box will have a opportunity of reach you i be exceedingly sorry you have forget a passage in one of my letter where i wish you not to feel anxious if you do not hear from I as often as you have do i state the reason that opportunity be less frequent more circuitous and attend with greater interruption i tell you that i should write at least once in three week and that you must attribute it to anything but neglect on my part you last letter have hurt I considerably for owe to some accident or other my letter have miscarry and you upbraid I with neglect and fear that i be not as industrious or correct as formerly i know you do not wish to hurt I but i can not help feeling hurt when i think that my parent have not the confidence which i think they have in I that some interruption which all complain of and which be natural to a state of warfare have prevent letter which i have write from be receive instead of make allowance for these thing to have they attribute it to a falling-off in industry and attention wound I a great deal mr allston to she great surprise receive just such a letter from she friend and it hurt she so that she be ill in consequence i dine at mr macaulay 's at five o'clock to-day and shall attend the house of common to-morrow evening where i expect to hear mr wilberforce speak on the slave trade with reference to the propriety of make the universal abolition of it a article in the pend negotiation if i have time in this letter i will give you some account of it in the mean time i will give you a slight account of some scene of which i have be a happy witness in the great drama now act in the theater of europe you will probably before this reach you hear of the splendid _ entrée _ of loui xviii into london i be a spectator of this scene on the morning of the day about ten o'clock i go into piccadilly through which the procession be to pass i do not find any great concourse of people at that hour except before the pultney hotel where the sister of emperor alexander reside on a visit to this country the grand duchess of oldenburg i think it probable that as the procession would pass this place there would be some uncommon occurrence take place before it so i take my situation directly opposite determine at any rate to secure a good view of what happen i wait four or five hour during which time the people begin to collect from all quarter the carriage begin to thicken the window and front of the house begin to be decorate with the white flag white ribbon and laurel temporary seat be fit up on all side which begin to be fill and all seem to be in preparation about this time the king 's splendid band of music make its appearance consist i suppose of more than fifty musician and to my great gratification place themselves directly before the hotel they begin to play and soon after the grand duchess attend by several russian nobleman make she appearance on the balcony follow by the queen of england the princess charlotte of wale the princess mary princess elizabeth and all the female part of the royal family from this fortunate circumstance you will see that i have a excellent opportunity of observe they person and countenance the duchess of oldenburg be a common-sized woman of about four or five and twenty she have rather a pleasant countenance blue eye pale complexion regular feature she cheek-bone high but not disagreeably so she resemble very much she brother the emperor judge from he portrait she have with she she little nephew prince alexander a boy of about three or four year old he be a lively little fellow playing about and be the principal object of the attention of the royal family the queen if i be truly direct to she be a old woman of very sallow complexion and nothing agreeable either in she countenance or deportment and if she be not call a queen she might as well be any ugly old woman the princess charlotte of wale i think pretty she have small feature regular pale complexion great amiability of expression and condescension of manners the princess elizabeth be extremely corpulent and from what i could see of she face be agreeable though nothing remarkable one of the other i think it be the princess mary appear to have considerable vivacity in she manners she be without any cover to she head she hair be sandy which she wear crop she complexion be probably fair originally but be rather red now she feature be agreeable it now begin to grow late the people be begin to be tired want they dinner and the crowd to thicken when a universal commotion and murmur through the crowd and from the housetops indicate that the procession be at hand this be follow by the thunder of artillery and the huzza of the people toward the head of the street where the house seem to be alive with the twirling of hat and shake of handkerchief this seem to mark the progress of the king for as he come opposite each house these action become most violent with cry of _ ` vivent les bourbon ' ` vive le roi ' ` vive loui ' _ etc i now grow several inch taller i stretch my neck and open my eye one carriage appear draw by six horse decorate with ribbon and contain some of the french _ noblesse _ another of the same description with some of the french royal family at length come a carriage draw by eight beautiful arabian cream-colored horse in this be seat loui xviii king of france the prince regent of england the duchesse d'angoulême daughter of loui xvi and the prince of condé they pass rather quickly so that i have but a glance at they though a distinct one the prince regent i have often see before the king of france i have a better sight of afterwards as i will presently relate the duchesse d'angoulême have a fine expression of countenance owe probably to the occasion but a melancholy cast be also visible through it she be pale the prince of condé i have no recollection of after this part of the procession have pass the crowd become exceedingly oppressive rush down the street to keep pace with the king 's carriage as the king pass the royal family he bow which they return by kiss they hand to he and shake they handkerchief with great enthusiasm after they have go by the royal family leave the balcony where they have be between two and three hour my only object now be to get clear of the crowd i wait nearly three quarter of a hour and at length by main strength work myself edgewise across the street where i push down through stable and house and by-lane to get thoroughly clear not care where i go as i know i could easily find my way when i get into a street this i at last gain and to my no small astonishment find myself by mere chance directly opposite the hotel where loui and he suite be the prince regent have just leave the place and with he carriage go a great part of the mob which leave the space before the house comparatively clear it soon fill again i take advantage however and get directly before the window of the hotel as i expect the king would show himself for the people be call for he very clamorously i be not disappoint for in less than half a minute he come to the window which be open before which i be i be so near he i could have touch he he stay nearly ten minute during which time i observe he carefully he be very corpulent a round face dark eye prominent feature the character of countenance much like the portrait of the other louise a pleasant face but above all such a expression of the moment as i shall never forget and in vain attempt to describe he eye be suffuse with tear he mouth slightly open with a unaffected smile full of gratitude and seem to say to every one ` bless you ' he hand be a little extended sometimes as if in adoration to heaven at other as if blessing the people i enter into he feeling i see a monarch who for five-and-twenty year have be a exile from he country deprive of he throne and until within a few month not a shadow of a hope remain of ever return to it again i see he raise as if by magic from a private station in a instant to he throne to reign over a nation which have make itself the most conspicuous of any nation on the globe i try to think as he do and in the heat of my enthusiasm i join with heart and soul in the cry of _ ` vive le roi ' ` vive loui ' _ which rent the air from the mouth of thousand as soon as he leave the window i return home much fatigued but well satisfied that my labor have not be for naught mr wilberforce be a excellent man he whole soul be bent on do good to he fellow man not a moment of he time be lose he be always plan some benevolent scheme or other and not only plan but execute he be make up altogether of affectionate feeling what i saw of he in private give I the most exalted opinion of he as a christian oh that such man as mr wilberforce be more common in this world so much human blood would not then be shed to gratify the malice and revenge of a few wicked interested man i hope cousin samuel breese will distinguish himself under so gallant a commander as captain perry i shall look with anxiety for the sailing of the guerrière there will be plenty of opportunity for he for peace with we be deprecate by the people here and it only remain for we to fight it out gallantly as we be able to do or submit slavishly to any term which they please to offer we a number of _ humane _ scheme be under contemplation such as burn new london for the sake of the frigate there arm the black in the southern state burn all of we principal city and such like plan which from the supineness of the new england people may be easily carry into effect but no the _ humane generous _ english can not do such base thing -- i hope not let the event show it it be perhaps well i be here for with my present opinion if i be at home i should most certainly be in the army or navy my mite be small but when my country 's honor demand it it might help to sustain it there can now be no french party i wish very much to know what effect this series of good news will have at home i congratulate you as well as all other good people on the providential event which have lately happen they must produce great change with we i hope it will be for the best i be in excellent health and be paint away i be make study for the large picture i contemplate for next year it will be as large i think as mr allston 's famous one which be ten foot by fourteen it can hardly be wonder at that the parent should have be somewhat anxious when we learn from letter of June 1814 that they have not hear from they son for _ seven month _ they be greatly relieve when letter do finally arrive and they rejoice in he success and in the hope of a universal peace which should enable they son to act they part on the stage of life in a calmer period of the world he mother keep urge he to send some of he painting home as they wish to judge of he improvement have as yet receive nothing but the small pen-and-ink portrait of himself which they do not think a very good likeness she also emphatically discourage any idea of patronage from america owe to the hard time bring on by the war and the father tell he son that he will endeavor to send he one thousand dollar more which must suffice for the additional year 's study and the expense of the journey home it be small wonder that the three son always manifest the deepest veneration and affection for they parent for seldom have there be see as great devotion and self-sacrifice and seldom be three son more worthy of it sidney be at this time study law at litchfield connecticut and richard be attend the theological seminary at andover massachusett both become eminent in after life though curiously enough neither in the law nor in the ministry but we shall have occasion to treat more specifically of this later on the three brother be devotedly attach to each other to the very end of they long life and be mutually helpful as they life now diverged and now come together again the next letter from morse to he parent write on June 15 1814 give a further account of the great people who be at that time in london : -- i expect at this time to have be in bristol with mr and mr allston who be now there but the great fêtes in honor of the peace and the visit of the ally sovereign have keep I in london till all be over there be now in london upward of twenty foreign prince also the great emperor alexander and the king of prussium a week ago yesterday they arrive in town and contrary to expectation come in a very private manner i go to see they _ entrée _ but be disappoint with the rest of the people for the emperor alexander dislike all show and parade come in a private carriage and take a indirect route here the next and following day i spend in endeavor to get a sight of they i have be very fortunate have see the emperor alexander no less than fourteen time so that i be quite familiar with he face the king of prussium i have see once marshal blücher five or six time count platoff three or four time besides general de yorck bülow etc all whose name must be perfectly familiar to you and the distinguished part they have all act in the great scene just past the emperor alexander i be quite in love with he have every mark of a great mind he countenance be a uncommonly fine one he have a fair complexion hair rather light and a stout well-made figure he have a very cheerful benevolent expression and he conduct have everywhere evince that he face be the index of he mind when i first see he he be dress in a green uniform with two epaulet and star of different order he be converse at the window of he hotel with he sister the duchess of oldenburg i see he again soon after in the superb coach of the prince regent with the duchess he sister go to the court of the queen in a few hour after i see he again on the balcony of the pultney hotel he come forward and bow to the people he be then dress in a red uniform with a broad blue sash over the right shoulder he appear to great advantage he stay about five minute i see he again five or six time through the day but get only indifferent view of he the follow day however i be determine to get a better and nearer view of he than before i go down to he hotel about ten o'clock the time when i suppose he would leave it i see one of the prince 's carriage draw up which open at the top and be throw back before and behind in a few minute the emperor with he sister make they appearance and get into it as the carriage start i press forward and get hold of the ring of the coach door and keep pace with it for about a quarter of a mile i be so near that i could have touch he he be in a plain dress a brown coat and altogether like any other gentleman he sister the duchess also be dress in a very plain unattractive manner and if it have not be for the crowd which follow they would have be take for any lady and gentleman take a airing in this unostentatious manner do he conduct himself despise all pomp and seem rather more intent upon inspect the charitable useful and ornamental establishment of this country with a view probably of benefit he own dominion by he observation than of display he rank by the splendor of dress and equipage he condescension also be no less remarkable a instance or two will exemplify it on the morning after he arrival he be up at six o'clock and while the lazy inhabitant of this great city be fast asleep in they bed he be walk with he sister the duchess in kensington garden as he come across hyde park he observe a corporal drilling some recruit upon which he go up to he and enter into familiar conversation with he ask he a variety of question and when he have see the end of the exercise shake he heartily by the hand and leave he when he be ride on horseback he shake hand with all who come round he a few day ago as he be come out of the gate of the london dock on foot after have inspect they a great crowd be wait to see he among whom be a old woman of about seventy year of age who seem very anxious to get near he but the crowd press very much she exclaim ` oh if i could but touch he clothes ' the emperor overhear she and turn round advance to she and pull off he glove give she he hand and at the same time drop a guinea into hers say to she ` perhaps this will do as well ' the old woman be quite overcome and cry ` god bless you majesty ' till he be out of sight a old woman in she ninetieth year send a pair of warm woolen stocking to the emperor and with they a letter state that she have knit they with she own hand expressly for he and as she could not afford to send he silk she think that woolen would be much more acceptable and would also be more useful in he climate the emperor be very much pleased and determine on give she he miniature set in gold and diamond but upon learn that she situation in life be such that money would be more acceptable he write she a answer and thank she heartily for she present enclose she one hundred pound these anecdote speak more than volume in praise of the emperor alexander he be truly a great man he be a great conqueror for he have subdue the greatest country in the world and overthrow the most alarming despotism that ever threaten mankind he be great also because he be good he whole time seem spend in distribute good to all around he and where-ever he go he make every heart rejoice he be very active and be all the time on the alert in view everything that be worth see the emperor be also extremely partial to the united state everything american please he and he seem uncommonly interested in the welfare of we country i be introduce to-day to mr harris we _ chargé d'affaire _ to the court of russium he be a very intelligent fine man and be a great favorite with alexander from a conversation with he i have a scheme in view which when i have mature i will submit to you for you approbation the king of prussium i have see but once and then have but a imperfect view of he he come to the window with the prince regent and bow to the people -lrb- at st jame 's palace -rrb- he be tall and thin have a agreeable countenance but rather deject in consequence of the late loss of he queen to whom he be very much attach general blücher now prince blücher i have see five or six time i see he on he entrance into london all cover with dust and in a very ordinary kind of vehicle on the day after i see he several time in he carriage draw about wherever he wish by the _ mob _ he be john 's greatest favorite and they have almost pull the brave general and he companion count platoff to piece out of pure affection platoff have he coat actually tear off he and divide into a thousand piece as _ relic _ by the good people

veteran-looking soldier a very fine head monstrous mustach he head be bald like papa 's he hair gray and he wear powder understanding that he be to be at covent garden theater i go as the best place to see he and i be not disappointed he be in the prince 's box and i have a good view of he during the whole entertainment be directly before he for three or four hour a few night since i also go to

-- i receive you last on Saturday and should have answer you first letter but for two reason first that i have nothing to say which i think metaphysician allow to be the most natural as well as the

should i have say it i thank you for you solicitude and can assure you that both mr allston and myself be in every respect better than when we leave london mr king receive I as i wish with

my have give the least intimation of such a design i have take merchant tailor ' hall -lrb- a very large room -rrb- for this purpose and shall probably open it in the course of next week perhaps you will be surprise to hear that i have be retouch it i have just conclude a fortnight 's hard work upon it and have the satisfaction to add that i have be seldom better satisfied than with my present labor i have repaint the greater part of the drapery -- indeed those of all the principal figure except the dead man -- with powerful and positive color and add double strength to the shadow of every figure so that for force and distinctness you would hardly know it for the same picture the morning chronicle would have no reason now to complain of its wan red i be sorry that parliament have be so impolite to you in procrastinate the firework but they be a unpolished set and will still be in the dark age of incivility notwithstanding they late illuminations however i be in great hope that the good people of england will derive no small degree of moral embellishment from they pure admiration of the illustrious general b -- who it be say for drinking and gaming have no equal bristol

what i can in london -rrb- i can improve myself more and therefore all thing take into consideration i believe it would be agreeable to my parent as to the political state of pari there be nothing to fear from that it appear perfectly tranquil and should at any time any difficulty arise it be but three day ' journey back to england again besides this i hope my parent will not feel any solicitude for I lest i should fall into any bad way when they consider that i be now between twenty-three and twenty-four year of age and that this be a age when the habit be generally fix as for expense i must also request you confidence feeling as i do the great obligation i be under to my parent they must think I destitute of gratitude if they think I capable after all that have be say to I of be prodigal

in bristol he friend c r leslie thus write to he in lead pencil from london on November 29 1814 : -- most potent grave and reverend doctor -- i take up my pencil to make ten thousand apology for address you in humble black lead deeply impressed as i be with the full conviction that you deserve the very best japan ink the only excuse i can make to you be the follow it be perhaps needless to remind you that the tool with which ink be apply to paper in order to produce write be make from goose quill which quill i be goose enough not to keep a supply of and not have so much money at present in my breeches pocket as will purchase one i be force to betake myself to my pencil a instrument which without pay myself any compliment i be sure i can wield better than a pen i be glad to hear that you be so industrious and that mr allston be succeed so well with portrait i hope he will bring all he have paint to london i be look out for you every day i think we form a kind of family here and i feel in a absence from mr and mr allston and yourself as i use to do when away from my mother and sister by the bye i have not have any letter from home for more than a month it seem the american be all unite and we shall now have war in earnest i be glad of it for many reason i think it will not only get we a more speedy and permanent peace but may tend to crush the demon of party spirit and strengthen we government i be do paint the gallery and have finish my drawing for the frieze thank you for you good wish i think mr allston know how proud i be of be consider he student tell he if he think it worth while to mention I at all in he letter to delaplaine i shall consider it a great honor to be call he student the father in a letter of December 6 1814 after again urge he to leave politics alone add this postscript : p if you can make up you mind to remain in london and finish you great picture for the exhibition to suppress you political feeling and resolutely turn a deaf ear to everything which do not concern you professional study not to talk on politics and preserve a conciliate course of conduct and conversation make as many friend as you can and behave as a good man ought to in you situation and put off go to france till after you exhibition -- this plan would suit we best but with the observation and advice now before you we leave you to judge for yourself let we early know you determination and intended plan you must rely on you own resource after this year the follow letter be from he warm friend the reverend samuel f jarvis write in new york December 14 1814 : -- i be not surprise at the feeling you express with regard to england or america the english in general have so contemptuous a opinion of we and one so exalted of themselves that every american must feel a virtuous indignation when he hear he country traduce and belie but my dear sir it be natural on the other hand for a exile from he native land to turn with fond remembrance to its excellence and forget its defect you will be able some year hence to speak with more impartiality on this subject than you do at present the man who have involve the country in this war be wicked and corrupt a systematic exclusion of all federalist from any office of trust be the lead feature of this administration yet the federalist comprehend the majority of the wealth virtue and intelligence of the community it be the power of the ignorant multitude by which they be support and i conceive that america will never be a respectable nation in the eye of the world till the extreme democracy of we constitution be do away with and there be a representation of the property rather than of the population of the country you feel nothing of the oppressive despotic sway of the _ soi-disant _ republican but we feel it in all its bitterness and know that it be far worse than that of the most despotic sovereign in europe with such man there can be no union the repulsion of british invasion be the duty and will be the pride of every american but while prepare to bare he arm in defense of he much-wronged country against a proud and arrogant and in some instance a cruel foe he can not be blind to the unprincipled conduct of she internal enemy and such he must conceive the present rule party to be on December 19 1814 he mother write : -- i be not a little astonished to hear you say in one of you letter from bristol that you have earn money enough there to pay off you debt i can not help ask what debt you could have to discharge with you own earnings after receive one thousand dollar a year from we which we be very sure must have afford you even by you own account of you expense ample means for the payment of all just fair and honorable debt and i hope you contract no other we be inform by other that they make six hundred dollar a year not only pay all they expense of clothing board travel learn the french language etc etc but they be able out of it to purchase book to send home and actually send a large trunk full of elegant book now the person who tell we that he do this have a father who be say to be worth a hundred and fifty thousand dollar therefore the young man be not pinch for means but be thus economical out of consideration to he parent and to show he gratitude to they as i suppose now think my dear son how much more you poor parent be do for you how good you dear brother be to be satisfy with so little do for they in comparison with what we be do for you and let the thought stimulate you to more economy and industry i greatly fear you have be fall off in both these since the éclat you receive for you first performance it have always be a fail of yours as soon as you find you could excel in what you undertake to be tire of it and not trouble yourself any further about it i be in hope that you have get over this fickleness ere this you must not expect to paint anything in this country for which you will receive any money to support you but portrait therefore do everything in you power to qualify you for painting and take they in the best style that be all you hope here and to be very oblige and condescend to those who be dispose to employ you i think young leslie be a very estimable young man to be as i be tell he be support himself and assist he widow mother by he industry i shall anticipate a little in order to give at once the son 's answer to this reproof he write on April 28 1815 : -- i wish i could persuade my parent that they might place some little confidence in my judgment at the age i now be -lrb- nearly twenty-four -rrb- a age when in ordinary people the judgment have reach a certain degree of maturity it be a singular and i think a unfortunate fact that i have not that i recollect since i have be in england have a turn of low spirit except when i have receive letter from home it be true i find a great deal of affectionate solicitude in they but with it i also find so much complaint and distrust so much fear that i be do wrong so much doubt as to my moral and principle and fear lest i should be lead away by bad company and the like that after i have read they i be miserable for a week i feel as though i have be guilty of every crime and i have pass many sleepless night after receive letter from you i shall not sleep to-night in consequence of passage in you letter just receive here he quote from he mother 's letter and answer : now as to the young man 's living for six hundred dollar i know who it be of whom you speak it be dr parkman who make it he boast that he would live for that sum but you do not enquire _ how _ he live i can tell you he never refuse a invitation to dine breakfast or tea which he use to obtain often by push himself into everybody 's company when he do not succeed in get invitation he invite himself to breakfast dine or sup with some of he friend he have often walk up to breakfast with we a distance of three or four mile if he fail in get a dinner or meal at any of these place he either use to go without or a bit of bread answer the purpose till next meal in he dress he be so shabby and uncouth that any decent person would be ashamed to walk with he in the street above all he notorious meanness in he money matter he stickling with he poor washerwoman for a halfpenny and with other for a farthing and he uniform stinginess on all occasion render he notoriously disgust to all he acquaintance and afford i should imagine but a poor example for imitation the fact be i could live for _ fifty _ pound a year if my only object be to live cheap and on the other hand if i be allow one thousand pound a year i could spend it all without the least extravagance in obtain greater advantage in my art but as you goodness have allow I but two hundred pound -lrb- and i wish you again to receive my sincere thanks for this allowance -rrb- should not my sole endeavor be to spend all this to the utmost advantage to keep as closely within the bound of that allowance as possible and would not _ economy _ in this instance consist in rigidly keep up to this rule if this be a true statement of the case then have i be perfectly economical for i have not yet overrun my allowance and i think i shall be able to return home without have exceed it a single shilling if i have do this and still continue to do it why in every letter i receive from home be the injunction repeat of _ be economical _ it make I exceedingly unhappy especially when i be conscious of have use my utmost endeavor ever since i have be in england to be rigidly so as to _ industry _ in which mama fear i be fall off i give you a account in my last letter -lrb- by mr ralston -rrb- of the method i use in parcel out my time since write that letter the spring and summer be approach fast and the day increase of course i can employ more of the time than in the winter mr leslie and myself rise at five o'clock in the morning and walk about a mile and a half to burlington where be the famous elgin marble the work of phidia and praxitele bring by lord elgin from athen from these we draw three hour every morning wet or dry before breakfast and return home just as the bustle begin in london for they be late riser in london when we go out of a morning we meet no one but the watchman who go he round for a hour and a half after we be up last summer mr leslie and i use to paint in the open air in the field three hour before breakfast and often before sunrise to study the morning effect on the landscape now be conscious of employ my time in the most industrious manner possible you can but faintly conceive the mortification and sorrow with which i read that part of mama 's letter i be so much hurt that i read it to mr allston and request he would write to you and give you a account of my spending my time he seem very much astonish when i read it to he and _ authorize I to tell you from he that it be impossible for any one to be more indefatigable in he study than i be _ mama mention in she letter that she hear that mr leslie support he mother and sister by he labor this be not the case leslie be support by three or four individual in philadelphium till within a few month past about a year ago he sell a large picture which he paint -lrb- whilst i be on my fruitless trip to bristol for money -rrb- for a hundred guinea since that he have have a number of commission in portrait and be barely able to support himself indeed he tell I this evening that he have but # 20 leave he be a very economical and a most excellent young man he expense in a year be on a average from # 230 to # 250 mr allston 's -lrb- single -rrb- expense not less than # 300 per annum and i know of no artist among all my acquaintance whose expense in a year be less than # 200 return now to the former chronological order i shall include the follow vehement letter write from london on December 22 1814 : -- my dear parent -- i arrive yesterday from bristol where i have be for several month past endeavor to make a little in the way of my profession but have completely fail owe to several cause first the total want of anything like partiality for the fine art in that place the people there be but a remove from brute a bristol hog be as proverbial in this country as a charlestown gentleman be in boston they whole mind be absorb in trade barter and gain and interest be all they understand if i could have paint a picture for half a guinea by which they could have make twenty whilst i starve _ i could have starve _ secondly the virulence of national prejudice which rage now with tenfold acrimony they no longer despise they hate the american the battle on champlain and before flattsburgh have decide the business the moan and bewailing for this business be really to a american quite comforting after they arrogant boasting of reduce we to unconditional submission be it strange that i should feel a little the effect of this universal hatred i have feel it and i have leave bristol after six month ' perfect neglect after have be invite there with promise of success i have have the mortification to leave it without have from bristol a single commission more than that and by far the worst if i have not go back in my art these six month i have at least stand still and to I this be the most try reflection of all i have be immure in the paralyze atmosphere of trade till my mind be near partake the infection i have be listen to the grovel avaricious devotee of mammon whose soul be narrow to the studious contemplation of a hard-earned shilling whose leaden imagination never soar above the prospect of a good bargain and whose _ summum bonum _ be the inspiring idea of count a hundred thousand : i say i have be listen to these miserly being till the idea do not seem so repugnant of lower my noble art to a trade of painting for money of degrading myself and the soul-enlarging art which i possess to the narrow idea of merely get money fie on myself i be ashamed of myself no never will i degrade myself by make a trade of a profession if i can not live a gentleman i will starve a gentleman but i will dismiss this unpleasant subject the particulars of which i can better relate to you than write suffice it to say that my ill-treatment do not prey upon my spirit i be in excellent health and spirit and have great reason to be thankful to heaven for thousand of blessing which one or two reverse shall not make I forget reverse do i call they how trifling be my trouble to the million of my fellow creature who be afflict with all the dreadful calamity incident to this life reverse do i call they no they be blessing compare with the misery of thousand indeed i be too ungrateful if a thing do not result just as i wish i begin to repine i forget the load of blessing which i enjoy : life health parent whose kindness exceed the kindest brother relative and friend advantage which no one else enjoy for the pursuit of a favorite art besides numerous other all which be forget the moment a unpleasant disappointment occur i be very ungrateful with respect to peace i can only say i should not be surprise if the preliminary be sign before January my reason be that great britain can not carry on the war any longer she may talk of she inexhaustible resource but she well know that the great resource the property tax must fail next April the people will not submit any longer they be take strong measure to prevent its continuance and without it they can not continue the war another great reason why i think there will be peace be the absolute _ fear _ which they express of we they fear the increase of we navy they fear the increase of the army they fear for canada and they be in dread of the further disgrace of they national character mr monroe 's plan for raise 100000 man go like a shock through the country they see the united state assume a attitude which they do not expect and the same man who cry for war war thrash the american now cry most lustily for peace the union of the party also have convince they that we be determine to resist they most arrogant pretension love to all brother miss russell etc yours very affectionately saml f b morse he end the letter thus abruptly probably realize that he be begin to tread on forbid ground but be unable to resist the temptation while from this letter and other we can form a just estimate of the character and temperament of the man it be also well to learn the opinion of he contemporary i shall therefore quote from a letter to the elder morse of the dr romeyn whom the son be so anxious to have he father see also from a letter of mr van schaick to dr romeyn the former be write in new york on December 27 1814 the enclosed letter of my friend mr van schaick will give you the information concern you son which you desire he have be intimately acquaint with you son for a considerable time you may rely on he account as he be not only a gentleman of unquestionable integrity but also a professor of the lord christ what i saw and hear of you son pleased I and i can not but hope he will repay all you anxiety and realize you reasonable expectation by he conduct and the standing which he must and will acquire in society by that conduct mr van schaick 's letter be write also in new york on December 14 1814 : -- to those passage of dr morse 's letter respect he son to which you have direct my attention i hasten to reply without any form because it will gratify I to relieve the anxiety of the parent of my friend he religious and moral character be unexceptionally good he feel strongly for he country and express those feeling among he american friend with great sensibility i do not know that he ever indulge in any observation in the company of englishman which be calculate to injure he standing among they but my dear sir you fully know that a american can not escape the sting of illiberal and false charge against he country and even its moral character unless he almost entirely withhold himself from society it can not be expect that any human being should be so unfeeling as to suffer indignity in total silence but i do not think that any political collision which may incidentally and very infrequently arise can injure he as a artist for it be well know to you that the simple fact of he be a american be sufficient to prevent he rise rapidly into notice since the possession of that character clog the effort or at least somewhat cloud the fame of man of superior genius and establish talent i advise samuel to go to france and bury himself for six month in the louvre from thence to italy the seat of the art he incline to the first part of the plan and then to return home but defer put it into execution till he hear from he father mr allston intend to winter in london morse have a fine taste and color well he drawing be capable of much improvement but he be anxious to place himself at the head of he profession and with a little judicious encouragement will probably succeed that patient industry which have in all age characterize the master of the art he will find it to he interest to apply to he study the farther he advance in they he success have be moderately good if he could sell the picture he have on hand the avail would probably pay he way into france refer to these letter the father write on January 25 1815 say : -- we have have letter from dr romeyn and mr van schaick concern you which have comfort we much since receive they we do not know but we have express ourselves in we letter in answer to you last a little stronger than we ought in regard to you _ political _ feeling and conduct i find other who have return feel pretty much as you do but it should be remember that you situation as a artist be different from theirs it be you wisdom to leave politics to politician and be solely the artist but if you be in france these caution will probably not be necessary as you will have no temptation to enter into any political discussion on the 3d of February 1815 morse in write to he parent have a very sad piece of news to communicate to they : -- i write in great haste and much agitation mr allston the wife of we beloved friend die last evening and the event overwhelm we all in the utmost sorrow as for mr allston for several hour after the death of he wife he be almost bereft of reason mr leslie and i be apply we whole attention to he and we have so far succeed as to see he more compose this be a terrible grief to all the little coterie of friend for whom the allston house have be a home one of they mr jj morgan in a long letter to morse write from wiltshire thus express himself : -- gracious god unsearchable indeed be thy way the insensible the brutish the wicked be powerful and everywhere in everything successful while allston who be everything that be amiable kind and good have be bruise blow after blow and now indeed he cup be full i be too unwell too little recover from the effect of you letter to write much coleridge intend write to-day i hope he will allston may derive some little relief from know how much he friend partake of he grief this be a time of great discouragement to the young artist through the failure of some of he letter to reach he parent in time he have not receive they permission to go to france until it be too late for he to go the death of mr allston cast a gloom over all the little circle and to cap the climax he be receive no encouragement in he profession on march 10 1815 he write : -- my jaunt to bristol in quest of money completely fail when i be first there i expect from the little connection i get into i should be able to support myself i be oblige to come to town on account of the exhibition and stay longer than i expect intend to return to bristol during this time i receive two press letter from mr visscher -lrb- which i will show you -rrb- invite I to come down say that i should have plenty of business i accordingly hurry off a gentleman for whom i have before paint two portrait have promise if i would let he have they for ten guinea apiece twelve be my price that he would procure I five sitter this i accede to i receive twenty guinea and have hear nothing from the man since though i particularly request mr visscher to enquire and remind he of he promise yet he never do anything more on the subject i be there three month gain nothing in my art and without a single commission mr breed of liverpool then come to bristol he take two landscape which i have be amusing myself with -lrb- for i can say nothing more of they -rrb- at ten guinea each i paint two more landscape which be unsold mr visscher a man worth about a hundred thousand pound and whose annual expense with a large family of seven child be not one thousand have a little frame for which he repeatedly desire I to paint a picture i tell he i would as soon as i have finish one of my landscape i begin it immediately without he know it and determine to surprise he with it i also have two frame which fit mr breed 's picture and which i be go to give to mr breed with he picture but mr visscher be particularly please with the frame as they be a pair and tell I not to send they to mr breed as he should like to have they himself and wish i would paint he picture to fit they -lrb- the two other landscape before mention -rrb- i accordingly be employ three month longer in paint these three picture i finish they he be very much pleased with they all he family be very much pleased with they all who see they be please with they but he _ decline take they _ without even ask my price and say that he have more picture than he know what to do with mr and mr allston hear he say twenty time he wish i would paint he a picture for the frame mr allston who know what i be about tell he no doubt i would do it for he and in a week after i have complete it i have tell mr visscher also that i be considerably in debt and that when he have pay I for these picture i should be something in pocket and by he not object to what i say i take it for grant -lrb- and from he request I to paint the picture -rrb- that the thing be certain but thus it be without give any reason in the world except that he have picture enough he decline take they make I spend three month longer in bristol than i otherwise should have do standing still in my art if not actually go back and force I to run in debt for some necessary expense of clothing in bristol and my passage from and back to london during all this time not a single commission for a portrait _ many _ of which be promise I nor a single call from any one to look at my picture thus end my jaunt in quest of money do not think that this disappointment be in consequence of any misconduct of mine mr allston who be with I experience the same treatment and have it not be for he uncle the american consul he might have starve for the bristol people he uncle be the only one who purchase any of he picture since i have be in london i have be endeavor to regain what i lose in bristol and i hope i have so far succeed as to say : ' _ i have not go back in my art _ ' in order to retrench my expense i have take a painting-room out of the house at about half of the expense of my former room though inconvenient in many respects yet my circumstance require it and i willingly put up with it as for _ economy _ do not be at any more pain in introduce that personage to I we have long be friend and necessary companion if you could look in on I and see I through a day i think you would not tell I in every letter to _ economize more _ it be impossible i can not economize more i live on as plain food and as little as be for my health less and plainer would make I ill for i have give it a fair experiment as for clothes i have be decent and that be all if i visit a great deal this would be a heavy expense but the less i go out the less need i care for clothes except for cleanliness my only heavy expense be color canvas frame etc and these be heavy a number of page of this letter be miss much to my regret he must have be tell of some of the great event which be happen on the continent probably of the return from elba for it begin again abruptly -- when he might have avoid it by quietness by undertake so bold a attempt as he have do without be completely sure of success and have lay he plan deeply and thirdly i know the feeling of the french people be decidedly in he favor more especially the military they feel as though loui xviii be force upon they by they conqueror they feel themselves a conquered nation and they look to bonaparte as the only man who can retrieve they character for they all these reason rush into my mind at the time i give it as my opinion that napoleon would again be emperor of the french and again set the world by the ear unless he may have learn a lesson from he adversity but this can not be expect i fear we be apt yet to see a darker and more dreadful storm than any we have yet see this be indeed a age of wonder let what will happen in europe let we have peace at home among ourselves more particularly but the character we have acquire among the nation of europe in we late contest with england have place we on such high ground that none of they england least of all will wish to embroil themselves with we this be write just after peace have be establish between england and america and in a letter from he mother write about the same time in march 1815 she thus comment on the joyful news : we have now the heartfelt pleasure of congratulating you on the return of peace between we country and great britain may it never again be interrupted but may both country study the thing that make for peace and love as brethren it never have be interrupt up to the present day for as i be pursue my pleasant task of bring these letter together for publication in the year of we lord 1911 the newspaper be agitate the question of a fitting commemoration of a hundred year of peace between great britain and the united state further on in this same letter the mother make this request of she son : when you return we wish you to bring some excellent black or corbeau cloth to make you good father and brother each a suit of clothes you papa also wish you to get make a handsome black cloth cloak for he one that will fit you he think will fit he be sure and attend to this you mama would like some grave color silk for a gown if it can be have but for little do not forget that you mother be no dwarf and that a large pattern suit she better than a small one the letter of April 28 from which i have already quote have this sentence at the beginning : you letter suppose I in paris _ but i be not there _ you hope that i go in October last i intend go and wish it at that time exceedingly but i have not leave from you to go and mr bromfield advise I by no means to go until i hear from you you must perceive from this case how impossible it be for I to form plan and transmit they across the atlantic for approbation thus let a opportunity slip which be irrecoverable chapter ix may 3 1815 -- October 18 1816 decide to return home in the fall -- hope to return to europe in a year -- ambition -- paint judgment of jupiter -- not allow to compete for premium -- mr russell 's portrait -- reproof of he parent -- battle of waterloo -- wilberforce -- painting of die hercule receive by parent -- much admire -- sail for home -- dreadful voyage last fifty-eight day -- extract from he journal -- home at last it be with great reluctance that morse make he preparation to return home he think that could he but remain a year or two longer in a atmosphere much more congenial to a artist than that which prevail in america at that time he would surely attain to greater eminence in he profession he in common with many other imagine that with the return of peace a era of great prosperity would at once set in but in this he be mistake for history record that just the opposite occur the war have make demand on manufacturer farmer and provision dealer which be meet by a increase in invention and in production and this mean wealth and prosperity to many when the war cease this demand suddenly fall off the soldier return to they country swell the army of the unemployed and there result increase misery among the lower class and a check to the prosperity of the middle and upper class it would seem therefore that fate deal more kindly with the young man than he at that time realize for have he remain he discouragement would undoubtedly have increase whereas by he return to he native land although meeting with many disappointment and suffer many hardship he be gradually turn into a path which ultimately lead to fame and fortune on may 3 1815 he write to he parent : -- with respect to return home i shall make my arrangement to be with you -lrb- should my life be spare -rrb- by the end of September next or the beginning of October but it will be necessary that i should be in england again -lrb- provide always providence permit -rrb- by September follow as arrangement which i have make will require my presence this i will fully explain when i meet you the moment i get home i wish to begin work so that i should like to have some portrait bespoken in season i shall charge forty dollar less than stuart for my portrait so that if any of my good friend be ready i will begin the moment i have say ` how do ye do ' to they i wish to do as much as possible in the year i be with you if i could get a commission or two for some large picture for a church or public hall to the amount of two or three thousand dollar i should feel much gratified i do not despair of such a event for through you influence with the clergy and they influence with they people i think some commission for a scripture subject for a church might be obtain a crucifixion for instance it may perhaps be say that the country be not rich enough to purchase large picture yes but two or three thousand dollar can be pay for a entertainment which be go in a day and whose effect be to demoralize and debilitate whilst the same sum expend on a fine picture would be add a ornament to the country which would be last it would tend to elevate and refine the public feeling by turn they thought from sensuality and luxury to intellectual pleasure and it would encourage and support a class of citizen who have always be reckon among the brightest star in the constellation of american worthy and who be to this day compel to exile themselves from they country and all that be dear to they in order to obtain a bare subsistence i do not speak of _ portrait-painter _ have i no higher thought than be a first-rate portrait-painter i would have choose a far different profession my ambition be to be among those who shall revive the splendor of the fifteenth century to rival the genius of a raphael a michael angelo or a titian my ambition be to be enlist in the constellation of genius now rise in this country i wish to shine not by a light borrow from they but to strive to shine the brightest if i could return home and stay a year visit my friend in various part of the union and by painting portrait make sufficient to bring I to england again at the end of the year whilst i obtain commission enough to employ I and support I while in england i think in the course of a year or two i shall have obtain sufficient credit to enable I to return home if not for the remainder of my life at least to pay a good long visit in all these plan i wish you to understand I as always take into consideration _ the will of providence _ and in every plan for future operation i hope i be not forgetful of the uncertainty of human life and i wish always to say _ should i live _ i will do this or that i perceive by you late letter that you suppose i be paint a large picture i do think of it some time ago and be only deter on account of the expense attend it all this i will explain to you entire satisfaction when i see you and why i do not think it expedient to make a exhibition when i return i perceive also that you be a little too sanguine with respect to I and expect a little too much from I you must recollect i be yet but a student and that a picture of any merit be not paint in a day experience as mr west be -lrb- and he also paint quicker than any other artist -rrb- he last large picture cost he between three and four year ' constant attention mr allston be nearly two year in paint he large picture young haydon be three year paint he large picture be now paint another on which he have be at work one year and expect to be two year more on it leslie be ten month paint he picture and my ` hercule ' cost I nearly a year 's study so you see that large picture be not the work of a moment all these matter we will talk over one of these day and all will be set right i have better paint miss russell 's aunt salisbury 's and dr bartlett 's picture at home for a very good reason i will give you he do however complete a large historical or rather mythological painting before leave england whether it be begin before or after write the foregoing letter i do not know but mr dunlap -lrb- whom i have already quote -rrb- have this to say about it : -- encourage by the flattering reception of he first work in painting and in sculpture the young artist redouble he energy in he study and determine to contend for the highest premium in historical composition offer by the royal academy at the beginning of the year 1814 the subject be ` the judgment of jupiter in the case of apollo marpessa and ida ' the premium offer be a gold medal and fifty guinea the decision be to take place in December of 1815 the composition contain four figure require much study but by the exercise of great diligence the picture be complete by the middle of July we young painter have now be in england four year one year longer than the time allow he by he parent and he have to return immediately home but he have finish he picture under the conviction strengthen by the opinion of west that it would be allow to remain and compete with those of the other candidate to he regret the petition to the council of the royal academy for this favor hand in to they by west and advocate strongly by he and fuselus be not grant he be tell that it be necessary accord to the rule of the academy that the artist should be present to receive the premium it could not be receive by proxy fuselus express himself in very indignant term at the narrowness of this decision thus disappoint the artist have but one mode of consolation he invite west to see he picture before he pack it up at the same time request mr west to inform he through mr leslie after the premium should be adjudge in December what chance he would have have if he have remain mr west after sit before the picture for a long time promise to comply with the request but add : ` you have better remain sir ' in a letter quote without a date by mr prime which be write from bristol but which seem to have be lose i find the following : -- jame russell esq have be extremely attentive to I he have a very fine family consist of four daughter and i think a son who be absent in the east indy the daughter be very beautiful accomplished and amiable especially the youngest lucy i come very near be at my old game of fall in love but i find that love and painting be quarrelsome companion and that the house of my heart be too small for both of they so i have turn mr love out-of-doors time enough thought i -lrb- with true old bachelor complacency -rrb- time enough for you these ten year to come mr russell 's portrait i have paint as a present to miss russell and will send it to she as soon as i can get a opportunity it be a excellent likeness of he he must either have say more in this letter or have write another after the family verdict -lrb- that terrible family verdict -rrb- have be pronounce for in the letter of April 23 1815 from which i have already quote he refer to this portrait as follow : -- as to the portrait which i paint of mr russell i be sorry you mention it to miss russell as i particularly request that you would not because in case of failure it would be a disappointment to she but as you have tell she i must now explain in the first place it be not a picture that will do I any credit i be unfortunate in the light which i choose to paint he in i wish to make it my best picture and so make it my worst for i work too timidly on it it be a likeness indeed a very strong likeness but the family be not please with it and they say that i have not flatter he that i have make he too old so i determine i would not send it indeed i promise they i would not send it but notwithstanding as i know miss russell will be good enough to comply with my condition i will send it directly for as it be a good likeness every one except the family know it instantly and mr allston say that it be a _ very strong likeness _ it will on that account be a gratification to she but i _ particularly _ and _ expressly request _ that it be keep in a private room to be show _ only _ to friend and relation and that i _ may never be mention as the painter _ and moreover that no _ artist _ or _ miniature painter _ be allow to see it on these condition i send it take for grant they will be comply with and without wait for a answer the parent of that generation be not frugal of counsel and advice even when they child have reach year of discretion and have fly far away from the family nest the father in a letter of may 20 1815 thus gently reprove he son : -- to-day we have receive you letter to march 23 you evidently misconceive we view in the letter to which you allude and feel much too strongly we advice and remark in respect to you write we so much on politics what we say be the affectionate advice of you parent who love you very tenderly and who be not unwilling you should judge for yourself though you might differ from they we have ever make a very candid allowance for you and so have all you friend and we have never for a moment believe we should differ a fortnight after you should come home and converse with we you have in the ardor of feeling construe many observation in we letter as censure you and design to wind you feeling which be not intend in the remotest degree by we for any such purpose i be sorry to hear of the death of mr thornton he be a good man he mother be much less gentle in she reproof i cull the follow sentence from a long letter of June 1 1815 : -- in perfect consistency with the feeling towards you all above describe we may and ought to tell you and that with the greatest plainness of anything that we deem improper in any part of you conduct either in a civil social or religious view this we feel it we duty to do and shall continue to do as long as we live and it will ever be you duty to receive from we the advice counsel and reproof which we may from time to time favor you with with the most perfect respect and dutiful observance and when you differ from we on any point whatever let that difference be convey to we in the most delicate and gentlemanly manner let this be do not only while you be under age and dependent on you parent for you support but when you be independent and when you be head of a family and even of a profession if you ever should be either i have dwell longer on this subject as i think you have in some of you last letter be somewhat deficient in that respect which you own good sense will at once convince you be on all account due and which i know you feel the propriety of without any further observation on June 2 1815 the father write : -- we have just receive a letter from you uncle jame eb finley of carolina he fear you will remain in europe but hope you have so much _ amor patrice _ as to return and display you talent in raise the military and naval glory of the nation by exhibit on canvas some of she late naval and land action and also promote the fine art among we he be you know a enthusiastic republican and patriot and a warm approver of the late war but a amiable excellent man i be by no means certain that it would not be best for you to come home this fall and spend a year or two in this country in paint some portrait but especially historical piece and landscape you might i think in this way succeed in get something to support you afterwards in europe for a few year i hope the time be not distant when artist in you profession and of the first class will be honorably patronize and support in this country in this case you can come and live with we which would give we much satisfaction the young man still take a deep interest in affair political and speculate rather keenly on the outcome of the tremendous happening on the continent on June 26 1815 he write : -- you will have hear of the dreadful battle in flander before this reach you the loss of the english be immense indeed almost all they finest officer and the flower of they army not less than 800 officer and upward of 15000 man some say 20000 but it have be decisive if the news of to-day be true that napoleon have abdicate what the event of these unparalleled time will be no mortal can pretend to foresee i have much to tell you when i see you perhaps you have better not write after the receipt of this as it may be more than two month before a answer could be receive p the papers of to-night confirm the news of this morning bonaparte be no longer a dangerous man he have abdicate and in all probability a republican form of government will be the future government of france if they be capable of enjoy such a government but no one can foresee event there may be a long peace or the world may be tear worse than it yet have be revolution seem to succeed revolution so rapidly that in look back on we life we seem to have live a thousand year and wonder of late seem to scorn to come alone they come in cluster the battle in flander be the battle of waterloo which be fight on the 18th day of June and on the 6th of July the ally army again enter paris refer to these event many year later morse say : -- it be on one of my visit in the year 1815 that a incident occur which well illustrate the character of the great philanthropist -lrb- mr wilberforce -rrb- as i pass through hyde park on my way to kensington gore i observe that great crowd have gather and rumor be rife that the ally army have enter pari that napoleon be a prisoner and that the war be virtually at a end and it be momentarily expect that the park gun would announce the good news to the people on enter the drawing-room at mr wilberforce 's i find the company consist of mr thornton -lrb- he memory must have play he false in this particular as mr thornton die some time before -rrb- mr macaulay mr grant the father and he two son robert and charle and robert owen of lanark in quite excited conversation respect the rumor that prevail mr wilberforce expatiate largely on the prospects of a universal peace in consequence of the probable overthrow of napoleon whom naturally he consider the great disturber of the nation at every period however he exclaim : ` it be too good to be true it can not be true ' he be altogether skeptical in regard to the rumor the general subject however be the absorb topic at the dinner-table after dinner the company join the lady in the drawing-room i sit near a window which look put in the direction of the distant park presently a flash and a distant dull report of a gun attract my attention but be unnoticed by the rest of the company another flash and report assure I that the park gun be firing and at once i call mr wilberforce 's attention to the fact run to the window he throw it up in time to see the next flash and hear the report clasp he hand in silence with the tear roll down he cheek he stand for a few moment perfectly absorb in thought and before utter a word embrace he wife and daughter and shake hand with every one in the room the scene be one not to be forget we learn from a letter of he mother 's date June 27 1815 that the painting of the die hercule have at last be receive but that the plaster cast of the same subject be still mysteriously miss the painting be much admire and the mother say : -- you friend mr tisdale say the picture of the hercule ought to be in boston as the beginning of a gallery of painting and that the bostonian ought not to permit it to go from here whether they will or not i know not i place no confidence in they but they may take a fit into they head to patronize the fine art and in that case they have it in they power undoubtedly to do as much as any city in this country towards they support morse have now make up he mind to return home although he parent in they letter of that time have give he leave to stay longer if he think it would be for he best interest but he father have make it clear that he must from this time forth depend on he own exertion he hope that -lrb- providence permit -rrb- he need only spend a year at home in earn enough money to warrant he return to europe providence however will otherwise and he do not return to europe until fourteen year later the next letter be date from liverpool August 8 1815 and be but a short one i shall quote the first few sentence : -- i have arrive thus far on my way home i leave london the 5th and arrive in this place yesterday the 7th at which time within a hour four year ago i land in england i have not yet determine by what vessel to return i have a choice of a great many the cere be the first that sail but i do not like she accommodation the liverpool packet sail about the 25th and as she have always be a favorite ship with I it be not improbable i may return in she he decide to sail in the cere however to he sorrow for the voyage home be a long and dreadful one the record of those terrible fifty-eight day carefully set down in he journal read like a odyssey of misfortune and almost of disaster to we of the present day who cross the ocean in a float hotel in a few day arrive almost on the hour the detailed account of the danger discomfort and privation suffer by the traveller of a earlier period seem almost incredible brave indeed be we father who go down to the sea in ship for they never know when if ever they would reach the other shore and there could be no cqd or so flash by wireless in the morse code to summon assistance in case of disaster in this case storm succeed storm head wind be encounter almost all the way across fine weather and fair wind be the exception and provision and fresh

unpleasant trait in we captain 's character which i shall merely allude to i be sorry to say he do not demonstrate that promptitude to assist a fellow creature in distress which i expect to find inherent in a seaman 's breast and especially in a american seaman 's it be not till after three or four hour ' delay and until the entreaty of he passenger and some threatening murmur on my part of a public exposure in boston of he conduct that he order the ship to bear down upon the wreck and then with slacken sail and much grumble a ship and a brig be astern of we and though farther by some mile from the distressed ship than we be they instantly bear down for she and render she this evening the assistance we might have do at noon we be now stand on we way with a fair wind spring up at

the storm ship roll to such a degree that we be compel to keep we berth cabin dark with the deadlight in oh who would go to sea when he can stay on shore the wind in southwest drive we back again so

four hour it blow so hard that all the sea be in a perfect foam and resemble a severe snowstorm more than a dry blow if the wind roar before it now shrilly whistle through we rig after some day of calm with wind sometimes favorable but light and when fresh ahead the journal continue : -- _ Monday 25th September _ another gale of wind last night ahead dreadful sea take in sail and lay to all

7th October _ wind still ahead and blow hard very cold and dismal oh when shall we see home i think i could observe a kind of warfare between the different wind since we have be at sea the west wind seem to be the tyrant at present as it be the bonaparte of the air he have be blow he gale very lavishly and no other wind have be able to check he with any success i recollect on one day while it be calm a thick bank of cloud begin to rise in the northeast no other cloud be in the sky they rise gently in the calm as if fearful of rouse they deadly foe in the west now they have gain one third of the heaven when behold in the southwest another bank of thick black cloud come roll up and redden in the ray of the setting sun march on teem with fury they soon gain the middle of the heaven where the frightened northeast have not yet reach they meet they mix the route northeast skulk back while the thick column of the southwest have drive back its enemy slowly return to its repose proudly display a thousand various color as if for victory at another time success seem to be more in favor of the northeast for shortly after this great defeat the southwest come forth and like a petty tyrant intoxicate with success begin to oppress the subject ocean it blow its gale and fill the air with cloud and rain and fog suddenly the northeast as under cover of the darkness and as one drive to desperation burst forth on its too confident enemy with redoubled fury old ocean groan at the dreadful conflict for as in the war of two hostile army on the domain of a neutral the neutral suffer most severely so the neutral ocean seem doom to bear the weight of all they rancor the southwest fly affrighted and now the northeast vaunt forth stalk with the rage of a angry demon over the water the ocean foam beneath he breath it steam and smoke and heave in agony its troubled bosom but alas how few can bear prosperity how few when victory crown they effort can rule with moderation how often do it happen that we reënact the same scene for which we punish we enemy for now have the northeast become the tyrant and rule with tenfold rigor he pour forth all he strength and drunk with success as soldier after a victory at length sink away into a inglorious calm now do the southwest collect he route force check but not conquer he again advance on he recreant foe and seize the vacant throne without a struggle ill-fated northeast hadst thou but rule with moderation when thou hadst gain with masterly maneuver the throne of the air hadst thou reserve thy force against surprise and not with prodigal profuseness lavish they on thy harmless subject thou hadst still be monarch of the sea and air all would have bless thee as the restorer of peace and as the deliverer of the ocean from western despotism but alas how art thou fall a everlasting example of overreach oppression this evening there be a fine fair wind from northeast carry we on at the rate of five or six knot this be the cause of the foregoing rhapsody have it be otherwise than a fair wind i should never have be in spirit to have write so much stuff still tantalize by baffling head wind and alternate calm and gale they be however gradually approach the coast omit the entry of the next eleven day i shall quote the final page of the journal _ Wednesday 18th October _ last night be a sleepless night to we all everything wear the appearance of a hard storm all be dull in the cabin scarce a word be speak every one wear a serious aspect and as any one come from the deck into the cabin the rest put up a inquisitive and apprehensive look with now and then a faint ` well how do it look now ' we captain as well as the passenger captain be both alarmed and be pore over the chart in deep deliberation a syllable be now and then catch from they but all seem despair at ten o'clock we lay to till twelve at four again till five rainy thick and hazy but not blow very hard all be dull and dismal a dreadful state of suspense between feeling of exquisite joy in the hope of soon see home and feeling of gloomy apprehension that a few hour may doom we to destruction _ half-past seven _ heaven be praise the joyful tiding be just announce of _ land _ oh who can conceive we feeling now the wretch condemn to the scaffold who receive at the moment he expect to die the joyful reprieve he can best conceive the

all difference political and otherwise be smooth over he remain at home that winter but seem to have meet with but slight success in he profession he judgment of jupiter be much admire but find no purchaser nor do he receive any commission for such large historical painting as it be he ambition to produce he be ask by a certain mr joseph delaplaine of philadelphium to paint a portrait of ex-president john adam for _ half _ price the portrait to be engrave and include in delaplaine 's repository of the life and portrait of distinguished american character and from letter of a later date i believe that morse consent to this it appear that he must also have receive but few if any order for portrait for in the follow summer he start on a painting tour through new hampshire which prove to be of great moment to he in more way than one before we follow he on that tour however i shall quote from a letter write by he to he friend washington allston : -- boston April 10 1816 my dear sir -- i have but one moment to write you by a vessel which sail to-morrow morning i write leslie by new packet some month since and be hourly expect a answer i congratulate you my dear sir on the sale of you picture of the dead man i suppose you will have receive notice before this reach you that the philadelphium academy of art have purchase it for the sum of thirty-five hundred dollar bravo for we country i be sincerely rejoice for you and for the disposition which it show of future encouragement i really think the time be not far distant when we shall be able to settle in we native land with profit as well as pleasure boston seem struggle in labor to bring forth a institution for the art but it will miscarry i find it be all force they can talk and talk and say what a fine thing it would be but nothing be do i find by experience that what you have often observe to I with respect to settle in boston be well found i think it will be the last in the art though without doubt it be capable of be the first if the fit would only take they oh how i miss you my dear sir i long to spend my evening again with you and leslie i shall certainly visit italy -lrb- should i live and no unforeseen event take place -rrb- in the course of a year or eighteen month could there not be some arrangement make to meet you and leslie there he live but the unforeseen event occur to make he alter all he plan further on in this same letter he say : -- my conscience accuse I and hardly too of many instance of pettishness and ill-humor towards you which make I almost hate myself that i could offend a temper like yours i need not ask you to forgive it i know you can not harbor anger a minute and perhaps have forget the instance but i can not forget they if you have failing of the same kind and i could recollect any instance where you have speak pettishly or ill-natured to I we account would then have be balance they would have call for mutual forgetfulness and forgiveness but when on reflection i find nothing of the kind to charge you with my conscience severely upbraid I with ingratitude to you to whom -lrb- under heaven -rrb- i owe all the little knowledge of my art which i possess but i hope still i shall prove grateful to you at any rate i feel my error and must mend they mr allston thus answer this frank appeal for forgiveness : -- my dear sir -- i will not apologize for have so long delay answer you kind letter be as you well know privileged by my friend to be a lazy correspondent i be sorry to find that you should have suffer the recollection of any hasty expression you might have utter to give you uneasiness be assure that they never be remember by I a moment after nor do they ever in the slightest degree diminish my regard or weaken my confidence in the sincerity of you friendship or the goodness of you heart besides the consciousness of warmth in my own temper would have make I inexcusable have i suffer myself to dwell on a inadvertent word from another i therefore beg you will no longer suffer any such unpleasant reflection to disturb you mind but that you will rest assure of my unaltered and sincere esteem you letter and one i have about the same time from my sister mary bring the first intelligence of the sale of my picture it be near three week later when i receive the account from philadelphium when you recollect that i consider the dead man -lrb- from the untoward fate he have hitherto experienced -rrb- almost literally as a _ caput mortuum _ you may easily believe that i be most agreeably surprise to hear of the sale but pleased as i be on account of the very seasonable pecuniary supply it would soon afford I i must say that i be still more gratify at the encouragement it seem to hold out for my return to america he friend leslie in a letter from london of may 7 1816 write : mr west say you picture would have be more likely than any of they to obtain the prize have you remain in another letter from leslie of September 6 1816 occur this amusing passage : -- the _ catalogue raisonné _ appear accord to promise but be not near so good as the one last year at the conclusion the author say that mr payne knight tell the director it be the custom of the greek nobility to strip and exhibit themselves naked to the artist in various attitude that they might have a opportunity of study fine form accordingly those public-spirited man the director have determine to adopt the plan and be all practise like mad to prepare themselves for the ensue exhibition when they be to be place on pedestal it be suppose that sir g beaumont mr long mr knight etc will occupy the principal light the marquis of stafford unfortunately could not recollect the attitude of any one antique figure but be find practise have the head of the die gladiator the body of the hercule one leg of the apollo and the other of the dancing faun turn the wrong way lord mulgrave have a small head thought of represent the torso but he do not know what to do with he leg and be afraid that as master of the ordnance he could not dispense with he _ arm _ in the beginning of August 1816 the young man start out on he quest for money this be frankly the object of he journey but it be characteristic of he buoyant and yet conscientious nature that have once make up he mind to give up for the present all thought of pursue the higher branch of he art he take up with zest the painting of portrait so far from degrade he art by pursue a branch of it which he hold to be inferior he still by conscientious work by put the best of himself into it raise it to a very high plane for many of he portrait be now hold by competent critic to rank high in the annals of art by some be place on a level with those of gilbert stuart on August 8 1816 he write to he parent from concord new hampshire : -- i have be in this place since Monday evening i arrive safely massabesek pond be very beautiful though see on a dull day i think that one or two elegant view might be make from it and i think i must sketch it at some future period i have as yet meet with no success in portrait but hope by perseverance i shall be able to

engage and many more talk of i think i shall get along well i believe i could make a independent fortune in a few year if i devoted myself exclusively to portrait so great be the desire for good portrait in the different country town he must have be a very rapid worker to have paint five portrait in eight day but perhaps on account of the very modest price he receive these be more in the nature of quick sketch the next letter be rather startling when we recall he recent assertion concern mr love and the joy of a bachelor existence concord August 20 1816 my dear parent -- i write you a few line just to say i be well and very industrious next day after to-morrow i shall have receive one hundred dollar which i think be pretty well for three week i shall probably stay here a fortnight

a excellent disposition this be she character in town i have enquire particularly of dr mcfarland respect the family and he answer be every way satisfactory except that they be not professor of religion he be a man of family and great wealth this last you know i never make a principal object but it be somewhat satisfactory to know that in my profession i may flatter myself but i think i might be a successful suitor you will perhaps think I a terrible harum-scarum fellow to be continually fall in love in this way but i have a dread of be a old bachelor and i be now twenty-five year of age there be still no need of hurry the young lady be but sixteen but all this be think aloud to you i make you my confidant i wish you advice nothing shall be do precipitately of course all that i say be between you and I for it all may come to nothing i have _ some experience _ that way what i have do i have do prayerfully i have pray to the giver of every good gift that he will direct I in this business that if it will not be to he glory and the good of he kingdom he will frustrate all that if he grant I prosperity he will grant I a heart to use it aright and if adversity that he will teach I submission to he will and that whatever may be my lot here i may not fall short of eternal happiness hereafter i hope you will remember I in you prayer and especially in reference to a

presume to last I some week if i could stay but i long to get home _ through concord _ mama 's scheme of paint a large landscape and sell it to general bradley for two hundred dollar must give place to another which have just come into my head : that of send to you for my great canvas and paint the quarrel at dartmouth college as large as life with all the portrait of the trustee overseer officer of college and student and if i finish it next week to ask five thousand dollar for it and then come home in a coach and six and put ned to the blush with he nineteen subscriber a day only think $ 5000 a week be $ 260000 a year and if i live ten year i shall be worth $ 2600000 a very pretty fortune for this time of day be it not a grand scheme the remark concern he brother sidney edward 's subscriber refer to a religious newspaper the boston recorder found and edit by he it be one of the first of the many religious journal which since that time have multiply all over the country continue he modestly successful progress he write next from hanover on October 3 1816 : -- i arrive in this place on Tuesday evening and be painting away with all my might i be painting judge woodward

great distance so that in all i receive eighty-five dollar in money i have five more engage at windsor for next summer so you see i have not be idle i _ must _ spend a fortnight at concord so that i shall not probably be at home till early in November i think with proper management that i have but little to fear as to this world i think i can with industry average from two to three thousand dollar a year which be a tolerable income though _ not equal to _ $ 2600000 concord October 14 1816 i arrive here on Friday evening in good health and spirit from hanover i paint four portrait altogether in hanover and have many engage for next summer i presume i shall paint some here though i be uncertain i find lucretium in good health very glad to see I she improve on acquaintance she be

o'clock -rrb- and be now in a state of suspense anxiously wait he answer before i close this i hope to give you the result _ five o'clock _ i have just call and have a conversation -lrb- by request -rrb- with mr walker and i have the satisfaction to say : i have lucretium 's parent ' entire approbation everything successful praise be to the giver of every good gift what indeed shall i render to he for all he unmerited and continually increase mercy and blessing in a letter to miss walker from a girl friend we find the following : -- you appear to think dear lucretia that i be possess of quite a insensible _ heart _ pardon I if i say the same of you for i have hear that several have become candidate for you affection but that you remain unmoved until mr m of charlestown make he appearance when i understand you do hope that he sentiment in you favor be reciprocal i rejoice to hear this for though i be unacquainted with that gentleman yet when i hear he be likely to become a successful suitor i have make some enquiry concern he and find he be possess of every excellent and amiable quality that i should wish the person to have who be to become the husband of so dear a friend as yourself morse must have return home about the end of October for we find no more letter until the 14th of December when he write from portsmouth new hampshire : -- i should have write you sooner but i have be employ in settle myself i think it best not to be precipitate in fix on a place to board and lodge but first to sound the public as to my success every one think i shall meet with encouragement and on the strength of this i have take lodgings and a room at mr hinge 's in jaffrey street a very excellent and central situation i shall commence on Monday morning with governor langdon 's portrait he be very kind and attentive to I as indeed be all here and will do everything to aid I i wish not to raise high expectation but i think i shall succeed tolerably well about this time finley morse and he brother edward have jointly devise and patent a new flexible piston-pump from which they hope great thing edward always more or less of a wag propose to call it morse 's patent metallic double-headed ocean-drinker and deluge-spouter valve pump-box it be to be use in connection with fire-engine and seem really to have be a excellent invention for president jeremiah day of yale college give the young inventor he write endorsement and elus whitney the inventor of the cotton-gin thus recommend it : have examine the model of a fire-engine invent by mr morse with piston of a new construction i be of opinion that a engine may be make on that principle -lrb- be more simple and much less expensive -rrb- which would have a preference to those in common use in the letter of the year 1817 and of several follow year even in the letter of the young man to he _ fiancée _ many long reference be make to this pump and to the vary success in introduce it into general use i shall not however refer to it again and only mention it to show the bent of morse 's mind towards invention he spend some time in the early part of 1817 in portsmouth new hampshire meeting with success in he profession miss walker be also there visit friend so we may presume that he stay be pleasant as well as profitable in February of that year he accompany he _ fiancée _ to charlestown he parent naturally wish to make the acquaintance of the young lady and then return to portsmouth to finish he work there the visit of miss walker to charlestown give great satisfaction to all concern on march 4 1817 morse write to he parent from portsmouth : i be under the agreeable necessity -lrb- shall i say -rrb- of postpone my return in consequence of a _ press of business _ i shall have three begin to-night one sit yesterday -lrb- a large one -rrb- and two will sit to-day -lrb- small -rrb- and three more have it in serious contemplation this unexpected occurrence will deprive I of the pleasure of see you this week at least and on the next day march 5 he write : the unexpected application of three sitter at a time completely stop I since i write i have take a first sit of a fourth -lrb- large -rrb- and a fifth -lrb- large -rrb- sit on Friday morning so you see i be over head and ear in business as it be necessary to a clear understanding of morse 's character to realize the depth of he religious conviction i shall quote the follow from this same letter of march 5 : -- i wish much to know the progress of the revival how many be admit next communion and any religious news i have be in the house almost ever since i come from home sift the scheme of universal salvation to the bottom what occasion this be a occurrence on the evening of Sunday before last i hear the bell ring for lecture and conclude it be at mr putnam 's i accordingly sally out to go to it when i find that it be in the universalist meeting-house as i be out and never in a universalist meeting i think for mere curiosity i would go in i go into a very large meeting-house the meeting be overflow with people of both sex and the singing the finest i have hear in portsmouth i be strike with the contrast it make to mr putnam 's sacramental lecture fifteen or sixteen person thinly scatter over the house and the choir consist of four or five whose united voice could scarcely be hear in the farthest corner of the church and when hear so out of harmony as to set one 's tooth on edge the reflection which this melancholy contrast cause i could not help communicate to mr putnam in the word of mr spring 's sermon ' _ something must be do _ ' he agree it be a dreadful state of society here but almost give up as hopeless i tell he he never should yield a post like this to the devil without a struggle and at any rate i tell he that the few christian that there be -lrb- and indeed they be but as one to one thousand -rrb- could pray and i think it be high time i tell he i would do all in my power to assist he in any scheme where i could be of use the year 1817 be spend by the young man in execute the commission which have be promise he the year before in new hampshire in all he journeying back and forth the road invariably lead through concord and the pure love of the young people for each other increase as the month roll by i shall not profane the sacredness of this love by introduce any of the more intimate passage of they letter of this and of later year the young girl respond readily to the religious exhortation of she _ fiancé _ and become a sincere and devout christian it will not be necessary to follow he in this journey as the experience be but a repetition of those of the year before he paint many portrait in concord hanover and other place and finally conclude to venture on a trip to charleston south carolina where he kinsman dr finley and mr john a alston have urge he to come assure he good business on January 27 1818 he arrive in that beautiful southern city and thus announce he arrival to he parent : i find myself in a new climate the weather warm as we may i have be introduce to a number of friend i think my prospects be favorable at first however the promise success do not materialize and it be not until after many week of wait that the tide turn but it do turn for a excellent portrait of dr finley one of the best ever paint by morse arouse the enthusiasm of the charlestonian and order begin to pour in so that in a few week he be engage to paint one hundred and fifty portrait at sixty dollar each quite a advance over the meager fifteen dollar he have receive in new england but for some of he more elaborate production he receive even more as the follow extract from a letter of mr john a alston date April 7 1818 will prove : -- i have just receive you favor of the 30th ultimo and thank you very cordially for you goodness in consent to take my daughter 's full-length likeness in the manner i describe say twenty-four inch

-- excuse my neglect in not have write you before this accord to my promise before i leave boston i can only plead as apology -lrb- what i know will gratify you -rrb- a multiplicity of business i be

to be finish at the north i hope in boston where i shall once more enjoy you criticism i be exert my utmost to improve every picture i try to make my best and in the evening i draw two hour from the antique as i do in london for i ought to inform you that i fortunately find a fine ` venus de medicis ' without a blemish import from pari sometime since by a gentleman of this city who wish to dispose of it also a young apollo which be so broken that he give it to I say it be useless i have however after a great deal of trouble put it together entirely and these two figure with some fragment -- hand foot etc -- make a good academy mr fraser mr cogdell mr fisher of boston and myself meet here of a evening to improve ourselves i feel as much enthusiasm as ever in my art and love it more than ever a few year at the rate i be now go on will place I independent of public patronage thus much for myself for you tell I in one of you letter from london that i must be more of a egotist or you should be less of one in you letter to I which i should greatly regret and now permit I my dear sir to congratulate you on you election to the royal academy i know you will believe I when i say i jump for joy when i hear it though it can not add to you merit yet it will extend the knowledge of it especially in we own country where we be still influence by foreign opinion and more justly perhaps in regard to taste in the fine art than in any other thing on march 1 1819 the common council of charleston pass the following resolution : -- resolve unanimously that he honor the intendant be request to solicit jame monroe president of the united state to permit a full-length likeness to be take for the city of charleston and that mr morse be request to take all necessary measure for execute the say likeness on the visit of the president to this city resolve unanimously that the sum of seven hundred and fifty dollar be appropriate for this purpose extract from the minute william roach jr clerk of council this portrait of president monroe be complete later on and still hang in the city hall of charleston i shall have occasion to refer to it again morse in a letter to he parent of march 26 1819 say : -- two of you letter have be lately receive detail the state of the parish and church i can not say i be surprise for it be what might be expect from charlestown people as to return home in the way i mention mama need not be at all uneasy on that score it be necessary i should visit washington as the president will stay so short a time here that i can not complete the head unless i see he in washington now as to the parish and church business i hope all thing will turn out right yet and i can not help wish that nothing may occur to keep you any longer in that nest of viper and conspirator i think with edward decidedly that on mama 's account alone you should leave a place which be full of the most unpleasant association to all the family and retire to some place of quiet to enjoy you old age why not come to charleston here be a fine place for usefulness a pleasant climate especially for person advance in life and you child here for i think seriously of settle in charleston lucretium be willing and i think it will be much for my advantage to remain through the year richard can find a place here if he will and edward can come on and be _ bishop _ or _ president _ or _ professor _ in some of the college -lrb- for i can not think of he in a less character -rrb- after he have graduate i wish seriously you would think of this you friend here would greatly rejoice and a opening could be find i have no doubt christian want they hand strengthen and a veteran soldier like papa might be of great service here in the infancy of the _ unitarian hydra _ who find a population too well adapt to receive and cherish its easy and fascinating tenet all this refer to a movement organize by the enemy of dr morse to oust he from he parish in charlestown he be a militant fighter for orthodoxy and a uncompromising foe to unitarianism which be gradually obtain the ascendancy in and near boston the movement be finally successful as we shall see later but they do not go as far from they old haunt as charleston i shall not attempt to argue the rights and wrong of the case which seem to have be rather complicate for dr morse more than a year after this in write to a friend say : the event of the last fifteen month be still involve in impenetrable mystery which i doubt not will be unravel in due time the winter and spring of 1819 be spend by the young couple both pleasantly and profitably in charleston the best society of that charming city open its arm to they and order flow in in a steady stream mr john a alston be a most generous patron order many portrait of he child and friend and sometimes insist on pay the young man even more than the price agree upon in a letter to morse he say : which of my friend be it who lately observe to you that i have a picture mania you make i understand a most excellent reply ` you wish i would come to town then and bite a dozen ' indeed my very good sir be it in my power to excite in they a just admiration of you talent i would readily come to town and bite the whole community and in another letter of April 10 1819 mr alston say : you portrait of my daughter be leave in georgetown -lrb- south carolina -rrb- at the house of a friend nearly all of the citizen have see it and i really think it will occasion you some application every one think himself at liberty to make remark some declare it to be a good likeness while other insist it be not so and several who make such remark i _ know _ have _ never _ see my daughter at last a rich jew gentleman observe ` it be the _ richest _ piece of painting he have ever see ' this be so much in character that i assure you sir i could contain myself no longer which spreading among the audience occasion not a unpleasant moment morse and he young wife return to the north in the early summer of 1819 and spend the summer and fall with he parent in charlestown the young man occupy himself with the completion of the portrait which he have bring with he from the south and he wife be busy with preparation for the event which be thus record in a letter of dr morse 's to he son sidney edward at andover : since i have be write the above lucretium have present we with a fine granddaughter and be do well the event have fill we with joy and gratitude the child be christen susan walker morse in the mean time the distressing news have come from charleston of the sudden death of dr finley to whose kindly affection and influence morse owe much of the pleasure and success of he several visit to charleston affair have come to a crisis in the parish at charlestown and dr morse decide to resign and plan to move to new haven connecticut with he family in the follow spring the necessity for pursue he profession in the most profitable field compel morse to return to charleston by way of washington in November and this time he have to go alone much against he inclination he write to he mother from new york on November 28 1819 : i miss lucretium and little susan more than you can think and i shall long to have we all together at new haven in the spring he object in go to washington be to paint the portrait of the president and of this he say in a letter : i begin on Monday to paint the president and have almost complete the head i be thus far please with it but i find it very perplexing for he can not sit more than ten or

magistrate for the credit of the nation plainness can be carry to a extreme and in national building and establishment it will with good reason be style meanness _ December 23 1819 _ it be obviously for my interest to hasten to charleston as i shall there be immediately at work and this be the more necessary as there be a fresh gang of adventurer in the brush line go to charleston before I a

the northwestern frontier of the united state and gain much valuable information which he lay before the government as he be a man of delicate constitution we can not but admire he indomitable spirit in ever devise new project of usefulness to he fellow man it be impossible for he to remain idle but it be not within the scope of this work to follow he on he journey although he letter of that period make interesting reading while he be in washington he wife write to he on January 27 1820 say : mr salisbury and abby drink tea with we day before yesterday they tell we that catherine breese be marry to a lieutenant in the army this must have be a very sudden thing and i should suppose very grievous to arthur little do the good lady think as she pen these word that many year afterwards she beloved eldest son would take as he second wife a daughter of this union why this marriage should have be grievous to the father arthur breese i do not know unless all army officer be class among the ungodly by the very pious of those day as a matter of fact lieutenant afterwards captain griswold be a most gallant gentleman in the mean time finley morse have reach charleston in safety after a tedious journey of many day by stage from washington and be busily employ in painting on February 4 1820 he write to he mother : -- i receive you good letter of the 19th and 22d ult and thank you for it i wish i have time to give you a narrative of my journey as you wish but you know ' _ time be money _ ' and we must ' _ make hay while the sun shine _ ' and ' _ a penny save be a penny get _ and ' _ least say soonest mend _ ' and a good many other wise saying which would be quite pat but i can not think of they the fact be i have scarcely time to say or write a word i be busily employ in get the cash or else ned 's almanac for march will foretell falsely i be do well although the city fairly swarm with painter i be the only one that have as much as he can do all the rest be complain i wish i could divide with some of they very clever man who have family to support and can get nothing to do i feel rejoice that thing have come to such a crisis in charlestown that we family will be release from that region of trouble so soon keep up you spirit mother the lord will show you good day accord to those in which you have see evil i be glad lucretium and the dear little susan intend meeting I at new haven i think this by far the best plan it will save I a great deal of time which as i say before be money i shall have to spend some time in new haven get settle and i wish to commence painting as soon as possible for i have more than a summer 's work before I in the president 's portrait and mr ball 's as soon as the cash come in mother it shall all be remit except what i immediately want you may depend upon it that nothing shall be leave undo on my part to help you and the rest of we from that hole of viper i think it very probable i shall return by the middle of may it will depend much on circumstance however i wish very much to be with my dear wife and daughter i must contrive to bring they with I next season to charleston though it may be more expensive yet i do not think that should be a consideration i think that a man should be separate from he family but very seldom and then under case of absolute necessity as i consider the case to be at present with I : that be i think they should not be separate for any length of time if i know my own disposition i be of a domestic habit form to this habit probably by the circumstance that have be so peculiar to we family in charlestown i by no means regret have such a habit if it can be properly regulate i think it may be carry to excess and shut we from the opportunity of do good by mix with we fellow man this pronouncement be very characteristic of the man he be always all through he long life happiest when at home surround by all he family and yet he never shirk the duty of absent himself from home even for a prolonged period when by so do he could accomplish some great or good work that a portrait-painter 's lot be not always a happy one may be illustrate by the following extract from letter of morse to the mr ball whom he mention in the foregoing letter to he mother and who seem to have be a most capricious person insist on continual alteration and one day pleased and the next almost insulting in she censure : -- madam -- suppose that i be deal not only with a woman of honor but from she profession with a christian i ventured in my note of the 18th inst to make a appeal to you conscience in support of the justness of my demand of the four hundred dollar still due from you for you portrait by you last note i find you be dispose to take a advantage of that circumstance of which i do not suppose you capable my sense of the justness of my demand be so strong as will appear from the whole tenor of that note that i venture this appeal not imagine that any person of honor of the least spark of generous feeling and more especially of christian principle could understand anything more than the enforce my claim by a appeal to that principle which i know should be the strongest in a real christian whilst however you have choose to put a different construction on this part of the note and suppose that i leave you to say whether you would pay I anything or nothing you have -lrb- doubtless unconsciously -rrb- show that you conscience have decide in favor of the whole amount which be my due and which i can never voluntarily relinquish you affirm in the first part of you note that after due consideration you think the real value of the picture be four hundred dollar -lrb- without the frame -rrb- yet have you crop be good you conscience would have adjudge I the remain four hundred dollar without hesitation and again -lrb- if you crop should be good -rrb- you could pay I the four hundred dollar next season must i understand from this madam that the goodness or badness of you crop be the scale on which you conscience measure you obligation to pay a just debt and that it contract or expand as you crop increase or diminish pardon I madam if i say that this appear to be the case from you letter my wish throughout this whole business have be to accommodate the time and term of payment as much to you convenience as i could consistently with my duty to my family and myself as a proof of this you need only advert to my note of yesterday in which i inform you that i be pay interest on money borrow for the use of my family which you debt if it have be promptly pay would have prevent and in another letter he say : -- i complete you picture in the summer with two other which have give as far as i can learn entire satisfaction yours be paint with the same attention and with the same ability as the other and admire as a picture after it be finish as much by some as the other and more by many among these latter be the celebrated colonel trumbull and vanderlyn painter of new york you can not but recollect madam that when you yourself with you child visit it not withstand you express yourself before they in term so strong against it and so wound to my feeling yet all you child dissent from you the youngest say it be ` mama ' and the eldest ' i be sure mother it be very like you ' you picture from the day i commence it have be the source of one of my greatest trial and if it have teach I in any degree patience and forbearance i shall have abundant reason to be thankful for the affliction in the end he consent to take less than have be agree upon in order to close the incident as a happy contrast to this episode we have the follow quotation from a letter to he wife write on February 17 1820 : -- do i tell you in my last that colonel alston insist on give I _ two hundred dollar _ more than i ask for the picture of little sally and a commission to paint she again full length next season smaller than the last and larger than the first portrait for which i shall receive four hundred dollar he intimate also that i be to paint a picture annually for he be not he a strange man -lrb- as people say here -rrb- i wish some more of the great fortune in this part of the country would be as strange and encourage other artist who be man of genius and starve for want of employment morse return to the north in the spring of 1820 and join he mother and he wife and daughter in new haven where they have precede he and where they be comfortably and agreeably settle as will appear from the following sentence in a letter to he good friend and mentor henry bromfield of london date August 1820 : you will perceive by the head of this letter that i be in new haven my father and he family have leave charlestown massachusett and be settle in this place my own family also consist of wife and daughter be pleasantly settle in this delightful spot i have build I a fine painting-room attach to my house in which i paint my large picture in the summer and in the winter i migrate to charleston south carolina where i have commission sufficient to employ I for some year to come he return to charleston in the fall of 1820 and be again compel to go alone he write to he wife on December 27 : i feel the separation this time more than ever and i feel the other day when i see the steamship start for new york that i have almost a mind to return in she from this sentence we learn that the slow schooner of the precede year have be supplant by the more rapid steamship but that be unfortunately all he have to say of this great step forward in human progress further on in this same letter he say : i be occupy fully so that i have no reason to complain i have not a _ press _ like the first season or like the last but still i can say i be all the time employ my president please very much i have hear no dissatisfaction express it be place in the great hall in a fine light and place mr ball want some alteration that be to say every five minute she would like it to be different she be the most unreasonable of all mortal derangement be she only apology i can not tell you all in a letter must wait till i see you i shall get the rest of the cash from she shortly just at this time the wave of prosperity on which the young man have so long float begin to subside for he write to he wife on January 28 1821 : -- i wish i could write encouragingly as to my professional pursuit but i can not notwithstanding the diminish price and the increase of exertion to please and although i be conscious of painting much better portrait than formerly -lrb- which indeed stand to reason if i make continual exertion to improve -rrb- yet with all i receive no new commission cold and procrastinating answer from those to whom i write and who have put they name on my list i give less satisfaction to those whom i have paint i receive less attention also from some of those who formerly pay I much attention and none at all from most but with he usual hopefulness he say later on in this letter : -- why should i expect my sky to be perpetually unclouded my sun to be never obscure i have thus far enjoy more of the sunshine of prosperity than most of my fellow man ` shall i receive good at the hand of the lord and shall i not also receive evil ' in this letter a very long one he suggest the establishment of a academy or school of painting in new haven so that he may be enable to live at home with he family and find time to paint some of the great historical work which he still long to do he also tell of the formation of such a academy in charleston : -- since write this there have be form here a academy of art to be erect immediately jr poinsett esq be president and six other with myself be choose director what this be go to lead to i do not know i hear mr cogdell say that it be intend to have lecture read among other thing i feel not very sanguine as to its success still i shall do all in my power to help it on as long as i be here he foreboding seem to have be justify for mr john s cogdell a sculptor thus write of it in later year to mr dunlap : -- the legislature grant a charter but my good sir as they possess no power under the constitution to confer taste or talent and possess none of those feeling which prompt to patronage they give none to the infant academy the institution be allow from apathy and opposition to die but mr poinsett and myself with a few other have purchase with a hope of revive the establishment refer to this academy the wife in new haven in a letter of February 25 1821 say : mr silliman say he be not much pleased to hear that they have a academy for painting in charleston he be afraid they will decoy you there on march 11 1821 morse answer thus : tell mr silliman i have stronger _ magnet _ at new haven than any academy can have and while that be the case i can not be decoy permanently from home i wonder if he use the word magnet advisedly for it be with professor silliman that he at that time pursue the study in physics include electricity which have so interested he while in college and it be largely due to the familiarity with the subject which he then acquire that he be in later year enable successfully to perfect he invention on the 12th of march 1821 another daughter be bear to the young couple and be name elizabeth ann after she paternal grandmother the child live but a few day however much to the grief of she parent and grandparent charleston have now give all she have to give to the young painter and he pack he belongings

that white be better than blue etc etc etc which she can explain to you much better than i can she be willing however to get you any you wish if you still request it she think if you can not wait for the new fashion that you black bonnet put into proper shape with black plume would be as _ tasty _ and fashionable as any you could procure i think so too you have better write aunt particularly about

plain sailing however for he wife say to he in a letter of December 28 1821 : know that perseverance be a trait in you character we do not any of we feel surprised to hear you have overcome so many

building at the corner of nassau and beekman street and that edifice have a important connection with the invention of the telegraph on the same site now stand the morse build a pioneer sky-scraper now sadly dwarf by its gigantic neighbor the year 1823 be one of mingled discouragement and hope compel to absent himself from home for long period in search of work always hope that in some place he would find enough to do to warrant he bring he family and make for they a permanent home he letter reflect he vary mood but always with the underlie conviction that providence will yet order all thing for the best the letter of the young wife be pathetic in they expression of loneliness during the absence of she husband and yet of forced cheerfulness and submission to the will of god on the 17th of march 1823 another child be bear a son who be name for he maternal grandfather charle walker the child be at first very delicate and this add to the anxiety of the fond mother and father but he soon outgrow he childish ailment morse 's active mind be ever bent on invention and in this year he devise and seek to patent a machine for carve marble statue perfect copy of any model he have great hope of pecuniary profit from this invention and it be mention many time in the letter of this and the following year but he find on enquiry that it be not patentable as it would have be a infringement on the machine of thoma blanchard which be patent in 1820 so once more be he hope of independence blast as they have be in the case of the pump and fire-engine he long like all artist to be free from the petty care and humiliation of the struggle for existence free to give full rein to he lofty aspiration secure in the confidence that those he love be well provide for but like most other genius he be compel to drink still deeper of the bitter cup to drain it to the very dregs in the month of August 1823 he go to albany hope through he acquaintance with the patroon stephen van rensselaer to establish himself there he paint the portrait of the patroon confident that by its exhibition he would secure other order in a letter to he wife he say : -- i have find lodgings -- a large front room on the second story twenty-five by eighteen foot and twelve foot high -- a fine room for painting with a neat little bedroom and every convenience and board all for six dollar a week which i think be very reasonable my landlord be a elderly irish gentleman with three daughter once in independent circumstance but now reduce everything bear the appearance of old-fashioned gentility which you know i always like everything be neat and clean and genteel bishop hobart and a great many acquaintance be on board of the boat upon which i come up to this city i can form no idea as yet of the prospect of success in my profession here if i get enough to employ I i shall go no farther if not i may visit some of the smaller town in the interior of the state i await with some anxiety the result of experiment with my machine i hope the invention may enable I to remain at home _ 16th of August _ i have not as yet receive any application for a portrait many tell I i have come at the wrong time -- the same tune that have be ring in my ear so long i hope the right tune will come by and by the winter it be say be the proper season but as it be better in the south at that season and it will be more profitable to be there i shall give albany a thorough trial and do my best if i should not find enough to employ I here i think i shall return to new york and settle there this i have rather not do at present but it may be the best that i can do roam become more and more irksome imperious necessity alone drive I to this course do not think by this i be faint-hearted i shall persevere in this course painful as be the separation from my family until providence clearly point out my duty to return _ August 22 _ i have something to do i have one portrait in progress and the promise of more one hundred dollar will pay all my expense here for three month so that the two i be now paint will clear I in that respect and all that come after will be clear gain i be therefore easier in my mind as to this the portrait i be now paint be judge moss kent brother of the chancellor he say that i shall paint the chancellor when he return to albany and he niece also and from these particulars you may infer that i shall be here for some little time longer just so long as my good prospects continue but should they fail i be determine to try new york city and sit down there in my profession permanently i believe i have now attain sufficient proficiency to venture there my progress may be slow at first but i believe it will be sure i do not like go south and i have give up the idea of new orlean or any southern city at least for the present circumstance may vary this determination but i think a settlement in new york be more feasible now than ever before i shall be near you and home in case of emergency and in the summer and sickly season can visit you at new haven while you can do the same to I in new york until we live again at new haven altogether i leave out of this calculation the _ machine for sculpture _ if that should entirely succeed my plan would be materially varied but i speak of my present plan as if that have fail _ August 24 _ i finish mr kent 's picture yesterday and receive the money for it mr kent be very polite to I and have introduce I to a number of person and family among other to the kane -- very wealthy people -- to governor yate etc mr clinton 's son call on I and invite I to they house i have be introduce to señor rocafuerto the spaniard who make so excellent a speech before the bible society last may he be a very handsome man very intelligent full of wit and vivacity he be a great favorite with the lady and be a man of wealth and a zealous patriot study we manners custom and improvement with a view of benefit he own countryman in peru i long to be with you again and to see you all at _ home _ i fear i dote on _ home _ too much but mine be such a uncommon home such a delightful home that i can not but feel strongly my privation of its pleasure _ August 27 _ my last two letter have hold out to you some encouraging prospects of success here but now they seem darkened again i have have nothing to do this week thus far but to wait patiently i have advertise in both of the city papers that i should remain one week to receive application but as yet it have produce no effect chancellor kent be out of town and i be tell yesterday would not be in until the end of next month if i should have nothing to do in the mean time it be hardly worth while to stay solely for that many have be talk of have they portrait paint but there it have thus far end i feel a little perplexed to know what to do i find nothing in albany which can profitably employ my leisure hour if there be any picture or statuary where i could sketch and draw it would be different i have visit several family who have be very kind to I for which i be thankful i shall leave albany and return to new york a week from to-day if there be no change in my prospects the more i think of make a push at new york as a permanent place of residence in my profession the more proper it seem that it should be pretty soon there be now no rival that i should fear a few more year may produce one that would be hard to overcome new york do not yet feel the influx of wealth from the western canal but in a year or two she will feel it and it will be advantageous to I to be previously identify among she citizen as a painter it require some little time to become know in such a city as new york colonel t -- be grow old too and there be no artist of education sufficiently prominent to take he place as president of the academy of art by become more know to the new york public and exert my talent to discover the best method of promote the art and write about they i may possibly be promote to he place where i could have a better opportunity of do _ something for the art in we country _ the object at which i aim _ September 3 _ i have nothing to do and shall pack up on the morrow for new york unless appearance change again i have not have full employment since i have be in albany and i feel miserable in do nothing i shall set out on Friday and perhaps may go to

in my profession but have be disappoint until last evening i call and spend the evening with my friend mr van schaick and tell he i have think of paint some little design from the ` sketch book ' so as not to be idle and mention the subject of ichabod crane discover the headless horseman he say : ` paint it for I and another picture of the same size and i will take they of you ' so i be now employ _ my secret scheme _ be not yet disclosable but i shall let you know as soon as i hear anything definite still later he say : -- i have see many of the artist they all agree that little be do in the city of new york it seem wholly give to commerce every man be drive at one object -- the making of money -- not the spending of it my _ secret scheme _ look promising but i be still in suspense you shall know the moment it be decide one way or the other he brother sidney edward in a letter to he parent of December 9 1823 say : finley be in good spirit again not because he have any prospect of business here but he be dream of the gold mine of mexico as he _ secret _ be now out he explain it fully in the follow letter to he wife date December 21 1823 : -- my cash be almost go and i begin to feel some anxiety and perplexity to know what to do i have advertise and visit and hint and plead and even ask one man to sit but all to no purpose my expense with the most rigid economy too be necessarily great my rent to-morrow will amount to thirty-three dollar and i have nothing to pay it with what can i do i have be here five week and there be not the smallest prospect _ now _ of any difference as to business i be willing to stay and wish to stay if there be anything to do the picture that i be painting for mr van schaick will not pay my expense if paint here my rent and board would eat it all up i have think of various plan but what to decide upon i be completely at a loss nor can i decide until i hear definitely from washington in regard to my mexico expedition since brother sidney have hint it to you i will tell you the state of it i write to general van rensselaer mr poinsett and colonel hayne of the senate apply for some situation in the legation to mexico soon to be send thither i state my object in go and my wish to go free of expense and under government protection i receive a letter a few day ago from general van rensselaer in which he say : ' i immediately lay you request before the president and second it with my warmest recommendation it be impossible to predict the result at present if we friend mr poinsett be appoint minister which he friend be press he will no doubt be happy to have you in he suite ' thus the case rest at present if mr poinsett be appoint i shall probably go to mexico if not it will be more doubtful if i go i should take my picture of the house of representative which in the present state of favorable feeling towards we country i should probably dispose of to advantage all account that i hear from mexico be in the highest degree favorable to my enterprise and i hear much from various quarter as can well be imagine he wife do not look with unalloyed pleasure on this plan she say in a letter of December 25 1823 : i have feel much for you my dearest finley in all you trial and perplexity i be sorry to hear you have be unsuccessful in obtain portrait i hope you will ere long experience a change for the better as to the mexico plan i know not what to think of it how can i consent to have you be at such a distance however convince by she husband that it would be for he best interest to go she reluctantly give she consent and he use every legitimate effort to secure the appointment he be finally successful mr poinsett be not appoint as minister this honor be bestow on the honorable ninian edward of illinoi but morse be name as one of he suite in a note from the honorable robert young hayne who it will be remember be the opponent of daniel webster in the great debate on state ' rights in the senate morse be thus apprise of he appointment : governor edward 's suite consist of mr mason of georgetown dc secretary of the legation mr hodgson of virginium private secretary and yourself attaché morse have great hope of increase he reputation as a painter and of earn much money in mexico he be perfectly frank in state that he principal object in seek a appointment as attaché be that he might pursue he profession and in a letter to mr edward of April 15 1824 he thus explain why he consider this not incompatible with he duty as attaché : that the pursuit of my profession will not be derogatory to the situation i may hold i infer from the fact that many of the ancient painter be ambassador to different european court and pursue they profession constantly while abroad ruben while ambassador to the english court execute some of he finest portrait and decorate the ceiling of the chapel of white hall with some of he best historical production when it be finally decide that he should go he make all he preparation include a bed and bedding among he impediment be assure that this be necessary in mexico and bid farewell to he family he father he wife and child and he sister-in-law accompany he as far as new york writing of the parting he say : a thousand affect incident of separation from my beloved family crowd upon my recollection the unconscious gayety of my dear child as they frolic in all they wonted playfulness too young to sympathize in the pang that agitate they distressed parent they artless request to bring home some trifling toy the parting kiss not understand as mean more than usual the tear and sad farewell of father mother wife sister family friend the desolateness of every room as the parting glance be throw on each familiar object and ` farewell farewell ' seem write on the very wall -- all these thing bear upon my memory and i realize the declaration that ` the place which now know we shall know we no more ' -lrb- illustration : lucretium pickering walker wife of sfb morse and two child paint by morse -rrb- it must be bear in mind that a journey in those day even one from new york to washington be not a few hour ' ride in a luxurious pullman but be fraught with many discomfort delay and even danger as a example of this i shall quote the first part of a letter write by morse from washington to he wife on April 11 1824 : -- i lose not a moment in inform you of my safe arrival with all my baggage in good order last evening i be much fatigued go to bed early and this morning feel perfectly refresh and much better for my journey after leave you on Wednesday morning i have but just time to reach the boat before she start in the land carriage we occupy three stage over a very rough road in cross a small creek in a ferry-boat the stage ahead of ours leave the boat a little too soon and come near upset in the water which would have put the passenger into a dangerous situation as it be the water come into the carriage and wet some of the baggage it be about a hour before they could get the stage out of the water next come we turn after travel a few mile the spring on one side give way and let we down almost upset we we get out without difficulty and in a few minute by put a rail under one side we proceed on again jocosely tell the passenger in the third stage that it be they turn next when we arrive at the boat in the delaware to we surprise the third stage come in with a rail under one side have meet with a similar accident a few mile after we leave they so we all have we turn but no injury to any of we he high hope of success in this enterprise be soon doom to be shatter and once again he be make to suffer a bitter disappointment on April 19 he write : i be at this moment put into a very embarrassing state of suspense by a political occurrence which have cause a great excitement here and will cause considerable interest no doubt throughout the country this morning a remonstrance be read in the house of representative from the honorable ninian edward against mr crawford which contain such charge and of so serious a nature as have lead to the appointment of a select committee with power to send for person and papers in order to a full investigation and i be tell by many member of congress that mr edward will undoubtedly be send for which will occasion of course a great delay in he journey to mexico if not cause a suspension of he go until the next season the mr crawford allude to be william harris crawford at that time a prominent candidate for the presidency in the come election with he customary faith in a overrule providence morse say later in the same letter : this delay and suspense try I more than distance or even absence from my dear family if i could be on my way and pursue my profession i should feel much better but all will be for the best though thing look dark i can and will trust he who will make my path of duty plain before I this satisfy my mind and do not allow a single desponding think the send of the legation be indefinitely postpone and morse much disappointed but resolve not to be overwhelm by this crush of he high hope return to new haven he spend the summer partly at home and partly in concord new hampshire -lrb- where he wife and child have go to visit she father -rrb- and in portsmouth portland and hartford have be summon to those city by patron who wish he to paint they portrait we can imagine that the young wife do not grieve over the failure of the mexican trip she letter to she husband at that period be fill with expression of the deepest affection but with a undertone of melancholy due no doubt to the increase delicacy of she health never very robust in the fall of 1824 morse resolve to make another assault on the purse of the solid man of new york and he establish himself at 96 broadway where for a time he have the satisfaction of have he wife and child with he they however return later to new haven and on December 5 1824 he write to he wife : -- i be fully employ and in excellent spirit i be engage in paint the full-length portrait of mr hone 's little daughter a pretty little girl just as old as susan i have make a sketch of the composition with which i be pleased and so be the father and mother i shall paint she with a cat set up in she lap like a baby with a towel under its chin and a cap on its head and she employ in feed it with a spoon i be as happy and contented as i can be without my dear lucrece and we dear child but i hope it will not be long before we shall be able to live together without these separation _ December 17 1824 _ i have everything very comfortable at my room my two pupil mr agate and mr field be very tractable and very useful i have everything

be sweep and all thing put in order i have as much as i can do in painting i do not mean by this that i have the overflow that i have in charleston nor do i wish it a hard shower be soon over i wish rather the gentle steady continuing rain i feel that i have a character to obtain and maintain and therefore my picture must be carefully study i shall not by this method paint so fast nor acquire property so fast but i shall do what be better secure a continuance of patronage and success i have no disposition to be a nine day ' wonder all the rage for a moment and then forget forever compel on this very account to wander from city to city to shine a moment in one and then pass on to another in a letter of a later date he say : -- i be go on prosperously through the kindness of providence in raise up many friend who be exert themselves in my favor my storm be partly over and a clear and pleasant day be dawn upon I chapter xiii January 4 1825 -- November 18 1825 success in new york --

day be apt to be follow by a storm meteorologist can probably give satisfactory scientific reason for this phenomenon but be that as it may how often do we find a parallel in human affair a period of prosperity and happiness in the life of a man or of a nation be almost invariably follow by calamity small or great but fortunately for individual and for nation the converse be also true the creep pendulum of fate pause for a instant at its highest point dip down again to gather impetus for a higher swing and so it be with morse fate be prepare for he a heavy blow one of the tragedy of he eventful life and in order to hearten he for the trial to give he strength to bear up under it she cheer he professional path with the sun of prosperity write to he wife from new york on January 4

portrait i paint of general lafayette for the city of new york that strange to say i find it difficult to recall even its general characteristic that portrait have a melancholy interest for I for it be just as i have commence the second sit of the general at washington that i receive the stunning intelligence of mr morse 's death and be compel abruptly to suspend the work i preserve as a gratifying memorial the letter of condolence and sympathy send in to I at the time by the general and in which he speak in flattering term of the promise of the portrait as a likeness i must be frank however in my judgment of my own work of that day this portrait be begin under the sad auspices to which i have allude and up to the close of the work i have a series of constant interruption of the same sad character a picture paint under such circumstance can scarcely be expect to do the artist justice and as a work of art i can not praise it still it be a good likeness be very satisfactory to the general and he several time allude to it in my presence in after year -lrb- when i be a frequent visitor to he in pari -rrb- in term of praise it be a full-length standing figure the size of life he be represent as standing at the top of a flight of step which he have just ascend upon a terrace the figure come against a glowing sunset sky indicative of the glory of he own evening of life upon

character of he own time in a vase on the other side be a flower-the helianthus -- with its face toward the sun in allusion to the characteristic stern uncompromising consistency of lafayette-a trait of character which i then consider and still consider the great prominent trait of that distinguished man morse like many man who have excel in one branch of the fine art often make excursion into one of the other i find among he papers many scrap of poetry and some more ambitious effort and while they do not perhaps entitle he to claim a poet 's crown some of they be worthy of be rescue from oblivion the follow sonnet be send to lafayette under the circumstance which morse himself thus describe : -- write on the loss of a faithful dog of lafayette 's on board the steamboat which sink in the mississippus the dog suppose he master still on board could not be persuade to leave the cabin but perish with the vessel lose from thy care to know thy master free can we thy self-devotion e'er forget 'twa kindred feeling in a less degree to that which thrill the soul of lafayette he freely brave we storm we danger meet nor leave the ship till we have ` scap the sea thine be a spark of noble feeling bright catch from the fire that warm thy master 's heart he be of heaven 's kindling and no small part of that pure fire be he we hail the light where'er it shine in heaven in man in brute we hail that sacred light howe'er minute whether its glimmer in thy bosom rest or blaze full orb would within thy master 's breast this be send to general lafayette on the 4th of July 1825 accompany by the follow note : -- in ask you acceptance of the enclosed poetic trifle i have not the vanity to suppose it can contribute much to you gratification but if it shall be consider as a endeavor to show to you some slight return of gratitude for the kind sympathy you evince towards I at a time of deep affliction i shall have attain my aim gladly would i offer to you any service but while a whole nation stand wait to answer the expression of you smallest wish my individual desire to serve you can only be consider as contend for a portion of that high honor which all feel in serve you conceal from the world he great sorrow and bravely strive always to maintain a cheerful countenance morse throw himself with energy into he work in new york endeavor to keep every minute occupy he seem to have have he little daughter with he for a while for in a letter of march 12 1825 occur this sentence : little susan have have the toothache once or twice and i have promise she a doll if she would have it out to-day -- i be this moment stop by she come in and show I the _ tooth out _ so i shall give she the doll but he soon find that it would be impossible for he to do justice to he work and at

professional study and i do not think its be so far ' _ up town _ ' will on the whole be any disadvantage to I may 26 1825 i have at length become comfortably settle and begin to feel at home in my new establishment all thing at present go smoothly brother charle walker and mr agate join with I in breakfast and tea and we find it best for convenience economy and time to dine from home -- it save the perplexity of provide marketing and the care of store and besides we think it will be more economical and the walk will be beneficial while success in he profession seem now assure and while order pour in so fast that he gladly assist some of he less fortunate brother artist by refer he would-be patron to they he also take a deep interest in the general artistic movement of the time he be by nature intensely enthusiastic and he strong personality ever impressed itself on individual and community with which he come in contact he be a bear leader of man and like so many other leader often so forgetful of self in he eager desire for the general good as to seriously interfere with he material prosperity this be what happen to he now for he give so liberally of himself in the formation of a new artistic body in new york and in the preparation of lecture that he encroach seriously on time which might have be more lucratively employ he brother sidney comment on this in a letter to the other brother richard : finley be well and in good spirit though not advance very rapidly in he business he be full of the academy and of he lecture -- can hardly talk on any other subject i despair of ever see he rich or even at ease in he pecuniary circumstance from effort of he own though able to do it with so little effort but he may be in a better way perhaps of get a fortune in he present course than he would be in the laborious path which we be too apt to think be the only road to wealth and ultimate ease we have see that morse be one of the founder of a academy of art in charleston south carolina and we have see that after he departure from that city this academy languish and die be it a unfair inference that if he have remain permanently in charleston so sad a fate would not have overtake the infant academy in support of this inference we shall now see that he be largely instrumental in bring into be a artistic association over which he preside for many year and which have continue to prosper until at the present day it be the lead artistic body in this country when morse settle in new york in 1825 there exist a american academy of art of which colonel trumbull the celebrated painter be the president while eminent as a painter trumbull seem to have lack executive ability and to have be rather haughty and overbearing in he manner for morse find great dissatisfaction exist among the professional artist and student at first it be think that by bring they grievance before the board of director of the academy condition might be change and on the 8th of November 1825 a meeting be call in the room of the historical society and the new york draw association be form and morse be choose to preside over its meeting it be not intend at first that this association should be a rival of the old academy but that it should give to its member facility which be difficult of attainment in the academy and should perhaps force that institution to become more liberal it be not successful in the latter effort for at a meeting of the draw association on the evening of the 14th of January 1825 morse the president propose certain resolution which he introduce by the follow remark : -- we have this evening assume a new attitude in the community we negotiation with the academy be at a end we union with it have be frustrate after every proper effort on we part to accomplish it the two who be elect as director from we ticket have signify they non-acceptance of the office we be therefore leave to organize ourselves on a plan that shall meet the wish of we all a plan of a institution which shall be truly liberal which shall be mutually beneficial which shall really encourage we respective art can not be devise in a moment it ought to be the work of great caution and deliberation and as simple as possible in its machinery time will be require for the purpose we must hear from distant country to obtain they experience and it must necessarily be perhaps many month before it can be mature in the mean time however a preparatory simple organization can be make and should be make as soon as possible to prevent dismemberment which may be attempt by outdoor influence on this subject let we all be on we guard let we point to we public document to any who ask what we have do and why we have do it while we go forward mind only we own concern leave the academy of fine art as much of we thought as they will permit we and bend we attention to we own affair act as if no such institution exist one of we danger at present be division and anarchy from a want of organization suit to the present exigency we be now compose of artist in the four art of design namely paint sculpture architecture and engrave some of we be professional artist other amateur other student to the profess and practical artist belong the management of all thing relate to school premium and lecture so that amateur and student may be most profit the amateur and student be those alone who can contend for the premium while the body of professional artist exclusively judge of they rights to premium and award they how shall we first make the separation have be a question which be a little perplexing there be none of we who can assume to be the body of artist without give offence to other and still every one must perceive that to organize a academy there must be the distinction between professional artist amateur who be student and professional student the first great division should be the body of professional artist from the amateur and student constitute the body who be to manage the entire concern of the institution who shall be its officer etc there be a method which strike I as obviate the difficulty place it on the broad principle of the formation of any society -- universal suffrage we be now a mixed body it be necessary for the benefit of all that a separation into class be make who shall make it why obviously the body itself let every member of this association take home with he a list of all the member of it let each one select for himself from the whole list _ fifteen _ whom he would call professional artist to be the ticket which he will give in at the next meeting these fifteen thus choose shall elect not less than _ ten _ nor more than _ fifteen _ professional artist in or out of the association who shall -lrb- with the previously elect fifteen -rrb- constitute the body to be call the national academy of the art of design to these shall be delegate the power to regulate its entire concern choose its member select its student etc thus will the germ be form to grow up into a institution which we trust will be put on such principle as to encourage -- not to depress -- the art when this be do we body will no longer be the drawing association but the national academy of the art of design still include all the present association but in different capacity one word as to the name ` national academy of the art of design ' any less name than ` national ' would be take one below the american academy and therefore be not desirable if we be simply the ` associate artist ' they name would swallow we up therefore ` national ' seem a proper one as to the art of design these be paint sculpture architecture and engrave while the fine art include poetry music landscape gardening and the histrionic art we name therefore express the entire character of we institution and that only from this we see that morse 's enthusiasm be temper with tact and common sense he proposal be receive with unanimous approval and on the 15th of January 1826 the follow fifteen be choose : -- sfb morse henry inman ab durand john frazee william wall charle c ingham william dunlap peter maverick ithiel town thoma s cumming edward potter charle c wright mosely j danforth hugh reinagle gerlando marsiglium these fifteen professional artist add by ballot to they number the follow fifteen : -- samuel waldo william jewett john w paradise frederick s agate rembrandt peale jame coyle nathaniel roger j parisen william main john ever martin e thompson thoma cole john vanderlyn -lrb- who decline -rrb- alexander anderson dw wilson thus be organize the national academy of design morse be elect its first president and be annually reëlected to that office until the year 1845 when the telegraph have now become a assure success he feel that he could not devote the necessary time and think to the interest of the academy and he insist on retire in the year 1861 he be prevail upon by thoma s cumming one of the original academician but now a general to become again the president and he serve in that office for a year the general in a letter to mr prime in 1873 say and i may add be beloved by all i shall not attempt to give a detailed account of the early struggle of the academy closely interwoven though they be with morse 's life those who may be interested in the matter will find they all detail in general cumming ' record of the national academy of design morse prepared and deliver a number of lecture on various subject pertain to the fine art and most of these have be preserve in pamphlet form in this connection i shall quote again from the letter of general cumming before allude to : -- mr morse 's connection with the academy be doubtless unfavorable in a pecuniary point of view he interest in it interfere with professional practice and the time take to enable he to prepare he course of lecture materially contribute to favor a distribution of he labor in art to other hand and it never fully return to he he ` discourse on academy of art ' deliver in the chapel of columbium college may 1827 will long stand as a monument of he ability in the line of art literature as a historical painter mr morse after allston be probably the best prepared and most fully educate artist of he day and should have receive the attention of the government and a share of the distribution in art commission that he effort be appreciate by he fellow artist and by the cultivate people of new york be thus modestly describe in a letter to he parent of November 18 1825 : -- i mention that reputation be flow in upon I the younger artist have form a drawing association at the academy and elect I they president we meet in the evening of three day in a week to draw and it have be conduct thus far with such success as to have treble the number of we association and excite the attention and applause of the community there be a spirit of harmony among the artist every one say which never before exist in new york and which augur well for the success of the art the artist be pleased to attribute it to my exertion and i find in they in consequence expression and feeling of respect which have be very gratifying to I whatever influence i have have however in produce this pleasant state of thing i think there be the preparation in the state of mind of the artist themselves i find a liberal feeling in the younger part of they and a refinement of manners which will redeem the character of art from the degradation to which a few dissipate interloper have temporarily reduce it a literary society admission to which must be by unanimous vote and into which many respectable literary character of the city have be deny admission have choose I a member together with mr hillhouse and mr bryant poet this indicate good feeling towards I to say the least and in the end will be of advantage i have no doubt chapter xiv January 1 1826 -- December 5 1829 success of he lecture the first of the kind in the united state -- difficulty of he position as leader -- still longing for a home -- very busy but in good health -- death of he father -- estimate of dr morse -- letter to he mother -- wish to go to europe again -- deliver address at first anniversary of national academy of design -- professor dana lecture on electricity -- morse 's study of the subject -- move to no 13 murray street -- too busy to visit he family -- death of he mother -- a remarkable woman -- go to central new york -- a serious accident -- moral reflection -- prepare to go to europe -- letter of john a dix -- sail for liverpool -- rough voyage -- liverpool January 1 1826 my dear parent -- i wish you all a happy new year kiss my little one as a new year 's present from I which must answer until i visit they when i shall bring they each a present if i hear good account from they the new year bring with it many painful reflection to I when i consider what a difference a year have accomplish in my situation that one on whom i depend so much for domestic happiness at this time last year give I the salutation of the season and now be go where year be unknown and when i think how mysteriously i be separate from my little family and that duty may keep I i know not how much longer in this solitary state i have much that make the present season far from be a happy new year to I but mysterious as thing seem in regard to the future i know that all will be order right and i have a great deal to say of mercy in the midst of judgment and a thousand unmerited blessing with all my trouble but why do i talk of trouble my cup be overflow with blessing as far as outward circumstance be concerned providence seem to be open a honorable and useful course to I oh that i may be able to bear prosperity if it be he will to bestow it or be deny it if not accompany with he blessing i be much engage in my lecture have complete two nearly and hope to get through the four in season for my turn at the athenæum these lecture be of great importance to I for if well do they place I alone among the artist i be the only one who have as yet write a course of lecture in we country time bestow on they be not therefore misspend for they will acquire I reputation which will yield wealth as mother i hope will live to see _ January 15 1826 _ on this day i seem to have the only moment in the week in which i can write you for i be almost overwhelm by the multitude of care that crowd upon I i find that the path of duty though plain be not without its roughness i can say but in one word that the association of artist of whom i be president after negotiation of some week with the academy of fine art to come into it on term of mutual benefit find they effort unavailing and have separate and form a new academy to be call probably the national academy of the art of design i be at its head but the care and responsibility which devolve on I in consequence be more than a balance for the honor the battle be yet to be fight for the need of public favor and be it not that the entire and perfect justness of we cause be clear to I in every point of view i should retire from a contest which would merely serve to rouse up all the ` old adam ' to no profit but the cause of the artist seem under providence to be in some degree confide to I and i can not shrink from the care and trouble at present put upon I i have go forward thus far ask direction from above and in look around I i feel that i be in the path of duty may i be keep in it and be preserve from the temptation the various and multiply and complicate temptation to which i know i shall be expose in every step thus far i feel a approve conscience there be none i could wish to retrace i fear you will think i have but few thought for you all at home and my dear little one in particular i do think of they though very often with many a longing to have a home for they under a parent 's roof and all my effort now be tend distantly to that end but when i shall ever have a home of my own or whether it will ever be i know not the necessity for a second connection on they account seem press but i can not find my heart ready for it i be occasionally rally on the subject but the suggestion only remind I of she i have lose and a tear be quite as ready to appear as a smile or if i can disguise it i feel a pang within that show I the wound be not yet heal it be eleven month since she have go but it seem but yesterday _ April 18 1826 _ i do not know but you will think i have forget how to write letter and i believe this be the first i have write for six week the pressure of my lecture become very great towards the close of they and i be compel to bend my whole attention to they completion i do not expect when i deliver my first that i should be able to give more than two but the importance of go through seem greater as i advanced and i be strengthen to accomplish the whole number and if i can judge from various indication i think i have be successful my audience consist of the most fashionable and literary society in the city regularly increase at each successive lecture and at the last it be say that i have the largest audience ever assemble in the room i be now engage on lafayette in expectation of complete it for we exhibition in may after which time i hope i shall be able to see you for a day or two in new haven i long to see you all and those dear child often make I feel anxious and i be often tempt to break away and have a short look at they but i be tie down here and can not move at present all that i be do have some reference to they interest they be constantly on my mind my health be never better with all my intense application sit in my chair from seven in the morning until twelve or one o'clock the next morning with only about a hour 's intermission i have feel no permanent inconvenience on Saturday night generally i have feel exceedingly nervous so that my whole body and limb would shake but rest on the sabbath seem to give I strength for the next week since my mind be relieve from my lecture i have feel new life and spirit and feel strong to accomplish anything _ may 10 18s6 _ i have just hear from mother and feel anxious about father nothing but the most imperious necessity prevent my coming immediately to new haven indeed as it be i will try and break away sometime next week if possible and pass one day with you but how to do it without detriment to my business i do not know i have long for some time for a little respite but like we good father all he son seem destine for most busy station in society and constant exertion not for themselves alone but for the public benefit whether this promise visit to new haven be pay or not be not record but it be to be hope that it be make possible for the good husband and father the faithful worker for the betterment of mankind be call to he well-earned rest on the 9th of June 1826 of he dr john todd say dr morse live before he time and be in advance of he generation president dwight of yale find he as full of resource as a egg be of meat and daniel webster speak of he as always think always write always talk always act mr prime thus sum up he character : he be a man of genius not content with what have be and be but originate and with vast executive ability combine the element to produce great result to he more than to any other one man may be attribute the impulse give in he day to religion and learning in the united state a polished gentleman in he manners the companion correspondent and friend of the most eminent man in church and state honor at the early age of thirty-four with the degree of doctor of divinity by the university of edinburgh scotland seek by scholar and statesman from abroad as one of the foremost man of he country and time the son must have feel keenly the loss of he father so soon after the death of he wife the whole family be a singularly unite one each member depend on the other for counsel and advice and the father who be but sixty-five when he die be still vigorous in mind although of delicate constitution later in this year morse manage to spend some time in new haven and he persuade he mother to seek rest and recuperation in travel accompany she as far as boston and write to she there on he return to new haven _ September 20 1826 _ i arrive safely home after leave you yesterday and find that neither the house nor the folk have run away persevere in you travels mother as long as you think it do you good and tell dick to brush up he best bow and bring home some lady to grace the now desolate mansion on November 9 1826 he write to he mother from new york : -- do not think i have forget you all at home because i have be so remiss in write you lately i feel guilty however in not steal some little time just to write you one line i acknowledge my fault so please forgive I and i will be a _ better boy _ in future the fact be i have be engage for the last three day during all my leisure moment in something unusual with I -- i mean _ electioneer _ ` oh what a sad boy ' mother will say ` there he be leave everything at six and seven and drive through the street and busy himself about those _ poison politics _ ' not quite so fast however i have not neglect my own affair as you will learn one of these day i have a historical picture to paint which will occupy I for some time for a proprietor of a steamboat which be build in philadelphium to be the most splendid ever build he have engage historical picture of allston vanderlyn sully and myself and landscape of the principal landscape painter for a gallery on board the boat i consider this as a new and noble channel for the encouragement of painting and in such a enterprise and in such company i shall do my best what do you think of spare I for about one year to visit pari and rome to finish what i begin when in europe before my education as a painter be incomplete without it and the time be rapidly go away when my age will render it impossible to profit by such study even if i should be able at a future time to visit europe again i can perhaps leave my dear little one at they age better than if they be more advanced and as my view be ultimately to benefit they i think no one will accuse I of neglect they if they do they know but little of my feeling towards they the mother 's answer to this letter have not be preserve but whether she dissuade he from go at that time or whether other reason prevent he the fact be that he do not start on the voyage to europe -lrb- the return trip prove so momentous to himself and to the world -rrb- until exactly three year later i shall pass rapidly over these intervene three year they be year of hard work but of work reward by material success and increase honor in the community on may 8 1827 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the national academy of design morse its president deliver a address before a brilliant audience in the chapel of columbium college this address be consider so remarkable that at the request of the academy it be publish in pamphlet form it call forth a sharp review in the north american which voice the opinion of those who be hostile to the new academy and who consider the term national little short of arrogant morse reply to this attack in a masterly manner in the journal of commerce and this also be publish in pamphlet form and end the controversy in the year 1827 professor jame freeman dana of columbium college deliver a series of lecture on the subject of electricity at the new york athenæum professor dana be a enthusiast in the study of that science which at that time be but in its infancy and he foresee great and beneficial result to mankind from this mysterious force when it should become more fully understand morse already familiar with the subject from he experiment with professor silliman in new haven take a deep interest in these lecture and he and professor dana become warm friend the latter on he side a great admirer of the fine art spend many hour in the studio of the artist discuss with he the two subject which be of absorb interest to they both art and electricity in this way morse become perfectly familiar with the latest discovery in electrical science so that when a few year later he grand conception of a simple and practicable means of harness this mystic agent to the use of mankind take form in he brain it find a field already prepare to receive it i wish to lay particular emphasis on this point because in later year when he claim as a inventor be bitterly assail in the court and in scientific circle it be assert that he know nothing whatever of the science of electricity at the time of he invention and that all its essential feature be suggest to he by other in the year 1828 morse again change he quarter move to a suite of room at no 13 murray street close to broadway for which he pay a great rent $ 500 and on may 6 of that year he write to he mother : ever since i leave you at new haven i have be over head and ear in arrangement of every kind it be the busiest time of the whole year as it regard the national academy we have get through the arrangement of we exhibition and yesterday open it to the guest of the academy we have the first people in the city lady and gentleman throng the room all day and the voice of all seem to be -- ` it be the best exhibition of the kind that have be see in the city ' i be now arrange my room they be very fine one i shall be through in a few day and then i hope to be able to come up and see you for i feel very anxious about you my dear mother i do most sincerely sympathize with you in you trouble and long to come up and take some of the care and burden from you and will do it as soon as my affair here can be arrange so that i can leave they without serious detriment to they what a siege you must have have with you _ help _ as it be most strangely call in new haven i be too aristocratic for such doings as _ help _ would make those who live in new haven endure ardently as i be attach to new haven the plague of _ help _ will probably always prevent my live there again for i would not put up with ` the world turn upside down ' and therefore should give offense to they _ helpiness _ and so lead a very uncomfortable life from this we suspicion be strengthen that the servant question belong to no time or country but be and always have be a perennial and ubiquitous problem _ may 11 1888 _ i feel very anxious about you dear mother i hear through mr van rensselaer that you be better and i hope that you will yet see many good day on earth and be happy in the affection of you child and friend here before you go a little before they to join those in heaven while express anxiety about he mother 's health he could not have consider she condition critical for on the 18th of may he write again : -- i do hope so to make my arrangement as to have be with you in new haven yesterday and to-day but i be so situate as to be unable to leave the city without great detriment to my business unless therefore there be something of press necessity prudence would dictate to I to take advantage of this season which have generally be the most profitable to other in the profession and see if i can not get my share of something to do it be a great struggle with I to know what i ought to do you situation and that of the family draw I to new haven the state of my finances keep I here i will come however if on the whole you think it best again be the record silent as to whether the visit be pay or not but he anxiety be well found for he mother 's appoint time have come and just ten day later on the 28th of may 1828 she die at the age of sixty-two thus within the space of three year the hand of death have remove the three being whom morse loved best he mother while as we have see stern and uncompromising in she puritan principle yet possess the faculty of win the love as well as the respect of she family and friend dr todd say of she home : a orphan myself and never have a home i have go away from dr morse 's house in tear feel that such a home must be more like heaven than anything of which i could conceive mr prime in he biography of morse thus pay tribute to she : -- two person more unlike in temperament it be say could not have be unite in love and marriage than the parent of morse the husband be sanguine impulsive resolute regardless of difficulty and danger she be calm judicious cautious and reflect and she too have a will of she own one day she be express to one of the parish she intense displeasure with the treatment she husband have receive when dr morse gently lay he hand upon she shoulder and say ` my dear you know we must throw the mantle of charity over the imperfection of other ' and she reply with become spirit ` mr morse charity be not a fool ' in the summer of 1828 morse spend some time in central new york visit relative and painting portrait when the occasion offer he thus describe a narrow escape from serious injury or even death in a letter to he brother sidney date utica August 17 1828 : -- in come from whitesboro on Friday i meet with a accident and a most narrow escape with my life the horse which have be tackle into the wagon be a vicious horse and have several time run away to the danger of mr dexter 's life and other of the family i be not aware of this or i should not have consent to go with he much less to drive he myself i be alone in the wagon with my baggage and the horse go very well for about a mile when he gradually quicken he pace and then set out in spite of all check on the full run i keep he in the road determine to let he run himself tire as the only safe alternative but just as i come in sight of a piece of the road which have be conceal by a angle there be a heavy wagon which i must meet so soon that in order to avoid it i must give it the whole road this be very narrow and the ditch and bank on each side very rough i instantly make up my mind to a serious accident as well as the velocity of the horse would allow I however i keep he on the side rough as it be for about a quarter of a mile pretty steadily expect however to upset every minute when all at once i see before I a abrupt narrow deep gully into which the wheel on one side be just upon the point of go down it flash across I in a instant that if i could throw the horse down into the ditch the wheel of the wagon might perhaps rest equipoise on each side and perhaps break the horse loose from the wagon i pull the rein and accomplish the object in part the sudden plunge of the horse into the gully break he loose from the wagon but it at the same time turn one of the fore wheel into the gully which upset the wagon and throw I forwards at the moment when the horse throw up he heel just take off my hat and leave I in the bottom of the gully i fall on my left shoulder and although muddy from head to foot i escape without any injury whatever i be not even jar painfully i find my shoulder a little bruised my wrist very slightly scratch and yesterday be a little and but very little stiffen in my limb and to-day have not the slightest feeling of bruise about I but think i feel better than i have for a long time indeed my health be entirely restore the ride and country air have be the means of restore I i have great cause of thankfulness for so much mercy and for such special preserving care -lrb- illustration : elizabeth a morse paint by morse -rrb- the historian or the biographer who be earnestly desirous of present a absolutely truthful picture of man and of event be aid in he task by take into account the character of the man who have make history he must ask the question : be it conceivable that this man could have act thus and so under such and such circumstance when he character as ultimately reveal through the perspective of time have be establish could washington and lincoln for example have be actuate by the motive attribute to they by they enemy like all man who have become shine mark in the annals of history morse could not hope to escape calumny and in later year he be accuse of action and motive be imputed to he which it become the duty of he biographer to disprove on the broad ground of moral impossibility among he letter and papers be many rough draft of thought and observation on many subject interlined and annotated some be afterwards elaborate into letter article or lecture other seem to have be the thought of the moment which he yet deem worth write down and which perhaps better than anything else reveal the true character of the man the following be write by he in pencil on Sunday September 6 1829 at cooperstown new york : -- that temptation surround we at every moment be too evident to require proof if they cease from without they still act upon we from within ourselves and we most secret thought may as surely be draw from the path of duty by secret temptation by the admission of evil suggestion and they will affect we character as injuriously as those more palpable and tangible temptation that attack we sense this life be a state of discipline a school in which to form character there be not a event that come to we knowledge not a sentence that we read not a person with whom we converse not a act of we life in short not a thought which we conceive but be act upon and moulding that character into a shape of good or evil and however unconscious we may be of the fact a think casually conceive in the solitariness and silence and darkness of midnight may so modify and change the current of we future conduct that a blessing or a curse to million may flow from it all we thought be mysteriously connect with good or evil they very habit too like the habit of we action be strengthen by indulgence and accord as we indulge the evil or the good we character will partake of the moral character of each but action proceed from thought we act as we think why should we then so cautiously guard we action from impropriety while we give a loose rein to we thought which so certainly sooner or later produce they fruit in we action god in he wisdom have separate at various distance sin and the consequence of sin in some instance we see a sin instantly follow by its fruit as of revenge by murder in other we see week and month and year aye and age too elapse before the fruit of a single act the result perhaps of a single thought be see in all they variety of evil how long ere the fruit of one sin in paradise will cease to be visible in the moral universe if this reasoning be correct i shall but cheat myself in preserve a good moral outward appearance to other if every thought of the heart in the most secret retirement be not carefully watch and check and guard from evil since the casual indulgence of a single evil thought in secret may be follow long after that thought be forget by I and when perhaps least expect by overt act of evil who then shall say that in those pleasure in which we indulge and which by many be call and apparently be innocent there be not lay the seed of many a corrupt affection who shall say that my innocent indulgence at the card table or at the theater be i incline to visit they may not produce if not in I a passion for gaming or for low indulgence yet in other may encourage these view to they ruin besides ` evil communication corrupt good manners ' and even place less objectionable be studiously to be avoid the soul be too precious to be thus expose where then be we remedy in christ alone ` cleanse thou I from secret fault search I o god and know my thought try I and know my way and see if there be any wicked way in I and lead I in the way which be everlasting ' this be but one of many expression of a similar character which be to be find in the letter and note and which be illuminating morse be now make ready for another trip to europe he have hope when he return home in 1815 to stay but a year or two on this side and then to go back and continue he artistic education which he by no means consider complete in france and italy we have see how one circumstance after another interfere to prevent the realization of this plan until now after the lapse of fourteen year he find it possible he wife and he parent be dead he child be be carefully care for by relative the daughter susan by she mother 's sister mr picker in concord new hampshire and the boy by they uncle richard c morse who be then happily marry and live in the family home in new haven the national academy of design be now establish on a firm footing and could spare he guide hand for a few year he have save enough money to defray he expense on a strictly economical basis but to make assurance doubly sure he seek and receive commission from he friend and patron in america for copy of famous painting or for original work of he own so that he could sail with a clear conscience as regard he finances he friend be uniformly encouraging in further he plan and he receive many letter of cordial good wish and of introduction to prominent man abroad i shall include the follow from john a dix at that time a captain in the army but afterwards a general and governor of new york who although he have be a unsuccessful suitor for the hand of miss walker morse 's wife bear no ill-will towards he rival but remain he firm friend to the end : -- cooperstown 27th October 1829 my dear sir -- i have only time to say that i have be absent in a adjacent county and fear there be not time to procure a letter for you to mr rive before the 1st i have write to mr van buren and he will doubtless send you a letter before the 8th therefore make arrangement to have it send after you if you sail on the 1st i need not say i shall be very happy to hear from you during you sojournment abroad especially tell I what you impression be when you turn from david 's picture with romulus and tatius in the foreground and paul veronese 's marriage at cana directly opposite at the entrance of the picture gallery in the louvre we be all well and all desire to be remembered i have only time to add my best wish for you happiness and prosperity yours truly and constantly john a dix the mr rive mention in the letter be at that time we minister to france and the mr van buren be martin van buren then secretary of state in president jackson 's cabinet and afterwards himself president of the united state the following be from the pencil draft of a letter or the beginning of a diary which be not finish but end abruptly : -- on the 8th November 1829 i embark from new york in the ship napoleon captain smith for liverpool the napoleon be one of those splendid packet which have be provide by the enterprise of we merchant for the accommodation of person whose business or pleasure require a visit to europe or america precisely at the appoint hour ten o'clock the steamboat with the passenger and they baggage leave the whitehall dock for we gallant ship which be lie to above the city head up the north river careen to the brisk northwest gale and wait with apparent impatience for we like a spirited horse curvett under the rein of he master and wait but he signal to bind away a few moment bring we to she side and a few more see the steamboat leave we and the sad farewell to relative and friend who have thus far accompany we be mutually exchange by the wave of hand and of handkerchief the ` ready

newfoundland one third of we passage many of we passenger be sanguine in they anticipation of we make the shortest passage ever know and have we subsequent progress be as great as at first we should doubtless have accomplish the voyage in thirteen day but calm and head wind for three day on the bank have frustrate we expectation there be little that be interesting in the incident of a voyage the indescribable listlessness of seasickness the varied state of feeling which change with the wind and weather have often be describe these i experience in all they force from the time we leave the bank of newfoundland we have a continue succession of head wind and when within one fair day 's sail of land we be keep off by severe gale directly ahead for five successive day and night during which time the uneasy motion of the ship deprive we all of sleep except in broken interval of a half-hour at a time we neither saw nor speak any vessel until the evening of the -- when we descry through the darkness a large vessel on a opposite course from ourselves we first see she cabin light it be blow a gale of wind before which we be go on we own course at the rate of eleven mile a hour it be of course impossible to speak she but to let she know that she have company on the wide ocean we throw up a rocket which for splendor of effect surpass any that i have ever see on shore it be throw from behind the mizzenmast over which it shoot arch its way over the main and foremast illuminate every sail and rope and then diving into the water pierce the wave it again shoot upward and vanish in a loud report to we companion ship the effect must have be very fine the sea be often complain of for its monotony and yet there be great variety in the appearance of the sea here it end but we learn a little more of the voyage and the landing in england from a letter to a cousin in america write in liverpool on December 5 1829 : -- i arrive safely in england yesterday after a long but on the whole

he to do this or that service and the chambermaid look so venerable and matronly that to ask they for a pitcher of water seem almost rude to they but i be in a land where domestic servant be the best in the world no servant aspire to a higher station but feel a pride in make himself the first in that station i notice this for we own country present a melancholy contrast in this particular here follow a description of the voyage and he continue : -- yesterday we anchor off the float light sixteen mile from the city unable to reach the dock on account of the wind but the post-office steamboat

they feature black hair and sparkling black eye with a nut-brown complexion and cheek of russet red and not without a shrewd intelligence in they expression at about nine o'clock we arrive at the guildhall tavern in the celebrated and ancient city of canterbury early in the morning as soon as we have breakfast we visit the superb cathedral this stupendous pile be one of the most distinguished gothic structure in the world it be not only interesting from its impose style of architecture but from its numerous historical association the first glimpse we catch of it be through and over a rich decayed gateway to the enclosure of the cathedral grounds after pass the gate the vast pile -- with its three great tower and innumerable turret and pinnacle and buttress and arch and paint window -- rise in majesty before we the grand center tower cover with a gray moss seem like a immense mass of the palisade strike out with all its regular irregularity and place above the surround mass of the same gray rock the bell of the great tower be toll for morning service and yet so distant from its height that it be scarcely hear upon the pavement below we enter the door of one of the tower and come immediately into the nave of the church the effect of the long aisle and tower cluster pillar and richly carve screen of a gothic church upon the imagination can scarcely be describe -- the emotion be that of awe a short procession be quickly pass up the step of the choir consist of the beadle or some such officer with he wand of office follow by ten boy in white surplice behind these be the prebendary and other officer of the church one thin and pale another portly and round with powdered hair and sleepy dull heavy expression of face much like the face that hogarth have choose for the ` preacher to he sleepy congregation ' this personage we afterward hear be lord nelson the brother of the celebrated nelson and the heir to he title the service be read in a hurry and commonplace manner to about thirty individual most of whom seem to be the necessary assistant at the ceremony the effect of the voice in the response and the chanting of the boy reverberate through the aisle and arch and recess of the church be peculiarly impose but when the great organ strike in the emotion of grandeur be carry to its height -- i say nothing of devotion i do not pretend on this occasion to join in it i own that my thought as well as my eye be roam to other object and gather around I the thousand recollection of scenic splendor of terror of bigotry and superstition which be act in sight of the very wall by which i be surround here the murder of thomas à becket be perpetrate there be he miracle-working shrine visit by pilgrim from all part of christendom and enriched with the most costly jewel that the wealth of prince could purchase and lavish upon it the very step wear into deep cavity by the knee of the devotee as they approach the shrine be ascend by we there stand the tomb

surcoat and casque the glove of mail and shield with which he be accoutr when he fight the famous battle of crécy there also stand the marble chair in which the saxon king be crown and in which with the natural desire that all seem to have in such case i could not avoid seat myself from this chair place at one end of the nave be see to best advantage the length of the church five hundred foot in extent after the service i visit more at leisure the tomb and other curiosity of the church the precise spot on which archbishop becket be murder be show but the spot on which he head fall on the pavement be cut out as a relic and send to rome and the place fill in with a fresh piece of stone about five inch square in the afternoon we leave canterbury and proceed to dover intend to embark the next morning -lrb- Thursday December 24 -rrb- for calai or boulogne in the steamer the weather however be very unpromising in the morning be thick and foggy and apparently prepare for a storm we

moment Monday the 28th the storm be more violent than ever the street be clog with snow and we be thus embargo completely for we know not how long a time to come notwithstanding the severity of the weather on Thursday we all venture out through the wind and snow to visit dover castle situate upon the bleak cliff to the north of the town the castle with its various tower and wall and outwork have be the constant care of the government for age here be the remains of every age from the time of the roman to the present about the center of the enclosure stand two ancient ruin the one a tower build by the roman thirty-six year after christ and the other a rude church build by the saxon in the sixth century other remains of tower and wall indicate the various kind of defensive and offensive war in different age from the time when the round or square tower with its loophole for the archer and crossbowman and gate secure by heavy portcullis be a substantial defense down to the present time when the bastion of regular side advance from the glaci mount with modern ordnance keep at a greater distance the hostile besieger through the glaci in various part be sally-port from one of which opening towards the road to ramsgate i well remember see a corporal 's guard issue about fifteen year ago to take possession of I and my sketch-book as i sit under a hedge at some distance to sketch the picturesque tower of this castle somewhat suspicious of they intention i leave my retreat and by a circuitous route into the town make my escape not however without ascertain from behind a distant hedge that i be actually the object of they expedition they go to the spot where i have be sit make a short search and then return to the castle through the same sally-port at that time -lrb- a time of war not only with france but america also -rrb- the strictest watch be keep and to have be catch make the slightest sketch of a fortification would have subject I to much trouble time be now change and have jack frost -lrb- the only commander of rigor now at the castle -rrb- permit i might have sketch any part of the interior or exterior _ boulogne-sur-mer france December 29 1829 _ this morning at ten o'clock after we tedious detention we embark from dover in a steamer for this place instead of calais i mention the steamer but cousin if you have form any idea of elegance or comfort or speed in connection with the name of steamer from see we fine steamboat and have imagine that english or french boat be superior to ours you may as well be undeceived i know of no description of packet-boat in we water bad enough to convey the idea they be small black dirty confine thing which would be suffer to rot at the wharf for want of the least custom from the lowest in we country you may judge of the extent of the accommodation when i tell you that there be in they but one cabin six foot six inch high fourteen foot long eleven foot wide contain eight berth we passage be fortunately short and we arrive in the dominion of ` he most christian majesty ' charle x at five o'clock the transition from a country where one 's own language be speak to one where the accent be strange from a country where the manners and habit be somewhat ally to we own to one where everything be different even to the most trifling article of dress be very striking on landing after so short a interval from england to france the pier-head at we landing be fill with human being in strange costume from the gray _ surtout _ and belt of the _ gendarme _ to the broad twilled and curiously plaited cap of the masculine woman which latter being by the way be the licensed porter of baggage to the custom-house _ pari January 7 1830 _ here have i be in this great capital of the continent since the first day of the year i shall remember my first visit to pari from the circumstance that at the dawn of the day of the new year we pass the porte saint-deni into the narrow and dirty street of the great metropolis the louvre be the first object we visit we passport obtain we ready admittance and although we finger and foot be almost freeze we yet linger three hour in the grand gallery of picture indeed it be a long walk simply to pass up and down the long hall the end of which from the opposite end be scarcely visible but be lose in the mist of distance on the wall be twelve hundred and fifty of some of the _ chef d'oeuvre _ of painting here i have mark out several which i shall copy on my return from italy i have my residence at present at the hôtel de lille which be situate very conveniently in the midst of all the most interesting object of curiosity to a stranger in paris -- the palace of the tuilery the palais royal the bibliothèque royale or royal library and numerous other place all within a few pace of we on new year 's day the equipage of the nobility and foreign ambassador etc who pay they respects to the king and the duke of orléans make considerable display in the place du carrousel and in the court of the tuilery at a exhibition of manufacture of porcelain tapestry etc in the louvre where be some of the most superb specimen of art in the world in these article we also see the duchesse de berri she be the mother of the little duc de bordeaux who you know be the heir apparent to the crown of france she be simply habit in a blue pelisse and blue bonnet and would not be distinguish in she appearance from the crowd except by she attendant in livery i can not close however without tell you what a delightful evening i pass evening before last at general lafayette 's he have a soirée on that night at which there be a number of american when i go in he instantly recognize I take I by both hand say he be expect to see I in france have read in the american papers that i have embark he meet I apparently with great cordiality then introduce I to each of he family to he daughter to madame lasterie and she two daughter -lrb- very pretty girl -rrb- and to madame rémusat -lrb- 1 -rrb- and two daughter of he son gw lafayette also very accomplished and beautiful girl the general inquire how long i intend to stay in france and press I to come and pass some time at la grange when i return from italy general lafayette look very well and seem to have the respect of all the best man in france at he soirée i see the celebrated benjamin constant one of the most distinguish of the liberal party in france he be tall and thin with a very fair white complexion and long white silken hair move with all the vigor of a young man -lrb- footnote 1 : this be not of course the famous madame de rémusat probably she daughter-in-law -rrb- in a letter to he brother write on the same day January 7th he say : -- if i go no farther and should now return what i have already see and study would be worth to I all the trouble and expense thus far incur i be more and more satisfied that my expedition be wisely plan you can not conceive how the cold be feel in pari and indeed in all france not that they climate be so intensely cold as ours but they provision against the cold be so bad fuel be excessively high they fireplace construct on the worst possible plan look like great oven dig four or five foot into the wall waste a vast deal of heat and then the door and window be far from tight so that altogether pari in winter be not the most comfortable place in the world mr town and i and probably mr jocelyn set out for italy on Monday by the way of chalons-sur-saone lyon avignon and nice i long to get to rome and naple that i may commence to paint in a warm climate and so keep warm weather with I to france again i do not know what to do about write letter for the ` journal of commerce ' i fear it will consume more of my time than the thing be worth and will be such a hindrance to my professional study that i must on the whole give up the thought of it my time here be worth a guinea a minute in the way of my profession i could undoubtedly write some interesting letter for they but i do not feel the same ease in write for the public that i do in write to a friend and in correct my language for the press i feel that it be go to consume more of my time than i can spare i will write if i can but they must not expect it for i find my pen and pencil be enemy to each other i must write less and paint more my advantage for study never appear so great and i never feel so ardent a desire to improve they morse spend about two week in paris visit church picture gallery palace and other show place he find the giraffe or camelopard the most interesting animal at the jardin des plante and he dislike a ceiling paint by gro : it be allegorical which be a class of painting i detest he deplore the continental Sunday : oh that we appreciate in america the value of we sabbath a sabbath of rest from labor a sabbath of moral and religious instruction a sabbath the greatest barrier to those flood of immorality which have in time past deluged this devoted country in blood and will again do it unless the sabbath gain its ascendancy once more from a undated and unfinished draft of a letter to he cousin mr roby we learn something of he journey from pari to rome or rather of the first part of it : -- i write you from paris give you a account of my travels to that city and i now improve the first moment of leisure since to continue my journal after get we passport sign by at least half a dozen ambassador preparatory to we long journey we leave paris on Wednesday January 13 at eight o'clock for dijon in the diligence the weather be very cold and we travel through a very uninteresting country it seem like a frozen ocean the road be over a immense plain unbroken by tree or fence we stop a few moment at melun at joigny and tonnerre which latter place be quite pretty with a fine-looking gothic church we find the village from pari thus far much neater and in better style than those on the road from boulogne we company consist of mr town of new york mr jocelyn of new haven a very pretty frenchwoman and myself the frenchwoman be quite a character she could not talk english nor could we talk french and yet we be talk all the time and be able to understand and be understand at four o'clock the next morning we _ dine _ at montbar which place we enter after much detention by the snow it be so deep that we be repeatedly stop for some time at a picturesque little village call val de luzon where we change horse the country begin to assume a different character it now become mountainous and have the season be propitious many beautiful scene for the pencil would have present themselves as it be the form of the mountain and the deep valley with village snugly situate at the bottom be grateful to the eye amidst the white shroud which everywhere cover the landscape we could but now and then catch a glimpse of the scenery through we coach window by thaw a place in the thickly covered glass which be so plate with the arborescent frost as not to yield to the warmth of the sun at midday we arrive at dijon at nine o'clock on Saturday evening after three day and two night of fatiguing ride the diligence be on the whole a comfortable carriage for travel i can scarcely give you any idea of its construction it be so unlike in many respects to we stage-coach it be three carriage-body together upon one set of wheel the forward part be call the _ coupé _ which hold but three person and from have window in front so that the country be see as you travel be the most expensive the middle carriage be the largest capable of hold six person and be call the _ intérieur _ the other call the _ derrière _ be the cheapest but be generally fill with low people the _ intérieur _ be so large and so well cushion that it be easy to sleep in it ordinarily and have it not be for the sudden stop occasion by the clog of the wheel in the snow we should have have very good rest but the discordant music make by the wheel as they grind the frozen snow sound like innumerable instrument mostly discordant but now and then concordant prevent we sound sleep the cold we find as severe as any i have usually experience in america the snow be as deep upon the hill be pile up on each side of the road five or six foot high the water in we pitcher freeze by the fireside and the glass on the window even in room comfortably warm be encrust with arborescent frost the floor too of all the room be pave with brick or tile and although comfortable in summer be far from desirable in such a winter at dijon we stop over the sabbath for the double purpose of avoid travel on that day and from really need a day of rest on Sunday morning we enquire of we landlord mon ripart of the hôtel du parc for a protestant church and be inform that there be not any in the place we learn however afterwards that there be one but too late to profit by the information we walk out in the cold to find some church and enter a large irregular gothic structure much out of repair we press towards the altar where the funeral service of the catholic church be perform over a corpse which lay before it the priest seven or eight in number be in the midst of they ceremony they have they hair shear close in front but leave long behind and at the side and powdered and while walk covered partially with a small black pyramidal velvet cap with a tuft at the top while sing the service they hold long light wax taper in they hand there be much ceremony but scarcely anything that be impose its heartlessness be so apparent especially in the conduct of some of the assistant that it seem a solemn mockery one in particular who seem to pride himself on the manner in which he vociferate ` aman ' be cast he eye among the crowd wink and laugh at various person and from the extravagance of he manners bawl out most irreverently and close by laugh i wonder that he be not perceive and rebuke by the priest as the procession leave the church it be head by a officer bear a pontoon -lrb- 1 -rrb- then one bear the silver crucifix then eight or ten boy with light wax taper by the side of the corpse then follow the priest six or eight in number and then the relative and friend of the decease at the grave the priest and assistant chant a moment the coffin be lower the earth throw upon it and then a elder priest mutter something over the grave and with a instrument consist of a silver ball with a small handle make the sign of the cross over the body which ceremony be repeat by each one in the procession to whom in succession the instrument be hand -lrb- footnote 1 : this must be a mistake -rrb- there be indeed two or three real mourner one young man in particular to whom the female might have be relate as wife or sister show all the sign of heartfelt grief it do not break out into extravagant gesture or loud cry but the tear as they flow down he manly face seem to be force out by the agony within which he in vain endeavor to suppress the struggle to restrain they be manifest and as he make the sign of the cross at the grave in he turn the feebleness with which he perform the ceremony show that the anguish of he heart have almost overcome he physical strength i long to speak to he and to sympathize with he but my ignorance of the language of he country lock I out from any such purpose accustom to the proper and orderly manner of keep the sabbath so universal in we country there be many thing that will strike a american not only as singular but disgust while in pari we find it to be customary not only on week day but also on the sabbath to have musician introduce towards the close of dinner who play and sing all kind of song we suppose that this custom be a peculiarity of the capital but this day after dinner a hand-organ play waltz and song and as if this be not enough a performer on the guitar succeed play song while two or three person with long card fill with specimen of natural history -- lobster crab and shell of various kind -- be busy in display they handiwork to we and each conclude he part of the ceremony by present a little cup for a contribution the letter end here and as i have find but few more of that year we must depend on he hurriedly write notebook for a further record of he wanderings leave dijon on January 18 morse and he companion continue they journey through châlons-sur-saone to macon and lyon which they reach late at night the next two day be spend in view the sight of lyon which be describe at length in he journal most of these note i shall omit description of place and of scenery be generally tiresome except to the author of they and i shall transcribe only such portion as have a more than ordinary personal or historic interest for instance the follow entry be characteristic of morse 's simple religious faith : -- from the musee we go to the hôtel dieu a hospital on a magnificent and liberal scale the apartment for the sick be commodiously and neatly arrange in one of they be two hundred and twelve cot all of which show a pale or fevered face upon the pillow the attendant be woman call ` sister of charity ' who have a peculiar costume these be benevolent woman who -lrb- some of they of rank and wealth -rrb- devote themselves to minister to the comfort and necessity of the wretched benevolence be a trait peculiarly feminine it be see among woman in all country and all religion and although true religion set out this jewel in the greatest beauty yet superstition and false religion can not entirely destroy its lustre it seem to be one of those virtue permit in a special manner by the father of all good to survive the ruin of sin on earth and to withstand the attack of satan in he attempt on the happiness of man and to woman in a marked manner he have confide the keep of this virtue she be first in the transgression but last at the cross leave lyon at four o'clock on the morning of the 22d they journey slowly towards avignon delay by the condition of the road cover by a unusual fall of snow which be now melting under the breath of a warm breeze from the south on the way they pass between the two hill a telegraph making

every avenue music and painting press into the service of -- not religion but the contrary -- lead the mind away from the contemplation of all that be practical in religion to the charm of mere sense no instruction be impart none seem ever to be intend what but ignorance can be expect when such a system prevail last evening we be delighted with some exquisite sacred music sing apparently by man 's voice only and slowly pass under we window the whole effect be enchant the various part be so harmoniously adapt and the taste with which these unknown minstrel strengthen and soften they tone give we

half franc all parley with the extortionate landlord have only the effect of make he more positive and even insolent and when we at last throw he the money to avoid further detention he tell we to mark he house and with the face of a demon tell we we should never enter he house again we can easily bear we punishment as we resume we journey we be salute with a shower of stone the journal

after breakfast of coffee etc we set out at six on we journey towards rome i shall not follow they every step of the way but shall select only the more personal entry in the diary a little after eleven o'clock we stop at a single house upon a high hill overlook the sea to breakfast it have the impose title of ` locanda della gran bretagna ' we expect little and get less and have a specimen of the bad faith of these people we enquire the price of we _ déjeuner _ before we order it which be always necessary we be tell one franc each but after we breakfast we be tell one and a half each and no talk with the landlord would alter he determination to demand he price there be no remedy for traveller they must pay or be delay at one o'clock we leave this hole of a place where we be more beset with beggar and sponger than at any place since we have be in italy stop overnight at sestrus they set out again on the 11th at five o'clock in the morning : -- it be as dark as the moon obscure by thick cloud would allow it to be and as we leave the courtyard of the inn it begin to rain violently we road lay over precipitous mountain away from the shore and the scenery become wild and grand as the day dawn we find ourselves in the midst of stupendous mountain rise in cone from the valley below deep basin be form at the bottom by the meeting of the long slope cloud be see far below we some waste away as they sail over the steep and some gathering denseness as they be detain by the cold snowy peak which shoot up beyond now and then a wind stream glitter at the bottom of some deep ravine amidst the darkness around it and occasionally a light from the cottage of some peasant glimmer like a star through the cloud as we labor up the steep ascent little brawl cascade without number from the height far above we in milky stream gather power from innumerable rill dash at we foot and pass down through the artificial passage beneath the road sweep down into the valley in torrent and swell the river whose broad bed be see through the opening rush with irresistible power to the sea we find from the violence of the storm that the road be heavy and much injure in some part by the wash down of rock from the height some of great size lay at the side recently throw down and now and then one of some hundred pound ' weight be find in the middle of the road we continue to ascend about four hour until we come again from a region of summer into the region of snow and the height from the sea be greater than we have at any time previously attain the scenery around we too be wilder and more sterile the apennine here be very grand assume every variety of shape and color long slope of clay color be interlock with dark brown sprinkle with golden yellow slate blue and gray mixed with green and purple and the pure deep ultramarine blue of distant peak finish the background after breakfast at borghetto at a miserable inn where they be much annoy by beggar of all description they continue they journey through much the same character of country for the rest of the day and towards dark they meet with a slight adventure : -- we road be down a steep declivity wind much in the same way as at finale precipice be at the side without a protect barrier and we feel some uneasiness at we situation which be not decrease by suddenly find we coach stop and a man on horseback -lrb- or rather muleback -rrb- stop by the side of the coach it be but for a moment we _ vetturino _ authoritatively order he to pass on which he do with a _ ` buona serum _ ' and we never part with a companion more gladly from all the circumstance attend it we be incline to believe that he have some design upon we but find we so numerous think it best not to run the risk spezium be they resting-place for that night and after a early start the next morning they reach the bank of the vara at nine o'clock we have a singular time in pass the river in a boat many woman of the lower order cross at the same time the boat be unable to approach the shore we be oblige to ride papoose-back upon the shoulder of the brawny waterman for some little distance but what amuse we much be the perfect _ sang-froid _ with which the woman with they bare leg hold up they clothes above the knee and wade to the boat before we at half-past twelve we come in sight of carrara this place we go out of we course to see and at one o'clock enter the celebrated village prettily situate in a valley at the base of stupendous mountain a deep ravine above the village contain the principal quarry of most exquisite marble for which this place have for so many age be famous the cloud obscure the highest peak and ascend from the valley like smoke from the crater of many volcano give additional grandeur to a scene by nature so grand in itself after stop at the hôtel de nouvelle paro which we find a miserable inn with bad wine scanty fare and high charge we take a hasty breakfast and procure a guide we walk out to see the curiosity of the place it rain hard and the road be excessively bad sometimes almost ankle-deep in mud notwithstanding the forbid weather and bad road we labor up the deep ravine on the side of which the excavation be make dark peak frown above we cap with cloud and snow white patch midway the side show the vein of the marble and immense heap of detritus the accumulation of age mountain themselves slope down on each side like mass of pile ice to the very edge of the road the road itself white with the material of which it be make be compose of loose piece of the white marble of every size continue the ascent by the side of a milky stream which rush down its rocky bed and which here and there be divert off into aqueduct to the various mill we be pointed to the top of a high hill by the roadside where be the entrance to a celebrated grotto and at the base close by a cavern protect a beautiful clear crystal fountain which gush from up the bottom form a liquid transparent floor and then glide to mingle its pure unsullied water with the cloudy stream that rush by it climb over pile of rock like refined sugar and pass several wagon carry heavy block down the road we arrive at the mouth of the principal quarry where the purest statuary marble be obtain i could not but think how many exquisite statue here lay entomb for age till genius at various time call they from they slumber and bid they live on we return we again pass the wagon laden with block and mule with slab on each side sometimes like the roof of a house over the mule the wagon and ox deserve notice the former be very badly construct they be strong but the wheel be small in diameter about two foot and but about three inch wide so sharp that the road must suffer from they the ox be small and without exception mouse-color the driver and there be usually one to each pair sit on the yoke between they and like the oarsman of a boat with he back towards the point towards which he be go two huge block be chained upon one of these wagon and behind drag upon the ground by a chain be another three yoke of these small ox apparently without fatigue draw the load thus construct over this wretched road a enterprising company of american or english by the construction of a railroad which be more practicable than a canal but which latter might be construct would i should think give great activity to the operation here and make it very profitable to themselves it be rather curious to note that this be the first mention of a railroad make by morse in he note or letter although he be evidently aware of the experiment which be be make at that time both in europe and america and these must have be of great interest to he it be also well to bear in mind that the great development of transportation by rail could not occur until the invention of the telegraph have make it possible to send signal ahead and in other way to control the movement of traffic at the present day the railroad at carrara which morse saw in he vision of the future have be build but the ox team be also still use and linger as a reminder of more primitive day continue they journey the traveller spend the night at lucca and in the morning explore the town which they find most interesting as well as neat and clean leave lucca with much reluctance on the 18th the journal continue : -- at half-past five at sunset pisa with its lean tower -lrb- the _ duomo _ of the cathedral and that of the baptistery be the principal object in the view -rrb- be see across the plain before we towards the west be a long line of horizon unbroken except here and there by a low-roofed tower or the little pyramidal spire of a village church to the southeast the plain stretch away to the base of distant blue mountain and to the east and the north the rude peak through which we have travel they cold top tinge with a warmer glow glitter beyond the deep brown slope which be more advanced and confine the plain to narrower limit they find the hôtel royal de l'hussar a excellent inn and the next day be Sunday they attend a english service and hear a excellent sermon by the reverend mr ford a englishman in the evening we walk to the famous lean tower the cathedral the baptistery and campo santo which be cluster together in the northern part of the city in go there we go some distance along the quay which be fill with carriage and pedestrian among whom be many masque and fancy dress of the most grotesque kind it be the season of carnival and all these foolery be permit at this time we merely glance at the exterior of the celebrated building leave till to-morrow a more thorough examination _ Monday February 16 _ we rise early and go again to the lean tower and its associated building the tower which be the _ campanile _ of the cathedral and be about one hundred and ninety foot high lean from its perpendicular thirteen foot we ascend to the top by a wind staircase one ascend feel the inclination every step he take and when he reach the top and perceive that that which should be horizontal be a inclined plane the sensation be truly startling it be difficult to persuade one 's self that the tower be not actually fall and i could not but imagine at interval that it move reasoning myself momentarily into security from the fact that it have thus stand for age i could not but recur also to the fact that once it stand upright that although age have be pass in assume its present inclination to the earth the time would probably come when it would actually fall and the idea would suggest itself with appalling force that that time might be now the reflection suggest by one of we company that it would be a glorious death for one thus perish would be sure of a imperishable name however please in romantic speculation have no great power to dispel the shrink fear produce by the vivid thought of the possibility when on the top of the tower the _ campanile _ be not the only lean tower in pisa we observe that several vary from the perpendicular and the side of many of the building even part of the cathedral and the baptistery incline at a considerable angle the soil be evidently unfavorable to the erection of high heavy building after a side trip to leghorn and further loitering along the way stop but a short time in florence which he purpose to visit and study at he leisure later on he see

coldly and distantly and even if they should so far relax as to hold a conversation with you through the evening the moment they rise to go all recognition cease they will take leave of every one else but as soon think of bow to the chair they have leave as to you a frenchman on the contrary respectfully salute all in the room friend and stranger alike he seem to take it for grant that the friend of he friend be at least entitle to respect if not to confidence and without reserve he freely enter into conversation with you and when he go he salute all alike but no acquaintance ensue a american carry he civility one step further if he meet you afterwards in other company the fact that he have see you at this friend 's and have a agreeable chit-chat be introduction enough and unless there be something _ peculiar _ in you case he will ever after know you and be you friend this be not the case with the two former the american be in this perhaps too unsuspicious and the other may have good reason for they mode but that of the american have more of generous sincerity and frankness and kindness in it _ Friday April 30 _ painting all day except two hour at the colonna palace -- landus 's picture -- horrible how i be disappointed i have hear landi the chevalier landus laud to the sky by the italian as the greatest modern colorist he be make a chevalier elect a member of the academy at florence and of the academy of st luke in rome and there be he picture which i be tell i must by all means see they be not merely bad they be execrable there be not a redeeming point in a single picture that i see not one that would have place he on a level with the commonest sign-painter in america he largest work in he room at present be the ` departure of mary queen of scot from pari ' the story be not tell the figure be not group but huddle together they be not well-drawn individually the character be vulgar and tame there be no taste in the disposal of the drapery and ornament no effect of _ chiaroscuro _ it be flimsy and misty and as to color the quality to which i be specially direct if total disregard of arrangement if the scattering of tawdry red and blues and yellow over the picture all quarrel for the precedence if leather complexion vary by those of chalk without truth or depth or tone constitute good color then be they finely color but if landus be a colorist then be titian and veronese never more to be admire in short i have never meet with the work of a artist who have a name like landus 's so utterly destitute of even the shadow of merit there be but one word which can express they character they be _ execrable _ it be astonishing that with such work of the old master before they as the italian have they should not perceive the defect of they own painter in this particular cammuccinus be the only one among they who possess genius in the higher department and he only in draw he color be very bad a funeral procession pass the house to-day on the bier expose as be customary here be a beautiful young girl apparently of fifteen dress in rich lace and satin embroider with gold and silver and flower tastefully arrange and sprinkle also with real flower and at she head be place a coronet of flower she have more the appearance of sleep than of death no relative appear near she the whole seem to be conduct by the priest and monk and those hideous object in white hood with face cover except two hole for the eye in early may morse in company with other artist go on a sketch trip to tivolus subiaco vico and vara this must have be one of the happiest period of he life he be in italy the cradle of the art he love he be surround by beauty both natural and that work by the hand of man he have daily intercourse with congenial soul and home with its care and struggle seem far away he notebook be largely fill with simple description of the place visit but now and then he indulge in rhapsody at subiaco he come upon this scene : -- upon a solitary seat -lrb- a fit place for meditation and study -rrb- by a gate which shut the part of the terrace near the convent from that which go round the hill sit a monk with he book he seem no further disturb by my passing than to give I the usual salutation i stop at a little distance from he to look around and down into the chasm below it be enchant in spite of the atmosphere of the sirocco the hill cover with wood at a distance remind I of my own country fresh and variegate the high peak beyond be gray from distance and the side of the nearer mountain be mark with many a wind track down one of which a shepherd and he sheep be descend look like a move pathway no noise disturb the silence but the distant bark of the shepherd 's dog -lrb- as he like a busy marshal keep the order of he procession unbroken -rrb- mix with the faint murmuring of the waterfall and the song of the bird that inhabit the ilex grove it be altogether a place suit to meditation and be it consistent with those duty which man owe he fellow man here would be the spot to which one fond of study and averse to the noise and bustle of the world would love to retire return to rome on June 3 after enjoy to the full this excursion from which he bring back many sketch he find the city give over to ceremony after ceremony connect with the church saint 's day follow saint 's day each with its appropriate -lrb- or from the point of view of the new englander inappropriate -rrb- pageant or some new church be dedicate and the night make brilliant with wonderful pyrotechnical display he go often with pleasure to the trinita di monti where the beautiful singing of the nun give he special pleasure comment sarcastically on a display of firework in honor of st francesco caracciolo he say : -- as far as whiz serpent wheel port-fire rocket and other variety of pyrotechnic art could set forth the humility of the saint it be this night brilliantly display and again in describe the procession of the _ corpus dominus _ the most splendid of all the church ceremony it be this which particularly impress he : -- next come monk of the franciscan and capuchin order with they brown dress and head shave and such a set of human face i never behold they seem many of they like disinterred corpse for a moment reanimate to go through this ceremony and then to sink back again into they profound sleep pale and haggard and unearthly the wild eye of the visionary and the stupid stare of the idiot be see among they and it need no stretch of the imagination to find in most the expression of the worst passion of we nature they chant as they go they sepulchral voice echo through the vaulted piazza while the bell of st peter 's toll a deep bass drone seem a fitting accompaniment for they hymn later on this same day while watch a part of the ceremony on the gorso he have this rather disagreeable experience : -- i be stand close to the side of the house when in a instant without the slightest notice my hat be strike off to the distance of several yard by a soldier or rather a poltroon in a soldier 's costume and this courteous maneuver be perform with he gun and bayonet accompany with curse and taunt and the expression of a demon in he countenance in case like this there be no redress the soldier receive he order to see that all hat be off in this religion of force and the manner be leave to he discretion if he be a brute as be the case in this instance he may strike it off or as in some other instance if the soldier be a gentleman he may ask to have it take off there be no excuse for this outrage on all decency to which every foreigner be liable and which be not of infrequent occurrence the blame lie after all not so much with the pitiful wretch who perpetrate

have receive commission and the day 's record almost invariably begin with at the colonna palace all day or at the vatican all day or wherever else he may have be work at the time the heat of the roman summer seem not yet to have inconvenience he for he do not complain but simply remark : sun almost vertical house and shop shut at noon he have this to say of a italian institution : lottery in rome make for the government eight thousand scudus per week common people venture in they be superstitious and consult _ cabaliste _ or lucky number these tolerate as they help sell the ticket while work hard he occasionally indulge himself in a holiday and on June 16 he in company with three other artist engage a carriage for a excursion to albano aricium and genzano to witness at the latter place the celebrated _ festa infiora _ which occur every year on the 17th of June after spend the night at albano which they find crowd with artist of various nationality and with other sight-seer we set out for genzano a pleasant walk of a little more than a mile through a wind carriage-road thickly shaded with fine tree of elm and chestnut and ilex a little fountain by the wayside delay we for a moment to sketch it and we then continue we way through a straight level pave road shaded on each side with tree into the pretty village of genzano finding that the principal display be not until the afternoon they stroll to the lake of nemus situate in a deep basin the crater of a volcano those italian lake which he have so far see while lovely and especially interesting from they historical or legendary association and the picturesque building on they shore seem to the artist -lrb- ever faithful to he native land -rrb- less naturally attractive than the lake with which he be familiar at home -- lake george otsego lake etc he have not yet see como or maggiore then he touch upon the great drawback to all travel in italy : -- throughout the day wherever we go beggar in every shape annoy we nor could we scarcely hear ourselves talk when on the border of the lake for the swarm which importune we a foolish italian in the hope probably of get rid of they commence give a _ mezzo biochus _ to each and such a clamor such devour eye such push and bawl such tease importunity for more and from some who have receive and conceal they gift i could not have conceive nor do i ever wish again to see so disgust a sight the foolish fellow who invent this plan of satisfy a italian beggar 's appetite find to he sorrow that instead of thanks he obtain curse and a increase of importunity after dinner we again walk to genzano whither we find be go great multitude of every class elegant equipage and _ vetture _ racing with each other donkey and horse and foot traveller and not among the least striking be the number of woman some of whom be splendidly dress all ride on horseback a foot in each stirrup and ride with as much ease and fine horsemanship as the man when we arrive at genzano the decoration of the street have commence two of the principal and wide street ascend a little diverge from each other from the left side of the common street which go through the village the middle of these street be the principal scene of decoration on each side of the center of the street leave a good-sized sidewalk be pillar at a distance of eight or nine foot from each other compose of the evergreen box and tuft at the top with every variety of flower they be in many place also connect by festoon of box the pavement of the street between the pillar in both street and for a distance of at least one half a mile be most exquisitely figure with flower of various color look like a immense and gorgeously figure carpet the device be in the follow order which i take note of on the spot : first a temple with four column of yellow flower -lrb- the flower of the broom -rrb- contain a altar on which be the holy sacrament in the pediment of the temple a column surmount by a halfmoon which be the arm of the colonna family second be a large crown third the holy sacrament again with various rich ornament fourth star and circle fifth a splendid coat-of-arm as accurate and rich as if emblazon in permanent color with a cardinal 's hat and a shield with the word _ ` pruden ' _ and _ ` fidelis ' _ upon it there be twenty of these wonderful floral decoration on the pavement of one street and fourteen on that of the other and all be describe in the note but i have particularize enough to show they character the journal continue : -- all these figure be as elegantly execute as if make for permanency some with a minuteness truly astonishing among other decoration of the day be the free-will offering of one of the people who have it display at the side of he shop on a rude pedestal it be call the ` flight into egypt ' and represent joseph and mary and the infant on a ass and all compose of shrub and flower it be indeed a most ludicrous-looking affair joseph with a face -lrb- if such it might be call -rrb- of purple flower and a flaxen wig dress in a coarse pilgrim 's cape stud over with yellow flower be lead by a hay band a green donkey make of a kind of heath grass with a tail of lavender and hoof of cabbage leaf of this latter composition be also the sandal of mary whose face as well as that of the _ bambino _ be also of purple flower and shapeless the frock of the infant be of the gaudiest red poppy it excite the laughter of almost all who see it except now and then some of the ignorant lower class would touch they hat cross themselves and mumble a prayer after describe some of the picturesque costume of the _ contadinus _ he continue : -- it be nearly dark before the procession to which all these preparation have reference begin to move at length the band of music be hear at the lower end of one of the street and a man in ample robe of scarlet and blue with a staff be see lead the procession which need be no further describe than to say it consist of the usual quantity of monk chant with wax-taper in they hand cross and heavy unwieldy banner which endanger the head of the multitude as they pass of a fine band of music playing beautiful waltz and other composition and a _ quantum suff _ of man dress in the garb of soldier to keep the good people uncovered and on they knee the head of the procession have arrive at the top of the street when -- crack pop -- go forty or fifty cracker which have be place against the wall of a house near we and which add wonderfully to the solemnity of the scene and accordingly be repeat every few seconds form a fine accompaniment to the waltz and the chanting of the monk in a few minute all the beauty of the flower-carpeted street be trodden out and the last of the procession have hardly pass before all the flower disappear from the pillar and all be ruin and disorder the procession halt at a temporary altar at the top of the street and we set out on we return at the same moment down the street face the immense multitude which fill the whole street we have scarcely proceed a third of the distance down when we suddenly see all before we uncovered and upon they knee we alone form a exception and we continue we course with various hint from those around we to stop and kneel which we answer by talk english to each other in a louder tone and so pass for unchristian _ forestierus _ and escape unmolested especially as the soldier be all at the head of the street the effect however be exceedingly grand of such a multitude upon they knee and could i have divest myself of the thought of the compulsory measure which produce it and the object to which they kneel the picture of the virgin i should have feel the solemnity of a scene which seem in the outward act to indicate such a universal reverence for he who alone rightfully claim the homage and devotion of the heart whether this curious custom still persist in genzano i know not baedeker be silent on the subject it be nearly dark before they start on the drive back to rome and quite dark after they have go a short distance we pass the tomb of the horatius and curiatius which look much grander in the light of the torch than in the day and drive hastily through albano come upon the campagna once more it be still more like a desert in the night than in the day for it be a interminable ocean and the mass of ruin come darker than the rest seem like desert wreck upon its bosom it be consider dangerous in the summer to sleep while cross the campagna indeed in certain part of it over the pontine marsh in July and August it be say to be certain death but if the traveller can keep awake there be no danger in spite of the fear which we naturally entertain lest it might be already dangerous most of we could not avoid sleep nor could i with every effort make for that purpose the day follow he return to rome be employ chiefly in copying at the colonna palace the heat be now begin to grow more oppressive and we find this note on June 21 : -- in the cool of the morning you see the door of the cafe throng with people take they coffee and sit on chair in the street for some distance round at _ mezzo giorno _ the street be desert the shop-door be close and all be still they have all go to they _ siesta _ they midday sleep at four o'clock all be bustle again it seem a fresh morning the street and cafés be throng and the corso be fill with the equipage of the wealthy enjoy till quite dark the cool of the evening air the sun be now oppressively warm the heat be unlike anything i have feel in america there be a scorching character about it which be indescribable and the glare of the light be exceedingly painful to the eye the evening be delightful cool and clear show the lustre of the star gloriously _ June 28 _ in the evening go to the piazza of st peter 's to witness the illumination of its magnificent dome and the piazza the change from the smaller to the larger illumination be one of the grandest spectacles i ever behold the lantern which be profusely scatter over it show its whole form in line of fire glow brighter and brighter as the evening advance from twilight to dark till it seem impossible for its brilliance to increase the crowd below on foot and in carriage be in breathless expectation the great bell of st peter 's at length strike the hour of nine and at the first stroke a great ball of light be see ascend the cross to its pinnacle this be the signal for thousand of assistant who be conceal over its vast extent to light the great lamp and in a instant all be motion the whole mass be like a living thing fire whirling and flash over it in all direction till the vast pile blaze as if light with a thousand sun the effect be truly magical for the agent by whom this change be work be invisible after the illumination of st peter 's he go to the castle of st angelo where he witness what he describe as the grandest display of firework he have ever see _ Tuesday June 29 _ this day be st peter 's day the grandest _ festa _ of the romish church i go with mr b early to st peter 's to see the ceremony the street be fill with equipage among which the splendid scarlet-and-gold equipage of the cardinal make the most conspicuous figure cardinal weld 's carriage be the richest and next in magnificence be that of cardinal barberinus on enter st peter 's we find it hang throughout with crimson damask and gold and fill with people except a wide space in the center with soldier on each side to keep it open for the procession we pass up near the statue of st peter who be to-day dress out in he papal robe he black face -lrb- for it be of bronze -rrb- look rather frightful from beneath the splendid tiara which crown he head and the scarlet-and-gold tissue of he robe have a little time to spare we follow a portion of the crowd down the step beside the pedestal of the statue of st veronica into the vault beneath the church which be illuminate on this festival mass be perform in several of the splendid chapel whose rich decoration of painting and sculpture be but once a year reveal to the light save from the obscure glimmering of the wax-taper which be carry by the guide to occasional visitor it be astonishing what a vast amount of expense be here literally bury the ornamented part be beneath the dome the other part be plain heavy arch and low almost numberless and contain the sarcophagus of the pope and other distinguished character the illumination here be confine to a single lamp over each arch which rather make darkness visible and give a awful effect to some of the gloomier passage in one part we see through a long avenue of arch a iron-grated door within be a dim light which just send its feeble ray upon some object in its neighborhood not strong enough to show what they be it require no great effort of the imagination to fancy a emaciated spectral figure of a monk pore over a large book which lay before he it might have be as we imagine we have not time to examine for the sound of music far above we summon we into the region of day again and we arrive in the body of the church just as the trumpet be sound from the balcony within the church over the great door of entrance the effect of the sound be very grand reverberate through the lofty arch and aisle of the church we get sight of the head of the procession come in at the great door and soon after the pope bear in he crimson chair of state and with the triple crown upon he head and a crimson gold-embroidered mantilla over he shoulder be see enter accompany by he fan-bearer and other usual attendant and after he the cardinal and bishop the pope as usual make the sign of the cross as he go the procession pass up the great aisle go round to the back of the great altar where be the canopy for the pope and seat for the cardinal and bishop the pope be too feeble to go through the ceremony of high mass it be therefore perform before he by one of the cardinal there be nothing in this ceremony that be novel or interesting it be the same monotonous chant from the choir the same numberless bowing and genuflection and puffing of incense and change of garment and fuss about the altar all that be new be the constant bustle about the pope kissing of he toe and he hand help he to rise and to sit again bring and take away of cushion and robe and tiara and mitre and a thousand other little matter that would have enrage any man of weak nerve if it do not kill he after two hour of this tedious work -lrb- the people in the mean time perfectly inattentive -rrb- the ceremony end and the pope be again bear through the church and the crowd return on July 7 morse with four friend leave rome at four o'clock in the morning for naple where they arrive on the 11th after the usual experience beggar continually mar the peaceful beauty of every scene by they importunity good inn with courteous landlord and servant alternate with wretched tavern and insolent attendant the little notebook detail the first ten day ' experience in naple be miss and the next one take up the narrative on July 24 when he and he friend be in sorrento i shall not transcribe he impression of that beautiful town or those of the island of caprus these place be too familiar to the visitor to italy and have change but little in the last eighty year prom caprus they be row over to amalfi and narrowly escape be dash on the rock by the sudden rising of a violent gale at amalfus they find lodgings in the franciscan monastery which be still use as a inn and here i shall again quote from the journal : -- the place be in decay and be a excellent specimen of they monastic building it be now in as romantic a state as the most poetic imagination could desire here be gloomy hall and dark and decayed room long corridor of chamber uninhabited except by the lizard and the bat terrace upon the brow of stupendous precipice gloomy cell with grated window and subterranean apartment and cavern remain of rude fresco stain the crumble ceiling and ivy and various wild plant hang down from the opening crevice and cover the top of the broken wall a rude sundial without a gnomon be almost obliterate from the wall of the cloister but its motto ' _ die nostri quasus umbra super terram et nulli est mora _ ' still resist the effect of decay as if to serve the appropriate purpose of the convent 's epitaph at the foot of the long stair in the great hall be the ruin chapel its altar break up and despoil of its picture and ornament we be call to dinner by we host who be accompany by he wife a very pretty woman two child the elder carry by the mother the younger by the old grandparent a old man of upward of eighty who seem quite pleased with he burden and delighted to show we he charge the whole family quite prepossess we in they favor there seem to be a unusual degree of affection display by the member towards each other which we could not but remark at the time we dining apartment be the old _ domus refectioni _ of the convent as its name write over the door which lead into the choir manifest after a excellent dinner we retire to we chamber for the night _ Tuesday July 27 _ we all rest but badly last night the heat be excessive the insect especially mosquito exceedingly troublesome and the sound of the wave as they beat against the rock and chafe the beach in the gusty night and the howling of the wind which for a time moan through the desert chamber of the convent all make we restless i rise several time in the night and open my window look out on the dark water of the bay till the dawn over the mountain warn I that the time for sleep be pass away and i again throw myself on the bed to rest but scarcely have i lose myself in sleep before the sound of loud voice below and wailing again wake I i look out of my window on the balcony below it be fill with armed man soldier and other like brigand with musket be in hurry commotion call to each other from the balcony and from the terraced step below while perplexed in conjecture the meaning of what i see mr c call at my door request I to rise as the whole house be in agitation at a terrible accident which have occur in the night dress in great haste i go into the contiguous room and look out of the window down upon a terrace some thirty foot below see the lifeless body of a man with spot of blood upon he clothes lie across the font of water a police officer with a band of man appear take down in write the particulars for a report on enquiry i find that the body be that of the old man the father of we host whom we have see the evening before in perfect health he have the dangerous habit of walk in he sleep and have jump it be suppose in that state out of he chamber window which be directly beneath we at what time in the night be uncertain he body must have be beneath I while i be look from my window in the night we host but particularly he brother seem for a time almost inconsolable the lamentation of the latter over the bloody body -lrb- as they be lay it out in the room where we have the evening before dine -rrb- call upon he father and mingle he cry with a chant to the virgin and to the saint be peculiarly plaintive and sound through the vacant hall of the convent make a melancholy impression upon we all soon after breakfast we go downstairs several priest and funeral attendant have arrive the poor old man be lay upon a bed the room darken and four wax-light burn two each side of the bed a short time be take in preparation and then upon a bier bear by four bearer a few precede it with wax-light the body with the face expose as be usual in italy be take down the steep pathway to its long home i could not help remark the total want of that decent deportment in all those officiate which mark the conduct of those that attend the interment of the dead in we own country even the priest ` seem to be in high glee talking and heartily laugh with each other at what it perplex I to conjecture i go into the room in which the old man have sleep all be as he have leave it over the head of the bed be the rude print of the virgin and saint which be so common in all the house of italy and which be suppose to act as charm by these superstitious people the lamp be on the window ledge where he have place it and he scanty wardrobe upon a chair by the bedside over the door be a sprig of laurel place there since he death the accident of the morning throw a gloom over the whole day we however commence we sketch from different part of the convent and i commence a picture a view of amalfus from the interior of the grotto several of the notebook be here miss and from the next in order we find that the traveller must have linger in or near sorrento until August 30 when they return to naple the next entry of interest while rather gruesome seem to be worth record _ Wednesday September 1 _ morning painting in the afternoon take a ride round the suburb and visit the campo santo the campo santo be the public burial-place it be a large square enclosure have high wall at the side and open at the top it contain three hundred and sixty vault one of which be open every day to receive the dead of that day and be not again open until all the other in rotation have be open as we enter the desolate enclosure the only living being be three miserable-looking old woman gather together upon the stone of one of the vault they sit as if perform some incantation mumble they prayer and count they bead and one other of the same fraternity who have be kneel before a picture leave she position as we enter and kneel upon another of the vault where she remain all the time we be present tell she bead at the farther end of the enclosure be a large portable lever to raise the stone which cover the vault upon the promise of a few _ grain _ the stone of the vault for the day be raise and with the precaution of hold we kerchief to we nose we look down into the dark vault death be sufficiently terrible in itself and the grave in its best form have enough of horror to make the stoutest heart quail at the thought but nothing i have see or read of can equal the campo santo for the most loathsome and disgusting mode of burial the human carcass of all age and sex be here throw in together to a depth of perhaps twenty foot without coffin in heap most of they perfectly naked and leave to corrupt in a mass like the offal from a slaughter house so disgust a spectacle i never witness there be in sight about twenty body man woman and child a child of about six year with beautiful fair hair have fall across the body of a man and lay in the attitude of sleep but i can not describe the position of all without offence so i forbear we be glad to turn away and retrace we step to we carriage never i believe in any country christian or pagan be there a instance of such total want of respect for the remains of the dead -lrb- illustration : de witt clinton paint by morse property of the metropolitan museum of art -rrb- on September 5 he again revert to the universal plague of beggar in italy : -- in pass through the country you may not take notice of a pretty child or seem pleased with it so soon as you do the mother will instantly importune you for ' _ qualche cosa _ ' for the child neither can you ask for a cup of cold water at a cottage door nor ask the way to the next village nor even make the slightest inquiry of a peasant on any subject but the result will be ' _ qualche cosa signora _ ' the first act which a child be teach in italy be to hold out its hand to beg child too young to speak i have see hold out they little hand for that purpose and so mechanical be this action that i have see in one instance a boy of nine year nod in he sleep and yet at regular interval extend he hand to beg beg be here no disgrace on the contrary it be make respectable by the custom of the church on September 6 after visit the catacomb he go to the convent of st martino and indulge in this rhapsody : -- from a terrace and balcony two view of the beautiful scenery of the city and bay be obtain from the latter place especially you look down upon the city which be spread like a model far beneath you there be a great deal of the sublime in thus look down upon a populous city one feel for the time separate from the concern of the world we forget while we consider the insignificance of that individual man move in yonder street and who be scarcely visible to we that we ourselves be equally insignificant it be in such a situation that the superiority of the mind over the body be feel paradoxical as it may at first seem its greatness be evince in the feeling of its own littleness after gaze here for a while we be show into the chapel through the choir in the sacristy be a picture of a dead christ with the three mary and joseph by spagnoletto not only the finest picture by that master but i be quite inclined to say that it be the finest picture i have yet see there be in it a more perfect union of the great quality of art -- fine conception just design admirable disposition of _ chiaroscuro _ exquisite color -- whether truth be consider or choice of tone in congruity with the subject 's most masterly execution and just character and expression if any objection be to be make it would perhaps be in the particular of character which in elevation in ideality fall far short of raphael in other point it have not its superior return to rome on September 14 the only entry i find in the journal for the first few day be paint all day at home and a short account of a soirée at the persiani ' _ Monday September 20 _ begin the portrait of the celebrated sculptor thorwaldsen he be a most amiable man and be universally respect he be never marry in early life he have two child by a mistress one a daughter be now in a convent it be say that a noble lady of england of great fortune become attach to he and he no less to she but that the circumstance of he have two illegitimate child prevent a marriage he be the greatest sculptor of the age i have study he work they be distinguish for simple dignity just expression and truth in character and design the composition be also characterize by simplicity these quality combine endow they with that beauty which we so much admire in the work of greece whether in literature or art thorwaldsen can not be say to imitate the antique he rather seem to be one bear in the best age of grecian art imbue with the spirit of that age and produce from he own resource kindred work the following letter be write by morse before he leave rome for naple but can be more appropriately introduce at this point : -- to the cavalier thorwaldsen my dear sir -- i have hope to have the pleasure of painting you portrait for which you be so good as to promise to sit before i leave rome for naple but the weather be become so oppressive and there be a party of friend about to travel the same road i have consent to join they i shall return to rome in September or October and i therefore beg you will allow I then to claim the fulfilment of you kind promise what a barrier my dear sir be difference of language to social intercourse i never feel the curse that befall the architect of babel so sensibly as now since as one of the effect of they folly i be debar from the gratification and profit which i have promise myself in be know to you with highest respect etc curiously enough morse never learn to speak a foreign language fluently although he could read quite easily french and i believe german and italian and from certain passage in he journal we infer that he could make himself understand by the italian the portrait of thorwaldsen be complete and become the property of philip hone esq who have give morse a commission to paint a picture for one hundred dollar the subject to be leave to the discretion of the artist mr hone value the portrait highly and it remain in he gallery until he death it be then sell and morse lose track of it for many year in 1868 be particularly desirous of gain possession of it again for a purpose which be explain in a letter quote a little farther on he institute a search for it and finally learn that it have be purchase by mr john taylor johnston for four hundred dollar before he could enter into negotiation for its purchase mr johnston hear of he desire to possess it and of he reason for this wish and he generously insist on present it to morse i shall now quote the following extract from a letter write in dresden on January 23 1868 to mr johnston : -- my dear sir -- you letter of the 6th inst be this moment receive in which i have be startle by you most generous offer present I with my portrait of the renowned thorwaldsen for which he sit to I in rome in 1831 i know not in what term my dear sir to express to you my thanks for this most acceptable gift i make a excursion to copenhagen in the summer of 1856 as a sort of devout pilgrimage to the tomb of two renowned dane whose labor in they respective department -- the one oerst of science the other thorwaldsen of art -- have so greatly enriched the world the personal kindness of the late king frederick vii who courteously receive I at he castle of fredericksborg through the special presentation of colonel raslof -lrb- more recently the danish minister at washington -rrb- the hospitality of many of the principal citizen of copenhagen the visit to the tomb and museum of the work of thorwaldsen and to the room in which the immortal oersted make he brilliant electro-magnetic discovery the casual and accidental introduction and interview with a daughter of oerst -- all create a train of reflection which prompt I to devise some suitable mode of show to these hospitable people my appreciation of they friendly attention and i propose to myself the presentation to he majesty the king of denmark of this portrait of thorwaldsen for which he sit to I in rome and with which i know he be specially pleased my desire to accomplish this purpose be further strengthen by the additional attention of the king at a later period in send I the decoration of he order of the danebrog from the moment this purpose be form twelve year ago i have be desirous of obtain this portrait and watch for the opportunity of possess it again here follow a detailed account of the circumstance of the painting of the portrait and of its disappearance with which we be familiar and he close by say : -- this brief history will show you my dear sir what a boon you have confer upon I indeed it seem like a dream and if my most cordial thanks not merely for the _ gift _ but for the graceful and generous manner in which it have be offer be any compensation you may be sure they be yours these be no conventional word but they come from a heart that can gratefully appreciate the noble sentiment which have prompt you generous act return from this little excursion into later year i shall take up the narrative again as reveal in the notebook while occasionally visit the opera and the theater morse do not altogether approve of they and on September 21 he indulge in the follow reflection on they and on the social evil : -- no female of openly dissolute character be see such as occupy particular part of the theater in england and america indeed they never appear on the street of rome in that unblushing manner as in london and even in new york and philadelphium it must not from hence be infer that vice be less frequent here than elsewhere there be enough of it but it be carry on in secret it be deeper and prey more on the vitals of society than with we this vice with we like a humor on the skin deform the surface but here it infect the very heart the whole system be affect it be rotten to the core theater here and with we be different institution here where thousand for want of thought or rather matter for thought would die of ennui where it be a object to escape from home and even from one 's self the theater serve the purpose of a momentary excitement a new piece a new performer furnish matter for conversation and turn off the mind from the discussion of point of theology or politics the theater be therefore encourage by the government and be guard against the abuse of popular assemblage by strong military guard but what have we to do with theater in america have we not the whole world of topic for discussion or conversation open to we be not truth in religion politics and science suffer to be assail by enemy freely and do it not therefore require the time of all intelligent man to study and understand and defend and fortify themselves in truth have we time to throw away more than this have we not home where domestic endearment charm we where domestic duty require we attention where the relation of wife of husband of child have the tie of mutual affection and mutual confidence to attach we to we fireside need we go abroad for amusement can the theater with all its tinsel finery attract away from home the man who have once taste the bliss of a happy family circle be there no pleasure in see that romp group of child in the heyday of youth amuse themselves ere they go to rest be there no pleasure in study the character of you little family as they thus undisguisedly display themselves and so give you the opportunity of direct they mind to the best advantage be there no amusement in watch the development of the infant mind and in assist its feeble effort he must be of most unsocial mould who can leave the thousand charm of home to pass those precious hour in the noxious atmosphere of a theater there to be excite to return at midnight to rise from a late bed to pass the best hour of the day in a feverish reverie succeed by the natural depression which be sure to follow and to crave a renew indulgence repeat renewal cause indifference and ennui to succeed till excitement be no longer produce but give place to a habit of listless indifference or a spirit of captious criticism _ Monday November 8 1830 _ a year to-day since i leave home _ Tuesday November 9 _ ignorance at post-office send letter for united state to england because the united state belong to england _ Wednesday December 1 _ many report for some day past prepared we for the announcement of

of the assassin of a prime minister that he be a keen and interested observer of the festivity in honor of a czar of russium a king of france and a famous general -lrb- blücher -rrb- and although not mention in he correspondence he be fond of tell how he have see the ship sailing away to distant st helena bear the conquer napoleon bonaparte into captivity now while he be diligently pursue he art in rome he be privileged to witness the funeral obsequy of one pope and the ceremony attendant upon the installation of he successor in future year the same good fortune follow he he presence on these occasion be not always unattended by danger to himself he discretion during the year of war between england and america save he from possible annoyance or worse and now again in rome he be call upon to exercise the same virtue for the church have enter upon troublous time and soon the life of foreigner be in danger and many of they leave the city on Thursday February 10 there be this entry in the journal : the revolution in the papal state to the north at bologna and ancona and in the duchy of modena have be make know at rome great consternation prevail we learn further that on February 12 rumor of conspiracy be numerous the time the place of rendezvous and even the number be openly talk of the street be fill with the people who gaze at each other inquisitively and apprehension seem mark on every face the shop be shut troops be station in the piazza and everything wear a gloomy aspect at half-past seven a discharge of musketry be hear among the report of the day be one that the trasteverinus have plot to massacre the _ forestierus _ in case of a revolt while the festivity of the carnival be on account of these disturbance order by the pope to be discontinue the religious ceremony be still observe and go to st peter 's one day -- to witness the ceremony of consecration as a bishop and coronation as a king of the pope -- morse have this pleasant experience : -- the immense area seem already fill a double line of soldier enclose a wide space from the great door through the middle of the church on each side of the altar and around the richly enclosed space where be erect the two papal throne and the seat for the cardinal into this soldier-invested space none but the privileged be permit to enter ambassador prince duke and noble of every degree be see in all they splendor of costume promenading i be with the crowd without make up my mind to see nothing of the ceremony but be in full dress and remember that on former occasion i have be admit as a stranger within the space i determine to make the effort again i therefore edge myself through the mass of people until i reach the line of soldier and catch the eye of the commanding officer as he pass by i beckoned to he and as he come to I i say ' _ sono un americano un forestiero signora _ ' which i have no sooner say than take I by the hand he draw I in and politely bow give I leave to go where i please from this point of vantage he have a excellent view of all the ceremony which be much like the other he have witness and do not need to be describe he want very much to go to florence at this time to fulfil some of the commission he have receive for copy of famous painting in that city but he departure be delay for as he note on February 13 : -- there be many alarming rumor one in particular that the trasteverinus and galleottus or galley slave have be secretly arm by the government and that the former be particularly incense against the _ forestierus _ as the suppose instigator of the revolution these fact have throw we all into alarm for we know not what excess such man may be guilty of when excite by religious enthusiasm to revenge themselves on those they call heretics we be compel too to remain in rome from the state of the country it be not safe to travel on account of brigand who now infest the road _ February 15 _ i have never be in a place where it be so difficult to ascertain the truth as in this city i have enquire the reason of this movement hostile to the government but can not ascertain precisely its object some say it be to deprive the pope of he temporal power -- and some catholic seem to think that they religion would flourish the better for it other that it be a plan long digest for bring all italy under one government have it divide into so many federative state like the united state the trasteverinus seem to be a peculiar class proud as believe themselves to be the only true descendant from the ancient roman and therefore hate the other roman poor from that very pride ignorant and attach to they faith they be the class of all other to be dread in a season of anarchy it be easy by flattery by a little distribution of money and by a cry of danger to they religion to rouse they to any degree of enthusiasm and no one can set bound to the excess of such a set of fiend when let loose upon society the government at present have they in they interest and while that be the case no danger be to be dread it be in that state of anarchy which for a longer or shorter period intervene in the change of government between the established rule of the one and of the other that such a class of man be to be fear _ February 17 _ the plan say to have be determine on by the conspirator be this : the last night of the carnival be fix for the execution of the plan this be Tuesday night when it be customary to have the _ moccolettus _ or small wax-candle light by the crowd the conspirator be each to be place as it be by accident by the side of a soldier -lrb- which in so great a crowd could be do without suspicion -rrb- and when the cannon fire which give the signal for close the course it be also to serve as a signal for each one to turn upon the soldier and by kill he to seize he arm this would indeed have be a bloody scene and for humanity 's sake it be well that it be discover and prevent _ February 20 _ i learn that the pope be desirous of yield to the spirit of the time and be dispose to grant a constitution to the people but that the cardinal oppose it he be say also to be prepare to fly from rome and even have declare he intention of resign the dignity of pope and retire again to the solitude of the convent _ February 24 _ it seem to be no longer doubtful that a revolutionary army be approach rome from the revolted province and that they advance rapidly the city be tranquil enough no troops be see except at night a sentinel at some corner cry as you pass ' _ chus viva _ ' and you be oblige to cry ' _ il papa _ ' which one may surely do with a good conscience for he be entitle to great respect for he personal character _ February 25 _ go to-day to get my passport viséed for florence whither i intend to go on Tuesday next but be advise by the consul and other not to risk the journey at present as it be unsafe i break the continuity of the narrative for a moment to note that while morse be make copy of famous painting in rome and study intelligently the work of the old master he be not forgetful of the young academy at home which he have help to find and of which he be still president on march 1 he write jubilantly to the secretary jl morton that he have succeed in obtain by gift a number of cast of ancient and modern sculpture which he will send home by the first opportunity among the generous donor he mention thorwaldsen daniel coit esq richard wyatt esq signor trentanove and george washington lee esq he add at the end of the letter : -- i leave rome immediately and know not when i shall be allow to rest the revolution here have turn everything into confusion render the movement of traveller uncertain and unsafe and embarrassing my study and those of other artist exceedingly i shall try to go to florence but must pass through the two hostile army and through a country which in a season of confusion like the present be sure to be infested with brigand if i reach florence in safety and be allow to remain which be somewhat doubtful you shall hear of I again either directly or through my brother mr morton answering this letter on may 22 inform morse of he reëlection as president of the national academy of design and add : by the by talk of come back do try and make you arrangement as soon as possible we want you very much if it be only to set we all right again we begin to feel the want of we _ head man _ revert to the journal again we find this note : march 3 for some day past i have be engage in pack up and take leave and yesterday be introduce by the count le grice to cardinal weld who receive I very politely present I with a book and send I two letter of introduction to london on march 4 morse with four companion start from rome on the seemingly perilous journey to florence they pass through the line of both army but contrary to they expectation they be most courteously treat by the officer on both side it be true that they learn afterwards that they come near be arrest at civita castellana where the papal army be assemble in force for -- when we take leave of the marquis at ternus he tell we that it be well we leave civita castellana as we do for a order for we arrest be make out and in a few minute more we should not have be allow to leave the place indeed when i think of the case it be a surprising thing that we be allow to go into all part of the place to see they position to count they man and know they strength and then to immediately pass over to they enemy and to give he if we choose all the information that any spy could have give it be not within the province of this work to deal at length with the political movement of the time as we have see morse be fortunate in avoid danger and we learn from history that this revolt which threaten at one time to become very serious be eventually suppress by the papal arm aid by the austrian have pass safely through the zone of danger they travel on and on march 9 : -- at half-past three the _ beautiful city _ be see to we left repose in sunshine in the wide vale of the arno the duomo and the campanile be the most conspicuous object at half-past four we enter florence and obtain room at the leone bianco in the via vigna nuova _ march 10 _ we find to-day to we great discomfiture that we be allow by the police to stay but three day in the city no entreaty through we consul nor offer of guaranty on he part avail to soften towards we the rigor of the decree which they say apply to all foreigner i have write to we consul at leghorn to petition the government for we stay as mr ombrosus the united state consul here be not accredit by the government he must have succeed in obtain permission to remain although the fact be not note in the journal for the next entry be on April 11 and find he still in florence it begin : various engagement prevent my enter regularly in my journal every day 's event as they occur i have be compel to make a gap which i fill up from recollection before follow he further however i shall quote from a letter write to he brother on April 15 but refer to event which happen some time before : -- we have recently hear of the disaster of the pole what noble people how deserving of they freedom i must tell you of a interesting circumstance that occur to I in relation to poland it be in the latter part of June of last year just as i be complete my arrangement for my journey to naple that i be tempt by one of those splendid moonlight evening so common in italy to visit once more the ruin of the coliseum i have frequently be to the coliseum in company but now i have the curiosity to go alone -- i wish to enjoy if possible its solitude and its solemn grandeur unannoyed by the presence of any one it be eleven o'clock when i leave my lodgings and no one be walk at that hour in the solitary street of rome from the corso to the forum all be as still as in a desert city the ruin of the forum the temple and pillar the arch of titus and the gigantic arcade of the temple of peace seem to sleep in the gravelike stillness of the air the only sound that reach my ear be that of my own footstep i slowly proceed stop occasionally and listen and enjoy the profound repose and the solemn pure light so suit to the ruin magnificence around I as i approach the coliseum the shriek of a owl and the answering echo break the stillness for a moment and all be still again i reach the entrance before which pace a lonely sentinel he arm flash in the moonbeam he abruptly stop I and tell I i could not enter i ask he why he reply that he order be to let no one pass i tell he i know better that he have no such order that he be place there to protect visitor and not to prevent they entrance and that i should pass find I resolute -lrb- for i know by experience he motive be merely to extort money -rrb- he soften in he tone and wish I to wait until he could speak to the sergeant of the guard to this i assent and while he be go a party of gentleman approach also to the entrance one of they have hear the discourse between the sentinel and myself address I perceive that he be a foreigner i ask he if he speak english he reply with a slight accent ` yes a little you be a englishman sir ' ` no ' i reply ' i be a american from the united state ' ` indeed ' say he ` that be much better ' and extend he hand he shake I cordially by the hand add ' i have a great respect for you country and i know many of you countryman ' he then mention dr jarvi and mr cooper the novelist the latter of whom he say be hold in the greatest estimation in europe and nowhere more so than in he country poland where he work be more seek after than those of scott and he mind be esteem of a equal if not of a superior cast this casual introduction of literary topic furnish we with ample matter for conversation while we be not engage in contemplate the sublime ruin over which when the sentinel return we climb i ask he respect the literature of poland and particularly if there be now any live poet of eminence he observe : ` yes sir i be happily travel in company with the most celebrated of we poet meinenvitch ' and who as i understand he be one of the party walk in another part of the ruin engage in conversation we leave the coliseum together and slowly proceed into the city i tell he of the deep interest with which poland be regard in the united state and that she hero be speak of with the same veneration as we own as some evidence of this estimation i inform he of the monument erect by the cadet of west point to the memory of kosciusko with this intelligence he be evidently much affect he take my hand and exclaim with great enthusiasm and emphatically : ` we too sir shall be free the time be come we too shall be free my unhappy country will be free ' -lrb- this be before the revolution in france -rrb- as i come to the street where we be to part he take out he notebook and go under the lamp of a madonna near the piazza colonna he wish I to write my name for he among the other name of american which he have treasured in he book i comply with he request in bidding I adieu he say : ` it will be one of my happiest recollection of rome that the last night which i pass in this city be pass in the coliseum and with a american a citizen of a free country if you should ever visit warsaw pray enquire for prince -- i shall be exceedingly glad to see you ' thus i part with this interesting pole that i should have forget a polish name pronounce but once you will not think extraordinary the sequel remain to be tell when the polish revolution break out what be my surprise to find the poet meinenvitch and a prince whose name seem like that which he pronounce to I and to which be add -- ` just return from italy ' -- among the first member of the provisional government morse assure himself afterwards and so note it in he journal that this chance acquaintance be prince michael jerome radziwill who have serve as lieutenant in the war of independence under kosciusko fight under napoleon in russium -lrb- by whom he be make a brigadier-general -rrb- and shortly after the meeting in the coliseum be make general-in-chief of the polish army after the defeat of this army he be banish to central russium until 1836 when he retire to dresden revert again to the notebook we find that florence with she wealth of beauty in architecture sculpture and painting appeal strongly to the artist and the note be chiefly description of what he see and which it will not be necessary to transcribe he have during all the time he be in italy be complete one after another the copy for which he have receive commission and have be send they home he thus describe to he friend mr van schaick the painting make for he : -- _ florence may 12 1831 _ i have at length complete the two picture which you be so kind as to commission I to execute for you and they be pack in a case ready to send to you from leghorn by the first opportunity through messr bell de yongh & co of that city as you request be that these picture should be head i have choose two of the most celebrated in the gallery of portrait in the florence gallery these be the head of ruben and titian from the portrait by themselves as the portrait of the two great master of color they will alone be interesting but they be more so from give a fair specimen of they two opposite style of color that of ruben from its gaiety will doubtless be more popular but that of titian from its sobriety and dignity please I better in hang the picture they should be place apart the style be so oppose that be they place near to each other they would mutually affect each other unfavorably ruben may be place in more obscurity but titian demand to be more in the light i have no time to add as i be prepare to leave florence on Monday for bologna and venice travel in italy in those day be fraught with many annoyance for in addition to the slow progress make in the _ vetture _ there seem to have be -lrb- judge from the journal -rrb- a _ dogana _ or custom-house every few mile where the luggage and clothing of traveller be examine sometimes hastily and courteously sometimes with more rigor and yet this leisurely rate of progress the traveller walk up most of the hill must have have a charm unknown to the present-day tourist who be whisk unsee through the most characteristic part of a foreign country the beautiful scenery of the apennine be in this way enjoy to the full by the artist but i shall not linger over the journey nor shall i include any note concern bologna he find the city most interesting -- a piece of porphyry set in verd antique -- and those to whom he have letter of introduction more hospitable than in any other city in italy from bologna the route lay through ferrara and then to pontelagoscuro on the river po where he be to take the courier boat for venice down the po and through a canal to add to the discomfort of this part of the trip it rain steadily for several day and on may 22 morse paint this dreary picture : -- when we wake this morning we find it still rain and apparently so to continue all day the rainy day at a country inn so exquisitely describe by irve in all its disagreeable feature be now before we a solitary inn with nothing indoors to attract cold and damp and dark the prospect from the window be a low muddy foreground the north bank of the muddy po a pile of brushwood a heap of offal a melancholy group of cattle who show no other sign of life than the occasional sly attack by one of they upon a poor drip half-starved dog who with tail between he leg now and then venture near they to search for he miserable meal beyond on the river a few bark silently lie upon the stream and on the opposite bank some building with a church and a campanile dimly see through the mist after coffee we be oblige to go to the _ dogana _ to see to the search of all we trunk and luggage the principal be present and we be not severely search a frenchman however who have come on a little before we be strip to he skin some papers be find upon he and i understand he have make he escape and they be now search for he at 230 after have dine we wade through the mud in a pelting rain to the _ dogana _ for we luggage and after get completely wet we embark on board the courier boat with a cabin seven foot long six foot wide and six high into which six of we have a gentleman from trieste and he mother add to we number be crowd with no bed rain rain rain in torrent cold and dreary through a perfectly flat country at ten o ` clock we arrive at a place call cavanellum where be a _ locanda _ upon the canal which should have be open to receive we but they be all asleep and no call would rouse they so we be oblige to go supperless to bed and such abed there be no room to spread mattress for six in the cabin three dirty mattress without sheet or blanket be lay on the floor of the forward cabin -lrb- if it might so be call -rrb- this cabin be a hole down into which two or three step lead we could not stand upright -- indeed kneel we head touch the top -- and when stretch at full length the tallest of we could touch with he head and foot from side to side but it be dreary and damp without and we be sleepy we consider not the place nor its inconvenience nor its little pest which annoy we all night nor its vicinity to a magazine of cheese with which the boat be laden and the odor from which assail we we lay down in we clothes and sleep the rain pattering above we head only cause we to sleep the sounder continue they leisurely journey in this primitive manner the rain finally cease but the sky remain overcast and the weather cold and wintry they reach chioggium and at 1130 the tower and spire of venice be see at a distance before we rise from the sea venice of course be a delight to morse 's eye but he nose be affect quite differently for he say : those that have reside in venice a long time say it be not a unhealthy place i can not believe it for the odor from the canal can not but produce illness of some kind that which be constantly offensive to any of we organ of sense must affect they injuriously several severe thunderstorm break over the city while he be there and one be say to be the worst which have be know within the memory of the oldest inhabitant after describe it he add : i be at the academy the rain penetrate through the ceiling at the corner of the picture i be copying -- ` the miracle of the slave ' by tintoret -- and threaten injury to it but happily it escape on June 19 he thus moralize : the piazza of st mark be the great place of resort and on every evening but especially on sunday or _ festa _ the arcade and cafés be crowd with elegantly dress female and they gallant chair be place in great number under the awning before the cafés a people that have no home who be deprive from policy of that domestic and social intercourse which we enjoy must have recourse to this empty heartless enjoyment a indolent enjoyment when all they intercourse too be in public surround by police agent and soldier to prevent excess hallam in he ` middle age ' have this just reflection on the condition of this same city when under the council of ten : ` but how much more honorable be the wildest excess of faction than the stillness and moral degradation of servitude ' quiet be indeed obtain here but at what immense expense expense of wealth although excessive be nothing compare with the expense of morality and of all intellectual exercise on June 23 he witness another thunderstorm from the piazza of st mark : -- the lightning flash in the dark cloud that be gather from the tyrolese alp portend another storm which soon burst over we and hasten the conclusion of the music the lightning be incessant i stand at the corner of the piazza and watch the splendid effect of light and dark in a moment come and in a moment go on the campanile and church of st mark 's it be most sublime the gilt statue of the angel on the top of the campanile never look so sublime seem to be envelop in the glory of the vivid light and as the electric fluid flash behind it from cloud to cloud incessantly it seem to go and come at the bidding of the angel this sound almost like a prophetic vision write by the pencil of the man who in a few year from then be to make the lightning go and come at he bidding _ July 4 _ this anniversary of the day of we national birth find but two american in venice we meet in the evening over a cup of coffee and thought and talk of the happiest of country we have no patriotic toast but the sentiment of we heart be -- ` peace be within thy wall and prosperity within thy palace ' never on any anniversary of we independence have i feel so strongly the great reason i have for gratitude in have be bear in such a country when i think of the innumerable blessing we enjoy over every other country in the world i be constrain to praise god who have make we to differ for ` he have not deal so with any nation and as for he judgment we have not know they ' while pestilence and famine and war surround I here in these devoted country i fix my thought on one bright spot on earth truly -lrb- if we too ungrateful countryman would but see it -rrb- truly a terrestrial paradise this attack of nostalgia be probably largely due to atmospheric condition for at least one thunderstorm seem to have be a matter of daily occurrence this add to the noisome odor arise from the canal affect he health for he complain of feel more unwell than at any time since he leave home it must therefore have be with no feeling of great regret that he pack he belongings and prepare to leave venice with a companion mr ferguson of natchez on the 18th of July he objective point be paris but he plan to linger by the way and take a leisurely course through the italian lake region switzerland and germany the notebook give a detailed but rather dry account of the daily happening it be presumably morse 's intention to elaborate these at some future day into a more entertaining record of he wanderings but this be never do i shall therefore pass on rapidly touch but lightly on the incident of the journey which be in the main without special interest the route lay through padua vicenza verona and brescium to milan from vicenza a side trip be make to the watering-place of recoaro where a few day be most delightfully spend in the company of the english consul at venice mr money and he family recoaro like all watering-place be begin to be the resort of the fashionable world the grand duchess of tuscany be now here and on Saturday the vice-queen of italy be expect from milan to visit she aunt the grand duchess towards evening party of lady and gentleman be see promenade or ride on donkey along the brow of the mountain and among the tree and many priest be see disfigure the landscape with they tasteless uncouth dress most of they come i be inform on the best authority for the purpose of gambling and dissipate that time of which from the trifling nature of they duty and the almost countless increase of they number they have so much to spare card have the most fascination for they another incident of the stay at recoaro be worth record refer to the family of mr money he say : -- in the afternoon take a excursion on donkey with the whole family among the wild and romantic scenery in return while ride by the side of mr money and in conversation with he my donkey stumble upon he knee and throw I over he head without injury to I but mr money who be just before I see the accident be near fainting and during the rest of the day be invisible i be somewhat surprise at the effect produce on she until i learn that the news of the loss of she son in indium by a fall from he horse which have recently reach she have render she nerve peculiarly sensitive two day later however he join they in another excursion on return we stop to take tea at mr ireland 's lodgings a english lady who be here with she two daughter accomplish and highly agreeable people i be tell by they that after i leave rome a most diabolical attempt be make to poison the english artist who have make a party to grotto ferra they be mistake by the person who attempt the deed for german they all become exceedingly ill immediately after dinner and as the wine be the only thing they have take there have bring they food with they it be suspect and a strong solution of copper be prove to be in it i be tell that messr gibson and desoulavy suffer a great deal the latter be confine to he bed for three week have i be in rome it be more than probable i should have be of they party for i have never visit grotto ferra and the company of those with whom i have associate would have induce I to join they without a doubt morse enjoy he stay at recoaro so much that he be persuade by he hospitable friend to prolong he visit for a few day longer than he have plan but on July 27 he and he friend mr ferguson bid adieu and proceed on they journey verona and brescium be visit and on July 29 they come to milan the cathedral he find a most gorgeous building far exceed my conception of it and of the beautiful street of the corso porta orientale he say : it be wider than broadway and as superior as white marble palace be to red brick house there be a opinion prevalent among some of we good citizen that broadway be not only the longest and widest but the most superbly build street in the world the sooner they be undeceived the better broadway be a beautiful street a very beautiful street but it be absurd to think that we brick house of twenty-five foot front with plain door and window build by contract in two or three month and hold together long enough to be let can rival the spacious stone palace of hundred of foot in length with lofty gate and balconied window and they foundation deeply lay and slowly construct to last for age this be of course when broadway even below fourteenth street be a residence street attend service in the cathedral on Sunday and be as usual wearied by the monotony and apparent insincerity of it all he again give vent to he feeling : -- how admirably contrived be every part of the structure of this system to take captive the imagination it be a religion of the imagination all the art of the imagination be press into its service architecture painting sculpture music have lend all they charm to enchant the sens and impose on the understanding by substitute for the solemn truth of god 's word which be address to the understand the fiction of poetry and the delusion of feel the theater be a daughter of this prolific mother of abomination and a child worthy of its dam the lesson of morality be pretend to be teach by both and much in the same way by scenic effect and pantomime and the fruit be much the same i be sometimes even constrain to doubt the lawfulness of my own art when i perceive its prostitution be i not fully persuade that the art itself when use for its legitimate purpose be one of the greatest correcter of grossness and promoter of refinement i have be lead since i have be in italy to think much of the propriety of introduce picture into church in aid of devotion i have certainly every inducement to decide in favor of the practice do i consult alone the seeming interest of art that picture may and do have the effect upon some rightly to raise the affection i have no doubt and abstractly consider the practice would not merely be harmless but useful but know that man be lead astray by he imagination more than by any of he other faculty i consider it so dangerous to he best interest that i have rather sacrifice the interest of the art if there be any collision than run the risk of endanger those compare with which all other be not for a moment to be consider but more of this another time i have introduce here and at other time morse 's stricture on the roman catholic religion and on other subject without comment on my part even when these stricture seem to verge on illiberality my desire be to present a true portrait of the man with the shadow as well as the light duly emphasize fully realize that what may appear fault to some to other will shine out as virtue and _ vice versa _ from milan morse and he companion plan to cross the mountain to geneva but have a day or two to spare they visit the lake of como which as be to be expect satisfied the eye of the artist : it be shut in by mountain on either side remind I of the scenery of lake george to which its shore be very similar in the transparency of the water however lake george be its superior and in island also but in all thing else the lake of como must claim the precedence the palace and villa and village which skirt its shore the mountain vine-clad and cultivate to they summit all give a charm for which we look in vain as yet in we country the luxury of art have combine with those of nature in a wonderful degree in this enchanting spot on August 4 they leave milan in the diligence for lago maggiore and we learn that : we coach be accompany by _ gendarme _ we enquire the reason of the conductor who be in the coach with we he tell we that the road be a unsafe one that every day there be instance of robbery perpetrate upon those who travel alone -lrb- illustration : henry clay paint by morse now in the metropolitan museum new york -rrb- it would be pleasant to follow the traveller through beautiful maggiore and up the rugged pass from italy to switzerland and thence to germany and pari and to see through the unspoiled eye of a enthusiast the beauty of that playground of the nation but it would be but the repetition of a oft-told tale and i must hasten on make but a few extract from the diary no thrilling adventure be meet with except towards the end but they enjoy to the full the grand scenery the picturesque costume of the peasant and the curious custom of the different country through which they pass the weather be sometimes fine but more often overcast or rainy and we find this note on August 15 : how much do a traveller 's impression depend upon the weather and even on the time of day in which he see object he see most of the country through which he travel but once and it be the face which any point assume at that one moment which be bring to he recollection if it be under a gloomy atmosphere it be not possible that he should remember it under other form or aspect on Sunday August 28 he watch the sunrise from the summit of the rigus under ideal condition and after describe the scene and say that the rest of the company have go back to bed he add : -- i have find too little comfort in the wretched thing that have be provide for I in the shape of a bed to desire to return thither and i also feel too strongly the emotion which the scene i have just witness have excite to wish for they dissipation in troubled dream if there be a feeling ally to devotion it be that which such a scene of sublimity as this we have just witness inspire and yet that feeling be not devotion i be aware that it be but the emotion of taste it may exist without a particle of true religious feeling or it may coexist and add strength to it there be thousand probably who have here have they emotion of taste excite without one thought of that be by whom these wonder be create one thought of they relation to he of they duty to he or of admiration at that unmerited goodness which allow they to be witness of he majesty and power as exhibit in these wonder of nature shut out as i be by circumstance from the privilege of this day in public worship i have yet on the top of this mountain a place of private worship such as i have not have for some time past i be alone on the mountain with such a scene spread before I that i must adore and weak indeed must be that faith which on this day in such a scene do not lift the heart from nature up to nature 's god on August 30 on the road to zurich he make this rather interesting observation : we notice in a great many instance that wire be attach to the electric rod and conduct to post near the house when a chime of bell be so arrange as to ring in a highly charge state of the atmosphere -lrb- franklin 's experiment -rrb- journey on past schaffhausen where the beautiful fall of the rhine fill he with admiration he and he companion come to heidelberg and explore the ruin of the stupendous castle here he part with he travel companion mr ferguson who go on to frankfort which city morse avoid because the french government have establish a strict quarantine against it on account of some epidemic the nature of which be not disclose in the note he be eager to get to paris now and wish to avoid all delay _ September 7 _ i engage my passage in the diligence for mannheim and for the first time since i have be in europe set out alone i learn from the gentleman in the coach that the _ cordon sanitaire _ in france be to be enforce with great rigor from the 11th of September i hope therefore to get into france before that date _ September 10 saarbruck _ we last night take we place for metz not know however or even think it probable that we should be able to get there it be hint by some that a small _ douceur _ would enable we to pass the _ cordon _ but how to be apply i know not among we passenger who join I yesterday be a young german officer who be the only one who could speak french with he i contrived to converse during the day we have bed in the same room and as we be about retire he tell I as i understand he that by give the key of my luggage to the coachman in the morning the business of pass at the _ douane _ on the frontier would be facilitate i assent and tell he as he understand the language better than i i leave it to he to make any arrangement and i would share the expense with he we be call sometime before day and i leave my bed very reluctantly the morning be cloudy and dark and so far favorable to the enterprise we be about to undertake and of the nature and plan of which i have not the slightest suspicion we be soon settle in the diligence and leave saarbruck for the frontier i compose myself to sleep and have just get into a doze when suddenly the coach stop and the door open a man touch I say in a low voice -- ' _ descendez monsieur descendez _ ' i ask the reason but get no answer my companion and i alighted there be no house near a bright streak in the east under the heavy black cloud show that it be just daybreak and ahead of we in the road a great light from the window of a long building show we the place of the hospital of the _ cordon _ we guide for so he prove to be take the knapsack of my companion and a basket of mine in which i carry my portfolio and map strike off to the leave into a newly plough field while we carriage proceed at a quick pace onward again i ask where we be go but get no other reply than ' _ doucement monsieur _ ' it then for the first time flash across my mind that we have undertake a unlawful and very hazardous enterprise that of run by the _ cordon _ i have now however no alternative i must follow for i know not what other course to take after pass through plough field and wet grass and grain for some time a small by-path cross from the main road we guide beckon we back while he go forward each way to see that all be clear and then we cross and proceed again over plough field and through the clover it now begin to rain which disagreeable as it be i do not regret all thing consider we soon come to another and wider cross-path we stop and we guide go forward again in the same cautious manner stoop down and listen like a indian near the ground he beckon we to cross over and again we traverse the field pass by the base of a small hill when as we softly creep up the side we see the form of a sentinel against the light of the sky we guide whisper ' _ doucement _ ' again and we gently retreat my companion whisper to I ' _ très dangèreux monsieur très désagréable _ ' we take a wider circuit behind some small building and at length come into one of the smaller street in the outskirts of forbach here be what appear to I barrack the caution be give to walk softly and separately -lrb- we be all fortunately in dark clothes -rrb- we guide pass first round the corner and have pass the sentry-box in which with one exception we see no person and in this instance the sentinel do not hail we -lrb- but this be in the city -rrb- we come to a house at the window of which we guide tap a man open it and after some explanation ascertain who we be open the door and strike a light set some wine and bread before we here we remain for some time to recover breath after we perilous adventure for if one of the sentinel have see we we should in all probability have be instantly shoot i know not that we be now entirely free from the danger of be arrest until we hear we carriage in the street and have ascertain that all we luggage have pass the _ douane _ without suspicion we pay we guide eight franc each and take we seat again in the carriage drive forward toward metz there be no further adventure although they tremble with anxiety every time they passport be call for morse regret have be innocently lead into this escapade and would have make a clean breast of it to the police as he have not be near frankfort but he fear to compromise he travel companion who have come from that city on September 12 they finally arrive in paris how change be the circumstance of this city since i be last here nearly two year ago a traitor king have be drive into exile blood have flow in its street the price of its liberty we friend the nation 's guest whom i then see at he house with apparently little influence and out of favor with the court the great lafayette be now second only to the king in honor and influence as the head of a powerful party these and a thousand other kindred reflection relate also to my own circumstance crowd upon I at the moment of again enter this famous city chapter xix September 18 1831 -- September 21 1832 take room with horatio greenough -- political talk with lafayette -- riot in paris -- letter from greenough -- bunker hill monument -- letter from fenimore cooper -- cooper 's portrait by verboeckhoven -- european criticism -- reminiscence of rw habersham

visit london before sailing for home -- sit to leslie for head of sterne the diary be not continue beyond this time and be never seriously resume so that we must now depend on letter to and from morse on fugitive note or on the reminiscence of other for a record of he life the first letter which i shall introduce be write from pari to he brother on September 18 1831 : -- i arrive safely in this city on Monday noon in excellent health and spirit my last letter to you be from venice just as i be about to leave it quite debilitate and unwell from application to my painting but more i believe from the climate from the perpetual sirocco which reign uninterrupted for week i have not time now to give you a account of my most interesting journey through lombardy switzerland part of germany and through the eastern part of france i find on my arrival here my friend mr greenough the sculptor who have come from florence to model the bust of general lafayette and we be in excellent convenient room together within a few door of the good general i call yesterday on general lafayette early in the morning the servant tell I that he be oblige to meet the polish committee at a early hour and fear he could not see I i send in my card however and the servant return immediately say that the general wish to see I in he chamber i follow he through several room and enter the chamber the general be in dishabille but with he characteristic kindness he run forward and seize both my hand express with great warmth how glad he be to see I safely return from italy and appear in such good health he then tell I to be seat and without any ceremony begin familiarly to question I about my travels etc the conversation however soon turn upon the absorb topic of the day the fate of poland the news of the fall of warsaw have just be receive by telegraphic dispatch i ask he if there be now any hope for poland he reply : ` oh yes they cause be not yet desperate they army be safe but the conduct of france and more especially of england have be most pusillanimous and culpable have the english government show the least disposition to coalesce in vigorous measure with france for the assistance of the pole they would have achieve they independence ' the general look better and younger than ever there be a healthy freshness of complexion like that of a young man in full vigor and he frame and step -lrb- allow for he lameness -rrb- be as firm and strong as when he be we nation 's guest i sit with he ten or fifteen minute and then take my leave for i feel it a sin to consume any more of the time of a man engage as he be in great plan of benevolence and whose every moment be therefore invaluable the news of the fall of warsaw be now agitate pari to a degree not know since the trial of the ex-minister about three o'clock we servant tell we that there be fight at the palais royal and we determine to go as far as we prudently could to see the tumult we proceed down the rue saint-honoré there be evident agitation in the multitude that fill the sidewalk -- a apprehension of something to be dread there be group at the corner the window be fill person look out as if in expectation of a procession or of some fête the shop begin to be shut and every now and then the drum be hear beat to arm the troops be assemble and body of infantry and cavalry be move through the various street during this time no noise be hear from the people -- a mysterious silence be observe but they be move by the slightest breath if one walk quicker than the rest or suddenly stop thither the enquire look and step be direct and a group instantly assemble at the palais royal a larger crowd have collect and a greater body of troops be march and countermarch in the place du palais royal the palais royal itself have the interior clear and all the court everything in this place of perpetual gayety be now desolate even the fountain have cease to play and the sear autumnal leaf of the tree some already fall seem congruous with the sentiment of the hour most of the shop be also shut and the stall desert still there be no outcry and no disturbance pass through the rue vivienne the same collection of crowd and of troops be see some be read a police notice just post on the wall design to prevent the riotous assemble of the people and advise they to retire when the riot act should be read the notice be read with murmur and groan and i have scarcely ascertain its contents before it be tear from the wall with acclamation as night approach we strike into the boulevard de la madeleine at the corner of this boulevard and the rue des capucine be the hotel of general sebastianus we find before the gate a great and increase crowd we take a position on the opposite corner in such a place as secure a safe retreat in case of need but allow we to observe all that pass here there be a evident intention in the crowd of do some violence nor be it at all doubtful what would be the object of they attack they seem to wait only for the darkness and for a leader the sight of such a crowd be fearful and its movement as it be sway by the incident of the moment be in the highest degree exciting a body of troops of the line would pass the crowd would silently open for they passage and close immediately behind they a body of the national guard would succeed and these would be receive with loud cheer and gratulation a soldier on guard would exercise a little more severity than be perhaps necessary for the occasion yell and execration and hiss would be he reward night have now set in heavy dark cloud with a misty rain have make the heaven above more dark and gloomy a man rush forward toward the gate hurl he hat in the air and follow by the crowd which suddenly form into long line behind he i now look for something serious a body of troops be in line before the gate at this moment two police officer on horseback in citizen ' dress but with a tricolored belt around they body ride through the crowd and up to the gate and in a moment after i perceive the multitude from one of the street rush in wild confusion into the boulevard and the current of the people set back in all direction while wonder at the cause of this sudden movement i hear the trampling of horse and a large band of carabinier with they bright helmet glitter in the light of the lamp dash down the street and draw up before the gate the police officer put themselves at they head and harangue the people the address be receive with groan the _ carabinier _ draw they sword order be give for the charge and in a instant they dash down the street the people disperse like the mist before the wind the charge be make down the opposite sidewalk from that where we have place ourselves so i keep my station and when they return up the middle of the street to charge on the other side i cross over behind they and avoid they i have give enough of this letter to show that morse be still surround by danger of various sort and it be also a good pen-picture of the irresponsible action of a cowardly mob especially of a parisian mob the letter which pass between morse and he friend jame fenimore cooper the novelist and horatio greenough the sculptor be most interesting and would of themselves fill a volume both cooper and greenough write fluently and entertainingly and i shall select a few characteristic sentence from the letter of each resist the strong temptation to include the whole correspondence greenough return to florence after have room with morse in pari and write as follow from there : -- as for the commission from government i do not speak of it yet after about a fortnight i shall be calm i think morse i have make up my mind on one score namely that this order shall not be fruitless to the greater man who be now in we rear they be suck now and rock in cradle but i can hear the pung pung puffetty of they hammer and i be prophetic too we 'll see if yankee land can not muster some ten or a dozen of they in the course of as many year you be right i have hear of the resolution submit to congress etc mr cooper write I about it i have not much faith in congress however i will confess that when the spectre debt have lean over my pillow of late and smile ghastlily have ask if she and i be not intend as companion through life i snap my finger at she and tell she that brother jonathan talk of adopt I and that he will not have she of he household go to london you hag say i where they say you be handsome and wholesome do not grind you long tooth at I or i 'll read the declaration of independence to ye so you see i make uncertain hope fight certain fear and borrow from the generous good-natured future the motive for content which be deny I by the stinted present what shall i say in answer to you remark on my opinion shall i go all over the ground again it be useless that my heart be wrong in a thousand way i daily feel but ' t be my stubborn head which refuse to comprehend the creation as you comprehend it that we should be grateful for all we have i feel -- for all we have be give we nor do i think we have little for my part i would be bless in mere existence be i not goad by a wish to make my one talent two and we have scripture for the rectitude of such a wish i do not think the stubborn resistance of the tide of ill-fortune can be call rebellion against providence help yourself and heaven will help you say the proverb there hang before I a print of the bunker hill monument pray be judge between I and the building committee of that monument there you observe that my model be found solidly and on each of its square plinth be trophy or group or cannon as might be think fit -lrb- no i -rrb- well they have take away the foundation make the shaft start sheer from the dirt like a spear of asparagus and instead of a acute angle by which i hope to show the work be do and lead off the eye they have make a obtuse one produce the broken-chimney-like effect which you eye will not fail to condemn in no ii then they have enclose theirs with a light elegant fence _ à la parigina _ as though the austere form of egypt be compatible with the decorative flummery of the boulevard let 'em go for dunderhead as they be i congratulate you on you sound conscience with regard to the affair that you wot of as for you remain free that be all very well to think during the interregnum but a man without a true love be a ship without ballast a one-tined fork half a pair of scissors a utter flash in the pan so you be go home my dear morse and god know if ever i shall see you again pardon i pray you anything of levity which you may have be offend at in I believe I it arise from my so rarely find one to whom i could be natural and give loose without fear of good faith or good nature ever fail wherever i be you approbation will be dearer to I than the hurrah of a world i shall write to glorious fenimore in a few day my love to allston and dana god bless you h greenough these extract be from different letter but they show i think the charming character of the man and reflect he admiration for morse from the letter of jame fenimore cooper write while they be both in europe i select the two follow as characteristic : July 31 1832 my dear morse -- here we be at spa -- the famous hard-drinking dissipate gambling intriguing spa -- where so much folly have be commit so many fortune squander and so many woman ruin how be the mighty fall we have just return from a ramble in the environs among desert reception-house and along silent road the country be not unlike ballston though less wood more cultivate and perhaps a little more varied i have have a great compliment pay I master samuel and as it be nearly the only compliment i have receive in travel over europe i be the more proud of it here be the fact you must know there be a great painter in brussels of the name of verboeckhoven -lrb- which translate into the vernacular mean a _ bull and a book baked in a oven _ -rrb- who be another paul potter he outdo all other man in draw cattle etc with a suitable landscape in he way he be truly admirable well sir this artist do I the favor to call at brussels with the request that i would let he sketch my face he come after the horse be order and know the difficulty of the task i thank he but be compel to refuse on we arrival at liège we be tell that a messenger from the governor have be to enquire for we and i begin to bethink I of my sin there be no great cause for fear however for it prove that mr bull-and-book-baked have place himself in the diligence come down to liège -lrb- sixty-three mile -rrb- and get the governor to give he notice by means of my passport when we come of course i sit i can not say the likeness be good but it have a vastly life-like look and be like all the other picture you have see of my chameleon face let that be as it will the compliment be none the less and provide the artist do not mean to serve I up as a specimen of american wild beast i shall thank he for it to be follow twelve post by a first-rate artist who be in favor with the king be so unusual that i be curious to know how far we mind be in unison and so i probe he a little i find he well skilled in he art of course but ignorant on most subject as respects we general view of man and thing there be scarcely a point in common for he have few salient quality though he be liberal but he gusto for natural subject be strong and he favorite among all my book be the prairie which you know be fill with wild beast here the secret be out that picture of animal nature have so catch he fancy that he follow I sixty mile to paint a sketch while this letter of cooper 's be write in lighter vein the follow extract from one write on August 19 show another side of he character : -- the criticism of which you speak give I no concern the heidenmauer be not equal to the bravo but it be a good book and better than two third of scott 's they may say it be like he if they please they have say so of every book i have write even the pilot but the heidenmauer be like and be intend to be like in order to show how differently a democrat and a aristocrat see the same thing as for french criticism they have never be able to exalt I in my own opinion nor to stir my bile for they be write with such evident ignorance -lrb- i mean of english book -rrb- as to be beneath notice what the deuce do i care whether my book be on they shelf or not what do i ever get from france or continental europe neither personal favor nor money but this they can not understand for so conceited be a frenchman that many of they think that i come to pari to be pay now i never get the difference in the boil of the pot between new york and pari in my life the journal des débats be snappish with water witch merve -lrb- -rrb- i believe with bravo and let it bark at heidenmauer and be hang no no more the humiliation come from home it be bite to find that accident have give I a country which have not manliness and pride to maintain its own opinion while it be overflow with conceit but never mind all this see that you do not decamp before my departure and i 'll promise not to throw myself into the rhine i hope the fourth of July be not break out in habersham 's noddle for i can tell he that be the place most affect during the dinner adieu yours as ever j fenimore cooper the mr habersham here jokingly refer to be rw habersham of augusta georgium who in the year 1831 be a art student in the _ atelier _ of baron gro and between whom and morse a friendship spring up they room together at a time when the cholera be rage in pari but owe to mr habersham 's wise insistence that all the occupant of the house should take a teaspoonful of charcoal every morning all escape the disease mr habersham in after year write and send to morse some of he reminiscence of that period and from these i shall quote the follow as be of more than ordinary interest : -- the louvre be always close on Monday to clean up the gallery after the popular exhibition of the painting on Sunday so that Monday be we day for visit excursion etc on one occasion i be leave alone and two or three time during the week he be absent this be unusual but i ask no question and make no remark but on Saturday evening sit by we evening lamp he seem lose in think till suddenly he remark : ` the mail in we country be too slow this french telegraph be better and would do even better in we clear atmosphere than here where half the time fog obscure the sky but this will not be fast enough -- _ the lightning would serve we better _ ' these may not be the exact word but they convey the sense and i laughing say : ` aha i see what you have be after you have be examine the french system of telegraph ' he admit that he have take advantage of the kind offer of one in authority to do so there be on one occasion another reference make to the conveyance of sound under water and to the length of time take to communicate the let in of the water into the erie canal by cannon shot to new york and other means during which the suggestion of use key and wire like the piano be reject as require too many wire if other thing be available i recollect also that in we frequent visit to mr j fenimore cooper 's in the rue st dominique these subject so interesting to american be often introduce and that morse seem to harp on they constantly refer to franklin and lord bacon now i while recognize the intellectual grandeur of both these man have contract a small opinion of they moral strength but morse would uphold and excuse or rather deny the fault attribute lord bacon especially he hold to have _ sacrifice himself to serve the queen in she aberration _ while of franklin ` the great american ' recognize by the french he be particularly proud cooper also remember some such hint of a telegraph make by morse at that time for in the sea lion -lrb- 1 -rrb- on page 161 he say : -- -lrb- footnote 1 : the riverside press 1870 -rrb- we pretend to no knowledge on the subject of the date of discovery in the art and science but well do we remember the earnestness and single-minded devotion to a laudable purpose with which we worthy friend first communicate to we he idea on the subject of use the electric spark by way of a telegraph it be in paris and during the winter of 1831-82 and the succeed spring and we have a satisfaction in record this date that other may prove better claim if they can curiously enough morse himself could in after year never remember have suggest at that time the possibility of use electricity to convey intelligence he always insist that the idea first come to he a few month later on he return voyage to america and in 1849 he write to mr cooper say that he must be mistake to which the latter reply under date of may 18 : -- for the time i still stick to pari so do my wife so do my eldest daughter you do no more than to throw out the general idea but i feel quite confident this occur in paris i confess i think the notion evidently chimerical and as such speak of it in my family i always set you down as a sober-minded common-sense sort of a fellow and think it a high flight for a painter to make to go off on the wing of the lightning we may be mistaken but you will remember that the priority of the invention be a question early start and my impression be the same much nearer to the time than it be to-day that the recollection of he friend be probably clearer than he own on this point be admit by morse in the follow letter : -- irve house new york September 5 1849 my dear sir -- i be agreeably surprise this morning in converse with professor renwick to find that he corroborate the fact you have mention in you sea lion respect the earlier conception of my telegraph by I than the date i have give and which go only so far back in my own recollection as 1832 professor renwick insist that immediately after professor dana 's lecture at the new york athenaeum i consult with he on the subject of the velocity of electricity and in such a way as to indicate to he that i be contrive a electric telegraph the consultation i remember but i do not recollect the time he will depose that it be before i go to europe after those lecture now i go in 1829 this make it almost certain that the impression you and mr cooper and you daughter have that i converse with you on the subject in 1831 after my return from italy be correct if you be still persuade that this be so you deposition before the commission in this city to that fact will render I a incalculable service i will cheerfully defray you expense to and from the city if you will meet I here this week or beginning of next in haste but with best respects to mr cooper and family i be dear sir as ever you friend and servant saml f b morse j fenimore cooper esq all this be interesting but of course have no direct bearing on the actual date of invention it be more than probable that morse do while he be study the french semaphore and at a even earlier date dream vaguely of the possibility of use electricity for convey intelligence and that he give utterance among he intimate to these dream but the practical means of so utilize this mysterious agent do not take shape in he mind until 1832 a inchoate vision of the possibility of use electricity be far different from a actual plan eventually elaborate into a commercial success another extract from mr habersham 's reminiscence on a totally different subject will be find interesting : i have forget to mention that one day while in the rue surenne i be study from my own face reflect in a glass as be often do by young artist when i remark how grand it would be if we could invent a method of fix the image on the mirror professor morse reply that he have think of it while a pupil at yale and that professor silliman -lrb- i think -rrb- and himself have try it with a wash of nitrate of silver on a piece of paper but that unfortunately it make the light _ dark _ and the shadow _ light _ but that if they could be reverse we should have a facsimile like india-ink drawing have they think of use glass as be now do the daguerreotype would have be perhaps anticipate -- certainly the photograph this be particularly interesting because as i shall note later on morse be one of the pioneer in experiment with the daguerreotype in america among the painting which morse execute while he be in paris be a very ambitious one this be a interior of one of the gallery in the louvre with carefully execute miniature copy of some of the most celebrated canvas write of it and of the dreadful epidemic of cholera to he brother on may 6 1832 he say : -- my anxiety to finish my picture and to return drive I i fear to too great application and too little exercise and my health have in consequence be so deranged that i have be prevent from the speedy completion of my picture from nine o'clock until four daily i paint uninterruptedly at the louvre and with the closest application i shall not be able to finish it before the close of the gallery on the 10th of August the time each morning before go to the gallery be wholly employ in preparation for the day and after the gallery close at four dinner and exercise be necessary so that i have no time for anything else the cholera be rage here and i can compare the state of mind in each man of we only to that of soldier in the heat of battle all the usual security of life seem to be go apprehension and anxiety make the stoutest heart quail any one feel when he lay himself down at night that he will in all probability be attack before daybreak for the disease be a pestilence that walketh in darkness and seize the greatest number of its victim at the most helpless hour of the night fifteen hundred be seize in a day and fifteen thousand at least have already perish although the official account will not give so many _ may 14 _ my picture make progress and i be sanguine of success if nothing interfere to prevent its completion i shall take no more commission here and shall only complete my large picture and a few unfinished work general lafayette tell I a few week ago when i be return with he in he carriage that the financial condition of the united state be a subject of great importance and he wish that i would write you and other who be know as statistical man and get you view on the subject there never be a better time for demonstrate the principle of we free institution by show a result favorable to we country among the man of note whom morse meet while he be in paris be baron alexander von humboldt the famous traveller and naturalist who be much attract towards the artist and often go to the louvre to watch he while he be at work or to wander through the gallery with he deep in conversation he be afterwards one of the first to congratulate morse on the successful exhibition of he telegraph before the french academy of science as we have already see morse be intensely patriotic he follow with keen interest the development in we national progress as they unroll themselves before he eye and when the occasion offer he take active part in further what he consider the right and in vigorously denounce the wrong he be never blind to we national or party failing but hold the mirror up before he countryman 's eye with steady hand and yet he be prouder of be a american than of anything else and as i have have occasion to remark before he ruling passion be a intense desire to accomplish some great good for he beloved country to raise she in the estimation of the rest of the world on the 4th of July 1832 he be call on to preside at the banquet give by the american resident in pari with mr cooper as vice-president general lafayette be the guest of honor and the american minister hon william c rive gw haven and many other be present morse in propose the toast to general lafayette speak as follow : -- i can not propose the next toast gentleman so intimately connect with the last without advert to the distinguished honor and pleasure we this day enjoy above the thousand and i may say hundred of thousand of we countryman who be at this moment celebrate this great national festival -- the honor and pleasure of have at we board we venerable guest on my right hand the hero whom two world claim as they own yes gentleman he belong to america as well as to europe he be we fellow citizen and the universal voice of we country would cry out against we do we not manifest we nation 's interest in he person and character with the maze of european politics we have nothing to do to change scheme of good or bad government we can not make ourselves a party with the success or defeat of this or that faction we can have no sympathy but with the great principle of rational liberty of civil and religious liberty those principle for which we guest fight by the side of we father and which he have steadily maintain for a long life ` through good report and evil report ' we do sympathize we should not be american if we do not sympathize with they nor can we compromise one of these principle and preserve we self-respect as loyal american citizen they be the principle of order and good government of obedience to law the principle which under providence have make we country unparalleled in prosperity principle which rest not in visionary theory but be make palpable by the sure test of experiment and time but gentleman we honor we guest as the stanch undeviating defender of these principle of we principle of american principle have he ever desert they have he ever be know to waver gentleman there be some man some too who would wish to direct public opinion who be like the buoy upon tide-water they float up and down as the current set this way or that if you ask at a emergency where they be we can not tell you we must first consult the almanac we must know the quarter of the moon the way of the wind the time of the tide and then we may guess where you will find they but gentleman we guest be not of this fickle class he be a tower amid the water he foundation be upon a rock he move not with the ebb and flow of the stream the storm may gather the water may rise and even dash above he head or they may subside at he foot still he stand unmoved we know he site and he bearing and with the fullest confidence we point to where he stand six-and-fifty year ago he stand there now the wind have sweep by he the wave have dash around he the snow of winter have light upon he but still he be there i ask you therefore gentleman to drink with I in honor of general lafayette portion of many of morse 's letter to he brother be publish in the new york observer own and edit by they part of the follow letter be so publish i believe but at mr cooper 's request the sentence refer to he personal sentiment be omit there can be no harm however in give they publicity at this late day the letter be write on July 18 1832 and begin by gently chide he brother for not have write to he for nearly four month and he conclude this part by say but what be past can not be help i be glad exceedingly glad to hear of you prosperity and hope it may be continue to you and then he say : -- i be diligently occupy every moment of my time at the louvre finish the great labor which i have there undertake i say ` finish ' i mean that part of it which can only be complete there namely the copy of the picture all the rest i hope to do at home in new york such as the frame of the picture the figure etc it be a great labor but it will be a splendid and valuable work it excite a great deal of attention from stranger and the french artist i have many compliment upon it and i be sure it be the most correct one of its kind ever paint for every one say i have catch the style of each of the master cooper be delighted with it and i think he will own it he be with I two or three hour at the gallery -lrb- the hour of he relaxation -rrb- every day as regularly as the day come i spend almost every evening at he house in he fine family cooper be very little understood i believe by we good people he have a bold original independent mind thoroughly american he love he country and she principle most ardently he know the hollowness of all the despotic system of europe and especially be he thoroughly conversant with the heartless false selfish system of great britain the perfect antipode of we own he fearlessly support american principle in the face of all europe and brave the obloquy and intrigue against he of all the european power i say all the european power for cooper be more read and therefore more fear than any american -- yes more than any european with the exception possibly of scott he work be translate into all the language of the continent edition of every work he publish be print in i think more than thirty different city and all this without any pain on he part he deal i believe with only one publisher in pari and one in london he never ask what effect any of he sentiment will have upon the sale of he work the only question he ask be -- ` be they just and true ' i know of no man short of a true christian who be so truly guide by high principle as cooper he be not a religious man -lrb- i wish from my heart he be -rrb- yet he be theoretically orthodox a great respecter of religion and religious man a man of unblemished moral character he be court by the greatest and the most aristocratic yet he never compromise the dignity of a american citizen which he contend be the highest distinction a man can have in europe and there be not a doubt but he command the respect of the exclusive here in a tenfold degree more than those who truckle and cringe to european opinion and custom they love a independent man and know enough of they own heartless system to respect a real freeman i admire exceedingly he proud assertion of the rank of a american -lrb- i speak from a political point of view -rrb- for i know no reason why a american should not take rank and assert it too above any of the artificial distinction that europe have make we have no aristocratic grade no title of nobility no ribbon and garter and cross and other gewgaw that please the great baby of europe be we therefore to take rank below or above they i say above they and i hope that every american who come abroad will feel that he be bind for he country 's sake to take that stand i do not mean ostentatiously or offensively or obtrusively but he ought to have a american self-respect there can be no _ condescension _ to a american a american gentleman be equal to any title or rank in europe king and emperor not except why be he not by what law be we bind to consider ourselves inferior because we have stamp _ folly _ upon the artificial and unjust grade of european system upon these antiquated remnant of feudal barbarism cooper see and feel the absurdity of these distinction and he assert he american rank and maintain it too i believe from a pure patriotism such a man deserve the support and respect of he countryman and i have no doubt he have they it be high time we should assume a more american tone while europe be leave no stone unturn to vilify and traduce we because the rotten despotism of europe fear we example and hate we you be not aware perhaps that the _ trollope _ system be political altogether you think that because we know the grossness of she libel and despise she abuse england and europe do the same you be mistaken they wish to know no good of we mr trollope 's book be more popular in england -lrb- and that too among a class who you fain would think know better -rrb- than any book of travels ever publish in america -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be also translate into french and will be puff and extol by france who be just enter upon the system of vilification of america and she institution that england have be pursue ever since we as colony resist she oppressive measure tory england aristocratic england be the same now towards we as she be then and tory france aristocratic france follow in she step we may deceive ourselves on this point by know the kindly feel manifest by religious and benevolent man towards each other in both country but we shall be want in we usual yankee penetration if the good feeling of these excellent and pious man shall lead we to think that they government or even the mass of they population be actuate by the same kindly regard no they hate we cordially hate we we should not disguise the truth and i will venture to say that no genuine american one who love he country and she distinctive principle can live abroad in any of the country of europe and not be thoroughly convince that europe as it be and america as it be can have no feeling of cordiality for each other -lrb- footnote 1 : this refer to mr france trollope 's book _ domestic manners of the american _ which create quite a stir in its day -rrb- america be the stronghold of the popular principle europe of the despotic these can not unite there can be at present no sympathy we need not quarrel with europe but we must keep ourselves aloof and suspect all she maneuver she have no good will towards we and we must not be dupe by she soft speech and fair word on the one side nor by she contemptible detraction on the other morse find time in spite of he absorption in he artistic work to interest himself and other in behalf of the pole who have unsuccessfully struggle to maintain they independence as a nation he be a active member of a committee organize to extend help to they and this committee be instrumental in obtain the release from imprisonment in berlin of dr sg howe who have be entrust with twenty thousand franc for the relief of the distressed pole in this work he be closely associate with general lafayette already he friend and they high regard for each other be further strengthened and result in a interchange of many letter some of these be give away by morse to friend desirous of possess autograph of the illustrious lafayette other be still among he papers and some of these i shall introduce in they proper chronological order the follow one be write on September 27 1832 from la grange : -- my dear sir -- i be sorry to see you will not take pari and la grange in you way to havre unless you be to wait for the packet of the 10th in company with general cadwalader commodore biddle and those young amiable philadelphian who contemplate sailing on that day but if you persist to go by the next packet i beg you here to receive my best wish and those of my family for you happy voyage upon you my dear sir i much depend to give we friend in the united state a proper explanation of the state of thing in europe you have be very attentive to what have pass since the revolution of 1830 much have be obtain here and in other part of europe in this whirlwind of a week further consequence here and in other country -- great britain and ireland include -- will be the certain result though they have be maul and betray where they ought to have receive encouragement but it will not be so short and so cheap as we have a right to anticipate it might be i think it useful on both side of the water to dispel the cloud which ignorance or design may throw over the real state of european and french politics in the mean while i believe it to be the duty of every american return home to let he fellow citizen know what wretched handle be make of the violent collision threat of a separation and reciprocal abuse to injure the character and question the stability of republican institution i too much depend upon the patriotism and good sense of the several party in the united state to be afraid that those dissension may terminate in a final dissolution of the union and should such a event be destine in future to take place deprecate as it have be by the best wish of the depart founder of the revolution -- washington at they head -- it ought at least in charity not to take place before the not remote period when every one of those who have fight and bleed in the cause shall have join they contemporary what be to be say of poland and the situation of she heroic unhappy son you well know have be a constant and zealous member of we committee you know what sort of mental perturbation among the ignorant part of every european nation have accompany the visit of the cholera in russium germany hungary and several part of great britain and france -- suspicion of poison prejudice against the politician and so forth i would tike to know whether the population of the united state have be quite free of these aberration as it would be a additional argument in behalf of republican institution and superior civilization result from they most truly and affectionately you friend lafayette as we see from the beginning of this letter morse have now determine to return home he have execute all the commission for copy which have be give to he and he ambitious painting of the interior of the louvre be so far finish that he could complete it at home he sail from havre on the 1st of October in the packetship sully the name of this ship have now become historic and a chance conversation in mid-ocean be destine to mark a epoch in human evolution before sailing however he make a fly trip to england and he write to he brother from london on September 21 : -- here i be once more in england and on the wing _ home _ i shall probably sail from havre in the packet of October 1 -lrb- the sully -rrb- and i shall leave london for southampton and havre on the 26th inst to be prepare for sailing i be visit old friend and renew old association in london twenty year make a vast difference as well in the aspect of this great city as in the face of old acquaintance london may be say literally to have go into the country where i once be accustom to walk in the field so far out of town as even to shoot at a target against the tree with impunity now there be spacious street and splendid house and garden i spend a good deal of my spare time with leslie he be the same amiable intelligent unassuming gentleman that i leave in 1815 he be paint a little picture -- ` sterne recover he manuscript from the curl of he hostess at lyon ' i have be sit to he for the head of sterne whom he think i resemble very strongly at any rate he have make no alteration in the character of the face from the one he have draw from sterne 's portrait and have simply attend to the expression when i leave paris i be feeble in health so much so that i be fearful of the effect of the journey to london especially as i pass through village suffer severely from the cholera but i proceed moderately lodge the first night at boulogne-sur-mer cross to dover in a severe southwest gale and pass the next night at canterbury and the next day come to london i think the ride do I good and i have be exercise a great deal ride and walk since and my general health be certainly improve i be in hope that the voyage will completely set I up again chapter xx morse 's life almost equally divide into two period artistic and scientific -- estimate of he artistic ability by daniel huntington -- also by samuel isham -- he character as reveal by he letter note etc -- end of volume i morse 's long life -lrb- he be eighty-one when he die -rrb- be almost exactly divide by the nature of he occupation into two equal period during the first up to he forty-first year he be wholly the artist enthusiastic fill with a laudable ambition to excel not only for personal reason but as appear from he correspondence largely from patriotic motive from a wish to rescue he country from the stigma of pure commercialism which it have incur in the eye of the rest of the world it be true that he active brain and warm heart spur he on to interest himself in many other thing in invention of more or less utility in religion politics and humanitarian project but next to he sincere religious faith he art hold chiefest sway and everything else be make subservient to that during the latter half of he life however a new goddess be enshrine in he heart a goddess whose cult entail even greater self-sacrifice keener suffer both mental and physical more humiliation to a proud and sensitive soul shrink alike from the jeer of the incredulous and the libel and plot of the envious and the unscrupulous while he ply he brush for many year after the conception of he epoch-making invention it be with a ever lessen enthusiasm with a divided interest art no longer reign supreme invention share the throne with she and eventually dispossess she it seem therefore fitting that in close the chronicle of morse the artist he rank in the annals of american art should be estimate as view by a contemporary and by the more impartial historian of the present day from a long article prepare by the late daniel huntington for mr prime i shall select the follow passage : -- my acquaintance with professor morse begin in the spring of 1835 when i be place under he care by my father as a pupil he then live in greenwich lane -lrb- now greenwich avenue -rrb- and several young man be study art under he instruction he give a short time every day to each pupil carefully point out we error and explain the principle of art after draw for some time from cast with the crayon he allow we to begin the use of the brush and we practice paint we study from the cast use black white and raw umber i believe this method be of great use in enable we early to acquire a good habit of painting i only regret that he do not insist on we stick to this kind of study a longer time and drill we more severely in it but he indulge we hankering for color too soon and when once we have taste the luxury of a full palette of color it be a dry business to go back to plain black and white in the autumn of that year 1835 he remove to spacious room in the new york university on washington square in the large studio in the north wing he paint several fine portrait among they the beautiful full-length of he daughter mr lind he also lecture before the student and a general audience illustrate he subject by paint diagram professor morse 's love of scientific experiment be show in he artist life he form theory of color try experiment with various vehicle oils varnish and pigment he studio be a kind of laboratory a beautiful picture of he wife and two child be paint he tell I with color ground in milk and the effect be juicy creamy and pearly to a degree another picture be commence with color mix with beer afterwards solidly impast and glaze with rich transparent tint in varnish he theory of color be fully explain in the account of he life in dunlap 's ` art of design ' he prove its truth by box and ball of various color he have a honest solid vigorous _ impasto _ which he strongly insist on in he instruction -- a method which be like the great master of the venetian school this method be modify in he practice by he study under west in england and by he intimacy with allston for whose genius he have a great reverence and by whose way of painting he be strongly influence he be a lover of simple unaffected truth and this trait be show in he work as a artist he have a passion for color and rich harmonious tint run through he picture which be glowing and mellow and yet pearly and delicate he have a true painter 's eye but he be hinder from reach the fame he genius promise as a painter by various distraction such as the early battle of the academy of design in its struggle for life domestic affliction and more than all the engrossing care of he invention -lrb- illustration : susan morse eldest daughter of the artist -rrb- the ` hercule ' with its colossal proportion and daring attitude be evidence of the zeal and courage of he early study it be worthy of be carefully preserve in a public gallery not only as a instance of successful study in a young artist -lrb- morse be in he twenty-first year -rrb- but as possess high artistic merit and a force and richness which plainly show that if he energy have not be divert he might have achieve a name in art equal to the greatest of he contemporary professor morse 's world-wide fame rest of course on he invention of the electric telegraph but it should be remember that the quality of mind which lead to it be develop in the progress of he art study and if he painting in the various field of history portrait and landscape could be bring together it would be find that he deserve a honor place among the foremost american artist this be a estimate of morse 's ability as a painter by a man of he own day a friend and pupil as this would naturally be somewhat bias it will be more to the point to see what a competent critic of the present day have to say mr samuel isham in he authoritative history of american painting publish in 1910 after give a brief biographical sketch of morse and tell why he come to abandon the brush thus sum up : -- it be a serious loss for morse without be a genius be yet perhaps better calculate than another to give in picture the spirit of the difficult time from 1830 to 1860 he be a man sound in mind and body well bear well educate and both by birth and education in sympathy with he time he have be abroad have see good work and receive sound training he ideal be not too far ahead of he public working as he do under widely vary condition he painting be dissimilar not only in merit but in method of execution even he portrait vary from thin free handling to solid _ impasto _ yet in the best of they there be a real painter 's feeling for he material the head have a soundness of construction and a freshness in the carnation that recall raeburn rather than west the pose be graceful or interesting the costume be skilfully arrange and in addition he understand perfectly the character of he sitter the man and woman of the transition period shrewd capable but rather commonplace without the ponderous dignity of copley 's subject or the cosmopolitan grace of a later day the struggle incident to the invention and development of telegraphy turn morse from the practice of art but up to the end of he life he be interested in it and aggressive in any scheme for its advancement i think that from the letter note etc which i have in the precede page bring together a clear conception of morse 's character can be form the dominant note be a almost childlike religious faith a triumphant trust in the goodness of god even when he hand be wield the rod a sincere belief in the literal truth of the bible which may seem strange to we of the twentieth century a conviction that he be destine in some way to accomplish a great good for he fellow man next to love of god come love of country he be patriotic in the best sense of the word while abroad he stoutly uphold the honor of he native land and at home he throw himself with vigor into the political discussion of the day fight stoutly for what he consider the right while sometimes in the light of future event he seem to have err in allow he religious belief to tinge too much he political view he be always perfectly sincere and never permit expediency to brush aside conviction we have see that wherever he go he have the faculty of inspiring respect and affection and that a ever widen circle of friend admit he to they intimacy seek he advice and confide in he with the perfect assurance of he ready sympathy a favorite bible quotation of he be woe unto you when all man shall speak well of you he deeply deplore the necessity of make enemy but he early in he career become convinced that no man could accomplish anything of value in this world without run counter either to the opinion of honest man who be as sincere as he or to the self-seeking of the dishonest and the unscrupulous up to this time he have have mainly to deal with the former class as in he successful effort to establish the national academy of design on a firm footing but in the future he be destine to make many and bitter enemy of both class in the controversy which ensue he always strive to be courteous and just even when vigorously defend he rights or take the offensive that he sometimes err in he judgment can not be deny but the error be honest and in many case be kindle and fan into a flame by the crafty malice of third party for they own pecuniary advantage so now have follow he in he career as a artist which discourage and trouble as it may often have seem to he be as the calm which precede the storm to the year of privation and heroic struggle which follow i shall bring this first volume to a close end of volume i end of the project gutenberg
