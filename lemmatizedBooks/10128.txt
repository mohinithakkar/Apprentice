upon society break out in 1846 over the admission of texa to the united state the superior fighting strength of the more northern race be at once make evident small body of united state troops

year gold be discover in californium thousand of eager adventurer flock thither and thus the vast wilderness that mexico have lightly surrender have hardly become united state territory ere it be fill with people not listless semi-savage but eager energetic man resolute and resourceful the west join the march of progress it double the wealth and prowess of the east -lrb- footnote : see _ discovery of gold in californium _ -rrb- the uprising of the people important indeed be that year of 1848 noteworthy above most in the story of mankind in europe it witness the greatest of all the outburst of democracy the common people easily suppress by the army of the holy alliance in 1820 have be subdue with difficulty in 1830 now in 1848 they rise again they gradual accumulation of power and passion would soon be irresistible even the pet army of autocracy become possess with the new belief in mankind 's brotherhood this time the outburst begin in italy mazzinus the celebrated founder of the political society young italy inspire he countryman with something of he own ardent devotion to the cause of liberty and italian union then in 1846 pius ix last of the head of the roman church to possess a temporal authority as well ascend the throne of the papal dominion the new pope be in sympathy with the democratic spirit of the time and he establish in he own state a constitutional government grant to he people more and more of power as he judge they fit for it soon however the most radical element assert themselves in the new government all that the pope could find it in he heart to grant seem to they not half enough the mighty spirit which he have let loose break from he control before the close of 1848 there be riot fight in the street the pope 's chief counsellor be murder and he himself have to flee by night in secrecy a fugitive from rome -lrb- footnote : see _ the reform of pius ix : he flight from rome _ -rrb- ere matter have reach this pass the sudden impulse give by rome to democratic government have spread like wildfire over the whole of europe throne everywhere seem crumble to the dust in January 1848 the people of sicily revolt against they tyrant king and form a republic southern italy which have be part of the same kingdom compel the sovereign to grant a constitution other italian state follow the example of rebellion all europe apparently have be but wait for the spark in france dissatisfaction with the tradesman-king loui philippe have long be bitter in February 1848 there be a open rebellion loui abdicate and a provisional government be form which proclaim the land a republic -lrb- footnote : see _ the revolution of February in france _ -rrb- there be no fear now lest the other power interfere each continental monarch be over-busy at home rebellion be everywhere every one of the lesser german state secure a constitution and the inhabitant summon those of prussium and austrium to join they in establish a single central government either republic or empire a unite germany on march 18th the prussian capital berlin be the seat of a savage street battle between citizen and the royal troops not until it have rage all day and upward of two hundred person have be slay do the prussian monarch frederick william iv weaken and proclaim a constitution -lrb- footnote : see _ revolutionary movement in germany _ -rrb- austria the stronghold of autocracy the land of prince metternich high-priest of repression have prove as little ready as she neighbor to withstand the sudden storm on march 13th the people of vienna rise in most unexpected revolt and metternich escape from the city in a washerwoman 's cart flee to england we be prepare for everything he lament but a democratic pope the whole heterogeneous empire of austrium seem to fall apart at once the hungarian rise in arm to fight for independence the bohemian expel the austrian troops from prague in italy the northern province follow the example set they in the south the people of milan attack the austrian garrison and expel it after four day of fight venice reassert she ancient independence the king of piedmont and sardinium declare himself the champion of italian unity order the austrian army to leave the country and march he force against they the other little state hasten to accept he leadership and add they troops to he yet against all these difficulty the military power of the austrian government begin to make determine headway the bohemian be crush by force of arm in italy the austrian general-in-chief withdraw slowly before he many foe until he government could reënforce he then he turn on they completely defeat the sardinian king at custozza and the next year at novara and therby restore austrian supremacy in northern italy meanwhile rome from which pius ix have flee in horror proclaim itself a republic mazzinus the earliest hero of italian unity and garibaldi its greatest champion be both member of the government the austrian march against they but french troops have also be despatch to defend the pope and it be the french who first reach rome storm and capture it the republic be overthrow by a republic -lrb- footnote : see _ rise and fall of the roman republic _ -rrb- venice be the last italian city to hold out and surrender to the austrian only after a siege of many month have reduce it to starvation the austrian revolution have also collapse at home in October 1848 government troops storm the city of vienna as if it have be a foreign capital and defeat the student and citizen who fight the soldier from street to street only in hungary be the royal army baffle there a regular republican government be establish under loui kossuth hungarian army be raise and defeat the austrian in pitched battle drive they from the land the austrian emperor in despair appeal to russia for aid and the czar have just trample out a incipient polish rebellion of he own come willingly to the aid of he brother autocrat just as austrian troops have so often do in italy so now a huge russian horde pour over hungary beat down all resistance and have reduce the land to helplessness return it to the angry grip of its insult sovereign -lrb- footnote : see _ the revolt of hungary _ -rrb- yet hungary do not wholly fail of she revenge she have bring about the downfall of austrium as a great political power the once haughty empire have be compel to cry for help to be protect even as be italy and spain against she own people she weakness be make manifest to the world never again could she pose as the leader of european council thus it be only in france and germany that the result of the upheaval of 1848-1849 remain evident upon the surface prussium and the lesser german state become and continue constitutional kingdom germany be unite in a closer though still vague union in which austrium and prussium struggle for a dominant influence but democracy have in many place commit such excess that the huge body of the middle class fear it and turn against it such citizen as have property to preserve conclude that after all they ancient king have be less tyrannic than king mob in france too this reaction be strongly feel the revolution of 1848 have not be accomplish without a outburst from socialism or communism which raise its red flag in the street of pari and be put down only after day of bloody battle with the more moderate element so the french middle class want peace and they elect as president of the republic loui napoleon nephew of they once famous emperor in 1851 the president by a sudden _ coup d'etat _ overturn he own government he declare the land a empire under himself as napoleon iii enthusiastic patriot protest in burn word but most of france appear content property-owner welcome the return of any government that be strong enough to govern -lrb- footnote : see _ the coup d'etat _ -rrb- despite temporary setback however the advance of the power of the people in 1848 have be enormous the dullest tyrant could hardly believe longer in the permanence of personal despotism even england the stronghold of conservatism as well as of personal independence be shift she aristocratic institution slowly toward democracy the reform bill of 1832 have be only a small step in the direction of popular government but it open the way for further reform almost immediately upon its grant begin what be know as the chartist movement a agitation keep up among the lower class for a charter or more liberal constitution this soon become associate with a demand for freer trade the importation into england of bread-stuff especially corn be heavily tax and thus the poorer class be drive almost to the point of famine the failure of the potato crop do at last produce actual and awful famine in ireland she peasant still speak of 1847 as the black year of death -lrb- footnote : see _ famine in ireland _ -rrb- hundred of thousand of the poorer class starve then begin a stream of emigration to america under pressure of such fact as these the english corn law be repeal and gradually great britain assume more and more positively the attitude of free trade -lrb- footnote : see _ repeal of the english corn law _ -rrb- expansion of european influence yet despite all the internal difficulty that thus convulse europe in the middle of the nineteenth century the period be also notable for the rapid expansion of european influence over the other continent of the eastern hemisphere earth-hunger the same passion that have sway the united state in its mexican contest plunge the power of europe also into repeat war france extend she authority over the nearer african state of the mediterranean indeed one of the main cause for the rebellion of 1848 against loui philippe be the enormous cost in man and money of these african campaign undertake against the truly remarkable mahometan leader and patriot abd-el-kader -lrb- footnote : see _ the fall of abd-el-kader _ -rrb- england tighten she grip on indium and extend she authority over the broader land around it the hopelessness of asiatic resistance to european aggressiveness and military force be once more make evident in the widespread rebellion of the indian native in 1857 in quick succession over vast and populous region both the people and the raja rise against british rule in the triumph of they first momentary victory they commit savage excess which make pardon hopeless yet neither they number nor the desperation to which they be drive enable they to hold they own against the mere handful of resolute englishman who soon subdue they -lrb- footnote : see _ the indian mutiny _ -rrb- england 's influence be also extend over afghanistan and southern africa livingstone most famous of missionary and explorer cross the dark continent from coast to coast in 1851 -lrb- footnote : see _ livingstone 's african discovery _ -rrb- in that same year gold be discover in australium and english adventurer flock thither the world grow small to european eye -lrb- footnote : see _ discovery of gold in australium _ -rrb- even the extremest east be bring in contact with the west as a result of the opium war of 1840 china be compel to open she door to foreign trade she be also compel to surrender territory to england japan which for more than two century have jealously exclude european from she shore receive she memorable awaken from the friendly american expedition of commodore perry -lrb- footnote : see _ the opening of japan _ -rrb- the crimean war russium seek to have she share also in the appropriation of territory and sphere of influence she and england be the only two european power which have not be seriously shake by the upheaval of 1848 it seem that they might almost divide between they the helpless eastern world england have already begin operation russium assume a sort of protectorate over the christian in turkish land and propose to england that the entire turkish empire should be divide between the two despoiler the british government refuse the plan mainly because it would give russium a broad highway to the sea and make she a dangerous commercial rival so russia attempt to carry out she scheme single-handed and begin seize turkish province she destroy the turkish fleet once before in 1828 the threat of a general european alliance have check the russian bear at this same game but europe be weaker now the czar stronger and england far off and undecided thus perhaps the czar might have have he way but for napoleon iii this new emperor have be permit by frenchman to usurp he power largely because of the military repute of he great namesake and he feel that to hold he place he must justify he reputation frenchman resent exceedingly the czar 's haughty assumption that only england be able to oppose russium and napoleon iii promptly assert himself in the _ role _ of the former napoleon as dictator of europe the title so pleased the insult pride of he people that they follow he eagerly and remain blind to many failing through more war than one the self-constituted dictator insist that he whole desire be for peace and the artistic beautifying of he country yet if russium persist in extend she power and ignore france -- in 1854 he join england in the war of the crimea against russium it can not be say that the ally achieve any great success against they huge antagonist they fleet bombard the baltic fortress with small result they army hasten to protect turkey attack the russian in the crimea gain the battle of the alma and then for a entire year besiege the fortification of sebastopol -lrb- footnote : see _ the capture of sebastopol _ -rrb- but distance and changeful climate prove russium 's aid as they have in 1812 the ally ' commissary and sanitary department could hardly be manage at all they troops die by thousand and though they finally storm and capture sebastopol it be a barren victory russium not so much overcome as convinced of the practical lack of profit in persistency make term of peace by which she once more draw back from she feeble prey english statesman be satisfy with the check administer to they great rival and the french be delight at the successful interference of they dictator of europe he have rehabilitate the nation in its own eye union of italy ambition grow by what it feed on napoleon determine to assert himself again the bitterness of italy against its austrian master offer a excellent opportunity and in 1859 he encourage the king of sardinium to try once more the contest which have prove so disastrous eleven year before the king victor emmanuel ii prepare for war against austrium the french join he so do the little north italian state and they combined force be victorious at magenta and solferino -lrb- footnote : see _ battle of magenta and solferino _ -rrb- napoleon have declare that the combat should not cease until the austrian be drive entirely out of italy as the price of he alliance he secure nice and savoy from sardinium and then immediately after the bloody battle of solferino he suddenly change front and declare that the war must cease austrium yield lombardy but keep venice the last of the possession for which during more than three hundred year she have be battle in italy the kingdom of sardinium become the kingdom of northern italy the next year -lrb- 1860 -rrb- garibaldus the lion-like fighter the enthusiastic lover of italy gathering round he a thousand follower make a unexpected attack on sicily which be hold by the tyrant king of naple with he celebrated thousand he win two remarkable victory the sicilian join he the neapolitan be drive from the island not give they time to recover garibaldus follow to the mainland defeat they again and be master of all southern italy meanwhile victor emmanuel march he troops southward seize what be leave of the state of the church the two conqueror meet midway in italy and garibaldus grasp he sovereign by the hand salute he as king at last of a unite italy only rome and venice remain outside the pale rome protect by be in actual possession of the pope and since france be still catholic guard by french troops from the eager italian the year 1860 have be second only to 1848 in its importance in change the outline of modern europe -lrb- footnote : see _ the kingdom of italy establish _ -rrb- another change immeasurably vast and still unmeasured in its consequence may be date from 1859 when charle darwin give to the world he book the _ origin of species _ in this he proclaim the doctrine of the evolution of all the more complicated form of life from simpler form the idea at first resolutely combate on religious grounds have gradually receive more or less acceptance into the entire religious fabric even as be the discovery of galileo -lrb- footnote : see _ darwin publish he origin of species _ -rrb- disunion in america yet each and all of these event important as they be grow little in man 's mind as the year 1860 draw to its close and reveal in america the come of a mightier quarrel the slavery question once suppose to have be settle by the missourus compromise have prove itself incapable of such settlement the forward march of democracy have in fact make slavery a anachronism outgrow and impossible even the emperor of russium see that and in 1861 liberate all the serf within he territory -lrb- footnote : see _ emancipation of russian serf _ -rrb- in the united state alone among the great power of the world do slavery persist in 1854 a new political party call itself the republican be form have for its main principle opposition to the extension of slavery into the territory -lrb- footnote : see _ the rise of the republican party _ -rrb- other issue might and do complicate the central question but it be the slavery issue that inflamed man 's mind make kansas a battle-ground between settler from north and south and send john brown upon he reckless raid watch the increase success of the republican southern leader begin to reassert the doctrine of the right of secession they say openly that if a republican president be elect they would leave the union and in 1860 a republican president be elect be the long-predicted and to most of europe eagerly desire disruption of the united state at hand be the break to be accomplish peacefully or in flame and wrath the fading year of 1860 leave the advance world of democracy in panic over the danger to what have be its most successful stronghold -lrb- for the next section of this general survey see volume xviii -rrb- -lrb- 1844 -rrb- invention of the telegraph alonzo b cornell after the experiment of franklin that do so much to advance the study of electrical phenomenon and to suggest practical application of electricity physicist in all country occupy themselves with investigation along line mark out by the american philosopher in 1749 franklin devise the lightning-rod but notwithstanding the labor of many investigator it be more than fifty year before any other practical discovery or invention in electricity be bring into general use the first great achievement of the kind be morse 's improvement of the electric telegraph that morse 's fellow-countryman joseph henry chiefly prepare the way for that triumph the follow account with just emphasis demonstrate among the european scientist and inventor to whom both henry and morse be indebted be the french electrician andré marie ampère -lrb- 1775-1836 -rrb- whose name -lrb- ampère -rrb- have be give to the practical unit of electric-current strength ampère be the first and be the most famous investigator in electrodynamics he also invent a telegraphic arrangement in which he use the magnetic needle and coil and the galvanic battery other in the latter part of the eighteenth century and the earlier year of the nineteenth devise similar arrangement but no strictly electromagnetic apparatus for telegraphic signalling be put to successful use until 1836 when in england charle wheatstone who be commonly regard as the first inventor of practical electric telegraphy construct a apparatus whereby thirty signal be transmit through nearly four mile of wire from 1837 to 1843 he have as a associate william fothergill cooke and the two work together to develop the electric telegraph they afterward quarrel over they respective claim to credit but in 1838-1841 telegraph line secure by they patent be set up on the great western and two other english railway meanwhile other inventor be still work for the same result in many part of the world and it have be significantly say that the electric telegraph have properly speak no inventor it grow up little by little nevertheless with respect to the distinctive character of morse 's improvement and he title to a peculiar place among those through whose labor the electric telegraph grow there can be no question alonzo b cornell son of the founder of cornell university at one time governor of new york be intimately connect with electrical and telegraphic affair for many year therefore on the subject here present he speak with professional authority he father be the first builder of the morse telegraph \* \* \* \* \* during the early year of the nineteenth century but slight advance be make in the development of electrical science although there be many person both here and abroad engage in experimental work and there be considerable increase of literature bearing upon the subject it be reserve for another illustrious american to accomplish the next important and decisive step in the pathway of progress in 1828 joseph henry then professor of physics at the albany academy afterward a professor at princeton and subsequently for many year secretary of the smithsonian institution at washington make the highly important discovery that by wind a plain iron core with many layer of insulate wire through which the electric current be pass he could at pleasure charge and discharge the iron core with magnetic power thus henry produce the electromagnet which be the beginning of the mastery by man of the subtle fluid he also discover that the intensity and power of the electric current be materially augmented by increase the number of the series of battery plate without increase the quantity of metal use in they construction these discovery of henry be beyond all question the most important in real and intrinsic value ever make in the progress of electric science as they form the solid basis upon which all subsequent inventor have be enable to accomplish successful result in they various field of endeavor it be concede by all familiar with the history of electrical progress that the name of professor joseph henry be to be honor and cherish as one of the very foremost of scientific discoverer of any age or country and it must remain a cause of sincere and permanent regret that of all the fabulous wealth that have result from the advancement of electrical science this modest and unselfish inventor should have pass hence without ever have realize any substantial reward for he great work not only so but he be never award the appropriate acknowledgment to which he be so eminently entitle for the inestimable benefit he discovery confer upon he countryman and upon the world at large the possibility of utilize professor henry 's electromagnet for the purpose of transmit intelligence to a distant point be conceive by still another american professor samuel finley breese morse of new york -lrb- footnote : he be bear in charlestown massachusett April 27 1791 -- ed -rrb- during he passage on board the packet-ship sully from havre to new york in the winter of 1832 incidental discussion between himself and doctor jackson a fellow-passenger in reference to recent electrical improvement on both side of the atlantic lead morse to the conclusion that intelligence might be instantaneously transmit over a metallic circuit to a distant point and he thereupon determine to devote himself to the solution of the problem involve the following day he exhibit a rough sketch of a plan for record electric impulse necessary to convey and express intelligence he pursue the subject with great devotion during the remainder of the voyage and after arrival in new york begin the construction of the necessary apparatus to accomplish he purpose morse be by profession a portrait painter of more than ordinary merit and be oblige to continue he artistic labor for a livelihood he be a graduate of yale college where he attention have first be attract to electrical experiment he be thus in a measure prepare for carry forward the important work he have undertake and pursue he labor with great assiduity devote every spare moment to the pursuit of he object which be attain but slowly by reason of he lack of mechanical skill and ingenuity not until 1837 have he so far succeed in he effort as to be prepare to make application for letters-patent to enable he to secure and protect he rights of invention in the electromagnetic telegraph in explanation of the slow progress of he experimental work professor morse in write to a friend say : up to the autumn of 1837 my telegraphic apparatus exist in so rude a form that i feel reluctance to have it see my means be very limit so limited as to preclude the possibility of construct a apparatus of such mechanical finish as to warrant my success in venture upon its public exhibition i have no wish to expose to ridicule the representative of so many hour of laborious think prior to the summer of 1837 i depend upon my pencil for subsistence indeed so straitened be my circumstance that in order to save time to carry out my invention and to economize my scanty means i have for month lodge and eat in my studio procure food in small quantity from some grocery and prepare it myself to conceal from my friend the stinted manner in which i live i be in the habit of bring food to my room in the evening and this be my mode of life for many year after the continuance of this heroic struggle for more than five year morse find himself compel to seek the aid of more accomplished mechanical skill than he possess to perfect he apparatus and be oblige to surrender a quarter interest in he invention in order to obtain pecuniary aid for this purpose have thus succeed in obtain at such serious sacrifice the requisite financial assistance to enable he to perfect the mechanism necessary to demonstrate he invention professor morse lose no time in complete he apparatus and present it for public inspection on January 6 1838 he first operate he system successfully over a wire three mile long in the presence of a number of personal friend at morristown new jersey in the follow month he make a similar exhibition before the faculty of the new york university which be a occasion of much interest among the scientist of the metropolis shortly thereafter the apparatus be take to philadelphium and exhibit at the franklin institute where he receive the highest commendation from the committee of science and art with a strong expression in favor of government aid for the purpose of demonstrate the practical usefulness of the system from philadelphium morse remove he apparatus to washington where he be permit to demonstrate its operation before president van buren and he cabinet foreign minister and member of both house of congress as well also as prominent citizen be invite to attend the exhibition and manifest much interest in the novelty of the invention a bill be introduce in congress make a appropriation of thirty thousand dollar for the purpose of provide for the erection of a experimental line of telegraph between washington and baltimore to illustrate by practical use its general utility the bill be in good time favorably report from the committee on commerce but make no further progress in that congress similar bill be subsequently introduce and diligently support in each succeed congress but it be not until the very closing hour of the expire session of 1843 that the necessary enactment be effect and the appropriation secure the plan of construction devise by professor morse for the experimental line of telegraph to be erect between washington and baltimore under the congressional appropriation provide for place insulate wire in a lead pipe underground this be to be accomplish by the use of a specially devise plough of peculiar construction to be draw by a powerful team by which mean the pipe contain the electric conductor be to be automatically deposit in the earth this apparatus be entirely successful in operation and the pipe be thus bury to the complete satisfaction of all concern at a cost very much lower than the work could have be accomplish in any other manner two wire be to be use to form a complete metallic circuit for at that time it be not know as be shortly afterward discover that the earth could be use to form one-half of the circuit for purpose of insulation the wire be neatly cover with cotton-yarn and then saturate in a bath of hot gum-shellac but this treatment prove defective in insulate property for when ten mile of line have be complete the wire be find to be wholly useless for electric conduction no mode have be devise for the treatment of india-rubber to make it available for purpose of insulation and gutta-percha be wholly unknown as a article of use or commerce in this country twenty-three thousand dollar of the government appropriation have be expend and the work thus far accomplish be a acknowledged failure only seven thousand dollar of the available fund remain unexpended and this be regard as inadequate to complete the undertaking under any other plan the friend of the enterprise be in despair and for some time see no other alternative than to apply to congress for a additional appropriation this however be regard as almost hopeless and the difficulty of the situation be extremely embarrassing a amusing incident be related of the means use to keep from public knowledge the desperate situation professor morse finally visit the scene of activity where the pipe-laying be proceed and call the superintendent aside confide to he the fact that the work must be stop without the newspaper find out the true reason of its suspension the quick-witted superintendent be equal to the occasion and start the ponderous machine soon manage to run foul of a protrude rock and break the plough the newspaper publish sensational account of the accident and announce that it would require several week to repair damages thus the real trouble be keep from the public until new plan could be determine upon after long and careful consideration professor morse very reluctantly decide to erect the wire on pole this plan be at first consider wholly objectionable under the apprehension that the structure would be disturb by evil-minded person it have however become manifest that this be the only mode of construction that could be accomplish within the remainder of the appropriation and finally upon ascertain that pole line have already be adopt in england it be determine to proceed in this manner the line be thus complete between washington and baltimore about may 1 1844 and prove to be successful and in every way satisfactory in its operation shortly after the completion of the line the national democratic convention which nominate polk and dalla for president and vice-president assemble in baltimore -lrb- may 1844 -rrb- report of the convention proceedings be promptly telegraph to the capital city where the telegraph office be throng with member of congress interested in the news these report create a immense sensation in washington and speedily remove all doubt as to the practical success of the new system of communication a despatch from the honorable sila wright then unite state senator from new york refuse to accept the nomination for vice-president be read in the national convention and produce a extraordinary interest from the fact that very few of the delegate have ever hear of the telegraph and it require much explanation to satisfy they of the genuineness of the alleged communication have thus establish beyond all reasonable question the practical utility of the telegraph as a superior means of public and private communication professor morse and he associate offer they patent to the united state government for the very moderate price of one hundred thousand dollar with a view of have the system adopt for general use in connection with the postal establishment this proposition be refer to the postmaster-general for consideration and report after due deliberation that officer report that although the invention be a agent vastly superior to any other ever devise by the genius of man yet the operation between washington and baltimore have not satisfied I that under any rate of postage that can be adopt its revenue can be make to cover its expenditure under the influence of this report congress very naturally decline the offer of the patentee and the telegraph be thereupon relegate to the domain of private enterprise the result be that the patentee finally realize for they interest many time the amount of they offer to the government during the autumn of 1844 short exhibition line be erect in boston and new york for the purpose of familiarize business man of those city with the characteristic of the new invention but they attract little attention and the promoter have much cause of discouragement on account of public indifference for the purpose of arouse more attention to the system appeal be make to the public press for favorable notice which be also generally decline the proprietor of one of the most prominent and enterprising of the new york daily papers distinctly refuse to encourage the establishment of telegraph line for the reason as he freely acknowledge that if the new method of transmit intelligence be to come into general use he competitor could use it as well as himself and he would therefore be deprive of he present advantage over they for procure early news by the use of a expensive system of special despatch then maintain by he paper two year later he refuse to join other papers in receive the governor 's message by telegraph from albany and be so badly beat by he rival in this instance that he paper be thenceforward one of the most generous patron of the telegraph early in the year 1845 a corporate organization be effect for the extension of the telegraph from baltimore to philadelphium and new york under the name of the magnetic telegraph company for which a special act of incorporation be obtain from the legislature of the state of maryland nearly all of the capital of this company be subscribe by washington people baltimore and philadelphium furnish only a few hundred dollar while new york contribute nothing slow progress be make toward the construction of the line on account of the difficulty of obtain the right of way either upon railway or highway and it be not until January 1846 that the line be complete to the west side of the hudson river which form a impassable barrier to further progress for a considerable period no method of insulation have yet be devise that would permit the operation of a electric conductor under water and it be doubt whether a wire could be maintain for a span sufficient to cross the river overhead finally however high mast be erect on the palisade near fort lee and on the height at fort washington on the new york side and a steel wire be suspend upon they this plan be successful except that occasionally the wire be break by a extraordinary burden of sleet in the winter season this method of cross the lower hudson be continue for more than ten year when it be supersede by submarine cable during the year 1846 incorporated company be form under which telegraph line be extend from new york to boston buffalo and pittsburg and within the next three year nearly every important town in the united state and canada from st loui and new orlean to montreal and halifax be bring into telegraphic communication thus after fifteen year of struggle with all the pain of poverty often lack even the common necessaries of life professor morse and he faithful colaborer have the supreme satisfaction in 1847 of know and realize that the telegraph system have finally achieve not only scientific success for this have be prove year before but that financial success ample and complete have come to pay they richly for all the dark day and wearisome year through which they have pass once generally establish the telegraph win its way to popular appreciation very rapidly it be in harmony with the spirit of the age and it be not long before every town of any considerable importance regard telegraphic facility as a indispensable necessity the small cost soon induce the construction of rival line regardless of the rights of the patentee and within a very few year unwise competition begin to bring many line to a condition of bankruptcy the weaker concern soon pass through the sheriff 's hand and find purchaser only at a extreme sacrifice at the bidding of the more provident and conservative proprietor of compete line instead of induce a more prudent course these disastrous result only serve to feed the spirit of rivalry and general insolvency seem to threaten the permanent prosperity of the telegraph business in consequence of the wild and reckless competition which appear to be inherent in its nature this extremely unsatisfactory condition of telegraph rivalry drift on from bad to worse until 1854 when from dire necessity of self-preservation a few of the more prudent and far-sighted proprietor of telegraph property be induce to combine they interest with some of they competitor and thus avoid the ruinous policy which have be so rapidly exhaust they vitality accordingly the principal telegraph line in ohio indiana michigan and some of the neighboring state be bring into fraternal relation and form the nucleus of the western union telegraph company the new policy soon bring prosperity in place of waste and improvidence profit be devote to the purchase of additional line thus enlarge they domain and strengthen they position prosperity increase with rapid stride and the beneficial effect of extirpate wasteful rivalry and build up a substantial system with superior facility and provident management give the new organization a dominate influence among the telegraph company of america the same general policy have be pursue to the present time -lrb- 1894 -rrb- and have result in the establishment of a prosperous corporation of magnificent proportion carry on a useful and beneficent business under a greater number of governmental jurisdiction great and small than any other corporate organization in existence for the development of the telegraph enterprise in america no thanks be due to the wealthy capitalist as a rule they would not listen to suggestion of invest they money in what be contemptuously term rotten pole and rusty wire they want something more substantial and conservative as the basis of they investment a early pioneer and builder of telegraph line whose name be now hold in grateful memory for deed of philanthropic beneficence visit the city of chicago in 1847 to solicit subscription to the capital stock of a company then engage in construction of the first line of telegraph between that place and the city of buffalo he present a carefully prepared prospectus show a estimate earning capacity of the project line of one hundred dollar per day the merit of the contemplated enterprise be freely canvass at a meeting of banker at which one of the most prominent declare that any man who ever expect to see one hundred dollar per day pay for telegraph west of buffalo must be crazy and unworthy of belief this oracular declaration prevail and the project be ignominiously reject by the wise man of chicago fortunately citizen of smaller town like ypsilantus kalamazoo south bend kenosha and racine take a more sensible view of the propose enterprise and the line be build despite the contempt of chicago capitalist now however the man of chicago pay more than five thousand dollar a day for telegraph at rate far lower than would have be think possible in that early day the true spirit of enterprise which have so grandly develop the resource of we imperial domain have generally be find to prevail among people of modest means thus nearly every dollar of capital contribute toward the establishment of telegraph line in this country come from the offering of people in very moderate circumstance in this connection therefore it be extremely gratifying to state that very few enterprise of any kind have return such generous recompense for the amount of capital invest as the telegraph and telephone line in america consider the apparently temporary and short-lived character of the structure erect for these purpose it seem difficult to comprehend the truth of this statement the method of telegraphic communication devise by professor morse have be continue in general use in this country but instead of require separate wire for each circuit as formerly six independent circuit be now operate simultaneously over a single wire by the use of the sextuplex apparatus -lrb- 1846 -rrb- repeal of the english corn law justin mccarthy after the repeal of the corn law the tariff legislation of great britain be guide by a new policy that of free trade and it have be follow ever since the reactionary tendency of continental europe after the fall of napoleon reach also to england where they control the conduct of political affair until canning in 1822 become secretary for foreign affair he policy be liberal and do much in form the public opinion that at length find voice in catholic emancipation -lrb- 1829 -rrb- in the reform bill -lrb- 1832 -rrb- and in the abolition of slavery in the english colony -lrb- 1833 -rrb- then follow important amendment of the poor-laws extension of local governmental power in the town improvement of popular education and other reform through all this gradual progress in liberal government and public amelioration the need of another reform have be point out by some thinker and statesman and at last the condition of the country favor the view of its advocate the corn law protect the english producer by impose heavy duty on import grain at one time these duty practically prohibit such importation mccarthy show how the law operate upon the people and he story of the memorable agitation for they repeal and of the accomplishment of that object could not have be better tell in 1815 the celebrated corn law be pass which be itself mould on the corn law of 1670 by the act of 1815 wheat might be export upon a payment of one shilling per quarter custom duty but the importation of foreign grain be practically prohibit until the price of wheat in england have reach eighty shilling a quarter that be to say until a certain price have be secure for the grower of grain at the expense of all the consumer in this country it be not permit to englishman to obtain they supplies from any foreign land unless on condition that suit the english corn-grower 's pocket we may perhaps make this principle a little more clear if it be necessary by illustrate its work on a small scale and within narrow limit in a particular street in london let we say a law be pass declare that no one must buy a loaf of bread out of that street or even round the corner until the price of bread have rise so high in the street itself as to secure to its two or three baker a certain enormous scale of profit on they loaf when the price of bread have be force up so high as to pass this scale of profit then it would be permissible for those who stand in need of bread to go round the corner and buy they loaf of the baker in the next street but the moment that they continue to do this cause the price of the baker 's bread in they own street to fall below the prescribe limit they must instantly take to buy bread within they own bound and of they own baker again this be a fair illustration of the principle on which the corn law be mould the corn law of 1815 be pass in order to enable the landowner and farmer to recover from the depression cause by the long era of foreign war it be rush through parliament if we may use a american expression petition of the most urgent nature pour in against it from all the commercial and manufacturing class and in vain popular disturbance break out in many place the poor everywhere see the bread of they family threaten see the food of they child almost take out of they mouth and they naturally break into wild extreme of anger in london there be serious riot and the house of some of the most prominent supporter of the bill be attack the incendiary go to work in many part of the country at that time it be still the way in england as it be now in russium and other country for popular indignation to express itself in the frequent incendiary fire at one place near london a riot last for two day and night the soldier have to be call out to put it down and five man be hang for take part in it after the passing of the corn law of 1815 and when it have work for some time there be sliding-scale act introduce which establish a vary system of duty so that when the price of home-grown grain rise above a certain figure the duty on import wheat be to sink in proportion the principle of all these measure be the same how it may be ask could any sane legislator adopt such measure as well might it be ask how can any civilized nation still as some still do believe in such a principle the truth be that the principle be one which have a strong fascination for most person the charm of which it be difficult for any class in its turn wholly to shake off the idea be that if we typical baker be pay more than the market price for a loaf he will be able in turn to pay more to the butcher than the fair price for he beef the butcher thus benefit will be enable to deal on more liberal term with the tailor the tailor so favor by legislation will be able in he turn to order a better kind of beer from the publican and pay a higher price for it thus by some extraordinary process everybody pay too much for everything and nevertheless all be enriched in turn the absurdity of this be easily keep out of sight where the protective duty affect a number of vary and complicate interest manufacture commercial and productive in the united state for example where the manufacturer be benefit in one place and the producer be benefit in another and where the country always produce food abundant to supply its own want man be not bring so directly face to face with the fallacy of the principle as they be in england at the time of the anti-corn law league in america protection affect manufacturer for the most part and there be no such popular craving for cheap manufacture as to bring the protective principle into collision with the daily want of the people but in england during the reign of the corn law the food which the people put into they mouth be the article mainly tax and make cruelly costly by the working of protection nevertheless the country put up with this system down to the close of the year 1836 at that time there be a stagnation of trade and a general depression of business severe poverty prevail in many district inevitably therefore the question arise in the mind of most man in distressed or depressed place whether it could be a good thing for the country in general to have the price of bread keep high by factitious means when wages have sink and work become scarce a anti-corn-law association be form in london it begin pretentiously enough but it bring about no result london be not a place where popular agitation find a fitting center in 1838 however bolton in lancashire suffer from a serious commercial crisis three-fifth of its manufacturing activity become paralyzed at once many house of business be actually close and abandon and thousand of workman be leave without the means of life lancashire suddenly rouse itself into the resolve to agitate against the corn law and manchester become the headquarters of the movement which afterward accomplish so much the anti-corn-law league be form and a free-trade hall be build in manchester on the scene of that disturbance which be call the massacre of peterloo the leader of the anti-corn-law movement be richard cobden john bright and charle villier cobden be not a manchester man he be the son of a sussex farmer after the death of he father he be take by he uncle and employ in he wholesale warehouse in the city of london he afterward become a partner in a manchester cotton-factory and sometimes travel on the commercial business of the establishment he become what would then have be consider a great traveller distinct of course from the class of explorer that be he make himself thoroughly familiar with most or all of the country of europe with various part of the east and with the united state and canada he have have a fair homely education and he improve it wherever he go by experience by observation and by conversation with all manner of man he become one of the most effective and persuasive popular speaker ever know in english agitation he be not a orator in the highest sense he have no imagination and little poetic feeling nor do genuine passion ever inflame into fervor of declamation he quiet argumentative style but he have humor he speak simple clear strong english he use no unnecessary word he always make he meaning plain and intelligible and he have a admirable faculty for illustrate every argument by something draw from reading or from observation or from experience he be in fact the very perfection of a common-sense talker a man fit to deal with man by fair straightforward argument to expose complicated sophistry and to make clear the most perplexed part of a intricate question he be exactly the man for that time for that question and for the persuasive and argumentative part of the great controversy which he have undertake cobden 's chief companion in the struggle be john bright whose name have be completely identify with that of cobden in the repeal of the corn law bright be a orator of the highest order he have all the qualification that make a master of eloquence he presence be command he voice be singularly strong and clear and have peculiar tone and shades in it which give indescribable meaning to passage of anger of pity or of contempt he manner be quiet compose serene he indulge in little or no gesticulation he have a rich gift of genuine saxon humor these two man one belong to the middle class of the north one spring from the yeomanry of southern england have as a colleague charle villier a man of high aristocratic family of marked ability and of indomitable loyalty to any cause he undertake villier for some year represent the free-trade cause in parliament and bright and cobden do its work on the platform cobden first and bright after he become member of the house of common and they be further assist there by milner gibson a man of position and family a effective debater who have be at first a conservative but who pass over to the rank of the free trader and through they to the rank of the liberal or radical every year villier bring on a motion in the house in favor of free trade for a long time this motion be only one of the annual performance which by a apparently inevitable necessity have to prelude for many year the practical movement of any great parliamentary question villier might have bring on he annual motion all he life without get much nearer to he object if manchester birmingham sheffield leed and other great northern town have not take the matter vigorously in hand if cobden and bright have not stir up the energy of the whole country and bring clearly home to the mind of every man the plain fact that reason argument and arithmetic as well as freedom and justice be distinctly on they side the anti-corn-law league shower pamphlet tract letter newspaper all over the country they send lecturer into every town preach the same doctrine and proving by scientific fact the justice of the cause they advocate these lecturer be enjoin to avoid as much as possible any appeal to sentiment or to passion the cause they have in hand be one which could best be serve by the clear statement of rigorous fact by the simple explanation of economical truth which no sophism could darken and which no oppose eloquence could charm away the melbourne ministry fall in 1841 it die of inanition : its force be spend sir robert peel come into office cobden who then enter the house of common for the first time seem to have good hope that even peel strong conservative though he be might prove to be a man from whom the free trader could expect substantial assistance sir robert peel have in fact in those later year express again and again he conviction as to the general truth of the principle of free trade all agree he say in 1842 in the general rule that we should buy in the cheapest and sell in the dearest market but he contend that while such be the general rule yet various economical and social condition make it necessary that there should be some distinct exception and he regard the corn law and sugar duty as such exception it may be mention perhaps that the corn law have in fact be treat as a necessary exception by many of the lead exponent of the principle of free trade thus we have to notice the curious fact that while sir robert peel 's own party look upon he accession to power as a certain guarantee against any concession to the free trader the free trader themselves be for the most part convince that they cause have better hope from he than from a whig ministry the free trader go on debate and divide in the house agitating and lecture all over the country for some year without any marked parliamentary success follow they endeavor a immense and overwhelming majority always vote against they in the house of common they be make progress and very great progress but it be not that kind of advance which have yet come to be decide by a parliamentary vote probably a keen and experienced eye might have note clearly enough the progress they be make the whig party be come more and more round to the principle of free trade day after day some whig leader be admit that the theory of the past would not do for the present and as we have say the tory leader have himself go so far as to admit the justice of the general principle of free trade at one point the main difference between sir robert peel the leader of the house of common and lord john russell the leader of the opposition seem to have be nothing more than this that peel still regard grain as a necessary exception to the principle of free trade and lord john russell be not clear that the time have come when it could be treat otherwise than as a exception a event however over which no party and no leader have any control suddenly intervene to hasten the action and spur the conviction of the leader on both side and especially of the prime minister this be the great famine which break out in ireland in the autumn of 1845 the vast majority of the irish people have long depend for they food on the potato alone the summer of 1845 have be a long season of wet and cold and sunlessness in the autumn the news go abroad that the whole potato crop of ireland be in danger of destruction if not already actually destroy before attention have well be awaken to the crisis it be officially announce that more than one-third of the entire potato crop have be sweep away by the disease and that it have not cease its ravages but on the contrary be spread more and more every day the general impression of those who could form a opinion be that the whole of the crop must perish the anti-corn-law league cry out for the opening of the port and the admission of grain and food from all place sir robert peel be decidedly in favor of such a course the duke of wellington and lord stanley oppose the idea and the proposition be give up only three member of the cabinet support sir robert peel 's proposal -- lord aberdeen sir jame graham mr sidney herbert all the other object some because they oppose the principle of the measure and be convince that if the port be once open they would never be close again which indeed be probably peel 's own conviction and other on the ground that no sufficient proof have yet be give that such a measure be necessary lord john russell almost immediately after write a letter from edinburgh to he constituent the elector of the city of london in which he declare that something must immediately be do that it be no longer worth while to contend for a fix duty and that a end must be put to the whole system of protection as the blight of commerce the bane of agriculture the source of bitter division among class the cause of penury fever and crime among the people this letter produce a decisive effect on peel he see that the whig be prepare to unite with the anti-corn-law league in agitate for the total repeal of the corn law and he therefore make up he mind to recommend to the cabinet a early meeting of parliament with the view to anticipate the agitation which he see must succeed in the end and to bring forward as a government measure some scheme which should at least prepare the way for the speedy repeal of the corn law a cabinet council be hold almost immediately after the publication of lord john russell 's letter and peel recommend the summon of parliament in order to take instant measure to cope with the distress in ireland and also to introduce legislation distinctly intend to prepare the way for the repeal of the corn law lord stanley could not accept the proposition the duke of wellington be himself of opinion that the corn law ought to be maintain but at the same time he declare that he consider good government for the country more important than corn law or any other consideration and that he be therefore ready to support sir robert peel 's administration through thick and thin lord stanley and the duke of buccleuch however declare that they could not be party to any legislation which tend toward the repeal of the corn-laws sir robert peel do not feel himself strong enough to carry out he project in the face of such opposition in the cabinet itself and he tender he resignation to the queen the queen send for lord john russell but russell 's party be not very strong in the country and they have not a majority in the house of common lord john try however to form a ministry without a parliamentary majority and even although sir robert peel would not give any pledge to support a measure for the immediate and complete repeal of the corn law lord john russell be not successful lord gray son of the lord gray of the reform bill object to the foreign policy of lord palmerston and think a seat in the cabinet ought to be offer to cobden lord john russell have nothing to do but to announce to the queen that he find it impossible to form a ministry the queen send for sir robert peel again and ask he to withdraw he resignation peel comply and almost immediately resume the function of first minister of the crown the duke of buccleuch consent to go on with he but lord stanley hold to he resolution and have no place in the ministry he position as secretary of state for the colony be take by william e gladstone gladstone however do not sit in parliament during the eventful session when the corn law be repeal he have sit for the borough of newark which be under the influence of the duke of newcastle and as the duke of newcastle have withdraw he support from the ministry gladstone do not seek re-election for newark and remain without a seat in the house of common for some month parliament meet on January 22 1846 the speech from the throne deliver by the queen in person recommend the legislature to take into consideration the necessity of still further apply the principle on which it have formerly act when measure be present to extend commerce and to stimulate domestic skill and industry by the repeal of prohibitive and the relaxation of protective duty in the debate on the address sir robert peel rise after the mover and seconder have speak and the question have be put from the chair and at once proceed to explain the policy which he intend to adopt he speech be long and labor and somewhat weary the audience by the elaborate manner in which he explain how he opinion have be bring into gradual change with regard to free trade and protection he make it however perfectly clear that he be now a convert to cobden 's opinion and that he intend to introduce some measure which should practically amount to the abolition of protection it be in this debate and immediately after peel have speak that benjamin disraelus make he first great impression on parliament he have be in the house for many year and have make many attempt have sometimes be laugh at have sometimes be dislike and occasionally for a moment admire but it be when he rise immediately after sir robert peel and denounce peel as one who have betray he party and he principle that he make the first deep impression on the house of common and come to be consider as a serious and influential parliamentary personage i be not one of the convert disraelus say i be perhaps a member of a fall party a new protection party be form almost immediately under the leadership of george lord bentinck a man of great energy and tenacity of purpose who have hitherto spend he life almost altogether on the turf who have have almost no previous preparation for leadership or even for debate but who certainly when he do accept the responsible position offer to he show a considerable capacity for leadership and a unwearying attention to he duty on January 27th sir robert peel explain he financial policy he intention be to abandon the slide scale altogether to impose for the present a duty of ten shilling a quarter on corn when the price of it be under forty-eight shilling a quarter to reduce that duty by one shilling for every shilling of rise in price until it reach fifty-three shilling a quarter when the duty should fall to four shilling this however be to be only a temporary arrangement it be to last but three year and at the end of that time protective duty on grain be to be wholly abandon we need not go at any length into the history of the long debate on peel 's proposition the discussion of one amendment which be in substance a motion to reject the scheme altogether last for twelve night the third reading of the bill pass the house of common on may 15th by a majority of ninety-eight the bill go up at once to the house of lord and at the urgent pressure of the duke of wellington be carry through that house without any serious opposition the duke make no secret of he own opinion he assure many of he brother peer that he dislike the measure just as much as anyone could do but he insist that they have all better vote for it nevertheless sir robert peel have triumph but he find himself desert by a large and influential section of the party he once have lead most of the great landowner and country gentleman of the conservative party abandon he some of they feel the bitterest resentment toward he they believe he have betray they although nothing could be more clear than that for year he have distinctly be make it know to the house that he principle incline he toward free trade and thereby leave it to be understand that if opportunity or emergency should compel he he would be glad to declare himself a free trader even in the matter of grain strange to say the day when the bill be read in the house of lord for the third time see the fall of peel 's ministry the fall be due to the state of ireland the government have be bring in a coercion bill for ireland it be introduce while the corn bill be yet pass through the house of common the situation be critical all the irish follower of daniel o'connell would be sure to oppose the coercion bill the liberal party at least when out of office have usually make it they principle to oppose coercion bill if they be not attend with some promise of legislative reform the english radical member lead by cobden and bright be certain to oppose coercion if the protectionist should join with these other opponent of the coercion bill the fate of the measure be assure and with it the fate of the government this be exactly what happen eighty protectionist follow lord george bentinck into the lobby against the bill in combination with the free trader the whig and the irish catholic and national member the division take place on the second reading of the bill on Thursday June 25th and there be a majority of seventy-three against the ministry the moment after sir robert peel succeed in pass he great measure of free trade he himself fall from power he political epitaph perhaps could not be better write than in the word with which he close the speech that just precede he fall : it may be that i shall leave a name sometimes remember with expression of good-will in those place which be the abode of man whose lot it be to labor and to earn they daily bread by the sweat of they brow -- a name remember with expression of good-will when they shall recreate they exhaust strength with abundant and untaxed food the sweeter because it be no longer leaven with a sense of injustice with the fall of the principle of the protection in corn may be say to have practically fall the principle of protection in that country altogether that principle be a little complicated in regard to the sugar duty and to the navigation law the sugar produce in the west indian colony be allow to enter that country at rate of duty much lower than those impose upon the sugar grow in foreign land the abolition of slavery in the colony have make labor there somewhat costly and difficult to obtain continuously and the impression be that if the duty on foreign sugar be reduce it would tend to enable those country which still maintain the slave trade to compete at great advantage with the sugar grow in the colony by that free labor to establish which england have but just pay so large a pecuniary fine therefore the question of free trade become involve with that of free labor at least so it seem to the eye of many a man who be not incline to support the protective principle in itself when it be put to he whether he be willing to push the free-trade principle so far as to allow country grow sugar by slave labor to drive we free-grown sugar out of the market he be often inclined to give way before this mode of put the question and to imagine that there really be a collision between free trade and free labor therefore a certain sentimental plea come in to aid the protectionist in regard to the sugar duty many of the old antislavery party find themselves deceive by this fallacy and incline to join the agitation against the reduction of the duty on foreign sugar on the other hand it be make tolerably clear that the labor be not so scarce or so dear in the colony as have be represent and that colonial sugar grow by free labor really suffer from no inconvenience except the fact that it be still manufacture on the most crude old-fashioned and uneconomical method besides the time have go by when the majority of the english people could be convince that a lesson on the beauty of freedom be to be convey to foreign sugar-grower and slave-owner by the means of a tax upon the product of they plantation therefore after a long and somewhat eager struggle the principle of free trade be allow to prevail in regard to sugar the duty on sugar be make equal the growth of the sugar plantation be admit on the same term into that country without any reference either to the soil from which it have spring or to the condition under which it be grow it have for a long time be stoutly proclaim that the abolition of slavery must be the destruction of we west indian colony year have elapse and the west indian colony still survive now the cry of alarm be take up again and it be prophesy that although they have get over the abolition of slavery they never could survive the equalization of the sugar duty jamaica certainly have fall greatly away from she period of temporary and factitious prosperity jamaica be own and manage by a class of proprietor who resemble in many way some of the planter of the state of america farthest south -- of the state toward the mouth of the mississippus they live in a kind of careless luxury mortgage they estate as deeply as they possibly could throw over to the coming year the superabundant debt of the last and only manage to keep they head above water so long as the people of england by favor they with a highly protective system enable they still to compete against those who grow sugar on better and more economical plan the whole island be give over to neglect and mismanagement the emancipate negro take but little trouble to cultivate the plot of ground they have obtain and be quite content if they could scratch enough from the soil to enable they barely to live therefore jamaica do at a certain time fall far below the level of she former seeming prosperity the other island have be better manage they estate be less encumber by debt and they pass through each successive crisis without sustain any noticeable injury in most of these island the product increase steadily after the emancipation of the slave the negro then begin to work earnestly and education grow not greatly but distinctly among all class jamaica the most unfortunate among the island have be constantly the scene of little outburst of more or less serious rebellion as the late lord chief justice of england observe in a charge on a famous occasion the soil of the island might seem to have be drench in blood but these disturbance or insurrection or whatever they may be call do not increase in number after the abolition of slavery and after the equalization of the sugar duty but on the contrary decrease during we time only one considerable disturbance have take place in jamaica and in former year such tumult be of frequent recurrence in the west indy we have therefore the most severe test to which the principle of free trade could well be subject it be not too much to say that in the more fortunate of these island it have establish its claim and that even in the least fortunate no evidence whatever have be give that the people would have be in any way the better off if the old system have be retain the navigation law have too a certain external attraction about they which induce many man not actually protectionist to believe in they necessity the principle of the navigation law be to impose such restriction of tariff and otherwise as to exclude foreign vessel from take any considerable part in we carry trade the law be first enact in oliver cromwell 's day at a time when the dutch be rival on the sea and when it be think desirable to repress by protective legislation the energy of such experienced seaman and push trader the navigation law be modify by mr huskisson in 1823 but only so far as to establish that which we now know so well as the principle of reciprocity any nation which remove restriction from british merchant marine be favor with a similar concession the idea also be that these navigation law keep foreigner out of england 's carry trade enable she to maintain always a supply of sailor who could at any time be transfer from the merchant marine to the royal navy and thus be make to assist in the defense of the country of course the ship-owner themselves uphold the navigation law on the plea that if the trade be throw open by the withdrawal of protection they chance would be go that they could not contend against the foreigner upon equal term that they interest must suffer and that great britain would in the end be a still severer sufferer because from the lack of encouragement give to the native trader and the sailor england would one day or another be leave at the mercy of some strong power which with wiser regulation would keep up she protective system and with it she naval strength nevertheless the ship-owner and the protectionist and those who raise the alarm-cry about england 's naval defence be unable to maintain they sophism in the face of grow education and of the impulse give by the adoption of free trade in 1849 the navigation law be abolish we believe there be very few ship-owner who will not now admit that the prosperity of they trade have grow immensely in place of suffer from the introduction of the free-trade principle in navigation as well as in com and sugar -lrb- 1846 -rrb- the discovery of neptune sir oliver lodge among modern astronomical discovery none have be regard as more important than that of neptune the outermost known planet of the solar system it be a rich reward to the watcher of the sky when this new planet swim into they ken this discovery be hail by astronomer as the most conspicuous triumph of the theory of gravitation long after copernicus even the genius of philosopher be slow to grasp the full conception of a spherical earth and its relation with the heavenly body as present by he so it be also with the final acceptance of newton 's demonstration of the universal law of gravitation -lrb- 1685 -rrb- whereby he show that the motion of the solar system be due to the action of a central force direct to the body at the center of the system and vary inversely with the square of the distance from it after make this discovery newton himself with the aid of other especially of the french mathematician picard labor for year to verify it and still further verification be necessary before it could be fully comprehend and accept by the scientific world the discovery of the asteroid or small planet revolve in orbit between those of mar and jupiter aid in confirm the newtonian theory which the discovery of uranus by sir william herschel -lrb- 1781 -rrb- have do much to establish from the time of sir william herschel the science of stellar astronomy reveal the enormous distance of the star -- none of they really fixed but all have real or apparent motion -- be rapidly develop the discovery of stellar planet at almost incalculable distance still further change the aspect of the heaven as view by astronomer and when the capital discovery of neptune be make those man of science be well prepare for study its nature and importance these matter as well as the simultaneous calculation of the place of neptune by adam and leverrier and its actual discovery by galle be set forth by sir oliver lodge in a manner as charming for simplicity as it be valuable in its summary of scientific learn the explanation by newton of the observe fact of the motion of the moon the way he account for precession and nutation and for the tide the way in which laplace explain every detail of the planetary motion -- these achievement may seem to the professional astronomer equally if not more striking and wonderful but of the fact to be explain in these case the general public be necessarily more or less ignorant and so no beauty or thoroughness of treatment appeal to it or excite its imagination but to predict in the solitude of the study with no weapon other than pen ink and paper a unknown and enormously distant world to calculate its orbit when as yet it have never be see and to be able to say to a practical astronomer point you telescope in such a direction at such a time and you will see a new planet hitherto unknown to man -- this must always appeal to the imagination with dramatic intensity and must awaken some interest in the dullest prediction be no novelty in science and in astronomy least of all be it a novelty thousand of year ago thale and other whose very name we have forget could predict eclipse but not without a certain degree of inaccuracy and many other phenomenon be capable of prediction by accumulate experience a gap between mar and jupiter cause a miss planet to be suspect and look for and to be find in a hundred piece the abnormal proper-motion of sirius suggest to bessel the existence of a unseen companion and these last instance seem to approach very near the same class of prediction as that of the discovery of neptune wherein then lie the difference how come it that some class of prediction -- such as that if you put you finger in fire it will be burn -- be childishly easy and commonplace while other excite in the keenest intellect the highest feeling of admiration mainly the difference lie first in the grounds on which the prediction be base second in the difficulty of the investigation whereby it be accomplish third in the completeness and the accuracy with which it can be verify in all these point the discovery of neptune stand out as one among the many verify prediction of science and the circumstance surround it be of singular interest three distinct observation suffice to determine the orbit of a planet completely but it be well to have the three observation as far apart as possible so as to minimize the effect of minute but necessary error of observation when uranus be find old record of stellar observation be ransack with the object of discover whether it have ever be unwittingly see before if see it have be think of course to be a star -- for it shine like a star of the sixth magnitude and can therefore be just see without a telescope if one know precisely where to look for it and if one have good sight -- but if it have be see and catalogue as a star it would have move from its place and the catalogue would by that entry be wrong the thing to do therefore be to examine all the catalogue for error to see whether the star enter there actually exist or whether any be miss if a wrong entry be discover it might of course have be due to some clerical error though that be hardly probable consider the care spend in make these record or it might have be a tailless comet or possibly the newly find planet the next thing to do be to calculate backward to see whether by any possibility the planet could have be in that place at that time examine in this way the tabulated observation of flamsteed show that he have unwittingly observe uranus five distinct time the first time in 1690 nearly a century before herschel discover its true nature but more remarkable still le monnier of pari have observe it eight time in one month catalogue it each time as a different star if only he have reduce and compare he observation he would have anticipate herschel by twelve year as it be he miss it it be see once by bradley also altogether it have be see twenty time these old observation of flamsteed and those of le monnier combine with those make after herschel 's discovery be very useful in determine a exact orbit for the new planet and its motion be consider thoroughly know for a time uranus seem to travel regularly and as expect in the orbit which have be calculate for it but early in the present century it begin to be slightly refractory and by 1820 its actual place show quite a distinct discrepancy from its position as calculate with the aid of the old observation it be think at first that this discrepancy must be due to inaccuracy in the older observation and they be accordingly reject and table prepare for the planet base on the newer and more accurate observation only but by 1830 it become apparent that it do not coincide with even these the error amount to about 20 by 1840 it be as much as 90 or a minute and a half this discrepancy be quite distinct but still it be very small and have two object be in the heaven at once the actual uranus and the theoretical uranus no unaided eye could possibly have distinguish they or detect that they be other than a single star the error of uranus though small be enormously greater than other thing which have certainly be observe there be a unmistakable discrepancy between theory and observation some cause be evidently at work on this distant planet cause it to disagree with its motion as calculate accord to the law of gravitation if the law of gravitation hold exactly at so great a distance from the sun there must be some perturb force act on it besides all the known force that have be fully take into account could it be a outer planet the question occur to several and one or two try to solve the problem but be soon stop by the tremendous difficulty of calculation the ordinary problem of perturbation be difficult enough : give a disturbing planet in such and such a position to find the perturbation it produce this be the problem that laplace work out in the _ mécanique céleste _ but the inverse problem -- give the perturbation to find the planet that cause they -- such a problem have never yet be attack and by only a few have its possibility be conceive friedrich bessel make preparation for solve this mystery in 1840 but he be prevent by fatal illness in 1841 the difficulty of the problem present by these residual perturbation of uranus excite the imagination of a young student a undergraduate of cambridge -- john couch adam by name -- and he determine to make a study of they as soon as he be through he _ tripos _ in January 1843 he be graduate as senior wrangler and shortly afterward he set to work in less than two year he reach a definite conclusion and in October 1845 he write to the astronomer-royal at greenwich professor airy say that the perturbation of uranus could be explain by assume the existence of a outer planet which he reckon be now situate in a specify latitude and longitude we know now that have the astronomer-royal put sufficient faith in this result to point he big telescope at the spot indicate and begin sweep for a planet he would have detect it within 1-3\/4 º of the place assign to it by adam but anyone in the situation of the astronomer-royal know that almost every post bring absurd letter from ambitious correspondent some of they have just discover perpetual motion or square the circle or prove the earth flat or discover the constitution of the moon or of ether or of electricity and in this mass of rubbish it require great skill and patience to detect such gem of value as may exist now this letter of adam 's be indeed a jewel of the first water and no doubt bear on its face a very different appearance from the chaff of which i have speak but still adam be unknown : he have be graduate as senior wrangler it be true but somebody must be graduate as senior wrangler every year and a first-rate mathematician be not produce every year those behind the scene -- as professor airy of course be have be a senior wrangler himself -- know perfectly well that the labeling of a young man on he take he degree be much more worthless as a testimony to he genius and ability than the general public be apt to suppose be it likely that a young and unknown man should have solve so extremely difficult a problem it be altogether unlikely still he should be test : he should be ask for explanation concern some of the perturbation which professor airy have notice and see whether he could explain these also by he hypothesis if he could there might be something in he theory if he fail -- well there be a end of it the question be not difficult they concern the error of the radius vector adam could have answer they with perfect ease but sad to say though a brilliant mathematician he be not a man of business he do not answer professor airy 's letter it may seem a pity to many that the greenwich equatorial be not point at the place just to see whether any foreign object do happen to be in that neighborhood but it be no light matter to derange the work of a observatory and alter the plan lay out for the staff into a sudden sweep for a new planet on the strength of a mathematical investigation just receive by post if observatory be conduct on these unsystematic and spasmodic principle they would not be the calm accurate satisfactory place they be of course if anyone have know that a new planet be to be find for the look _ any _ course would have be justified but no one could know this i do not suppose that adam himself feel a absolute confidence in he attempted prediction so there the matter drop adam 's communication be pigeonhole and remain in seclusion eight or nine month meanwhile and quite independently something of the same sort be go on in france a brilliant young mathematician urban jean joseph leverrier bear in normandy in 1811 hold the post of astronomical professor at the école polytechnique found by napoleon he first publish papers direct attention to he wonderful power and the official head of astronomy in france the famous arago suggest to he the unexplained perturbation of uranus as a worthy object for he fresh and well-armed vigor at once he set to work in a thorough and systematic way he first consider whether the discrepancy could be due to error in the table or error in the old observation he discuss they with minute care and come to the conclusion that they be not thus to be explain away this part of the work he publish in November 1845 he then set to work to consider the perturbation produce by jupiter and saturn to see whether they have be accurately allow for or whether some minute improvement could be make sufficient to destroy the irregularity he introduce several fresh term into these calculation but none of they of sufficient importance to do more than partly explain the mysterious perturbation he next examine the various hypothesis that have be suggest to account for they be they cause by a failure in the law of gravitation or by the presence of a resist medium be they due to some large but unseen satellite or to a collision with some comet all these theory he examine and dismiss for various reason the perturbation be due to some continuous cause -- for instance some unknown planet could this planet be inside the orbit of uranus no for then it would perturb saturn and jupiter also and they be not perturb by it it must therefore be some planet outside the orbit of uranus and in all probability accord to bode 's empirical law at nearly double the distance from the sun that uranus be finally he proceed to determine where this planet be and what its orbit must be to produce the observe disturbance not without failure and disheartening complication be this part of the process complete this be after all the real tug of war many unknown quantity exist : its mass its distance its eccentricity the obliquity of its orbit its position -- nothing be know in fact about the planet except the microscopic disturbance it cause in uranus several thousand million mile away from it without go into further detail suffice it to say that in June 1846 he publish he last paper and in it announce to the world he theory as to the situation of the planet professor airy receive a copy of this paper before the end of the month and be astonish to find that leverrier 's theoretical place for the planet be within 1 ° of the place adam have assign to it eight month before so strike a coincidence seem sufficient to justify a herschelian sweep for a week or two but a sweep for so distant a planet would be no easy matter when see through a large telescope it would still only look like a star and it would require considerable labor and watch to sift it out from the other star surround it we know that uranus have be see twenty time and think to be a star before its true nature be discover by herschel and uranus be only about half as far away as neptune neither at paris nor at greenwich be any optical search undertake but professor airy write to ask m leverrier the same old question that he have fruitlessly put to adam : do the new theory explain the error of the radius vector or not the reply of leverrier be both prompt and satisfactory -- these error be explain as well as all the other the existence of the object be then for the first time officially believe in the british association meet that year at southampton and sir john herschel be one of its sectional president in he inaugural address on September 10 1846 he call attention to the research of leverrier and adam in these memorable word : the past year have give to we the new -lrb- minor -rrb- planet astræa it have do more -- it have give we the probable prospect of another we see it as columbus see america from the shore of spain its movement have be feel tremble along the far-reaching line of we analysis with a certainty hardly inferior to ocular demonstration it be nearly time to begin to look for it so the astronomer-royal thought on reading leverrier 's paper but as the national telescope at greenwich be otherwise occupy he write to professor challi at cambridge to know whether he would permit a search to be make for it with the northumberland equatorial the large telescope at cambridge university present to it by one of the duke of northumberland professor challi say he would conduct the search himself and shortly begin a leisurely and dignified series of sweep around the place designate by theory catalogue all the star he observe intend afterward to sort out he observation compare one with another and find out whether any one star have change its position because if it have it must be the planet thus without give a excessive time to the business he accumulate a host of observation professor challi thus actually see the planet twice -- on August 4 and August 12 1846 -- without know it if he have have a map of the heaven contain telescopic star down to the tenth magnitude and if he have compare he observation with this map as they be make the process would have be easy and the discovery quick but he have no such map nevertheless one be in existence it have just be complete in that country of enlighten method and industry -- germany doctor bremiker have not indeed complete he great work -- a chart of the whole zodiac down to star of the tenth magnitude -- but portion of it be complete and the special region where the new planet be expect to appear happen to be among the portion finish but in england this be not know meanwhile adam write to the astronomer-royal several additional communication make improvement in he theory and give what he consider nearer and nearer approximation for the place of the planet he also now answer quite satisfactorily but too late the question about the radius vector send to he month before leverrier be likewise engage in improve this theory and in consider how best the optical search could be conduct actuated probably by the knowledge that in such matter as cataloguing and mapping germany be then as now far ahead of all the other nation he write in September -lrb- the same year that sir john herschel deliver he eloquent address at southampton -rrb- to berlin leverrier write to doctor galle head of the observatory at berlin say to he clearly and decidedly that the new planet be now in or close to such and such a position and that if he would point he telescope to that part of the heaven he would see it and moreover that he would be able to tell it from a star by its have a sensible magnitude or disk instead of be a mere point galle get the letter on September 23 1846 that same evening he point he telescope to the place leverrier tell he and see the planet he recognize it first by its appearance to he practiced eye it do seem to have a small disk and not quite the same aspect as a ordinary star he then consult bremiker 's great star-chart the part just engrave and finish and sure enough no such star be there undoubtedly it be the planet the news flash over europe at the maximum speed with which news could travel at that date -lrb- which be not very fast -rrb- and by October 1st professor challi and mr adam hear it at cambridge and realize that in so far as there be competition in such a matter england be out of the race it be a unconscious race to all concerned however the french scientist know nothing of the search in england adam 's papers have never be publish and very annoy the french be when a claim be set up in he behalf to a share in this magnificent discovery as for adam himself we be tell that by no word do he show resentment at the loss of the practical consummation of he discovery he part in any controversy that arise be calm and dignified but for a time he friend fight a public battle for he fame it so happen that the public take a keener interest than it usually take in scientific prediction but the discussion have now settle down all the world honor the bright genius and mathematical skill of john couch adam and recognize that he first solve the problem by calculation all the world too perceive clearly the no less eminent mathematical talent of m leverrier but it recognize in he something more than the mere mathematician -- the man of energy decision and character -lrb- 1846 -rrb- the acquisition of californium henry b dawson in the history of the united state the acquisition of californium carry with it that of new mexico be a peculiar and unusual event and one of immense significance in the expansion and development of the republic together with the annexation of texa it be the most important result of the mexican war the californium country formerly a indeterminate territory of vast extent be settle by spanish missionary in the seventeenth century they settlement within the present limit of the state of californium date from the first foundation of san diego in 1769 in 1822 the entire region call californium become a part of the mexican republic and it remain a possession of mexico until the time of the transfer describe below at the beginning of 1846 the population of californium include with about two hundred thousand indian six thousand mexican and perhaps two hundred american war against mexico have be declare in may 1845 and already general taylor have win the battle of palo alto and resaca de la palma and have compel the surrender of monterey while these operation be lead the united state force to the rapid accomplishment of they work in mexico proper other movement be undertake the execution and outcome of which form the subject of mr dawson 's narrative in 1848 californium and new mexico be cede to the united state immediately after the opening of hostility in the valley of the rio grande -lrb- march 1846 -rrb- among the expedition which be organize by the federal authority be one to move against and take possession of californium and new mexico two province in the northern part of the enemy 's country the command of this expedition have be vest in general stephen w kearney and the force under he command have rendezvous at fort leavenworth and the most energetic measure have be adopt to insure its early departure and its ultimate success have complete all the arrangement on June 26th the main body of this expedition have move from the fort and after a rapid but interesting march of eight hundred seventy-three mile on August 18th it enter and take possession of santa fé the capital of new mexico the mexican force numbering four thousand which have be collect to defend the town have disperse without offer the least opposition as it approach while these operation in new mexico and on the western frontier of the united state be take place brevet-captain john c frémont who have be engage in exploration on the western slope of the rocky mountain have also revolutionize the province of californium and to some extent at least have anticipate the movement of the expedition command by general kearney the character of he mission be scientific and peaceful rather than warlike he have not have a officer or soldier of the regular army in he company and he whole force have consist of sixty-two man employ by himself for security against the indian and for procure subsistence in the wilderness and desert country through which he have pass for the purpose of obtain game for he man and grass for he horse in a uninhabited part of californium he have during the winter of 1845-1846 solicit and obtain permission from the mexican authority to winter in the valley of san joaquin but he have scarcely establish himself before he receive advice that the mexican commander be prepare to attack he under the pretext that under the cover of a scientific mission he be exciting the american settler in that vicinity to revolt in view of this threaten attack and for the purpose of repel it lieutenant frémont immediately occupy a mountain which overlook monterey -- although it be thirty mile from that city -- and have intrench it and raise the flag of the united state he wait the approach of the enemy after remain there until march 10 1846 he retire to the northward intend to march by way of oregon to the united state but about the middle of may after he have quietly pass into oregon he have receive information through samuel neal and levus sigler two hunter who have be send after he from lassen 's _ rancho _ that the mexican governor of californium be pursue he while the indian by whom he be surround instigate by the enemy have show sign of hostility and have kill or wound five of he man under these circumstance on June 6 1846 lieutenant frémont have resolve to turn on he pursuer with the little party under he command and to seek safety not merely in the overthrow of he pursuer but in that of the entire government of mexico in the province of californium accordingly on June 11th lieutenant frémont assist by captain merritt and fourteen of the settler have attack and capture a escort of horse destine for general castro 's troops -- lieutenant arce fourteen man and two hundred horse remain in he hand as the trophy of he victory on the 15th the military post of sonoma be surprised and general vallejo captain vallejo colonel greuxdon and several other officer nine piece of brass cannon two hundred fifty stand of musket and other store and arm be take and on the 25th the military commandant of the province who have move toward the post with a heavy force to retake it be attack by lieutenant frémont and twenty man and completely route have thus clear that part of the province north of the bay of san francisco of the enemy it be say that on July 5th captain frémont have assemble the american settler at sonoma address they upon the danger of they situation and recommend a declaration of independence and war on mexico as the only remedy and that the hardy frontiersman promptly accept the proposal and raise the flag of independent californium -- a bear and a star on a red ground while these revolutionary movement be destroy the power of mexico in the interior of the province of californium and the expedition under general kearney -- ignorant of the fact that the work have be do already -- be approach its eastern border for the same purpose the naval force of the united state in the pacific under commodore sloat have be assist in the work of conquest have hear of the opening of hostility on the rio grande the commodore -- then at mazatlan -- hasten with the savannah to monterey in californium where he arrive on July 2d and on the 7th he take possession of the town without opposition the custom-house be seize the american flag raise and californium declare to be henceforward a part of the united state within a few day intelligence of the action of commodore sloat be receive by the revolutionary leader at sonoma and a battalion of mount rifleman which have be organize among they be immediately move to monterey the flag of the united state be substitute for the bear and star and the authority of the commodore be immediately recognize this battalion of mount rifleman on its arrival at monterey July 23 1846 be muster into the service of the united state by commodore stockton who have succeed commodore sloat in command of the squadron -- captain frémont be appoint its commandant and lieutenant a h gillespie of the marine its second officer -- and it be immediately despatch on the sloop-of-war cyane to san diego for the purpose of cut off the retreat of general castro of the mexican service who have encamp and fortify he position near ciudad de los angele while the commodore with he sailor -- who land from the congress at san pedro -- move against he in front the expedition be eminently successful as the mexican on the approach of the commodore immediately evacuate they camp and flee in the greatest confusion -- although most of the principal officer be subsequently capture -- and on August 13th the ciudad de los angele be occupy again without opposition by the american troops and seaman and the conquest of californium be apparently complete a short time afterward commodore stockton appoint captain frémont governor of the territory into which by the proclamation of commodore sloat the province have be transform while captain gillespie be leave with nineteen man in possession of lo angele lieutenant talbot of the topographical engineer with nine man be leave at santa barbara and with he squadron commodore stockton proceed to san francisco while governor frémont on September 8th also move to monterey the main body have no sooner left lo angele than the californian -- who before the departure of the commodore and the governor have hold secret meeting for the purpose -- rise in arm for the expulsion of the invader of they country indeed a attempt appear to have be intend before the governor leave the city but by timely precaution it have be prevent although the purpose and determination still continue and be call into requisition at a more convenient season the necessary preparation have be make for that purpose under the direction of josé antonio carrillo a profess conspirator of that vicinity at a early hour on the morning of September 23d the quarter of captain gillespie be attack by cerbulo varelum -- a metamorphose captain under governor frémont -- at the head of sixty-five man under cover of a thick fog the morning be auspicious for such purpose yet the captain be not surprised and the twenty-one rifle which he control be quickly bring to bear on the assailant who retire soon afterward with three of they number kill and several wound and at daylight the remainder be drive from the town with the loss of several take prisoner by a few man under lieutenant hensley and doctor gilchrist of the navy the insurgent who be thus expel from the city form a nucleus around which the disaffected gather and as the party gain strength day by day it harass the little garrison and kill one of its number there be but little concert of action in its rank however and as the rival aspirant to power struggle for authority while the number rapidly increase the efficiency of the insurgent be but slightly increase at length in a spirit of compromise captain antonio flore be urge to take the command of the party and reluctantly accept it and he soon find himself at the head of six hundred man arm with lance _ escopeta _ and a brass six-pounder light and well mount in the mean time the little garrison have find a old honeycombed iron six-pounder and have drill out the spike clean and mount it and by melt the lead pipe of a distillery have provide -- unknown to the insurgent -- thirty round of ball and grape for it two other piece have be add to this on the follow day the little garrison and its gallant commander resolve to die rather than surrender notwithstanding the extreme effort which have be make to strengthen its position and the great fatigue which be incident thereto to render he little party still more secure however on September 27th captain gillespie withdraw he command from he quarter in the city and occupy a height which command it when he strengthen he position and prepare for a obstinate defense no sooner have this movement be effect than captain flore send don eulogeo celi to inquire on what term captain gillespie would surrender the city and that officer after consult with he subordinate answer that if the enemy would consent that he should march out of the city with the honor of war color fly and drum beat that he should take everything with he that he should be furnish with means for transport he baggage and provision at he own expense and that the enemy should not come within a league of he party while on its line of march to san pedro he would accept those term and no other would be consider and captain flore should be hold responsible for any damage which might ensue in case they be reject after some negotiation these term be offer by captain flore and accept by captain gillespie and on September 29th the garrison begin its march reach san pedro on the same evening and on October 4th embark on the vandalium after spike its three old gun -- a exploit which when the circumstance under which captain gillespie 's force the strength of he opponent and the temper of the people among whom he move be take into consideration may well be rank as one of the most brilliant feat of that remarkable campaign while these difficulty be surround captain gillespie at lo angele lieutenant talbot at santa barbara with he nine man be not less dangerously situated and when the former have make term with the insurgent manuel garpio with two hundred man move against lieutenant talbot surround the town and demand he surrender offer two hour for he deliberation as the man have resolve that they would not give up they arm and as the barracks be untenable with so small a force the lieutenant resolve to abandon the town and push for the hill and strange to say he marshal he man and march out of the town without opposition -- those who lay on the road retreat to the main force which be on the lower side of the town have reach the hill he encamp and remain there eight day when the californian endeavor to rout he out but be repulse with the loss of a horse the insurgent then offer he he arm and freedom if he would engage to remain neutral in the anticipated hostility but he send word back that he prefer to fight they next build fire about he and burn he out but in do so they do not capture or injure he and he push through the mountain for monterey and after a month 's travel in which he endure unheard-of hardship and suffer he reach that place in safety intelligence of the insurrection have reach commodore stockton at san francisco and lieutenant-colonel frémont at sacramento both take immediate step to check its progress and to punish the offender in conformity with the commodore 's order lieutenant-colonel fremont hasten to san francisco whence he embark with one hundred sixty man on the ship sterling for santa barbara to which port the frigate savannah -lrb- captain mervine -rrb- have previously be order while on the same day the commodore in person sail for the same port in the congress the latter vessel reach san pedro on October 6th and at sunrise on the 7th captain mervine land with he seaman and marine and after be join by captain gillespie and he brave-hearted little party he find himself at the head of three hundred ten man as brave and as valiant as ever be lead to battle upon any field at eight o'clock the party commence its march toward lo angele captain gillespie be in advance and when the column reach the hill of palo verde the insurgent show themselves and open a fire with they _ escopeta _ the march be rapid and the jolly tar unused to such extend journey appear to have suffer from its effect in consequence of which although the enemy gradually fall back before the advance column between one and two o'clock when near the rancho de los domingos fourteen mile from san pedro it become necessary to halt and encamp for the night as may have be expect the sailor and marine be ashore and the strict discipline which the deck have inculcate appear to have be leave on board the frigate as a necessary consequence the camp display but little of the order which such a locality should have insure and many and marvellous be the adventure of that night while on the other hand the enemy profit by the delay by the moral effect of the disorder with which the march have be conduct and by the entire absence of any artillery on the follow morning at daylight the column be again put in motion and with captain gillespie 's man in front in still greater disorder than on the precede day it move toward lo angele twelve mile distant it have march only three mile when post behind a small stream which intersect the line of march the advance of the insurgent -- seventy-six man with a small fieldpiece under josé antonio carrillo -- be discover in front and as the column approach a fire be open on it which be answer with a characteristic shout the volunteer -- captain gillespie 's command -- press forward and by take advantage of the neighbor shelter they drive the enemy and compel he to abandon he fieldpiece but before it could be reach and take possession of captain mervine give order to withdraw with great indignation therefore the volunteer discontinue the action and after pick up he kill and wound -- harass by the enemy who press after the column and cover by the volunteer and sixteen marine under captain gillespie -- captain mervine slowly and sadly fall back to san pedro where he arrive about dark on the same day thirteen noble tar be bury on the island in front of san pedro the victim of this badly manage expedition on October 23d the commodore reach san pedro -- lieutenant-colonel frémont meanwhile have return to monterey -- and on the 31st he sail for san diego which have be invest by the insurgent and need assistance he reach that port a few day afterward and with the assistance of captain gillespie 's command the besieger be repel and a fort be erect to protect the town from similar trouble in future strenuous effort be make to obtain horse for the use of the troops with some degree of success and commodore stockton sail toward san pedro again during this temporary absence of the commodore the insurgent appear -lrb- on November 18 1846 -rrb- to have move against san diego a second time and be again drive back by captain gillespie and the volunteer and marine under he command and on December 3d a messenger come into the town bear a letter from general kearney apprise the commodore of he approach and express a wish that a communication might be open with he that he might be inform of the state of affair in californium it appear that after the general have take santa fé -lrb- on October 1st -rrb- he have move from that city with the regular cavalry which he have bring there soon afterward -lrb- October 7th -rrb- he have reduce he force to one hundred man -- send the remainder back to santa fé -- and after a interesting march overland on December 3 1846 he have reach warner 's _ rancherium _ the outpost of civilization in californium from there a letter have be despatch to san diego by mr stoke a

sixth to advance as best they could along the causeway in the tooth of the _ tête de pont _ despatch garland 's and clarke 's brigade through the field on the right to attack it in flank every gun be instantly direct against the assailant and though the day be bright and clear the cloud of smoke actually darken the air hoffman wave he sword cheer on the sixth but the shot tear and rip up they rank to such a degree that in a few minute they have lose ninety-seven man the brigade on the right suffer as severely one hundred man fall within the space of a acre still they press on till the eighth

bayonet the defender as they take aim at last officer and man mixed pell-mell some through the embrasure some over the wall rush or leap in and drive the garrison helter-skelter upon they reserve the _ tête de pont _ gain its gun be turn on the convent whence the mexican be still slaughter we gallant second and third duncan 's battery too hitherto in reserve be bring up and open with such rapidity that a bystander estimate the interval between the report at three seconds stun by this novel attack the garrison of san pablo slacken fire in a instant the third follow by dimmick 's artillery dash forward with the bayonet to storm the nearest bastion with a run they carry it the artillery burst over the curtain but at that moment a dozen white flag wave in they face the whole fortified position of churubusco be take meantime however a conflict as deadly as either of these be rage behind the mexican fortification soon after the battle commence scott send pierce 's and shield 's brigade by the leave through the field to attack the enemy in the rear on the causeway oppose to they be plant santa anna 's reserve -- four thousand foot and three thousand horse -- in a measure protect by a dense

take they place then dunn himself fall and immediately afterward lieutenant benjamin and he first sergeant meet the same fate the rifleman in the arch repel sally but quitman 's position be precarious till night terminate the conflict worth meanwhile have advance in like manner along the san cosme causeway drive the mexican from barricade to barricade till within two hundred fifty yard of the _

clarke 's to the leave he order they to break into the house burst through the wall and bear they way to the flank of the _ garita _ the plan have succeed perfectly at monterey nor do it fail here slowly but surely the sapper pass from house to house until at sunset they reach the point desire then worth order the attack lieutenant hunt bring up a light gun at a gallop and fire it through the

might the mexican gaze upon he face -lrb- 1847 -rrb- famine in ireland sir charle gavan duffy from the fact that its immediate cause be the almost complete failure of the potato crop due to the rot the great irish famine be know as the potato famine the crop that suffer so be that of 1845 and the famine begin in the following year and reach its climax in 1847 it be estimate that by this calamity two hundred thousand person perish many compensate feature in connection with this appalling distress have be point out some writer friendly toward ireland have declare that the famine prove one of the greatest blessing to the country that it hasten free trade better drainage of the island and the passage of the land improvement act that it relieve the overcrowded labor market lead to more scientific farming and in other way produce change that have be of lasting benefit but though all this be true the misfortune itself give to modern history one of its most harrowing chapter the population of ireland in 1845 be suppose to have be nearly nine million the manufacture be small and the people depend on the potato crop and have no other resource in time of scarcity for several year the potato yield have be abundant the country be comparatively prosperous and the temperance movement lead by father mathew promise a happier future a great harvest be expect in 1845 but almost at a single stroke this expectation be blast for although the crop be large the greater part of it be destroy in the ground and the potato that be gather rot in pit and storehouse the farmer tax all they means and energy to secure even a larger crop in 1846 but the blight of that year be even more fatal than the last to pinch want be add discouragement and the people sit in the shadow of a frightful catastrophe in vain the british government be call upon to give relief through parliament until in the autumn of 1846 parliamentary authority be obtain to grant baronial loan but these and every local endeavor to mitigate the suffering fail and the destructive work of the famine continue the number of victim increase to the end of that fatal year the horror of 1846 be more than equal by those of the year that follow and the woful picture present by sir charle gavan duffy the distinguished irish patriot statesman and historian be but too amply justify by the accept record of the time the condition of ireland at the opening of the year 1847 be one of the most painful chapter in the annals of mankind a industrious and hospitable race be in the pang of a devour famine death of individual of husband and wife of entire family be become common the potato-blight have spread from the atlantic to the caspian but there be more suffer in one parish of mayo than in all the rest of europe from connaught where distress be greatest come batch of inquest with the horrible verdict die of starvation in some instance the victim be bury wrap in a coarse coverlet a coffin be too costly a luxury the living await death with a listlessness that be at once tragic and revolting woman with dead child in they arm be see beg for a coffin to bury they béranger have touch a thousand heart by the picture of _ pauvre jacque _ who when the tax-gatherer come in the king 's name be discover dead on he miserable pallet but at skibbereen in the fruitful county cork whose seaport be throng with vessel laden with corn cattle and butter for england the rate collector tell a more tragic tale some house he find desert the owner have be carry to they grave in one cabin there be no other occupant than three corpse in a once prosperous home a woman and she child have lie dead and unburied for a week in the field a man be discover so fearfully mangled by dog that identification be impossible the relief committee of the society of friend describe the state of the town in language which it be hard to read with dry eye the people be die of the unaccustomed food which mock they prayer for daily bread and be carry to the graveyard in a coffin from which the benevolent stranger who have come to they relief have to drop they like dead dog that there might be a cover for the next corpse in its turn this place be one mass of famine disease and death the poor creature hitherto try to exist on one meal a day be now sink under fever and bowel complaint unable to come for they soup which be not fit for they rice be what they whole cry be for but we can not manage this well nor can we get the food carry to the house from dread of infection i have get a coffin construct with movable side to convey the body to the churchyard in calico bag prepare in which the remains be wrap up i have just send it to bring the remains of a poor creature to the grave who have be turn out of the only shelter she have a miserable hut perish the night before last in a quarry the people see the harvest they have rear carry away to another country without a effort for the most part to retain it the sole food of the distressed class be indian-meal which have pay freight and storage in england and have be obtain in exchange for english manufacture under a recent law a peasant who accept public relief forfeit he holding and thousand be eject under this cruel provision but landowner be not content with one process alone they close on the people with ejectment turn they out on the road and pluck down they rooftree in more than one county rent fall due in November for land that no longer yield food to the cultivator be enforce in January in the southwest the peasantry have make some frantic effort to clutch they harvest and to retaliate for they suffering in blind vengeance but the law carry a sharp sword eight county or part of county be proclaimed and a special commission after a brief sit in clare and limerick leave eleven peasant for the gallows chief justice blackburn take occasion to note that the state of thing in 1847 be exactly that describe by a act pass in 1776 the disease be permanent so be the symptom one well-head of irish discontent be english prejudice which refuse to listen to any complaint till it threaten to become dangerous it be a fearful time for man who love they country not only with deep affection but with a wise and forecasting interest a revolution of the worst type be in progress not the present alone but the future be be lay waste the marvellous reform accomplish by father mathew the self-reliance which have grow up in the era of monster meeting and the moral teaching of davi and he friend be be fast swallow up by this calamity the youth and manhood of the middle class be scramble for pauper place from the board of work and the peasant be be transform into mendicant by process of law these calamity relate of a distant and savage tribe would move a generous heart but see they befall we own people the child of the same mother and foresee all the black unfathomable misery they foreshadow it be hard to preserve the sober rule of reason the gentry who be responsible in the first place for the protection of the people from whom they draw they income insist that the calamity be a imperial one and ought to be bear out of the exchequer of the empire it be a equitable claim if there be no irresistible title of brotherhood at lowest the stronger nation have snatch away from the weaker the power of help itself and still draw away during this terrible era half a million pound every month in the shape of absentee rent the demand be put aside contemptuously the claim of the nationalist to reënter on the management of they own affair since it be plain england could not manage they successfully be treat as sedition we be proffer instead of we own resource which be ample -- alms from scornful hand to hand in chain bitterer to taste than death all the nation of the earth be appeal to and they give generously but the result be far from be proportionate to the need during the year 1846 the contribution fall short of two thousand pound a week and it be not forget that after the great fire of london when the citizen be in deep distress the irish contribute twenty thousand fat cattle for they relief which at they present value would amount to a sum greater than england and europe send to the aid of ireland in 1846 to lie down and die like cattle in a murrain be base no people be bind to starve while they soil produce food cultivate by they own hand no other people in europe would have submit to such a fate but the leader whom they be accustom to follow have involve himself in a tangle of false doctrine by he unhappy peace resolution and he exhort they to endure all with patience and submission he son have the amazing assurance to add that if they starve with complete resignation the repeal of the union be near at hand on the relief committee doctor clergyman and country gentleman bear the burden of the work but a multitude of the gentry stand apart as if the transaction do not concern they they be busy in transfer the harvest to england or clear the population off they estate the english official in ireland accuse they of job in public work or quarter they relation and dependent on the relief fund as overseer and in some extreme case of obtain grant for they own family of money design for the suffering poor on they estate the benevolence of the minority could not counterbalance these odious offence and deadly hatred be sow which have since bear a abundant harvest the state of the country grow worse from day to day it be difficult now to realize the condition of the western population in the autumn of 1847 but a witness of unexceptionable impartiality have paint it in permanent color a young englishman represent the society of friend who in that tragic time do work worthy of the good samaritan report what he see in mayo and galway in language which for plain vigor rival the narrative of defoe this be what he see in westport : the town of westport be in itself a strange and fearful sight like what we read of in beleaguered city its street crowd with gaunt wanderer saunter to and fro with hopeless air and hunger-stricken look a mob of starve almost naked woman around the poorhouse clamor for soup ticket we inn the headquarters of the road-engineer and pay-clerk beset by a crowd beg for work as he approach galway the rural population be find to be in a more miserable condition : some of the woman and child that we see on the road be abject case of poverty and almost naked the few rag they have on be with the greatest difficulty hold together and in a few week as they be utterly unable to provide themselves with fresh clothes unless they be give they they must become absolutely naked and in another district : as we go along we wonder be not that the people die but that they live and i have no doubt whatever that in any other country the mortality would have be far greater that many life have be prolonged perhaps save by the long apprenticeship to want in which the irish peasant have be train and by that lovely touching charity which prompt he to share he scanty meal with he starve neighbor the fisherman of the cladagh who be induce to send the whig attorney-general to parliament a few month before have to pledge the implement of they call for a little daily bread even the very net and tackle of these poor fisherman i hear be pawn and unless they be assist to redeem they they will be unable to take advantage of the herr shoal even when they approach they coast in order to ascertain the truth of this statement i go into two or three of the largest pawnshop the owner of which fully confirm it and say they have in pledge at least a thousand pound ' worth of such property and see no likelihood of its be redeem in a rural district which he revisit after a interval he paint a scene which can scarcely be match in the annals of a mediaeval plague : one poor woman whose cabin i visit say ` there will be nothing for we but to lie down and die ' i try to give she hope of english aid but alas she prophecy have be too true out of a population of two hundred forty i find thirteen already dead from want the survivor be like walk skeleton the man gaunt and haggard stamp with the livid mark of hunger the child cry with pain the woman in some of the cabin too weak to stand when there before i have see cow at almost every cabin and there be besides many sheep and pig own in the village but now all the sheep be go all the cow all the poultry kill only one pig leave the very dog which have bark at I before have disappear no potato no oats the young man point the moral which these horrible spectacles suggest with laudable courage : i would not now discuss the cause of this condition nor attempt to apportion blame to its author but of this one fact there can be no question : that the result of we social system be that vast number of we fellow-countryman -- of the peasantry of one of the richest nation the world ever know -- have not leave to live surely such a social result as this be not only a national misfortune but a national sin cry loudly to every christian citizen to do he utmost to remove it no one of we can have a right to enjoy either riches or repose until to the extent of he ability he strive to wash himself of all share in the guilt of this fearful inequality which will be a blot in the history of we country and make she a byword among the nation the weekly return of the dead be like the bulletin of a fierce campaign as the end of the year approach village and rural district which have be prosperous and populous a year before be desolate in some place the loss amount to half the resident population even the poorhouse shut up and pauper do not escape more than one in six perish of the unaccustomed food the people do not everywhere consent to die patiently in armagh and down group of man go from house to house in the rural district and insist on be feed in tipperary and waterford corn store and baker ' shop be sack in donegal the people seize upon a flour-mill and pillage it in limerick five thousand man assemble on tory hill and declare that they would not starve a local clergyman restrain they by the promise of speedy relief if the government do not act promptly he himself would show they where food could be have in a few case crop be carry away from farm the offence which spring from suffer and fear be hear of in many district but they be encounter with instant resistance there be thirty thousand man in red jacket carefully feed clothe and lodge ready to maintain the law four prisoner be convict at the galway assizes of steal a filly which they kill and eat to preserve they own life in enniskillen two boy under twelve year of age be convict of steal one pint of indian-meal cook into stirabout and chief justice blackburn vindicate the outraged law by transport they for seven year other child commit larceny that they might be send to jail where there be still daily bread to be have in mayo the people be eat carrion wherever it could be procure and the coroner could not keep pace with the inquest for the law sometimes spend more to ascertain the cause of a pauper 's death than would suffice to preserve he life the social disorganization be a spectacle as afflict as the waste of life it be the waste of whatever make life worth possess all the institution which civilize and elevate the people be disappear one after another the church be half empty the temperance reading-room be shut up the mechanic ' institute no longer get support only the jail and the poorhouse be crowd a new generation bear in disease and rear in destitution pitiless and imbecile threaten to drag down the nation to hopeless slavery trade be paralyzed no one buy anything which be not indispensable at the hour the loss of the farmer in potato be estimate at more than twenty million sterling and with the potato the pig which feed on they disappear the seed procure at a high price in spring again fail time money and labor be lose and another year of famine be certain all who depend on the farmer have sink with he shopkeeper be beggar tradesman be starve the priest live on voluntary offering be sometimes in fearful distress when the people have no longer anything to offer the poor-rate be quite inadequate to support the burden throw upon it by the suspension of public work but there be another claim upon it which could not wait when the election be over and the government majority secure the treasury call on the poor-law guardian to levy immediately a special rate for the repayment of a million and a quarter lend by the state in a previous year they be warn that if they refuse they board would be dissolve and the rate levy by the authority of the commissioner the guardian in many district declare that a additional rate could not be collect all that could be get would be too little to support the distressed class but the treasury would listen to no excuse and a dozen board be dissolve and pay guardian put in they place the treasury have lend seven million sterling in 1846 five million of it have be spend in make road which be not need nor desire and one million be divert from the wages fund to purchase land for this experiment the aid which the stronger country propose to give to the weaker from the treasury to which both contribute be the remission of one-third of this debt a blunder in foreign policy the escapade of a ambitious minister in indium or africa have cost the british taxpayer more in a month than he spend to save million of fellow-subject beyond the irish sea when the increase mortality be press on the attention of the government lord john russell reply that the owner of property in ireland ought to support the poor bear on they estate it be a perfectly just proposition if the ratepayer be empower to determine the object and method of the expenditure but prohibit productive work and force they to turn strong man into pauper and keep they swelter in workhouse instead of labor to reclaim the waste land -- this be not justice the _ time _ comment on the new policy declare that ireland be as well able to help herself as france or belgium and that the whole earth be do duty for inhuman irish landlord a unanswerable case if ireland like france and belgium have the power of collect and apply she own revenue otherwise not difficult to answer the people flee before the famine to england america and the british colony they carry with they the seed of disease and death in england a bishop and more than twenty priest die of typhus catch in attendance on the sick and die the english people clamor against such a infliction which it can not be deny would be altogether intolerable if these fugitive be not make exile and pauper by english law they be order home again that they might be support on the resource of they own country for though we have no country for the purpose of self-government and self-protection we be acknowledge to have a country when the necessity of bear burden arise more than a hundred thousand soul flee to the united state and canada the united state maintain sanitary regulation on shipboard which be effectual to a certain extent but the emigration to canada be leave to the individual greed of shipowner and the emigrant-ship rival the cabin of mayo or the fever-shed of skibbereen crowd and filthy carry double the legal number of passenger who be ill-fed and imperfectly clothe and have no doctor on board the hold say a eyewitness be like the black hole of calcutta and death occur in myriad the survivor on they arrival in the new country continue to die and to scatter death around they at montreal during nine week eight hundred emigrant perish and over nine hundred resident die of disease catch from emigrant during six month the death of the new arrival exceed three thousand no preparation be make by the british government for the reception or the employment of these helpless multitude the _ time _ pronounce the neglect to be a eternal disgrace to the british name ship carry german emigrant and english emigrant arrive in canada at the same time in a perfectly healthy state the chief secretary for ireland be able to inform the house of common that of a hundred thousand irishman who flee to canada in a year six thousand one hundred perish on the voyage four thousand one hundred on they arrival five thousand two hundred in the hospital and one thousand nine hundred in the town to which they repair the emigrant society of montreal paint the result during the whole period of the famine in language not easily to be forget : from grosse island up to port sarnium along the border of we great river on the shore of lake ontario and erie wherever the tide of immigration have extend be to be find one unbroken chain of grave where repose father and mother sister and brother in a commingled heap -- no stone mark the spot twenty thousand and upward have go down to they grave this be the fate which be befall we race at home and abroad as the year 1847 close there be not many of we who would not have give we life cheerfully to arrest this ruin if we could only see a possible way -- but no way be visible -lrb- 1848 -rrb- migration of the mormon thoma l kane among the numerous religious body that have grow up in the united state the sect of mormon officially call the church of jesus christ of latter-day saint be perhaps the most unique in its origin and organization and the most singular in its history the sect be found in 1830 by joseph smith of vermont he declare that he have discover one of its authoritative writings the _ book of mormon _ at cumorah new york this book he say be find by he bury in the earth at a place reveal to he by a angel accord to the mormon the book write in mystic character on golden plate be a record of certain ancient people -- the long-lost tribe of israel smith declare -- inhabit north america this book be say to have be abridge by the prophet mormon and translate by smith by anti-mormon it be suppose to be base on a manuscript romance write by solomon spauld the mormon church be govern by a hierarchy with two order of priesthood a president two counsellor twelve apostle and elder and other officer peculiar as they polity appear it have prove remarkably successful in the development of they church and community notwithstanding stern hostility and widespread disapproval they present a impressive example of shrewdness thrift and administrative skill result in great material prosperity besides they separate book they accept the bible as authoritative and many of they doctrine and rite resemble those common to the christian sect more than anything else they teaching and they practice of polygamy have bring they into collision with gentile and with the united state government the first mormon settlement be at kirtland ohio the next be in missourus from those state they be expel and in 1840 they found nauvoo in illinois they later experience up to they permanent establishment in utah be recount in the follow narrative of the hardship endure and surmount by this extraordinary people but it should be add that the cause of the exodus be not as be generally suppose religious persecution the leader of the sect at nauvoo have set up a bank without capital and pass thousand of its worthless note upon the unsuspecting farmer and trader and it be this and other crime that exasperate the inhabitant of that region to the point of drive away the whole community of mormon once while ascend the upper mississippus in the autumn when its water be low i be compel to travel by land past the region of the rapid

and see no one : i hear no movement : though the stillness everywhere be such that i hear the fly buzz and the ripple break against the shallows of the beach i walk through the solitary street the town lay as in a dream under some deadening spell of loneliness from which i almost fear to wake it plainly it have not sleep long there be no grass grow in the paved way and rain have not wash away the print of footstep in the dust yet i go about unchecked i go into empty ropewalk workshop and smithy the spinner 's wheel be idle the carpenter have go from he workbench and leave he sash and case unfinished fresh bark be in the tanner 's vat and the fresh chop lightwood stand pile against the baker 's oven the blacksmith 's shop be cold but he coal-heap and ladling-pool and crooked water-horn be all there as if he have just go off for a holiday no workpeople anywhere look to know my errand if i go into the garden clink the wicket latch loudly after I to pull the marigold heartsease and lady 's - slipper and draw a drink with the water-sodden well-bucket and its noisy chain or knock off with my stick the tall heavy-headed dahlia and sunflower hunting among the bed for cucumber and love-apple -- no one call out to I from any open window no dog spring forward to bark a alarm i could have suppose the people hide in the house but the door be unfastened and when at last i timidly enter i find dead ash cold upon the hearth and have to tread on tiptoe as if walk down the aisle of a country church to avoid rousing irreverent echo from the naked floor on the outskirts of the town be the city graveyard but there be no record of plague there nor do it in any wise differ much from other protestant american cemetery some of the mound be not long sod some of the stone be newly set they date recent and they black inscription glossy in the hardly dry lettering-ink beyond the graveyard out in the field i saw in one spot hard by where the fruited bough of a young orchard have be tear down the still smolder ember of a barbecue fire that have be construct of rail from the fencing around it it be the latest sign of life there field upon field of heavy-headed grain lay rot ungathered upon the ground no one be at hand to take in they rich harvest as far as the eye could reach they stretch away -- they sleep too in the hazy air of autumn only two portion of the city seem to suggest the import of this mysterious solitude in the southern suburb the house look out upon the country show by they splintered woodwork and wall batter to the foundation that they have lately be the mark of a destructive cannonade and in and around the splendid temple which have be the chief object of my admiration armed man be barrack surround by they stack of musketry and piece of heavy ordnance these challenge I to render a account of myself and to tell the reason why i have have the temerity to cross the water without a write permit from a leader of they band though these man be generally more or less under the influence of ardent spirit after i have explain myself as a pass stranger they seem anxious to gain my good opinion they tell I the story of the dead city : that it have be a notable manufacturing and commercial mart shelter over twenty thousand person that they have wage war with its inhabitant for several year and have be finally successful only a few day before my visit in a action fight in the ruin suburb after which they have drive they forth at the point of the sword the defense they say have be obstinate but give way on the third day 's bombardment they also conduct I inside the massive sculptured wall of the curious temple in which they say the banish inhabitant be accustom to celebrate the mystic rite of a unhallowed worship they particularly point out to I certain feature of the building which have be the peculiar object of a former superstitious regard they have as matter of duty sedulously defile and deface the reputed site of certain shrine they have thus particularly notice and various sheltered chamber in one of which be a deep well construct they believe with a dreadful design besides these they lead I to see a large and deeply chiselled marble vase or basin support upon twelve ox also of marble and of life size and of which they tell some romantic story they say the deluded person most of whom be emigrant from a great distance believe they deity countenance they reception here of a baptism of regeneration as proxy for whomsoever they hold in warm affection in the country from which they have come : that here parent go into the water for they lost child child for they parent widow for they spouse and young person for they lover : that thus the great vase come to be associate with all they most cherish memory and be therefore the chief object of all other in the building upon which they bestow the greatest degree of they idolatrous affection on this account the victor have so diligently desecrate it as to render the apartment in which it be contain too noisome to abide in they permit I also to ascend into the steeple to see where it have be strike by lightning on the sabbath before and to look out east and south on waste farm -- like those i have see near the city -- extend till they be lose in the distance close to the scar leave by the thunderbolt be fragment of food cruse of liquor and broken drinking-vessel with a bass-drum and a steamboat signal-bell of which with pain i learn the use it be after nightfall when i be ready to cross the river on my return the wind have freshen since sunset and the water beat roughly into my little boat i head higher up the stream than the point i have leave in the morning and land where a faint glimmering light invite I to steer among the rush -- sheltered only by the darkness without roof between they and the sky -- i come upon a crowd of several hundred human creature whom my movement rouse from uneasy slumber dreadful indeed be the suffering of these forsake being cow and cramp by cold and sunburn alternate as each weary day and night drag on they be almost all of they the cripple victim of disease they be there because they have no home nor hospital nor poorhouse nor friend to offer they any they could not minister to the need of they sick they have no bread to quiet the fractious hungry cry of they child mother and babe daughter and grandparent all alike be clothe in tatters lack even sufficient cover for the fever-stricken sufferer these be the mormon famish in lee county iowa in the fourth week of the month of September 1846 the desert city be nauvoo illinoi the mormon be the owner of that city and the smile country around it and those who have stop they plough who have silence they hammer they axis they shuttle and the wheel of they workshop those who have put out they fire who have eat they food spoil they orchard and trample under foot they thousand of acre of unharvested grain -- these be the keeper of they dwelling the carouser in they temple the noise of whose drunken rioting insult the ear of the die they be all tell not more than six hundred forty person who be thus lie on the river-flat but the mormon in nauvoo and its environs have be number the year before at over twenty thousand where be they they have last be see carry in mournful train they sick and wounded halt and blind to disappear behind the western horizon pursue the phantom of another home hardly anything else be know of they and people ask with curiosity what have be they fate -- what they fortune the party encounter by I at the river shore be the last of the mormon that leave the city they have all of they engage the year before that they would vacate they home and seek some other place of refuge it have be the condition of a truce between they and they assailant and as a earnest of they good faith the chief elder and some other of obnoxious standing with they family be to set out for the west in the spring of 1846 it have be stipulate in return that the rest of the mormon might remain behind in the peaceful enjoyment of they illinois abode until they leader with they explore party could with all diligence select for they a new place of settlement beyond the rocky mountain in californium or elsewhere and until they have opportunity to dispose to the best advantage of the property which they be then to leave some renew symptom of hostile feeling have however determine the pioneer party to begin they work before the spring it be of course anticipate that this would be a perilous service but it be regard as a matter of self-denying duty the ardor and emulation of many particularly the devout and the young be stimulate by the difficulty it involve and the rank of the party be therefore fill up with volunteer from among the most effective and responsible member of the sect they begin they march in midwinter and by the beginning of February nearly all of they be on the road many of they wagon have cross the mississippus on the ice under the most favor circumstance a expedition of this sort undertake at such a season of the year could scarcely fail to be disastrous but the pioneer company have to set out in haste and be very imperfectly supply with necessaries the cold be intense they move in the tooth of keen-edged northwest wind such as sweep down the iowa peninsula from the icebound region of the timber-shaded slave lake and lake of the wood along the scatter watercourse where they break the thick ice to give they cattle drink the annual autumn fire have leave but little firewood to man insufficiently furnished with tent and other appliance of shelter wood be almost a necessary of life after day of fatigue they night be often pass in restless effort to prevent themselves from freezing they stock of food also prove inadequate and as they constitution become more debilitate they suffering from cold increase afflict with catarrhal affection manacle by the fetter of dreadfully acute rheumatism some contrived for a while to get over the shorten day 's march and drag along some other but the sign of a impaired circulation soon begin to show itself in the liability of all to be dreadfully frost-bitten the hardiest and strongest become helplessly cripple about the same time the strength of they draught animal begin to fail the small supply of provender they could carry with they have give out the winter-bleached prairie straw prove devoid of nourishment and they could only keep they from starve by seek for the browse as it be call this be the green bark and tender bud and branch of the cottonwood and other stunt growth in the hollow to return to nauvoo be apparently the only escape but this would have be to give occasion for fresh mistrust and so to bring new trouble to those they have leave there behind they they resolve at least to hold they ground and to advance as they might be it only by limp through the deep snow a few slow mile a day they find a sort of comfort in compare themselves to the exile of siberium and seek consolation in earnest prayer for the spring the spring come at last it overtake they in the sac and fox country still on the naked prairie not yet half way over the trail they be follow between the mississippus and missourus river but it bring its own share of trouble with it the month with which it open prove nearly as try as the worst of winter the snow and sleet and rain which fall as it appear to they without intermission make the road over the rich prairie soil as impassable as one vast bog of heavy black mud sometimes they would fasten the horse and ox of four or five wagon to one and attempt to get ahead in this way take turn but at the close of a day of hard toil for themselves and they cattle they would find themselves a quarter or a half a mile from the place they leave in the morning the heavy rain raise all the watercourse the most trifling stream be impassable wood fit for bridge be often not to be have and in such case the only resource be to halt for the freshet to subside -- a matter in the case of the headwater of the chariton for instance of over three week ' delay these be dreary waiting upon providence the most spirited and sturdy murmured most at they force inactivity and even the woman whose heroic spirit have be proof against the severest cold confess they temper fluctuate with the ceaseless variation of the barometer they complain too that the health of they child suffer more it be the fact that the damp wind of march and April bring with they more mortal sickness than the sharpest freezing weather the frequent burial discourage and depress the hardiest spirit but the general hopefulness of human nature be well illustrate by the fact that even the most provident be find unfurnished with burial necessaries and as a result they be often drive to the most melancholy makeshift the usual expedient adopt be to cut a log of some eight or nine foot long and slit the bark longitudinally strip it off in two half-cylinder these place around the body of the deceased and bind firmly together with with make of alburnum form a rough sort of tubular coffin which survive relative and friend with a little show of black crape could follow to the hole or bit of ditch dig to receive it in the wet ground of the prairie the name of the deceased he age the date of he death and the surround landmark be all register with care he party be then ready to move on such grave mark all the line of the first year of mormon travel -- dispiriting milestone to fail straggler in the rear the hardship and trial which they have suffer develop a spirit of self-sacrifice among these indomitable people hale young man give up they own food and shelter to the old and helpless and work they way back to part of the frontier state chiefly missourus and iowa where they be not recognize and hire themselves out for wages to purchase more other be send there to exchange for meal and flour or wheat and corn the table-and bed-furniture and other remain article of personal property which a few have still retain in a kindred spirit of fraternity other lay out great farm in the wild and plant the grain save for they own bread that there might be harvest for those who should follow they two of these in the sac and fox country and beyond it garden grove and mount pisgah include within they fence about two mile of land each carefully plant with grain with a hamlet of comfortable log cabin in the neighborhood of each through all this the pioneer find comfort in the thought that they own suffering be the price of immunity from similar hardship they friend at home in follow they trail would otherwise have have to pay but the arrival of spring prove this a delusion before the warm weather have make the earth dry enough for easy travel messenger come in from nauvoo to overtake the party with fear-exaggerated tale of outrage and to urge the chief man to hurry back to the city that they might give counsel and assistance there the enemy have only wait until the emigrant be suppose to be go on they road too far to return to interfere with they and then renew they aggression the mormon outside nauvoo be indeed hard press but inside the city they maintain themselves very well for two or three month longer strange to say the chief part of this respite be devote to complete the structure of they quaintly devise but beautiful temple since the dispersion of jewry probably history afford we no parallel to the attachment of the mormon for this edifice every architectural element every most fantastic emblem it embody be associate for they with some cherish feature of they religion its erection have be enjoin upon they as a most sacred duty : they be proud of the honor it confer upon they city when it grow up in its splendor to become the chief object of the admiration of stranger upon the upper mississippus besides they have build it as a labor of love they could count up to half a million the value of they tithing and freewill offering lay upon it hardly a mormon woman have not give up to it some trinket or pin-money the poorest mormon man have at least serve the tenth part of he year on its wall and the coarsest artisan could turn to it with something of the ennobling attachment a artist have for he own creation therefore though they enemy drive on they ruthlessly they succeed in parry the last sword-thrust till they have complete even the gilding of the angel and trumpet on the summit of its lofty spire as a closing work they place on the entablature of the front like a baptismal mark on the forehead these word : the house of the lord : build by the church of jesus christ of latter-day saint holiness to the lord then at high noon under the bright sunshine of may the next after its completion they consecrate it to divine service there be a carefully study ceremonial for the occasion it be say the high elder of the sect travel furtively from the camp of israel in the wilderness and throw off ingenious disguise appear in they own robe of office to give it splendor for that one day the temple stand resplendent in all its typical glory of sun moon and star and other abound figure and letter sign hieroglyph and symbol but that day only the sacred rite of consecration end the work of remove the _ sacrosancta _ proceed with the rapidity of magic it go on through the night and when the morning of the next day dawn all the ornament and furniture everything that could provoke a sneer have be carry off and except some fixture that would not bear removal the building be dismantle this day see the departure of the last of the elder and the largest band that move in one company together the people of iowa have tell I that from morning to night they pass westward like a endless procession they do not seem greatly out of heart they say but at the top of every hill before they disappear they be to be see look back like banish moor on they abandon home and the distant temple and its glittering spire after this consecration which be construe to indicate a insincerity on the part of the mormon as to they stipulate departure or at least a hope of return they foe set upon they with renew bitterness as many flee as be at all prepared but by the very fact of they so decrease the already diminish force of the city 's defender they encourage the enemy to greater boldness it soon become apparent that nothing short of a immediate emigration could save the remnant from this time onward the energy of those already on the road be engross by the duty of provide for the fugitive who come crowd in after they at a last general meeting of the sect in nauvoo there have be pass a unanimous resolution that they would sustain one another whatever they circumstance upon the march and this though make in view of no such appalling exigency they now with one accord set themselves together to carry out the host again move on the tent which have gather on the hill summit like white bird hesitate to venture on the long flight over the river be strike one after another and the dweller in they and they wagon and they cattle hasten down to cross it at a ferry in the valley which they make by night and day a little beyond the landing they form they company and make they preparation for the last and longest stage of they journey though the season be late when they first cross the missourus some of they move forward with great hopefulness full of the notion of viewing and choose they new home that year but the van have only reach grand island and the pawnee village when they be overtake by more ill news from nauvoo before the summer close they enemy set upon the last remnant of those who be leave behind in illinoi they be a few lingerer who could not be persuade but there might yet be time for they to gather up they worldly goods before remove some weakly mother and they infant a few delicate young girl and many cripple and bereaved and sick people -- these have remain under shelter accord to the mormon statement at least by virtue of a express covenant in they behalf if there be such a covenant it be break a vindictive war be wage upon they from which the weakest flee in scatter party leave the rest to make a reluctant and almost ludicrously unavailing defense till September 17th when one thousand six hundred twenty-five troops enter nauvoo and drive all forth who have not retreat before that time like the wounded bird of a flock fire into toward nightfall they come straggle on with falter step many of they without bag or baggage beast or barrow all ask shelter or burial and force a fresh repartition of the already divide ration of they friend it be plain now that every energy must be tax to prevent the entire expedition from perish further emigration for the time be out of the question and the whole people prepared themselves for encounter another winter on the prairie happily for the main body they find themselves at this juncture among indian who be amicably dispose the land on both side of the missourus in particular be own by the pottawottomi and omaha two tribe whom unjust treatment by we united state government have the effect of render most hospitable to stranger whom they regard as persecute like themselves they be please with the mormon they would have be please with any whites who would not cheat they nor sell they whiskey nor whip they for they poor gypsy habit nor conduct themselves indecently toward they woman many of whom among the pottawottomi -- especially those of nearly unmixed french descent -- be singularly comely and some of they educate but all indian have something like a sentiment of reverence for the insane and admire those who sacrifice without apparent motive they worldly welfare to the triumph of a idea they understand the meaning of what they call a great vow and think it the duty of the right-minded to lighten the votary 's penance under it to this feeling they unite the sympathy of fellow-sufferer for those who could talk to they of they own illinoi and tell the story of how they also have be ruthlessly expel from it they hospitality be sincere almost delicate fanny le clerc the spoil child of the great brave pied riche interpreter of the nation would have the paleface miss devine learn duet with she on the guitar and the daughter of substantial joseph la framboise the united state interpreter for the tribe -lrb- she die of the fever that summer -rrb- welcome all the nicest young mormon woman to a party at she father 's house which be probably the best cabin in that village they make the mormon at home there and elsewhere upon all they land they formally give they leave to remain as long as suit they own good pleasure the affair of course furnished material for a solemn council under the auspices of a officer of the united state they chief be summon in the form befitting great occasion to meet in the yard of a mr pa sarpy 's log trading-house they come in grand costume move in they fantastic attire with so much _ aplomb _ and genteel measure that the stranger find it difficult not to believe they high-born gentleman attend a fancy-dress ball they aristocratically thin leg of which they display fully the usual indian proportion aid this illusion there be something too at all time very mock-indian in the theatrical french millinery tie of the pottawottomus turban while it be next to impossible for a sober white man at first sight to believe that the red green black blue and yellow cosmetic with which he see such grave personage so variously dot diapered cancel and arabesque be worn by they in any mood but one of the deepest and most desperate quiz from the time of they first squat upon the ground to the final break up of the council circle they sustain they character with equal self-possession and address i will not take it upon myself to describe they order of ceremony indeed i ought not since i have never be able to view the habit and custom of we aborigine in any other light than that of a sorrowful subject of jest besides in this instance the powwow and the expect flow of turgid eloquence be both moderate probably by the conduct of the entire transaction on temperance principle i therefore content myself with observe generally that the proceedings be such as in every way become the dignity of the party interested and the magnitude of the interest involve when the red man have indulge to satiety in tobacco-smoke from they peace-pipe and in what they love still better -- they peculiar metaphoric rhodomontade which begin with the celestial body and course downward over the grandest sublunary object always manage to alight at last on they great father polk and the tenderness with which he affectionate red child regard he all the solemn funny fellow present who play the part of chief sign formal article of convention with they unpronounceable name the renowned chief pie riche -- he be surname le clerc on account of he remarkable scholarship -- then rise and say : my mormon brethren the pottawottomus come sad and tired into this unhealthy missourus bottom not many year back when he be take from he beautiful country beyond the mississippus which have abundant game and timber and clear water everywhere now you be drive away the same from you lodge and land and the grave of you people so we have both suffer we must help one another and the great spirit will help we both you be now free to cut and use all the wood you may wish you can make all you improvement and live on any part of we actual land not occupy by we because one suffer and do not deserve it be no reason he shall suffer always : i say we may live to see all right yet however if we do not we child will _ bon jour _ and thus end the powwow i give this speech as a morsel of real indian it be recite to I after the treaty by the pottawottomus orator in french which language he speak with elegance _ bon jour _ -lrb- good day -rrb- be the french indian and english hail and farewell of the pottawottomi upon the pottawotomus land scatter through the border region of missourus and iowa in the sac and fox country a few among the ioway among the ponca in a great company upon the bank of the l'eau qui coulée -lrb- or run water -rrb- river and at the omaha winter quarter the mormon sustain themselves through the heavy winter of 1846-1847 it be the severest of they trial this winter be the turning-point of the mormon fortune those who live through it be spare to witness the gradual return of better time and they now liken it to the passing of a dreary night since which they have watch the come of a steadily brighten day in the spring of 1847 a body of one hundred forty-three pick man with seventy wagon draw by they best horse leave the omaha quarter under the command of the member of the high council who have winter there they carry with they little but seed and farming implement they aim be to plant spring crop at they ultimate destination they rely on they rifle to give they food but rarely leave they road in search of game they make long march and move as rapidly as possible against the season when ordinary emigration pass the missourus they be already through the south pass and after a couple of short day ' travel beyond it enter upon the more arduous part of they journey which now lay through the rocky mountain they pass fremont 's peak long 's peak the twin and other summit but have great difficulty to overcome in force they way over other mountain of the rugged utah range sometimes follow the stony bed of torrent the headwater of some of the mightiest river of we continent and sometimes literally cut they road through heavy and ragged timber they arrive at the grand basin of the great salt lake much exhaust but without lose a man and in time to plant for a partial autumn harvest another party start after these pioneer from the omaha winter quarter in the summer they have five hundred sixty-six wagon and carry large quantity of grain which they be able to sow before it freeze the same season these be join by a part of the battalion and other member of the church who come eastward from californium and the sandwich island together they fortify themselves strongly with sun-dried brick wall and blockhouse and live safely through the winter be able to reap crop that yield ample provision for the ensue year in 1848 nearly all the remain member of the church leave the missourus country in a succession of powerful band invigorate and enrich by they abundant harvest there and that year see fully establish they commonwealth of the new covenant the future state of deseret -lrb- footnote : the mormon repeatedly try to secure the admission of deseret into the union as a state under that name -- say to mean virtue and industry -rrb- when utah be organize as a territory -lrb- 1850 -rrb- the mormon leader brigham young be make governor in 1857 president buchanan appoint a non-mormon to succeed young this act lead the mormon to rebel but after a display of military force by the government they acknowledge allegiance in 1896 polygamy have be prohibit by congress utah be admit to the union since the settlement of the mormon upon the great salt lake there have be a large immigration into utah -lrb- the mormon have spread beyond that state into arizona idaho wyoming and other part of the west and southwest -- ed -rrb- -lrb- 1848 -rrb- the reform of pius ix franci bowen in the long roll of pontiff the name of pius ix stand conspicuous among those of pope who have greatly exert they power for effect upon the papacy itself but the influence of pius ix be not less marked in italian and european politics a account of the reform which he undertake and of the obstacle he have to confront can not fail to convey directly or by implication matter of much importance in modern history that a pope who signalize the beginning of he official career by a series of liberal reform should soon have be drive from he see by revolutionist be one of the historical paradox for which even the philosophy of history find it difficult to account but as one writer tell we the revolutionary fever of 1848 spread too fast for a reform pope and he refusal to make war upon the austrian finally cost he the affection of the roman pope pius ix -lrb- giovannus marium mastaus ferrettus -rrb- who at the age of fifty-four bring the power of he papal throne to advance the cause of young italy -- lead by mazzinus and other patriot -- be bear at sinigaglium may 13 1792 he be descend from a noble family and he early education be receive at the college of volterra throughout the year of he youth he suffer from infirm health but before reach thirty he gain much in strength and in 1827 become archbishop of spoleto in 1840 he be make cardinal by pope gregory xvi gregory die June 1 1846 and after be two day in conclave the cardinal elect they colleague ferrettus to succeed he the cardinal feel the advisability of choose for pope a native of the papal state a man not too far advance in year and one who would see the necessity of correct abuse and make some reform franci bowen whose review of pope pius 's career from he entrance upon the papal office until he temporary withdrawal from rome be here present be a well-known authority in this as also in other field of history and he recital be base upon the best contemporary account when pius ix be elect pope he course do not long remain doubtful he limit the expense of the court at once dispense alms in abundance set aside one day of each week for give audience and command that political inquisition should be stop immediately these few step take before he have have time to consult with other afford perhaps a better indication of the mild and kind character of the new pontiff than the grave political act which be subsequently perform these show we the man the other reveal only the sovereign just one month after he election a manifesto of amnesty for all political offender be publish at rome include the exile those await trial and those undergo sentence the only condition impose be that the individual pardon should give they word of honor never to abuse the indulgence and would fulfil every duty of a good citizen the news of this act fly like the wind through the papal state and cause everywhere a burst of exultation and gratitude toward the new sovereign it carry joy to thousand of household bring back to they the long-separated brother or parent and it be a token of future peace and contentment in the city say farinus -lrb- footnote : luigus carlo farinus who be freely quote by bowen be a italian historian and statesman he principal work be _ storium dello stato romano dall ' anno 1814 al 1830 _ -- ed -rrb- the hosanna be countless each citizen embrace he neighbor like a brother thousand of torch blaze in the evening the multitude run to the palace of the pope call for he throw themselves prostrate on the earth before he and receive he blessing in devout silence many of the pardon offender be still more extravagant in they demonstration of joy and thankfulness among they be gallettus of bologna afterward one of the pope 's minister and most active in those measure which end in the assassination of rossus and in drive pius into exile he have be sentence to imprisonment for life and be keep in the castle of sant ' angelo when release he throw himself at the pope 's foot and swear by he own heart 's blood and that of he child that he would be grateful and faithful some of the exile however among whom be mamiani refuse to subscribe the propose engagement simple as it be but they return after a time to they home merely promising allegiance every time that the pope leave he palace he be surround by a sort of triumphal procession the whole length of the corso be decorate when he pass

ciceruacchio he be a person of single mind rustic in manners proud and at the same time generous as be common with roman of the lower class by he industry he have acquire considerable property and by he liberal use of it have become a leader of the populace whom he now fire with he own enthusiasm for pius ix the pope would have be more than man if he head have not be a little turn with all this adulation which come to he from many foreign land as well as from italy but he simple and modest character bear the trial well he manifest no undue elation and form he plan tranquilly and without hurry for the improvement of he people cardinal gizzus well know as a friend to reform and much attach to the pope be name secretary of state and he write letter to the president of the province invite they the municipal magistrate ecclesiastic and all respectable citizen to prepare and offer scheme for promote popular education and especially for the moral religious and industrial instruction of the child of the poor commission be appoint to deliberate and advise upon many subject of propose reform great indeed be the need of change in the institution of the pontifical state but the government have a delicate part to play in amend they and it wisely determine not to be precipitate in its measure already the liberal have conceive boundless desire and the retrogradist be haunt with unreasonable fear the government have to-day to moderate on the left circulate despatch wellnigh to scold man for hope too much but the friend of change say farinus be for the most part measure in they wish and cautious in they proceedings for all prudent man be exert themselves strenuously to keep the impatient in hand with excellent effect we can not follow in detail the pope 's measure down to march 1848 till which period the movement may be consider as all he own emanate from he free choice and not from the pressure of outward circumstance or from revolution in foreign state he do enough during these twenty month to establish he character as a wise humane and liberal sovereign eager to promote the temporal and religious interest of he people and prompt to give political power into they hand as fast as they show themselves capable of use and not abuse it he institute a civic guard throughout he dominion model on the french national guard and disband the gregorian centurion and volunteer all he court be oppose to this measure as premature and dangerous and even cardinal gizzus resign he place in consequence of it but the pope persevere and cardinal ferrettus still more inclined to liberalism be appoint in he place he conceive the idea of a italian custom league after the model of the german one and press it with so much earnestness that in November 1847 it be institute for the roman tuscan and sardinian dominion and every effort be make to render it acceptable to the other power of italy he establish a municipal government for the city of rome which have hitherto remain without one and he create a council of state for all he dominion to consist chiefly of the laity one person be choose for each province by the sovereign out of a list of three nominate by the provincial authority this council be to sit in rome and aid the government with its advice in put the various department in order in constitute municipality and in other public concern he create also a council of minister which farini call the most important act of he reign as be that by which the executive power acquire a organization worthy of a civilized state and altogether novel in that of rome there be to be nine department and with the exception of the president of the council and its secretary the minister need not be cardinal all those first appoint however be cardinal or prelate a body of _ uditorus _ be attach to this council consist of twelve ecclesiastic and twelve layman all appoint by the sovereign the law respect the censorship of the press be much relax and numerous political journal be establish at rome which before have nothing that deserve the name of a newspaper we infant journalism say farinus have its infant passion and caprice instead of meditate it gambol and every day it smash its toy of the day before as child do it institute a school of declamation not of political knowledge it run and plunge about blindfold it make boast of a independent spirit and be a mean slave to out-of-doors influence these measure of reform and the enthusiasm which they create be not without effect on surround nation consider the place whence they come and the sovereign who conduct they they be adapt to have a vast influence rome the eternal city be regenerate and a new life bound through she old limb and the August head of the catholic church the greatest religious potentate of the civilized world the infallible the object of veneration to half christendom and hitherto the most despotic and conservative sovereign in europe be now the daring innovator the radical the idol of the populace austrium look on with distrust and dismay and try to pick a quarrel and thus find a pretext for invasion by order its troops who have as yet only garrison the fortress to occupy the city of ferrara and patrol its street -- a measure almost sure to lead to a collision with its citizen the pope protest in a firm but temperate tone and he indignant people would fain have hurry he into a war but he bridle they impatience and the matter end in a compromise tuscany catch the generous flame of freedom and though there be not so much to be accomplish there as the government have long be mild and discreet the good archduke -lrb- leopold ii -rrb- profess the utmost admiration for pius and begin to imitate he measure the king of sardinium be move to enthusiasm during the difficulty with austrium about ferrara he offer the pope whatever succor of ship or man he might need and a asylum in he dominion if he should be compel to leave rome he do more he relax the bond of the press improve the administration of justice deprive the police of they discretionary power enlarged and amend the council of state emancipate the commune and allow they officer to be choose by popular vote the character and example of pius seem likely to effect as great and as beneficial change out of he dominion as within they those of the italian sovereign who be not willing to follow he lead of they own accord be oblige to yield in dismay before the spirit which he have awaken in they subject the silly duke of lucca a fanatic a prodigal and a despot after attempt in vain to cudgel he people into submission flee in terror from they arouse wrath and consent to the annexation of he dominion to tuscany whereby they share in the reform institute by leopold but in sicily and naple be develop the most striking result of the fire which have be kindle by a reform pope the cruel and imbecile bourbon who reign there become only more harsh and obstinate while the other prince of italy deem it necessary to reform they institution and conciliate they people he subject petition he and shout for pius in the street but the soldiery be turn against they and the king show himself alike inaccessible to they caress and they prayer one king only say thier from the tribune speaking of italy he of naple present the sword 's point to the people who be flock around he and that people fall on it the impulsive sicilian fix January 12 1848 as the day beyond which they patience would not extend the king make no concession the day come and the island be revolutionize the troops everywhere give way before the excited populace within a fortnight the inhabitant of naple follow they example and before the fight begin the king 's heart fail he and he grant all that they ask the ministry be change a constitution be resolve upon and its fundamental principle be announce on January 29th while the administration pledge themselves to publish it complete within twelve day the king come out to meet the crowd who be cheer he and intimate he purpose to surpass the other sovereign of italy in the magnitude of he concession how sincere he promise be the lapse of a few month fully show but at present everything wear a cheerful aspect the pope have now reach the climax of he fortune the furthest limit of the good which he be permit to accomplish by he own free will and the sky begin to be overcast the enthusiasm of he people become unmanageable and the volcanic force of another french revolution be soon to burst and to prostrate half the government in europe by the explosion constant excitement for twenty month have make rome noisy and turbulent and the populace have be gratify so often that they now expect everything to succumb to they wish busy agitator be in the midst of they intent upon prosecute the plan of mazzinus and young italy and turn reform into revolution the people be mad for a declaration of war against austrium though the military strength of the roman state be grossly inadequate for such a conflict and the head of the catholic church be naturally reluctant to come to extremity with a catholic power which have long be the firmest support of the papacy then a cry be raise to exclude all ecclesiastic from office or at least to admit so large a portion of the laity into the administration that rome would be secularize and lose its distinctive character as a appanage for the head of the church the people would not consider or be reckless of the fact that pius be a devout catholic as well as a liberal sovereign and could not be expect to lend he aid to a project for strip the papacy of all temporal power if not for raze it to its foundation the cry of expulsion and death to the jesuit be also raise and as that body however obnoxious elsewhere have give no offence at rome the pope 's sense of justice inclined he to protect they and to resist the clamor of the mob the news from sicily and naple cause a great popular demonstration at rome the aspect of which be so threatening that pius issue a proclamation on February 10th announce that he have take measure for reorganize and enlarge the army and for augment the lay portion of the council of minister but appeal to he people in affect term by the proof already give of he solicitude in they behalf that they should cease from agitation and not make demand which could not be grant consistently with he duty and they own well-being this paper cause another effusion of popular gratitude a immense multitude collect in the piazza del papolo and accompany by the civic guard and bearing banner they set out for the pope 's palace when they come to the quirinal pius show himself at the balcony and make sign that he wish to speak there be a profound silence not break even by the trickle of the fountain which have be stop some day before the pope say : ` before the benediction of god descend upon you on the rest of my people and i say it again on all italy i pray you to be of one mind and to keep the faith which you have swear to I the pontiff ' at these word the silence of deep feeling be break by a sudden thunder of acclamation ` yes i swear ' and pius proceed : ' i warn you however against the raising of certain cry that be not of the people but of a few individual and against make any such request to I as be incompatible with the sanctity of the church for these i can not i may not and i will not grant this be understand with my whole soul i bless you ' deed follow word the ministry be change five layman be admit into it and it be intimate that a constitution would be grant resemble those in other state then come the news of the disaster at pari and everything be precipitate on march 10th the ministry be again change only three ecclesiastic be now admit into it and on the 14th the new constitution or fundamental statute be proclaim it institute a legislature in two branch the high council and the council of deputy the member of the former be appoint by the pope and those of the latter be choose by popular vote in the ratio as nearly as might be of one to every thirty thousand soul all citizen be voter who pay twelve crown a year in direct tax or have property amounting to three hundred crown to these be add all member of college and honorary graduate and all person hold office in the commune and municipality the legislature be to be convoke every year both council be to choose they own officer and they session be to be public except on extraordinary occasion when they might of they own accord prefer secrecy freedom of debate and vote be guarantee and the member of both house be protect from arrest even for notoriously criminal act during the session except by consent of the council to which they belong they be to have authority to make law on all subject except ecclesiastical matter and the canon and discipline of the church but include the imposition of tax the pope however like most monarch reserve to himself the right of negative a law all discussion also of the diplomatico-religious relation of the holy see with foreign power be forbid money bill be to originate in the lower house and direct tax could be grant for only a year the deputy have a right to impeach minister who if they be layman be to be try by the high council if ecclesiastic by the sacred college the unlimited right of petition to the lower house be assure and minister be responsible for every ministerial act they have the right of sit and debate but not of voting in both council a portion of the revenue of the state for the support of the cardinal the ecclesiastical congregation and generally for the transaction of purely ecclesiastical business be to be secure to the pope and to be bear on the estimate every year the judge be to be irremovable after they have hold office for three year and all person be declare equal in the sight of the law extraordinary commission or tribunal for the trial of offence be abolish all property whether of individual or corporation whether civil or ecclesiastical be to be hold subject to its equal part of the burden of the state and to all bill impose tax the pope would annex of he own authority a special waiver of the ecclesiastical exemption the administration of the province and the commune be place in the hand of they respective inhabitant the government -lrb- or political -rrb- censorship be abolish but the ecclesiastical censorship be retain such be a general outline of the roman constitution spontaneously grant to he subject by pius ix its merit in all civil or political matter be certainly equal if not superior to those of the english constitution from which in great part it be borrow its fault be precisely those which result necessarily from the pope 's double character as temporal sovereign of the roman state and as head of the catholic church throughout the world it be not within the province or at the discretion of pius to alter the tenure by which he hold he throne to change the fundamental principle of the church or to abolish he ecclesiastical dominion he grant to he subject all that be in he power to grant as they temporal sovereign he purely ecclesiastical relation and duty do not concern they or concerned they only so far as they be member of the great body of catholic believer in all land the college of cardinal _ must _ choose the pope and _ must _ choose one of they own number this be not a law of the roman state but a law of the catholic church pius could not abrogate it and if he have be incline to grant everything to he people by divest himself of the last rag of he sovereignty the only consequence would have be that the cardinal must have choose another pope in he place who might undo all that pius have accomplish these be obvious and necessary consideration and the pope expressly recognize they in the ordinance accompany the grant of the constitution we intend he say to maintain intact we authority in matter that by they nature be related to the catholic religion and its rule of moral and this be due from we as a guaranty to the whole of christendom that in the state of the church reorganize in this new form nothing shall be derogate from the liberty and rights of the church herself and of the holy see nor any precedent be establish for violate the sacredness of the religion which it be we duty and mission to preach to the whole world as the only scheme of covenant between god and man the only pledge of that heavenly benediction by which state subsist and nation flourish now it be worthy of note that neither this constitution nor any of the act of pius under it be ever complain of by any party among the pope 's subject except in regard to these ecclesiastical reservation which be force from he by the very nature of the office that he hold the constitutionalist indeed the moderate reformer the party of balbo and giobertus and d'azeglio which comprise most of the educate and reflect person in the state seem to have be entirely satisfy with it as a whole or as it be so also be the unthinking populace who receive it with shout of exultation so long as they be not move by the art of a party who would not be satisfy with have a good pope but be bent upon have no pope at all this be the party of mazzinus the revolutionist as distinguish from the reformer -- not strong at first either in number or credit as we have see but who make up for all deficiency by they zeal and activity -- who be determine to establish a republic and who care nothing for the embarrassment of the pope 's situation as head of the church of indeed for the church itself they complain -- and with reason too upon they principle -- of these ecclesiastical reservation and they make out of they they chief weapon of attack upon the pope 's government though they do not profit so much by the use of it as by the evident unwillingness of pius to rush into a war with austrium for the purpose of give the sovereignty of lombardy to charle albert a measure to which he be averse because he think such a conflict would be detrimental to the interest of the church over which he preside the world 's future judgment of pius will depend upon its belief of the sincerity with which he act in thus allow nothing but he religious duty and he position as the head of the church to limit he concession of political privilege to he subject on this point it be well to hear the opinion of farinus who as one of the mamiani ministry and as employ to mediate between they and the pope because much loved and trust by he seem peculiarly qualify to form one without undue bias on either side : pius ix have apply himself to political reform not so much for the reason that he conscience as a honorable man and a most pious sovereign enjoin it as because he high view of the papal office prompt he to employ the temporal power for the benefit of he spiritual authority a meek man and a benevolent prince pius ix be as a pontiff lofty even to sternness with a soul not only devout but mystical he refer everything to god and respect and venerate he own person as standing in god 's place he think it he duty to guard with jealousy the temporal sovereignty of the church because he think it essential to the safe-keeping and the apostleship of the faith aware of the numerous vice of that temporal government and hostile to all vice and all its agent he have seek on mount the throne to effect those reform which justice public opinion and the time require he hope to give lustre to the papacy by they means and so to extend and to consolidate the faith he hope to acquire for the clergy that credit which be a great part of the decorum of religion and a efficient cause of reverence and devotion in the people he first effort be successful in such a degree that no pontiff ever get greater praise by this he be greatly stimulate and encourage and perhaps he give in to the seduction of applause and the temptation of popularity more than be fitting for a man of decision or for a prudent prince but when after a little europe be shake by universal revolution the work he have commence be in he view mar he then retire within himself and take alarm in he heart the pontiff always come before the prince the priest before the citizen in the secret struggle of he mind pontifical and priestly conference always outweigh the conscience of the prince and citizen and as he conscience be a very timid one it follow that he inward conflict be frequent that hesitation be a matter of course and that he often take resolution even about temporal affair more from religious intuition or impulse than from he judgment as a man add to this he health be weak and susceptible of nervous excitement -- the dregs of he old complaint from this he suffer most when he mind be most troubled and uneasy another cause of wavering and changefulness under the pressure of the extraordinary occurrence throughout europe early in the spring of 1848 the pope 's new ministry under the constitution proceed vigorously and rapidly to give full development and efficiency to that instrument they also express the wish for a firm union of the constitutional throne of italy with one another with a view to insure she independence and they order the papal banner to be decorate with pennon of the italian tricolor on march 21st the news of the revolution at vienna much magnify by report arrive and the excitement of the roman populace know no bound every bell in the city peal for joy from palace and from hovel from magazine and workshop the townspeople pour in throng into the street and square some take to let off firearm some to strew flower some hoist flag on the tower some deck with they they balcony everybody be shout ' _ italium italium _ ' and cursing the empire in a access of fury the austrian arm be tear down dash to piece and befouled amid the applause of the crowd in spite of the dissuasion of the public functionary and of prudent person the hostility to the jesuit now threaten to break out into violence and for the double purpose of protect they and appease the passion of the mob the pope consent that the school which they have superintend should be give into other hand that they association should be disband and they should be exile the government perhaps have no choice so swiftly and impetuously do the torrent of popular commotion roll i will not affirm that the pope and the government ought to have expose to the last hazard the security of the state for a ineffectual defense of the fraternity what i wish to observe be that if there be among the jesuit man stain with guilt and mischievous plotter they ought to have be watch and punish as bad citizen but it be incompatible with propriety or justice to condemn and punish a religious association as such in a place where the pope hold both he own seat and the supreme authority of the church none but the pope have the power to condemn the society as a whole and no condemnation but he could be just or valid in the opinion and conscience of the catholic or produce the desire political effect on the same day that the jesuit be expel the pope issue a noble proclamation breathe the best spirit of religion the follow excerpt be a portion of it : _ pius papa ix to the people of the state of italy -- health and apostolic benediction _ : the event which the last two month have witness follow and throng one another in such rapid succession be no work of man woe to he that do not discern the lord 's voice in this blast that agitate uproot and rend the cedar and the oak woe to the pride of man if he shall refer these marvellous change to any human merit or any human fault if instead of adore the hidden design of providence whether manifest in the path of he justice or of he mercy or of that providence in whose hand be all the end of the earth and we who be endowed with speech in order to interpret the dumb eloquence of the work of god -- we can not be mute amid the longing the fear and the hope which agitate the mind of we child and first it be we duty to make know to you that if we heart have be move at hear how in a part of italy the consolation of religion have precede the peril of battle and nobleness of mind have be display in work of charity we nevertheless could not and can not but greatly grieve over the injury which in other place have be do to the minister of that same religion -- injury even if contrary to we duty we be silent concern they we silence could not hinder from impair the efficacy of we benediction neither can we refrain from tell you that to use victory well be a greater and more difficult achievement than to be victorious if the present day recall to you any other period of you history let the child profit by the error of they forefather remember that all stability and all prosperity have its main earthly ground in concord that it be god alone who maketh of one mind they that dwell in a house that he grant this reward only to the humble and the meek to those who respect he law in the liberty of he church in the order of society in charity toward all mankind \* \* \* \* \* shortly afterward another measure emanate entirely from the pope and oppose by the prejudice of the mob show that he humane and liberal disposition and enlighten understanding wait for no impulse from without and for no hope of increase popularity before do justice to a long oppressed race the friend of social progress be highly gratify by the decision of pius ix to raze in rome the wall and gate which shut up the jew in the ghetto he have already at the commencement of he pontificate soften some of the rigor with which they be afflict and have direct that they might spread beyond that ignominious precinct nor however great be the outcry about it among the mob do he forego the idea of better the condition of the follower of the mosaic law he be dispose to give they civil rights and if he do not think of extend he concession even to political privilege yet he would give this as the main reason for it that in a constitutional country everyone who enjoy they may rise to the highest stage of power whereas a pope could not have any save catholic minister in the mean time he raise they out of the abjectness of they isolation although the roman vulgar censure he for it bitterly most of all because it take effect in holy week when it be know in the city that the wall and fastening of the ghetto be to be pull down at night by order of the cardinal vicar ciceruacchio hasten with he companion or subject to share in the work and they share in it so largely that it seem as though the thing be effect more as they boon than by the will of the pope pius ix be vex at this whether because noise have be make about what he want do quietly or because it be bring about in such a manner that it might seem the popular party have have more to say to it than the authority of the head of religion rome fully share the enthusiasm which be awaken throughout italy by the entrance of the piedmontese troops into lombardy and by the announcement by charle albert that he have draw the sword in the sacred cause of italian independence he proclamation in the stilted phrase common to such state papers declare that he rely upon the assistance of that god who be visibly with we of that god who have give pius ix to italy of that god who by such wondrous impulse have place she in a condition to act for herself and if she act for herself if she deed have be commensurate with she glorious word the austrian would never again have trodden any portion of the peninsula with the step of a master but the zeal of the italian for independence seem all to evaporate in high-sounding manifesto and in a few excess of the populace in the great city the inactivity of the italian sovereign may be explain by they imputed treachery or lukewarmness in the cause but what prevent the people themselves from crowd the camp of charle albert with volunteer at a time when not a crown head in italy dare offer the least open opposition to such a movement the king of naple sorely against he will send he regular army consist of about fourteen thousand man to fight for the cause and withdraw they in about six week as soon as a base act of treachery have give he the victory at home general pepe they commander wish to disobey the order and move forward but nearly the whole army turn its back on the po and on he and move backward in the direction of the neapolitan kingdom two hundred volunteer have previously set out from naple for upper italy under the guidance and at the expense of a enthusiastic woman the princess belgioioso she have live as a exile in france and be at first enthusiastic for the _ giovine italia _ she afterward become averse to it and side with guizot duchâtel and mignet she intimate friend she be well verse -- or mixed herself much -- in literature politics the study of theology and journalism a woman that have some of the feeling and anxiety of man together with all those of she own sex and who be now travel through italy intent upon manly business but after woman 's fashion other volunteer afterward start and a vessel set sail for leghorn which carry they along with the tenth regiment of the line the sicilian at the same time determine to separate entirely from naple and the rest of the peninsula and thus all the ability and spirit the arm and wealth of that powerful island be apply to the effort for insular independence and draw off from that for the independence of the nation from tuscany there go to this national war about three thousand volunteer and perhaps as many more regular -- a number so small that farinus apologize for it and endeavor to prove that it ought not to be imputed to any lukewarmness in the affection for italy the army from the roman state which the pope have set on foot but hope to retain as a defensive force within the northern boundary of he dominion number about sixteen thousand of whom more than half be volunteer the conduct of the people of lombardy who though the conflict rage on they own soil and they own freedom be immediately at stake waste they strength in quarrel with one another instead of succore charle albert have long be a topic of wonder and censure in short all italy do not furnish for this sacred war so long the object of she aspiration and she prayer a body of volunteer one-fourth as large as the army which the king of sardinium bring into the field though it be probable that he be move from the first only by the hope of personal aggrandizement he invade lombardy with a army of fifty-five thousand man expect thereby to win with the aid of the national enthusiasm the sceptre of all italy for himself and he descendant a terrible disappointment await he instead of glory shame and defeat be he portion and have abdicate he paternal throne in despair he die in exile literally of a broken heart pius ix be hardly more fortunate to he also this fatal war bring dishonor and exile the loss of the affection of he subject and of the admiration of the civilized world the reluctance of the pope to engage when unprovoked in a war with austrium be no cause for wonder he earnestly desire the welfare of he people and the independence of he native land but all he desire be subject to the interest of the church of which he be the recognize head throughout christendom the republican in he dominion include mazzinus and he party be aware of this reluctance and determine to make use of it and of the passion of the people in order to get rid of he altogether no opportunity be lose to compromise he in the war both in he temporal and ecclesiastical character and the misfortune of he twofold position do not allow he to resist these machination with success general durando the commander of the papal force issue a flaming proclamation to he army when they pass the po announce to they that they sword be bless by the venerable head of the church and that they should all wear the cross on they bosom as beseemed those who be engage in a holy war this act naturally give great uneasiness to the pope and farinus censure it as a unwise attempt to obtain the sanction of religion for merely political object -- the very conduct which the liberal party have previously censure in they opponent if italian mind he argue be not capable of warm with the simple fire of patriotism for the noble and even holy enterprise of liberating italy from the stranger it be vain to hope that heart so freeze up in indifference could kindle with religious faith in the mean time the german who be speculate about the unity of they own stock and nation and be strain every nerve in that difficult enterprise could not excuse the desire of independence in the italian and contend for the boast rights of austrium and germany over the land and the coast of italy with the people that inhabit they when it become know in germany that the pontifical troops be hasten to the legitimate defense of italy it affect the public feeling generally and the name of pius ix be brand with censure not by layman only but by some bishop and high ecclesiastic monsignor viale nuncio at vienna and monsignor sacconus nuncio at munich be assiduous and eager in detail the sinister report touch rome and the pope and color they in such a way as to create a apprehension of schism the most serious one that could rise for a pope -- and that pope too pius ix he have before this be greatly trouble by the proclamation of general durando still he have hope that the italian league would be shortly conclude and that when he have furnish the quota of troops that might be due from he as a temporal sovereign he would then have be able in the capacity of pontiff to use those good office which he consider requisite to assure the conscience of catholic even the news of some reverse to the italian arm in lombardy fail to awaken a proper feeling among the inhabitant of central and southern italy and farinus thus censure the slothfulness and vanity of he countryman : few give credit or importance at the time to this and other sinister intelligence the greater part of those who behold the first marvellous smile of fortune rely upon the star of italy and think the empire be dismember we italian be too susceptible to the impulse of passion and of heat in the imagination with a small matter we be drunken and think to leap over the moon deadly intoxication most deadly fault that of undervalue a enemy which let we enthusiasm too easily evaporate and give he every facility for show that he be as gallant as we be and more resolute that he have much of perseverance and of discipline -- quality more effectual and valuable than simple courage it come to this we must either send about they business the dream of poet and educate ourselves in severe and masculine virtue or must yet remain long in a position to chant many more elegy to assuage we sorrow than hymn of triumph we must either rest assure that with the tenacious the disciplined and the resolute only the tenacious disciplined and resolute can cope and must therefore leave off despise the austrian and imitate they in they steadiness and they attention to the military spirit or else we must be doom to the disgrace of see they master of we country a stern truth but the only one that a italian freeman can utter to italian free in mind he who want compliment and adulation may fling these warn word from he the ministry at rome drive onward by the popular clamor represent to the pope in strong term the necessity of send order to he army to take a active part in the war for they have not yet commence hostility with the austrian a consistory of the cardinal be to be hold on April 29th and it be fear that pius would take that occasion for declare that he be averse to the war thus pacify the mind of the catholic in germany the allocution of the pope realize these fear though it express only he wish to remain neutral and to embrace all kindred people and nation with equal solicitude of paternal affection but the ministry resign in consequence and great disturbance arise in the city the populace be not willing themselves to volunteer for the war but they be determine that the pope should not continue a man of peace the civic guard be place under arm but it be soon find that the soldier share the feeling of the people and no reliance could be place upon they threat be utter of assassinate the cardinal and other cry out to make short work -- as they call it -- with the government of the priest those traitor to italy and to place rome under popular sway to avert bloodsh the pope consent to a compromise he give up the entire direction of he troops to charle albert and publish of he own accord and without the knowledge of he minister a affect remonstrance to he people pius also write a earnest letter to the emperor of austrium entreat he to put a stop to the war by acknowledge the independence of venetium and lombardy let not the generous german nation take it ill he say if we invite they to lay resentment aside and to convert into the beneficial relation of friendly neighborhood a domination which could never be prosperous or noble while it depend solely on the sword but the prayer of the pope have now little influence either with the emperor or with he own subject he have long ago forfeit the favor of the absolutist by he political reform and he have now lose the love of he people by he reluctance to gratify they passion for sway yet if he have basely yield to they wish against he judgment and he conscience he would have injure only the cause of the papacy in foreign land and the issue of the war would not have be change as it be he troops be actively engage in the contest till the time of they capture at vicenza by the austrian the fatal blow be give to the hope of italy by the king of naple withdraw he troops at a critical moment when they loss could not be replace they departure and the consequent capture of the papal army under durando at vicenza enable the austrian to turn they whole force against the piedmontese who be then defeat and drive back the disgraceful capitulation at milan follow and the cause of united italy be lose forever brilliant as its promise have be at the outset the revolution of 1848 terminate as pitifully as do those of 1820 and 1831 and for its disastrous issue the italian have none to blame but themselves misfortune and defeat have they usual effect in inflame the rage of party the personal influence of the pope could no longer keep the passion of the citizen in check and the club now govern rome with absolute sway the party of mazzinus bent on try the experiment of a republic at all hazard begin to show its head after a long period of inefficiency and discouragement and every day acquire new adherent and stronger influence one ministry after another try in vain to steer the ship of state on a even course between the opposite peril of the domination of a mob and the rigorous enforcement of the law the pope try for some month the experiment of a popular administration under mamianus of whom we author say he seem to play the part of a tribune of the people more than of the pope 's minister still he be a honest man oppose to violence to tumult and to all excess though he pay too much deference to the club which be now as turbulent and mischievous as they parisian prototype the act of he ministry be not numerous farinus say for the character of the time would not admit of dispassionate inquiry and solid reform in truth the energy of government be exhaust in a vain attempt to keep the peace in the city which be now a constant scene of turbulence and disorder bologna also have successfully repel a unauthorized attack make upon it by the austrian under welden have become a prey to the wildest confusion owe to the continuance there of the irregular band of armed man who have contribute to its defense at the urgent request of the bolognese deputy the ministry determine to send thither one of they own number to aid in restore order and farinus be depute for this purpose the follow be a portion of he account of what he see there and what he accomplish : in the street and open place of the city for two day the brigand have be slaughter every man he enemy among the government officer some of they indeed disreputable and sorry fellow other respectable they kill with musket-shot and if the fall give sign of life they reload they arm in the sight of the people and the soldier and fire they afresh or else put a end to they victim with they knife they hunt man down like wild beast enter they house and drag they forth to slaughter one bianchus a inspector of police be lie in bed reduce to agony by consumption they come in set upon he and cut he throat in the presence of he wife and child the corpse a frightful spectacle remain in the public street i see it see death deal about and the abominable chase cardinal amat who have give notice of he arrival come the day after and the armed common escort he to the palace at the very time when the villain be perpetrate they murder there be no longer any judge or any officer of the police those who have escape death either have flee or have hide themselves the civic guard be disarm the citizen kill the few soldier of the line either mix with the insurgent or be wholly without spirit the carbineer and dragoon in hesitation the volunteer legion and free corps a support to the rioter not to the authority of government we send to rome for leave to declare bologna in a state of siege but the answer be that the ministry have take the opinion of the council of state consider that order might be restore without recourse to this extreme measure all we best exertion be make to draw to the side of government the carbineer and dragoon as also bellezzus and the honest leader of the people but with little success it be report that bellezzus himself have give leave to kill those whom they call the spy one masina come before we propose by way of compromise to banish those whose life be threaten armed man be in the very palace of government and we ourselves at they mercy accident however effect at a stroke what we could have do only slowly and with difficulty a assassin attempt the life of a carbineer he companion inflamed with anger pursue he and catch he in a church they then volunteer they most resolute effort at repression they be order to sally forth arrest and disarm the ruffian the dragoon second they young pepolus commandant of the civic guard muster a few company bianchettus and the respect citizen of the committee of public safety draw close around we and we hurry in the swiss from forlus the population begin to regain its courage and to applaud the carbineer as they arrest the assassin the swiss enter amid cheer the disturbance at bologna be quell but the bond of law and order throughout the papal state be now loosen and it become evident that a more determine minister must be place at the helm or the experiment of the existing form of government must be abandon in despair a republic or a return to the old principle of despotism would then be inevitable in this emergency the eye of the pope and of all prudent person at rome be turn to rossus who since the fall of loui philippe 's government from which he have be ambassador to the roman state have reside there as a private citizen take no active share in politics but often consult by both party owe to he high reputation for sagacity and firmness exile on account of he liberal opinion by gregory he have lay the foundation of he fame at paris where he successively become professor peer and ambassador and be highly esteem by all party as a writer and a statesman once before pius have solicit he to form a ministry but he have decline because conscious that the affection of the populace be not with he and he judge that the mind even of the better portion of the citizen be not yet prepare for a resolute attempt to carry on a constitutional government by firm measure he suggest to the pope that he be probably odious to the court on account of he previous employment and he writings that some would perhaps look very coldly on a minister who have marry a protestant wife and that the french republic might be displeased if he should hold a high post at rome but in the middle of September the solicitation of the pope and of many respectable person in the state become so urgent that rossus consent to serve the opinion be universal that no other person possess the requisite ability character and experience to carry on the government at this perilous crisis and that if he fail all indeed be lose he select for he colleague man of liberal politics but temperate in they opinion he announce he intention to carry into effect the fundamental statute in all its part accord to constitutional usage to counteract and repress both party oppose to that instrument to abolish exemption restore the finances and reorganize the army to conclude a league with piedmont and tuscany even if it should be impossible with naple and to fix the contingent of troops which the pope be to supply so that he need not in any way mingle in the war the turbulent and the presumptuous the magistrate accustom to fatten upon abuse the sanfedist who make a livelihood of disorder and the clergy greedy of gold and honor could ill bear that pellegrino rossus should have the authority of a minister but those who know the real condition of affair and that unless the finances be improve and public discipline and order restore all would go to wreck count it great gain that he should take charge of the debilitated state the dissatisfied be more numerous and noisy in the capital the contented stronger in the province especially at bologna where a educate community wish for a liberal system with a government strong in the strength of the law where the recent terrible event have fill every mind with horror and where rossus the proscribe of 1815 be dear to memory and root in public esteem the roman legislature be to meet again in the middle of November so that the new minister be chiefly occupy with mature the measure which be to be lay before it for adoption he public act therefore be few but they be enough to show that new wisdom and vigor direct the course of affair he obtain the pope 's consent that the clergy should make a new contribution of two million of crown to the state on the strength of which he obtain a new loan and punctually pay the interest on the public debt he invite general zucchus home from switzerland to take the command of the army which rapidly improve in

civic guard and the carbineer to the spot allay the tumult arrest and imprison some of its ringleader and publish a energetic proclamation to warn the turbulent that the law would be enforce all these proceedings excite the anger of rossus 's enemy the journalist the captain of the people and the roman club there be no opprobrium that be not heap upon he no charge that be not level at the government but these declamation seem to have little effect on the body of the people on the morning of November 15th when the legislature be to commence its session though knot of person be see talk in the street with excited countenance there be no outbreak or popular tumult rossus have receive many anonymous letter in which he life be threaten but he scorn to take any notice of they this morning one come which directly affirm that he would be assassinate in the course of the day and he throw it into the fire the regulation of the police now that the day of the session have arrive belong to the president of the council of deputy and rossus punctilious in the observance of the constitution refuse to give they any order several of he friend come and remonstrate with he against such a exposure of he life to all this he answer that he have take the measure which he think suitable for keep the seditious in order and that he could not on account of risk that he might personally run forego repair to the council accord to he duty that perhaps these be idle menace but if anyone thirst for he blood he would have the means of shed it elsewhere on some other day even if on that day he should lose he opportunity he would therefore go he be elate by the confidence which the pope have in he and expect both trust and aid from the parliament to which he be so soon to explain he idea and intention when the ordinary hour of the parliamentary sit which be about noon arrive the people begin to gather in the square of the cancellarium and by degree in the courtyard and then in the public gallery of the hall soon these be all full a battalion of the civic guard be draw up in the square in the court and hall there be no guard greater than ordinary there be however not a few individual arm with they dagger in the dress of the volunteer return from vicenza and wear the medal with which the municipality of rome have decorate they they stand together and form a line from the gate up to the staircase of the palace sullen visage be to be see and ferocious imprecation hear among they during the time when the deputy be slowly assemble and business could not commence because there be not yet a quorum present a cry for help suddenly proceed from the extremity of the public gallery on which everyone turn thither a curious eye but nothing more be hear or see and those who go to get some explanation of the circumstance return without success in the mean time rossus 's carriage enter the court of the palace he sit on the right and righettus deputy minister of finance on the leave a howl be raise in the court and yard which echo even into the hall of the council rossus get out first and move briskly as be he habit in walk across the short space which lead from the center of the court to the staircase on the left hand righettus who descend after he remain behind because the person be in the way who cause the outcry and who brandish they cutlass have surround rossus and be load he with opprobrium at this moment there be see amid the throng the flash of a poniard and then rossus lose he foot and sink to the ground alas he be spout blood from a broad gash in the neck he be raise by righettus but could hardly hold himself up and do not articulate a syllable he eye grow clouded and he blood spurt forth in a copious jet some of those whom i name as clad in military uniform be above upon the stair they come down and form a ring about the unhappy man and when they see he shed blood and half lifeless they all turn and rejoin they companion he be bear amid he death-struggle into the apartment of cardinal gazzolus at the head of the stair on the left side and there after a few moment he breathe he last in leave the palace of the cancellarium one meet some face gleam with a hellish joy other pallid with alarm many townspeople standing as if petrified agitator run this way and that carbineer the same one kind of man might be hear mutter imprecation on the assassin but the generality falter in broken and doubtful accent some horrible to relate curse the murder man yes i have still before my eye the livid countenance of one who as he see I shout ` so fare the betrayer of the people ' but the city be in the depths of gloom as under the hand of calamity and the scourge of god and wherever there be respectable person though of liberal and italian principle they be horror-struck and call for the resolute exertion of the authority when the terrible news come to the pope he be strike with horror and dismay but yet strive to rally the other member of the government around he and preserve the state from anarchy but he effort be miserably second one person after another decline take office or continue in it and even when the president of the two council be summon they have little advice to give on the morrow the tiding come that a mob be on its way toward the quirinal some of the carbineer have fraternize with they to enforce the appointment of a democratic ministry and a declaration in favor of a constituent assembly for all italy only a few swiss the ordinary guard of honor be on duty but they shut the gate of the palace and nobly declare that they own body should be pile up behind they before the rioter should enter gallettus the former minister of police act as spokesman of the mob and when admit to a audience he state they demand the pope indignantly declare that he would not yield to violence but must deliberate in freedom this answer only inspire the insurgent with fresh fury so that they press forward to the gate set one of they on fire and mount upon the roof of the neighbor house open a fire upon the wall and window of the quirinal the few swiss fire in return and then the cry run through the city that the pope 's guard be butcher the people and already there be many slay within the palace many advise pius to yield a few still speak of resistance and the foreign minister who be collect there have no scheme to offer the scuffle continue the worthy prelate monsignor palma fall dead by the window of he own apartment ball reach the ante-chamber of the pope at last pius turn to the diplomatic body who stand around he and say : there be no further hope in resistance already a prelate be slay in my very palace shot be aim at it artillery level to avoid fruitless bloodshed and increase enormity we give way but it be as you see only to force therefore we protest let the court let you government know it we give way to violence alone and all we concede be null and void gallettus be then ask to propose he list of minister from which the pope indignantly strike out the name of the neapolitan salicettus but admit without a word the name of sterbinus lunatus and gallettus they appointment be sign on the spot and the news be tell to the insurgent they fire musket in token of joy and go off with hymn for italy and cheer for the italian constituent assembly and the democratic ministry the next day the club desire that the swiss should be deprive of they arm and dismiss from the quirinal the pope comply the club then ask that gallettus should be name general of the carbineer and he be appoint such

pass from the rule of the bourbon represent by charle x to that of the orleanist in the hand of loui philippe the citizen king -lrb- July 1830 -rrb- great hope be entertain by the constitutional party that this renewal of the monarchy through the July revolution would result in permanent benefit at first the new king enjoy great popularity in some respects he government compare with that of charle x be liberal and one of its early act be a extension of the suffrage by decrease the amount of the property qualification for voter the demand for still further enlargement of popular rights become emphatic the people be divide mainly into three party and the difficulty confront the king be formidable the conservative who have place he in power wish to prevent further change in the state the moderate ask for new reform especially for a still more extended suffrage the radical party desire a republic the attitude of the radical cause loui philippe to halt in he progressive policy more than once he life be attempt and in consequence of such act the liberty of the press and other privilege be restricted the greater part of the french people wish to have the king intervene in behalf of poland -- which at that period be in a state of almost chronic insurrection -- as he have aid the belgian against holland in she eastern policy france be defeat by the quadruple alliance form by england prussium austrium and russium and in consequence of this failure the king 's prestige suffer but the question of extend the suffrage be keep always before the people and when the king refuse to go further with that reform its advocate urge they demand more strongly than ever lamartine found a journal in which he agitate for universal suffrage and in this agitation many other newspaper join even thier the lead statesman of the moderate party ask for suffrage reform fail to control the legislative assembly the reformer at last appeal to the people the king rely on he majority in the assembly be undisturbed by the popular ferment guizot whose account of the February revolution be here give be the chief minister of loui philippe and however partisan the author 's narrative may seem it rest upon a intimate knowledge of the event record i come with profound repugnance and sorrow to those painful day by the fault and misfortune of which france be launch into dangerous enterprise such that man of the greatest foresight could not discern they end we country have pay very dearly for the fatal error which overthrow the throne of the king who have for eighteen year govern it with a wisdom prudence and moderation acknowledge even by he enemy when attack he the cabinet of October 29 1847 and its political friend have a clearly define idea and purpose they aspire to bring to a close the french era of revolution by establish the free government which france have in 1789 promise herself as the consequence and political guarantee of the social revolution which she be complete this policy formerly the object of they youthful hope have become theirs whether in power or in the opposition it be in fact both liberal and antirevolutionary -- antirevolutionary both in home and foreign affair since it wish to maintain the peace of europe abroad and the constitutional monarchy at home liberal since it fully accept and respect the essential condition of free government the decisive intervention of the country in its affair with a constant and well-sustained discussion in public as well as in the chamber of the idea and act of the government in fact this twofold object be attain from 1830 to 1848 abroad peace be maintain without any loss to the influence or reputation of france in europe at home from 1830 to 1848 political liberty be great and powerful from 1840 to 1848 in particular it be display without any new legal limit be impose it be this policy that the opposition -- all the opposition monarchical and dynastic as well as republican -- blindly or knowingly attack and try to change it be to change it that they demand electoral and parliamentary reform in principle the government have no absolute or permanent objection whatever to such reform the extension of the right of suffrage and the incompatibility of certain function with the office of deputy might and must be the natural and legitimate consequence of the upward movement of society and political liberty they do not think the reform necessary or well-timed and be therefore justified in delay they as much as possible provide they should one day allow to be accomplish by other what they think themselves still strong enough to refuse we have too much and too long maintain a good policy say guizot afterward a frequent and formidable sign that man 's mind be secretly agitate be the anxiety by which they be seize with reference to intrigue and vice which they suppose around they it would be a serious error to see always a symptom of moral improvement in the clamor against electoral or parliamentary corruption immediately after the ministerial success in the general election of 1846 this precursory indication of storm appear on the horizon guizot raise the question to its proper point of view leave to country which be not free say he leave to absolute government that explanation of great result by small feeble or dishonorable human act in free country when great result be produce it be from great cause that they spring a great fact have be show in the election just complete the country have give its adhesion its earnest and free adhesion to the policy present before it do not attribute this fact to several pretend electoral maneuver you have no right to come to explain or qualify by wretched supposition a grand idea of the country thus grandly and freely manifest the rumor of electoral corruption be soon follow by rumor of parliamentary corruption but the majority of the chamber declare themselves content with the ministerial explanation the contents figure in the opposition attack by the side of the pritchardist several improper abuse of long standing exist in certain branch of the administration some post in the treasury have be the object of pecuniary transaction between those who hold the post and be resign and the candidate who present themselves to replace they a bill propose on January 20 1848 by hébert who have become keeper of the seal formally forbid any such transaction under assign penalty several month previously -lrb- June 1847 -rrb- m teste formerly minister of public work and then president of the cour de cassation be seriously compromise in the scandalous trial of general cubières and pellapra convict of have receive a large sum of money in connection with the mining concession he be bring before the peer and be lead from question to question and from discussion to discussion soon make a confession of he crime he as well as he accomplice undergo the just penalty it be on the part of the cabinet one of those act the merit of which be only perceive afterward and in which the government bear the weight of the evil at the moment when it be try most sincerely and courageously to repress it there be several deplorable incident -- the shocking murder of the duchess of praslin some scandalous trial and violent death follow hard one upon another and aggravate the momentary depression and the excited state of the popular imagination the air seem infect with moral disorder and unlooked-for misfortune come to join in party attack and the false accusation which the cabinet be subject to it be one of those unhealthy hurricane often meet in the life of government it be certainly culpable on the part of the opposition to try to take advantage of this disturbed state of man 's mind to gain the end they be pursue seven time be parliamentary reform and three time be electoral reform refuse by the chamber from February 20 1841 to April 8 1847 the question be then displace it change its ground the opposition make a appeal to popular passion and parliamentary discussion be succeed by the banquet from the close of the session of 1847 to the opening of that of 1848 they keep france in a state of constant fever -- a artificial and deceptive fever in this sense that it be not the natural and spontaneous result of the actual wish and want of the country but true and serious in this sense that the political party who take the initiative in it find among some of the middle class and the lower order a prompt and keen adhesion to they proposal the first banquet take place in pari at the château-rouge hôtel on July 9 1847 garnier-pagès have himself tell how the royalist opposition and the republican opposition conclude they alliance for that purpose on leave the house of odilon barrot the radical member of the meeting walk together for some time on reach that part of the boulevard opposite the foreign office at the moment they be about to separate pagnerre say : well really i do not expect for we proposal so speedy and complete success do those gentleman see what that may lead to for my part i confess i do not see it clearly but it be not for we radical to be alarm about it you see that tree reply garnier-pagès engrave on its bark a mark in memory of this day for what we have just decide upon be a revolution garnier-pagès do not foresee that the republic of 1848 as well as the monarchy of 1830 should in its turn speedily perish in that revolution so long big with so many storm for six month banquet be renew in most of the department -- at colmar strasburg st quentin lille avesne cosne châlons mâcon lyon montpellier rouen etc in many part there be a great display of feeling and intention most hostile to royalty and the dynasty on several occasion -- at lille for example -- the keenest member of the parliamentary opposition odilon barrot and he friend withdraw soon after take they place at table because the other absolutely refuse to dissemble they hostility to the crown and the king at other banquet notably at dijon the idea and passion of 1793 unblushingly reappear they defend robespierre and the reign of terror the red republic openly flaunt its color and hope the attack upon monarchy and the dynasty range itself it be true behind the parliamentary opposition but like galatea run away : _ et se cupit ante viderus _ it have succeed well enough in make itself see the government could no longer shut they eye they have tolerate the banquet so long as they could believe or seem to believe that the parliamentary opposition direct or at least rule the movement when it become evident that the anarchical impulse be more and more gain upon the parliamentary opposition and that the latter be become the instrument instead of remain the master then only they forbid the banquet it be they duty it be also they right in the opinion of the most competent legal authority as well as accord to the recent practice of other free government in presence of a situation full of certain danger this right however be dispute by the opposition the government push the principle of legality to its furthest limit arrange with several lead man of the opposition for the purpose of enable the question of right to be bring speedily and methodically before competent tribunal just before the opening of the new session in order to close the campaign a new and formal banquet be be prepare in pari to which all the deputy and peer who have take part in any of the precede banquet be to be invite this manifestation be to take place in the twelfth arrondissement of paris it be therefore agree between the opposition delegate and those of the ministerial majority that the deputy invite should go to the place appoint for the meeting and take they place so as to avoid any disturbance in the street or the hall and that on the police commissary declare that there be a order against it the guest should protest and withdraw to lay the question before the tribunal the agreement thus conclude be communicate by duchâtel to the council which approve of it meanwhile the chamber meet the session be open and from the very first the government could perceive a wavering in the majority even among those who blame and fear the agitation out-of-door several believe in the urgent necessity of a concession to remove all pretext for clamor and intrigue on the minister be inform of it guizot say : withdraw the question from the hand of those who now hold it and let it be bring back to the chamber let the majority take a step in the direction of the concession indicate however small it be i be certain it will be understand and that you will have a new cabinet which will do what you think necessary it be in the same spirit that the ministry during the discussion on the address reject a amendment tend to impose upon they immediate engagement with reference to reform the maintenance of the unity of the conservative party say guizot the maintenance of conservative policy and power will be the fixed idea and rule of conduct in the cabinet they will make sincere effort to maintain or restore the unity of the conservative party upon that question in order that it may be the conservative party itself in its entirety that undertake and give to the country its solution if such a operation in the midst of the conservative party be possible it will take place if that be not possible -- if by the question of reform the conservative party can not succeed in make a common arrangement and maintain the power of the conservative policy the cabinet will leave to other the sad task of preside over the disorganization of the conservative party and the ruin of its policy the question be not destine to be take up again by the chamber have escape from the weak hand that aspire to direct it the courtesy of the conservative reformer have no result except disquieting the government a sort of precursory sign of the tempest even the parliamentary opposition find themselves baffle in they prudent effort a manifesto publish in the _ national _ newspaper organize a noisy demonstration in the street though forbid in the banquet-hall the national guard be call to arm by the insurrection and they service arrange beforehand the convention be clearly violate and the legal appeal to the tribunal therefore abandon : the revolution itself declare it would decide the question in such a situation sorrowfully admit by those who have negotiate the evening before the government officially forbid the banquet the evening papers announce that the deputy of the opposition have give up the intention of be present and therefore the propose manifestation be deprive of all importance the revolutionary leader in they turn declare that the banquet would not take place disappointment increase they irritation the parliamentary opposition in a momentary resistance employ the remainder of they strength on February 22d fifty-two deputy of the left lay before the chamber a bill of impeachment against the ministry on account of they home and foreign policy during the whole course of they administration what would you have they do say to guizot a old member of the opposition who have no share whatever in this act they have just render the banquet abortive by declare they would not attend it and feel compel to do something to compensate for and to some extent redeem that refusal weakness have a constrain power difficult to understand which be not foresee even by those who give way to it and of this the history of the revolution of 1848 offer a eloquent and melancholy example the king as well as he minister still hope that the crisis have pass and that the disorder avoid on the occasion of the banquet should not reappear under any pretext the display of military force which have be agree upon and prepare be order to be suspend instruction to arrest the republican leader be issue slowly and in but few instance yet a secret agitation be indicate in several part of the capital there be numerous crowd on the morning of the 23rd several _ corps-de-garde _ be attack as the fermentation increase the street be crowd with idle workman people collect in knot from curiosity or stand at they door the storm be in the air evident both to those who dread it and those who be prepare to make use of it meanwhile the appeal of the revolutionary leader to the national guard have be listen to many of the parisian shopkeeper take part in the reform movement without well understand it and march under the order of they dangerous ally several detachment of the seventh third second and tenth legion appear in the street some in the faubourg st antoine other march to the palais royal or the office of the _ national _ in the rue le peletier and other in the student ' quarter shout long live reform in every street when general jacqueminot the commander-in-chief of the national guard order a general muster of the legion a large number of the guard respectable and law-abiding man do not answer to the summons they have no desire for a revolution or reform force from the legal power by insurrection but they shrink from enter upon a struggle with soldier wear they own uniform and influence apparently by reasonable motive they remain in they home deject and anxious the king be as dejected as the parisian citizen and still more anxious for several month he have frequently fall into very low spirit which be attribute to he grief at the death of he only sister madame adelaide of orlean whose life have be always intimately associate with he and who have just expire -lrb- December 1847 -rrb- he most intimate friend urge he to charm away the crisis by change he ministry he still resist but every hour less vigorously the cabinet be not even inform of he perplexity concession force by violence from all the legal power be not a means of safety say duchâtel one defeat would quickly bring a second in the revolution there be not much time between that of June 20th and August 10th and to-day thing advance more quickly than in those time event like traveller now go by steam the truth however be now become manifest both in the king 's mind as to the tendency of he idea and in the eye of he minister as to the determination now be form in the palace by the very statement of the question it be resolve upon guizot and duchâtel thus express it to the king : it be for you majesty to decide the cabinet be ready either to defend to the last the king and conservative policy which

and on the 3d the people gather to meet the deputation on its return the follow be the account give by the son of robert blum : by anonymous placard on the wall the population of leipsic be summon on the evening of march 3d to meet at the railway station the deputation return from dresden since the space be too narrow in this place the innumerable mass march to the market-place which as well as the neighbor street they completely fill in perfect silence the thousand await here the arrival of the deputation which at last toward nine o'clock arrive and be greet with unceasing applause town

voice alone control the whole market-place and be even hear in the neighbor street he too seek by try to quiet they to turn they away from the subject of the address and of the king 's answer but the people break uproariously into he speech with the demand ` the answer the answer ' it could no longer be conceal that the petition of the town have receive harsh rejection then come a loud and passionate murmur the mass have firmly hope that the deputation would bring with they from dresden the news of the dismissal of the hate minister but blum continue he speech and they renew they attention to he ` in constitutional country ' say he ` it be not the king but the minister who be responsible they too bear the responsibility of the rejection of the leipsic proposal the people must press for they removal ' he add that he would bring forward in the next meeting of the town representative the proposal that the king should dismiss the ministry ` which do not possess the confidence of the people ' amid shout of exultation and applause the appease assembly disperse blum be as successful with he colleague as with the crowd and the town council now demand from the king the dismissal of he minister the meeting of the assembly and freedom of the press the king try to resist the last of these three proposal plead he duty to the bund but even the bundestag have feel the spirit of the time and on march 1st have pass a resolution give leave to every government to abolish the censorship of the press the king seem to yield and promise to fulfil all that be wish but the reactionary party in dresden have become alarm at the action of the man of leipsic and so on march 11th when the man of leipsic suppose that all be grant general von carlowitz enter they city at the head of a strong force and demand that the town council should abstain from exciting speech that the elocution union should give up all political discussion that the procession of people should cease and above all that the march from leipsic to dresden which be believe to be then intend should be give up these demand be meet by blum with a indignant protest five man say he who manage the army can not understand that though they bullet may kill man they can not make a single hole in the idea that rule the world the town councillor of leipsic be equally firm carlowitz abandon he attempt as hopeless and on march 13th the king summon a liberal ministry which abolish press censorship grant publicity of legal proceedings trial by jury and a wider basis for the saxon parliament and promise to assist in the reform of the bund in the mean time the success of the french revolution have awaken new hope in vienna soon after the arrival of the news a placard appear on one of the city gate bear the word : in a month prince metternich will be overthrow long live constitutional austrium metternich himself be greatly alarmed and begin to listen to proposal for extend the power of the lower austrian estate yet he still hope by talk over and discuss these matter to delay the execution of reform till a more favorable turn in affair should render they either harmless or unnecessary but great as be the alarm cause by the south german rising and great as be the hope which they kindle in the viennese the word that be to give definiteness and importance to the impulse that be stir in vienna could not come from bavarium or saxony much as they might wish to connect themselves with a german movement the viennese could not get rid of the fact that they be for the present bind up with a different political system nor be it wholly clear that the german movement be as yet completely successful the king of prussium seem to be meditate a reactionary policy and have even threaten to despatch troops to put down the saxon liberal and the king of hanover also be dispose to resist the movement for a german parliament it be from a country more closely bind up with the viennese government and yet enjoy tradition of more deeply rooted liberty that the utterance be to come which be eventually to rouse the viennese to action the readiness of the noble to accept the purely verbal concession offer by metternich in the matter of the administrator have show kossuth -lrb- footnote : loui kossuth the famous leader of the hungarian insurrection of 1848 be at this time about forty-six year of age the sovereignty of hungary have be in the hand of the hapsburg since 1687 -- ed -rrb- that there could be no further peace but he still know how and when to strike the blow and it be not by armed insurrection so much as by the declaration of a policy that he shake the rule of metternich on march 3d a conservative member of the presburg assembly bring forward a motion for inquiry into the austrian bank-notes kossuth answer that the confusion in the affair of austrian commerce produce a evil effect on hungarian finances and he show the need of a independent finance ministry for hungary then he go on to point out that this same confusion extend to other part of the monarchy the actual cause of the break up of peace in the monarchy and of all the evil which may possibly follow from it lie in the system of government he admit that it be hard for those who have be bring up under this system to consent to its destruction but he go on the people last forever and we wish also that the country of the people should last forever forever too should last the splendor of that dynasty whose representative we reckon as we ruler in a few day the man of the past will descend into they grave but for that scion of the house of hapsburg who excite such great hope for the archduke franci joseph who at he first come forward earn the love of the nation -- for he there wait the inheritance of a splendid throne which derive its strength from freedom toward a dynasty which base itself on the freedom of its people 's enthusiasm will always be rouse for it be only the freeman who can be faithful from he heart for a bureaucracy there can be no enthusiasm he then urge that the future of the dynasty depend on the hearty union between the nation which live under it this union he say can be bring about only by respect the nationality and by that bond of constitutionalism which can produce a kindred feel the bureau and the bayonet be miserable bond he then go on to apologize for not examine the difficulty between hungary and croatia the solution of the difficulty of the empire would he hold solve the croatian question too if it do not he promise to consider that question with sympathy and examine it in all its detail he conclude by propose a address to the emperor which should point out that it be the want of constitutional life in the whole empire which hinder the progress of hungary and that while a independent government and a separate responsible ministry be absolutely essential to hungary it be also necessary that the emperor should surround he throne in all matter of the government with such constitutional arrangement as be indispensably demand by the need of the time this utterance have be call the baptismal speech of the revolution come as it do directly after the news of the french revolution it give a definiteness to the grow demand for freedom but it do more than this metternich have cherish a grow hope that the demand for constitutional government in vienna might be gradually use to crush out the independent position of hungary by absorb the hungarian in a common austrian parliament and he have look upon a croatian question as a means for still further weaken the power of the hungarian diet kossuth 's speech strike a blow at these hope by declare that freedom for any part of the empire could be obtain only by work for the freedom of the whole he sweep aside for the moment those national and provincial jealousy which be the great strength of the austrian despotism and appeal to all the liberal of the empire to unite against the system which be oppress they all have kossuth remain true to the faith which he proclaim in this speech it be within the limit of probability that the whole revolution of 1848-1849 might have have a different result the hungarian chancellor mailath be so alarmed at kossuth 's speech that he hinder the set out of the deputation which be to have present the address to the emperor but he could not prevent the speech from produce its effect although presburg be only six hour ' journey from vienna the route have be make so difficult that the news of anything do in the hungarian diet have hitherto reach vienna in a roundabout manner and have sometimes be a week on its way the news of this speech however arrive on the very next day and kossuth 's friend pulszky immediately translate it into german and circulate it among the viennese a rumor of its contents have spread before the actual speech it be say that kossuth have declare war against the system of government and that he have say state bankruptcy be inevitable but as the news become more definite the mind of the viennese fix upon two point -- the denunciation of the man of the past and the demand for a constitution for austrium so alarmed do the government become at the effect of this speech that they undertake to answer it in a official paper the writer of this answer call attention to the terrible scene which he say be be enact in pari which prove accord to he that the only safety for the govern be in rally round the government this utterance naturally excite only contempt and disgust and the ever-arriving news of new constitution grant in germany swell the enthusiasm which have be rouse by kossuth 's speech the movement still centre in the professor of the university on march 1st doctor loehner have propose at one of the meeting of the reading and debate society that negotiation should be open with the estate and that they should be urge to declare they assembly permanent the country in danger and metternich a public enemy this proposal mark a definite step in constitutional progress the estate of lower austrium which meet in vienna have indeed from time to time express they opinion on certain public grievance but these opinion have be generally disregard by franci and metternich and though the latter have of late talk of enlarge the power of the estate he have evidently intend such word partly as mere talk in order to delay any efficient action and partly as a bid against the concession which have be make by the king of prussium that the leader of a popular movement should suggest a appeal to the estate of lower austrium be therefore a unexpected sign of a desire to find any legal center for action however weak in power and however aristocratic that center might be doctor loehner 's proposal however do not seem to have be generally adopt and instead of the suggested appeal to the estate a program of eleven point be circulate by the debate society when we consider that the revolution break out in less than a fortnight after this petition we can not but be strike with the extreme moderation of the demand now make most of the eleven point be concern with proposal for the removal either of form of corruption or of restraint on personal liberty and they be direct chiefly against those interference with the life and teaching of the university which be cause so much bitterness in vienna such demand for constitutional reform as be contain in this program be certainly not of a alarming character the petitioner ask that the right of election to the assembly of estate should be extend to citizen and peasant that the deliberative power of the estate should be enlarged and that the whole empire should be represent in a assembly for which however the petitioner ask only a consultative power perhaps the three demand in this petition which would have excite the widest sympathy be those in favor of the universal arming of the people the universal right of petition and the abolition of the censorship the expression of desire for reform now become much more general and even some member of the estate prepare a appeal to they colleague against the bureaucratic system but the character and tone of the utterance of these new reformer somewhat weaken the effect which have be produce by the bolder complaint of the earlier leader of the movement for while the student of the university and some of they professor still show a desire for bold and independent action the merchant catch eagerly at the sympathy of the archduke franci charle while the bookseller address to the emperor a petition in which servility pass into blasphemy these sign of weakness be no doubt observe by the government and it be not wonderful that under these circumstance metternich and kolowrat should have be able to persuade themselves that they could still play with the viennese and put they off with promise which need never be fulfil archduke loui alone seem to have foresee the come storm but be unable to persuade he colleague to make military preparation to meet it in the mean time the movement among the student be assume more decide proportion and they demand relate as usual to the great question of freedom of speech freedom of the press and freedom of teaching and to these be add the demand for popular representation the justification for which they draw from kossuth 's speech of march 3d but while hungary supply the model of constitutional government the hope for a wider national life connect itself more and more with the idea of a unite germany two day after the delivery of kossuth 's speech a impulse have be give to this latter feeling by the meeting at heidelberg of the lead supporter of german unity and they have elect a committee of seven to prepare the way for a constituent assembly at frankfort of these seven two come from baden one from wurtemberg one from hesse-darmstadt one from prussium one from bavarium and one from frankfort thus it will be see that south germany still keep the lead in the movement for german unity and the president of the committee be that izstein of baden who have be know to germany chiefly by he ill-timed expulsion from berlin but though this distribution of power augur ill for the relation between the leader of the german movement and the king of prussium the meeting at heidelberg be not prepare to adopt the complete program of the baden leader nor to commit itself to that republican movement which would probably have repel the north german liberal the chief leader of the more moderate party in the meeting be heinrich von gagern the representative of hesse-darmstadt gagern be the son of a former minister of the grand duke of nassau who have leave that state to take service in austrium and who have act with the archduke john in plan a popular rise in the tyrol in 1813 heinrich have be train at a military school in munich he have steadily oppose the policy of metternich have do he best to induce the university to co-operate in a common german movement and have try to secure internal liberty for hesse-darmstadt while he have urge he countryman to look for the model of a free constitution rather to england and hungary than to france during the constitutional movement of 1848 he have become prime minister of hesse-darmstadt and he seem to have have considerable power of win popular confidence although he be not able to commit the meeting to a definitely monarchical policy he have influence enough to counteract the attempt of struve and hecker to carry a proposal for the proclamation of a republic and he influence increase during the later phase of the movement it be obvious that in the state of viennese feeling a movement in favor of german unity at once so determine and so moderate in its character would give new impulse to the hope for freedom already excite by kossuth 's speech and the action of the reformer now become more vigorous because the student rather than the professor be guide the movement some of the latter and particularly professor hye be begin to be alarm and be attempt to hold they pupil in check this rouse the distrust and suspicion of the student and it be with great difficulty that professor hye and endlicher could prevail on the younger leader of the movement to abstain from action until the professor have lay before the emperor the desire of the university for the removal of metternich this deputation wait on the emperor on march 12th but it prove of little avail and when the professor return with the answer that the emperor would consider they wish the student receive they with laughter and resolve to take the matter into they own hand the next day be to be the opening of the assembly of the estate of lower austrium and the student of vienna resolve to march from the university to the landhaus in the great hall of the university now hide away in a obscure part of vienna but still retain trace of the painting which then decorate it the student gather in large number on march 13th various rumor of a discourage kind have be circulate this and that lead citizen be mention as have be arrest nay it be even say that member of the estate have themselves be seize and that the sit of the assembly would not be allow to take place to these rumor be add the warning of the professor fuester who have recently preach on the duty of devotion to the cause of the country now endeavor by praise of the emperor to check the desire of the student for immediate action but he be shout down hye then appeal to they to wait a few day in hope of a further answer from the emperor they answer with a shout that they would not wait a hour and then they raise the cry of landhaus breaking loose from all further restraint they set out on they march and as they go number gather round they the people of vienna have already be appeal to by a placard on st stephen 's church to free the good emperor ferdinand from he enemy and the placard further declare that he who wish for the rise of austrium must wish for the fall of the present minister of state the appeal produce its effect and the crowd grow dense as the student march into the narrow herren gasse they pass under the archway which lead into the courtyard of the landhaus there in front of the very build where the assembly be sit they come to a dead halt and with the strange hesitation which sometimes come over crowd no man seem to know what be next to be do suddenly in the pause which follow the word _ meine herren _ be hear from a corner of the crowd it be evident that some one be try to address they and the student nearest to the speaker hoist he upon they shoulder then the crowd see a quiet-looking man with a round strong head short-cropped hair and a thick beard each man eagerly ask he neighbor who this could be and as the speech proceed the news go round that this be doctor fischhof a man who have be very little known beyond medical circle and hitherto look upon as quite outside political movement such be the speaker who now utter what be still remember as the first free word in vienna he begin by dwelling on the importance of the day and on the need of encourage the man who sit there point to the landhaus by we appeal to they of strengthen they by we adherence and lead they to the desire end by we coöperation in action he exclaim fischhof who have no courage on such a day as this be only fit for the nursery he then proceed to dwell at some length on the need for freedom of the press and trial by jury then catch as it be the note of kossuth 's speech of march 3d he go on to speak of the greatness which austrium might attain by combine together the idealist german the steady industrious and persevere slav the knightly and enthusiastic magyar the clever and sharp-sighted italian finally he call upon they to demand freedom of the press freedom of religion freedom of teaching and learn a responsible ministry representation of the people arm of the people and connection with germany in the mean time the estate be sit within they have gather in unusually large number be persuade by they president that they be bind to resist the stream of opinion representative as they be of the privileged class they have little sympathy with the movement that be go on in vienna nor do it appear that there be anyone among they who be dispose to play the part of a confalonierus or szechenyus much less of a mirabeau or a lafayette many of they have hear rumor of the come deputation but montecuccolus they president refuse to begin the proceedings before the regular hour while they be still debate this point they hear the rush of the crowd outside then the sudden silence and then fischhof 's voice several member be seize with a panic and desire to adjourn again montecuccoli refuse to yield and one of they liberal member urge they to take courage from the fact of this deputation to make stronger demand on the government but before the assembly could decide to act the crowd outside have take sterner measure the speaker who immediately follow fischhof have make little impression then another doctor name goldmark spring up and urge the people to break into the landhaus so before the leader of the estate have decide what action to take the door be suddenly burst open and fischhof enter at the head of the crowd he announce that he have come to encourage the estate in they deliberation and to ask they to sanction the demand embody in the petition of the people montecuccoli assure the deputation that the emperor have already promise to summon the provincial assembly to vienna and that for they part the estate of lower austrium be in favor of progress but he add they must have room and opportunity to deliberate fischhof assent to this suggestion and persuade he follower to withdraw to the courtyard but those who have remain behind have be seize with a fear of treachery and a cry arise that fischhof have be arrest thereupon fischhof show himself with montecuccolus on the balcony and the president promise that the estate would send a deputation of they own to the emperor to express to he the wish of the people he therefore invite the crowd to choose twelve man to be present at the deliberation of the estate during the draw up of the petition while the election of these twelve be still go on a hungarian student appear with the german translation of kossuth 's speech the hungarian 's voice be too weak to make itself hear he hand the speech to a tyrolese student who read it to the crowd the allusion to the need of a constitution be receive with loud applause and so also be the expression of the hope for good from the archduke franci joseph but however much the reading of the speech have encourage the hope of the crowd it have also give time for the estate to decide on a course without wait for the twelve representative of the people and before the crowd have hear the end of kossuth 's speech the reading be interrupt by a message from the estate announce the contents of they propose petition the petition have shrink to the meager demand that a report on the condition of the state bank should be lay before the estate and that a committee should be choose from provincial assembly to consider timely reform and to take a share in legislation the feeble character of the propose compromise rouse a storm of scorn and rage and a moravian student tear the message of the estate into piece the conclusion of kossuth 's speech rouse the people to still further excitement and with cry for a free constitution for union with germany and against alliance with russium the crowd once more break into the assembly one of the lead student then demand of montecuccolus whether this be the whole of the petition they intend to send to the emperor montecuccolus answer that the estate have be so disturbed in they deliberation that they have not be able to come to a final decision but he declare that they desire to lay before the emperor all the wish of the people again the leader of the crowd repeat in slightly altered form the demand originally formulate by fischhof at last after considerable discussion montecuccolus be prepare to start for the castle at the head of the estate when a regiment of soldier arrive but they be unable to make they way through the crowd and be even press back out of the herren gasse the desire now arise for better protection for the people and a deputation try to persuade the burgomaster of vienna to call out the city guard czapka the burgomaster be however a mere tool of the government and he declare that the archduke albert as commander-in-chief of the army have alone the power of call out the guard the archduke albert be perhaps next to loui the most unpopular of the royal house he indignantly refuse to listen to any demand of the people and hasten to the spot rally the soldier and lead they to the open space at the corner of the herren gasse which be know as the freyung the inner circle of vienna be at this time surround with wall outside of which be the large suburb in which chiefly workman live the student seem already to have gain some sympathy with the workman and for the previous two year the discontent cause by the suffering of the poorer class have be take a more directly political turn several of the workman have press in with the student in the morning into the inner town and some big man with rough darned coat and dirty cap over they ear be see clench they fist for the fight the news quickly spread to the suburb that the soldier be about to attack the people seize long pole and any iron tool which come to hand the workman rush forward to the gate of the inner town in one district they find the town gate close against they and cannon place on the bastion near but in other the authority be unprepared and the workman burst into the inner town tear down stone and plaster to throw at the soldier in the mean time the representative of the estate have reach the castle and be try to persuade the authority to yield to the demand of the people metternich persist in believe that the whole affair be move by foreign influence and particularly by italian and swiss and he desire that the soldier should gather in the castle and that prince windischgraetz should be appoint commandant of the city alfr windischgraetz be a bohemian nobleman who have previously be know chiefly for he strong aristocratic feeling which he be say to have embody in the expression human being begin at baron but he have be mark out by metternich as a man of vigor and decision who might be trust to act in a emergency lator who have be the previous commandant of the castle in vienna show sign of hesitation at this crisis and this give metternich the excuse for dismiss lator and appoint windischgraetz in he place to this arrangement all the ruling council consent but when archduke loui and metternich propose to make windischgraetz military dictator of the city and to allow he to bring out cannon for firing on the people great opposition arise the archduke john be perhaps one of the few councillor who really sympathize with liberal idea but several of the archduke and particularly franci charle heartily desire the fall of metternich and kolowrat share they wish this combined opposition of sincere reformer and jealous courtier hinder metternich 's policy and it be decide that the city guard should first be call out and that the dictatorship of windischgraetz should be keep in reserve as a last resource in the mean time the struggle on the street be rage fiercely archduke albert have find to he cost that the insurrection be not as he have suppose the work of a few discontented man the student fight gallantly but a still fiercer element be contribute to the insurrection by the workman who have come in from the suburb one workman be wound in he head he arm and he foot but he continue to encourage he friend and cry out that he care nothing for life either he would die that day or else the high gentleman should be overthrow another who have have no food since the morning entreat for a little refreshment that he might be able to fight the better and he quickly return to the struggle in those suburb from which the workman have not be able to break into the inner town the insurrection threaten to assume the form of a attack on the employer machine be destroy and the house of those employer who have lower wages be set on fire it be this aspect of the insurrection which encourage the noble to believe that by call out the guard they would induce the richer citizen to take arm against the workman and this policy be carry still further when on the application of the rector of the university the student also be allow the privilege of bear arm but the ruse entirely fail the people recognize the city guard as they friend and refuse to attack they and the rumor soon spread that the police have fire on the city guard it be now evident that the citizen soldier be on the side of the people and the richer citizen send a deputation to entreat that metternich should be dismiss but the archduke maximilian be resolve that as the first expedient propose by the council have fail he would now apply some of those more violent remedy which have be postpone at first he therefore order that the cannon should be bring down from the castle to the michaelerplatz from this point the cannon would have command on the one side the herren gasse where the crowd have gather in the morning and in front the kohlmarkt which lead to the wide street of amgraben have the cannon be fire then and there the course of the insurrection must in one way or other have be change that change might have be as maximilian hope the complete collapse of the insurrection or as lator hold the cannon might have sweep away the last vestige of loyalty to the emperor and the republic might have be instantly proclaimed but in any case the result must have be most disastrous to the cause both of order and liberty for the passion which have already be rouse especially among the workman could hardly have fail to produce one of those savage struggle which may overthrow one tyranny but which usually end in the establishment of another fortunately however the archduke maximilian seem to have have no official authority in this matter and when he give the order to fire the master-gunner a bohemian name pollett declare that he would not obey the order unless it be give by the commander of the force or the commander of the town the archduke then appeal to the subordinate to fire in spite of this opposition but pollett place himself in front of the cannon and exclaim : the cannon be under my command until there come a order from my commander and until necessity oblige it let no one fire on friendly unarmed citizen only over my body shall you fire the archduke retire in despair in the mean time the deputation of citizen have reach the castle at first the official be dispose to treat they angrily and even try to detain they by force but the news of the concession of arm to the student the urgent pressure of archduke john and the account of the grow fury of the people finally decide metternich to yield and advance into the room where the civic deputation be assemble he declare that as they have say he resignation would bring peace to austria he now resign he office and wish good luck to the new government many of the royal family and of the other member of the council flatter themselves that they have get rid of a formidable enemy without make any definite concession to the people windischgraetz alone protest against the abandonment of metternich by the ruler of austrium metternich have hope to retire quietly to he own villa but it have be already burn in the insurrection and he soon find that it be safer to fly from vienna and eventually to take refuge in england he have however one consolation in all he misfortune in the memoir write four year later he express he certainty that he at least have do no wrong and that if he have to begin he career again he would follow the same course he take before and would not deviate from it for a instant when at half-past eight in the evening of march 13th man go through the street of vienna cry out metternich be fall it seem as if the march of the student and the petition of fischhof have produce in one day all the result desire but neither the suspicion of the people nor the violent intention of the prince be at a end the archduke still talk of make windischgraetz dictator of vienna the workman still rage in the suburb and the student refuse to leave the university for fear a attack should be make upon it but in spite of the violence of the workman the leader of the richer citizen be more and more determine to make common cause with reformer indeed both they and the student hope to check the violence of the riot while they prevent any reactionary movement the emperor also be on the side of concession he refuse to let the people be fire on and announce on the 14th the freedom of the press but unfortunately he be seize with one of he epileptic fit and the intriguer who be already consolidate themselves into the secret council know as the camarillum publish the news of windischgraetz 's dictatorship and resolve to place vienna under a state of siege while the emperor be incapable of give direction the news of windischgraetz 's accession to power so alarm the people that they at once decide to march upon the castle but one of the lead citizen name arthaber persuade they to abandon they intention and instead to send he and another friend to ask for a constitution from the emperor a struggle be evidently go on between ferdinand and he courtier whenever he be strong and able to hold he own he be ready to make concession whenever he be either ill or still suffer from the mental effect of he illness the government fall into the hand of windischgraetz and the archduke and violent measure be propose thus though arthaber and he friend be receive courteously and assure of the constitutional intention of the emperor at eleven o'clock on the same night there appear a public notice declare vienna in a state of siege but even windischgraetz seem to have be somewhat frighten by the undaunted attitude of the people and when he find that he notice be tear down from the wall and that a new insurrection be about to break out he send for professor hye and entreat he to preserve order in the mean time the emperor have to some extent recover he sens and he speedily issue a promise to summon the estate of the german and slavonic province and the congregation of lombardo-venetium but the people have have enough of sham constitution and the emperor 's proclamation be tear down this act however do not imply any personal hostility to ferdinand for the belief that the austrian minister be thwart the good intention of they master be as deeply root at this time in the mind of the viennese as be a similar belief with regard to pius ix and he cardinal in the mind of the roman and when the emperor drive out on march 15th he be receive with loud cheer but as ferdinand listen to these cheer he must have notice that louder than the _ e lebe der kaiser _ of he german subject and the _ slawa _ of the bohemian rise the sound of the hungarian _ eljen _ for mingle in the crowd with the ordinary inhabitant of vienna be the hungarian deputation which have at last be permit by the count palatine to leave presburg and which have arrive in vienna to demand both freedom that have be grant to the german and also a separate responsible ministry for hungary they arrive in the full glory of recent success in the presburg diet for strengthen by the news of the viennese rise kossuth have carry in one day many of the reform for which he party have so long be contend the last remnant of the dependent condition of the peasantry have be sweep away taxation have be make universal and freedom of the press and universal military service have be promise szechenyus alone have venture to raise a note of warning and it have fall unheeded in vienna kossuth be welcome almost as cordially as in presburg for the german movement in vienna have tend to produce in its supporter a willingness to lose the eastern half of the empire in order to obtain the union of the western half with germany so the note of arndt 's _ deutsch vaterland _ be mingle with the cry of _ batthyanyus lajo minister praesident _ before such a combination as this ferdinand have no desire windischgraetz no power to maintain a obstinate resistance and on march 16th sedlnitzky the hate head of the police be dismiss from office on the 18th a responsible ministry be appoint and on the 22d windischgraetz announce that national affair would now be guide on the path of progress in the mean time that german movement from which the viennese derive so much of they impulse have be gain a new accession of force in the north of germany in berlin the order of the viennese movement have be to some extent reverse there the artisan instead of take they tone from the student have give the first impulse to reform the king indeed have begin he concession by grant freedom of the press on march 7th but it seem very unlikely that this concession would be accompany by any security that would make it a reality the king even refuse to fulfil he promise of summon the assembly and it be in consequence of this refusal that the artisan present to the town council of berlin a petition for the redress of they special grievance the same kind of misery which prevail in vienna have show itself though in less degree in berlin and committee have be form for the relief of the poor the town council refuse to present the petition of the workman and in order to take the movement out of they hand present a petition of they own in favor of freedom of the press trial by jury representation of the german people in the bundestag and the summon of all the provincial assembly of the kingdom this petition be reject by the king and thereupon on march 13th the people gather in large number in the street general pfuel fire on they but instead of yield they throw up barricade and a fierce struggle ensue on the 14th the cry for complete freedom of the press become louder and more prominent and the insurgent be encourage by the first news of the vienna rise the other part of the kingdom now join in the movement on the 14th come deputation from the rhine province who demand in a threatening manner the extension of popular liberty on the 16th come the more important news that posen and silesium be in revolt mieroslawsky who have be one of the leader of the polish movement of 1846 have gain much popularity in berlin and he seem fully dispose to combine the movement for the independence of posen with that for the freedom of prussium much in the same way as kossuth have combine the cause of hungarian liberty with the demand for a austrian constitution in silesium no doubt the terrible famine of the previous year and the remains of feudal oppression have sharpen the desire for liberty and closely follow on the news of these two revolt come clearer account of the viennese rise and the happy tiding of the fall of metternich the king of prussium promise on the arrival of this news to summon the assembly for April 2d and two day later he appear on the balcony of he palace and declare he desire to change germany from a alliance of state into a federal state but the suspicion of the people have now be thoroughly arouse and on march 18th the very day on which the king make this declaration fresh deputation come to demand liberty from he and when he appeal to they to go home he request be not comply with the threatening attitude of the soldier and the recollection of they violence on the precede day have convince the people that until part at least of the military force be remove they could have no security for liberty the event of the day justify they belief for while some one be read aloud to the people the account of the concession recently make by the king the soldier suddenly fire upon they and the crowd flee in every direction they flee however soon to rally again barricade be once more throw up the pole of posen flock in to help they friend and the black red and gold flag of germany be display woman join the fight at the barricade and on the 19th some of the rifleman whom the king have bring from neuchâtel refuse to fire upon the people then the king suddenly yield dismiss he minister and promise to withdraw the troops and allow the arming of the people the victory of the popular cause seem now complete but the bitterness which still remain in the heart of the citizen be show by a public funeral procession through berlin in honor of those who have fall in the struggle the king stand bare-headed on the balcony as the procession pass the palace and on march 21st he come forward in public wave the black red and gold flag of germany -lrb- 1848 -rrb- the revolt of hungary arminius vambery deep interest throughout the civilized world be arouse by the unavailing struggle of hungary in 1848 for national independence the name of loui kossuth the hungarian patriot and famous orator become celebrate in many land and in the various country where he sojourn as a exile from he own -- especially in the united state -lrb- 1851-1852 -rrb- and in england -- he eloquent appeal awaken profound sympathy for he people 's cause vambery however regard kossuth 's compatriot count stephen szechenyus -lrb- bear in 1791 -rrb- as the greatest hungarian of the nineteenth century he be descend from a distinguished family which have give to its country many champion of liberty the great aim of he life be to revive the drooping energy of the nation as a youth he serve in the army enter the famous diet of 1825 in which by right of birth he take he seat in the upper house he distinguish himself by he liberal leadership and as a writer and a advocate of public endowment accomplish much for the education of he people up to the time at which vambery the celebrated historian of hungary begin the present narrative the growth of the national spirit have be more and more evident each year since the end of the napoleonic war for more than two century hungary have be under the oppressive rule of austrium hungary have furnish soldier to austria in she struggle against bonaparte and the austrian emperor have repeatedly promise to redress hungarian grievance but after the fall of napoleon these promise be repudiate hungary so emphatically show she indignation that the emperor be compel to convoke the diet in which szechenyus distinguish himself the subsequent career of this leader the character and aim of kossuth and the insurrection they do so much to incite be powerfully describe by vambery who write not only as a author fully verse in he country 's annals but also as a patriot jealous of she liberty proud of she heroic son and loyal to she fame for fifteen year up to 1840 the popularity of szechenyus extend over hungary and he name be cherish by every patriot in the land about this time however the great statesman be destine to come into collision with a man who be he peer in genius and ability the two patriot be representative of different method and in the contest produce by the shock of antagonistic tendency szechenyus be compel to yield to loui kossuth he younger rival although there be no material difference between they aim -- for both wish to see they country great free constitutionally govern prosperous and advanced in civilization -- yet in the way and mean employ by they to attain that aim they be diametrically oppose to each other szechenyus who descend from a family of ancient and aristocratic lineage and present himself to the nation with connection reach up into the highest circle of the court with the lustre of he ancient name and with he immense fortune wish to secure the happiness of he country by quite different method from those adopt by loui kossuth a child of the people who although he be a nobleman by birth yet belong to that poorer class of gentry who support themselves by they own exertion and who in hungary be destine to fulfil the mission of the citizen-class of other country it be from this class of the gentry for the most part that be recruit the trades-people the smaller landowner professional man writer subordinate official lawyer physician clergyman teacher and professor by virtue of they nobility it be true they belong to the privileged class of the country and be not subject to the humiliation of the oppressed peasantry yet they have to earn a living by they own work and be therefore not only accessible to but be ready enthusiastically to receive the lofty message of liberty and equality which the french revolution of 1830 begin to proclaim anew throughout europe these doctrine form a sharp contrast to the view of count stephen szechenyus view which owe to the social position of the man who hold they be not devoid of a certain aristocratic tinge and accord to which the most important part in the regeneration of the hungarian nation be assign to the aristocracy it be a part however which the hungarian aristocracy be itself by no means dispose to assume among its younger member indeed could be find here and there enthusiastic man who be devotedly attach to the person of the lordly reformer but the great majority of he class be hostilely array against szechenyus 's aim and obstruct the grant of even the most inoffensive demand of the nation support the viennese government which be rigidly oppose to political reform and to any change in the public institution of the country this attitude of the aristocracy compel szechenyus to avoid as much as possible all question concern constitutionality and liberty and to confine the work of reform chiefly to the sphere of internal improvement the only way in which he could hope to obtain the support of the court of vienna and of the majority of the upper house for he politico-economical measure be to remain as neutral as possible in politics the idea which chiefly govern he action be that the country should be first strengthened internally and that afterward it would be easy for the nation to bring about the triumph of she national and political aspiration after 1840 however the bulk of the nation and especially the small gentry whose preponderating influence be make itself continually feel be unwilling to follow szechenyus in he one-sided policy the reformatory work of szechenyus during the precede fifteen year have educate public opinion up to new and great idea but the leader of that public opinion be now to be find in the house of representative in the person of franci deak and loui kossuth they wish to obtain for they country both political liberty and material prosperity they know the effect of political institution upon the material well-being and civilization of a nation and they no longer deem it possible to attain these object without a modern constitutional government loui kossuth who be bear in 1802 be the very incarnation of the great democratic idea of he age he be entirely a man of work and enter the legal profession after he have complete he study with great distinction for the purpose of support himself by it kossuth be present at the diet of 1832 when the government which conduct itself most brutally and arbitrarily toward the press refuse to allow the newspaper to print report of the deliberation of the diet in spite of the repeat urging by the deputy for such a authorization and it be owe to he ingenuity that this prohibition be evade the censorship be exercise on print matter only and do not extend to manuscript kossuth write out the report of the diet himself have numerous copy make of they in write and circulate they for a slight fee in every part of the country where they be look for with feverish expectation and owe to the spirit of opposition with which they be color be read with the greatest eagerness this manuscript newspaper produce quite a revolutionary movement among the people frightening even the austrian government the latter now attempt to silence kossuth by gentle means promise he high office and a pension but he refuse the entice offer and continue he work for the benefit of the nation foiled in the attempt to lure kossuth from he duty the government resort to violence seize the lithographic apparatus by means of which kossuth plan to multiply he manuscript newspaper and give direction to the postmaster to detain and open all those seal package which be suppose to contain the report but these arbitrary proceedings of the government could not put a end to the circulation of the newspaper the country gentleman by they own servant continue to send each other single copy and the matter be give up only when the diet cease to be in session then kossuth at the urgent request of he friend and one might say of the whole country start a new manuscript newspaper at budapest which report the deliberation of the county assembly the effect produce by this new paper be fraught with even greater consequence than the first have create for it be instrumental in bring the county into contact with one another thus give they a opportunity to combine against the government the latter however soon prohibit its publication but the prohibition give rise to a storm of indignation throughout the whole country the county in solid array address protest to the government against the illegal act and in behalf of kossuth who continue to publish the paper in spite of the inhibition the government at last resort to the most barefaced brutality kossuth the brave champion of liberty its eloquent pen and herald be drag to a damp and dark subterranean prison-cell in the castle of buda and detain there while he father and mother and he family who be look to he solely for they support be rob of the aid of they natural protector although at that period lawlessness be the order of the day yet this last cruel and illegal act of the government greatly exasperate the public mind which be already in a ferment of excitement but while the excited passion rage throughout the country the government nothing loth cause kossuth to be prosecute for high treason and have obtain he conviction have he sentence to a imprisonment of three year kossuth apply himself during he detention to serious study and acquire also while in prison the english language to such a extent that he be enable to address in that language during he exile with great effect and impressiveness large audience both in england and in the united state of america he imprisonment last two long year after the lapse of which he obtain in 1840 a pardon in consequence of the repeat and urgent representation of the diet kossuth return to the scene of he former activity as the martyr of free speech and the victim to the cause of the nation he very soon find a new field in which to labor the government perceive at last that violence be of little avail and that those question which be occupy the mind to such a degree could no longer be keep from be publicly discuss by the press kossuth now obtain permission to edit a political daily paper its publication be commence under the title of _ pestus hirlap _ -lrb- newspaper of pest -rrb- in 1841 and may be say to have create the political daily press of hungary it disseminate new idea among the mass stir up the indifferent to feel a interest in the affair of the country and give a purpose to the national aspiration it proclaim democratic reform in every department the abolition of the privilege of the nobility and of they exemption from taxation equal rights and equal burden for all the citizen of the state and the extension of public instruction and it endeavor to restore the hungarian nationality to the place it be entitle to claim in the organism of the state the wealth of idea thus daily communicate to the country appear in the most attractive garb for kossuth possess a masterly style and he leader and shorter article show off to advantage so many unexpected beauty of the hungarian language that he reader be fairly enchanted and carry away by they he article be a happy compound of poetical elevation and oratorical power gratify common-sense and the imagination at the same time appeal by they lucid exposition to the reader 's intelligence and exciting and warm he fancy by they fervor kossuth always rightly guess what question most interested the nation and the daily press become in he hand a power in hungary electrify the mass who be always ready to give they unconditional support to he bold and far-reaching scheme the extraordinary influence obtain by kossuth through he paper frighten szechenyus and to even a greater degree those whose prejudice be shock or ancient privilege and interest be endanger by the democratic agitation for reform kossuth be attack in book pamphlet and newspaper but he come out victorious from all contest in vain do szechenyus himself back by he great authority in the land assail he declare that he do not object to kossuth 's idea but that he manner and he tactic be reprehensible and that the latter be sure to lead to a revolution the great mass of the people feel instinctively that revolution have become a necessity and be unavoidable if hungary be to pass from the old mediaeval order to the establishment of modern institution and be to become a state where equality before the law should be the ruling standard the mass be strengthen in this conviction by the unreasonable short-sighted and violent policy pursue by the government of vienna which obstruct the slightest reform in the ancient institution and oppose every national aspiration and under whose protect wing the reactionary element of the upper house be constantly paralyze the noblest and best effort make by the lower house for the public weal while the same government arbitrarily support claim of the catholic clergy in flat contradiction to the rights and liberty of the various denomination inhabit the country the government in its antipathy to the national movement go even further it secretly incite the other nationality especially the croat against the hungarian and thus plant the seed from which spring the subsequent great civil war in observe the dangerous symptom precede the last-mentioned movement and the bloody scene and fight provoke at every election by the hireling of the government in order to intimidate the adherent of reform the friend of progress become more and more convinced that the period of moderation such as preach by szechenyus have pass by and must give way to that resolute policy advocate by kossuth which recoil from no consequence numerous magnate all the chief leader of the gentry boasting of enlightenment and patriotism and imbue with european culture rally around kossuth until finally the public opinion of the country and the enthusiasm of which he be the center cause he to be return in 1847 together with count loui batthyanyus as deputy from the foremost county of the country the county of pest during the first month of the diet of 1847-1848 which be to raise hungary to the rank of those country that proclaim equal rights and possess a responsible parliamentary government it differ very little from the one precede it the opposition initiate great reform as before but there be no one who believe that they realization be near at hand kossuth repeatedly address the house and soon convinced he audience that he be as irresistible a orator as he have prove powerful as a writer but there be nothing to indicate that the country be on the eve of a great transformation the revolution of February 1848 which break out in paris change as if by magic the relative position of austrium and hungary metternich 's system of government which be oppose to grant liberty to the people collapse at once the storm of popular indignation sweep it away like a house build of card at the first news of the occurrence in pari kossuth ask in the lower house for the creation of a responsible ministry the motion be favorably receive but in the upper house it be reject the government not be yet alive to the real state of affair and still hope by a system of negation to frustrate the wish of the people but very soon the revolution rear its head in vienna itself and the wish of the hungarian people utter at budapest receive thereby a new and powerful advocate at that time the hungarian diet still meet at presburg but the two sister-city of buda and pest form the real capital of the country and be the center of commerce industry science and literature michael vorosmarty the poet laureate of the nation live in pest and there the twin star of literature alexander petofus and maurice jokaus shone on the national horizon jokaus who be still live -lrb- 1886 -rrb- and enjoy a world-wide

revolution of march 15 1848 which obtain the liberty of the press for the nation and at the same time in a solemn manifesto give expression to the wish of the hungarian in the matter of reform the only act of violence these revolutionary hero be guilty of be the enter of a printing establishment whose proprietor afraid of the government have refuse to print the admirable poem of petofus entitle _ talpra magyar _ -lrb- up magyar -rrb- and do the printing there themselves the first stanza of this poem later the war-song of the national movement run in a literal translation thus : arise o magyar thy country call here be the time now or never shall we be slave or free that be the question -- choose we swear by the god of the magyar we swear to be slave no longer this soul-stirring poem be improvise by petofus under the inspiration of the moment and at the same establishment where it be first print be also print a proclamation which contain twelve article set forth the wish of the

government and the magnificent reform the transformation however have be so sudden and unexpected and the old aristocratic world with all its institution and its ancient organization have be sweep away with such vehement precipitation that even under ordinary circumstance in the absence of all opposition the new idea and tendency could have hardly enter into the political life of the nation without cause some confusion and disorder but in addition to these natural drawback the new order of thing have to contend with certain national element in the population which feeling themselves injure in they real or imaginary interest be bent on mischief hope to be able to rob the nation in the midst of the ensue trouble of the great political prize she have win certain circle of the court and class of the people strive equally hard to surround with difficulty the practical introduction of the constitution of 1848 the court and the standing army the party of the soldier class fear that they commanding position would be impair by the predominate influence of the people the non-hungarian portion of the inhabitant choose to ignore the fact that the new law secure without distinction of nationality equal rights to every citizen of the state be apprehensive lest the liberal constitution would benefit chiefly the hungarian element of the nation they therefore encourage by the secret machination of the government of vienna take up arm in order to drag the country which be prepare to take possession of she new liberty into a civil war the croatian under the lead of ban jellachich and the wallach and serb lead by other imperial officer and yield to they persuasion rise in rebellion against hungary and begin to persecute plunder and murder the hungarian live among they dreadful

previously happen at the approach of the turk and thousand be compel to abandon they all to the rebel in order to escape with they bare life in the course of a few week the flame of rebellion have spread over a large part of the country and the hungarian element instead of enjoy the liberty win for the whole nation after a bitter struggle of many decade be under the sad necessity of resort to armed force in order to reëstablish the internal peace the hungarian now have to prove on the battlefield and in bloody engagement that they be worthy of liberty and capable of defend it the government which by virtue of the new law have meanwhile transfer its seat to budapest display extraordinary energy in the face of the sad difficulty beset it as it be impossible to rely upon the austrian soldier who be still in the country it exert itself to create and to organize a national army a portion of the national guard enter the national army under the name of _ honved _ -lrb- defender of the country -rrb- a name which become before long famous throughout the civilized world for the brilliant military achievement connect with it the hungarian soldier garrison the austrian principality hasten home brave the greatest danger partly accompany by they officer and partly without they the famous hungarian hussar especially return in great number to offer they service to they imperilled country but all this prove insufficient and as soon as the national assembly elect under the new constitution meet kossuth who have be the life and soul of the government during this try and critical period call upon the nation to raise large army for the defense of the country the session of July 11th during which kossuth introduce in the house of representative he motion relate to the subject present a scene which beggar all description kossuth ascend the tribune pale and haggard with illness but the long-continued applause that greet he after the first few sentence soon give he back he strength and he marvellous oratorical power when he have conclude he speech and submit to the house he request for two hundred thousand soldier and the necessary money a momentary pause of deep silence ensue suddenly paul nyary the leader of the opposition arise and lift he right arm toward heaven exclaim : we grant it the house be in a fever of patriotic excitement all the deputy rise from they seat shout we grant it we grant it kossuth with tear in he eye bow to the representative of the people and say you have rise like one man and i bow down before the greatness of the nation these sacrifice on the part of the country have become a matter of urgent necessity the serb and wallach insurrection assume every day larger proportion while the croat under the leadership of jellachich enter hungarian territory with the fix determination of deprive the nation of she constitutional liberty but the hungarian government be already able to send a army against the croatian who be march on budapest plundering and lay waste everything before they they be surround by the hungarian force and a part of they army nine thousand man strong be compel to lay down its arm while jellachich with he remain force precipitately flee from the country the young hungarian army have thus prove itself equal to the task of repel the attack of the croat but the recent event be nevertheless fraught with the gravest consequence the news of the croatian invasion fill the hungarian with deep anxiety and the extraordinary excitement cause by it cast a permanent cloud over the soul of that great and noble man count szechenyus the mind of the great patriot who have initiate the national movement give way under the strain of the frightful rumor come from the croatian frontier he have be ail for some time and he nervousness increase so greatly under the pressure of the great event follow one another in rapid succession that when the news come that the enemy have invade the country he think hungary be lose he despair darken he mind and he seek death in the wave of the danube he family remove he to a private asylum near vienna where he recover he mental faculty and even write several book but he be never entirely cure of he hallucination and exasperate by the vexation he be subject to by the viennese government even in the asylum the great patriot put a end to he own life on April 8 1860 by a pistol-shot jellachich 's incursion have other important political consequence the attack on hungary have be make by jellachich in the name of the viennese government and the intimate connection between the domestic disorder and the court of vienna become more and more apparent this state of thing render inevitable a struggle between hungary and the unconstitutional action of the court the austrian force be arm against hungary on every side vienna too rise in rebellion against the court and now the hungarian hasten to assist the revolutionist in the austrian capital unfortunately the young national army be not ripe yet for so great a military enterprise and prince windischgraetz have crush the revolution in vienna invade hungary a last attempt be now make by the hungarian to negotiate peace with the court but it fail windischgraetz be so elated with he success that nothing short of unconditional submission on the part of the country would satisfy he to accept such term would have be both cowardly and suicidal and the nation therefore drive to the sad alternative of war determine rather to perish gloriously than pusillanimously to submit to be enslave by the court they follow the lead of kossuth who be now at the head of the government while gorgeus be the commander-in-chief of the hungarian army the two name of kossuth and gorgeus soon constitute the glory of the nation while these two act in harmony they achieve brilliant triumph but they personal antagonism greatly contribute at a subsequent period to the calamity of the country windischgraetz take possession of buda in January 1849 thus compelling kossuth to transfer the seat of government to debreczin while gorgeus withdraw with he army to the northern part of hungary but the national army fight victoriously against the serb and wallach and the situation of the hungarian have in the course of the winter become more favorable all over the country the genius of kossuth bring again and again as if by magic fresh army into the field and he be indefatigable in organize the defense of the country distinguish general like gorgeus klapka damjanic and bem transform the raw recruit in a wonderfully short time into properly discipline troops who be able to hold they own and bravely contend against the old and try imperial force whom they put to flight at every point the fortune of war change in favor of the hungarian in the latter part of January 1849 klapka achieve the first triumph which be follow by the brilliant victory win by one of gorgeus 's division command by guyon in

be take be poor and yield small return for year of work the discovery in 1848 influence the whole world give new life to trade and industry everywhere the first publish report of gold in californium appear in hakluyt 's account of sir franci drake 's visit to the coast in 1579 the observation of drake 's man be suppose by some to have be make at a point not far from san francisco the hakluyt statement however be disbelieve by many historian the spaniard and mexican who later visit the coast be know to have find gold at many place and especially near the colorado river but they discover no mine worth work report of great mineral wealth in californium be repeat up to the time of the american conquest but they command little confidence among mining expert although gold be find in what be now san diego county in 1828 alexander forbe the historian of californium write in 1835 that no mineral of particular importance have be discover in upper californium nor any ore of metal about 1838 a gold placer be discover in the can ± on of san francisquito forty-five mile northwest of lo angele and this be the first californium mine that produce any considerable amount of metal it be work for ten year and then abandon for richer digging in the sacramento valley the average yield for the ten year be probably about six thousand dollar after the return of the wilke explore expedition of 1842 jame d dana its mineralogist mention place in californium at which he have observe or infer the existence of gold but he report lead to no gold-hunting and have only a scientific interest the great discovery of 1848 and its world-wide effect be describe in the follow account by hittell which form a part of hubert h bancroft 's voluminous _ history of the pacific state _ as edmund hammond hargrave be the hero of the australian so be jame w marshall of the californian gold discovery before give the account of he discovery however i will quote the following passage from a letter write on may 4 1846 by thoma o larkin then unite state consul at monterey californium to jame buchanan secretary of state : there be say to be black lead in the country of san fernando near san pedro -lrb- now lo angele county -rrb- by wash the sand in a plate any person can obtain from one dollar to five dollar per day of gold that bring seventeen dollar per ounce in boston the gold have be gather for two or three year though but few have the patience to look for it on the southeast end of the island of catalina there be a silver mine from which silver have be extract there be no doubt but that gold silver quick-silver copper lead sulphur and coal mine be to be find all over californium and it be equally doubtful whether under they present owner they will ever be work jame w marshall in a letter date January 28 1856 and address to charle e pickett give the follow account of the gold discovery : toward the end of August 1847 captain sutter and i form a copartnership to build and run a sawmill upon a site select by myself -lrb- since know as coloma -rrb- we employ pl weimer and family to remove from the fort -lrb- sutter 's fort -rrb- to the mill-site to cook and labor for we nearly the first work do be the building of a double log cabin about half a mile from the mill-site we commence the mill about christmas some of the mill-hands want a cabin near the mill this be build and i go to the fort to superintend the construction of the mill-irons leave order to cut a narrow ditch where the race be to be make upon my return in January 1848 i find the ditch cut as direct and those who be work on the same be do so at a great disadvantage expend they labor upon the head of the race instead of the foot i immediately change the course of thing and upon the 19th of the same month of January discover the gold near the lower end of the race about two hundred yard below the mill william scott be the second man to see the metal he be at work at a carpenter 's bench near the mill i show the gold to he alexander stephen jame brown henry bigler and william johnston be likewise work in front of the mill frame the upper story they be call up next and of course see the precious metal pl weimer and charle bennett be at the old double log cabin -lrb- where hasting and company afterward keep a store -rrb- in the mean time we put in some wheat and pea nearly five acre across the river in February the captain -lrb- captain sutter -rrb- come to the mountain for the first time then we consummate a treaty with the indian which have be previously negotiate the tenor of this be that we be to pay they two hundred dollar yearly in goods at yerba buena price for the joint possession and occupation of the land with they they agree not to kill we stock viz horse cattle hog or sheep nor burn the grass within the limit fix by the treaty at the same time captain sutter myself and isaac humphrey enter into a copartnership to dig gold a short time afterward pl weimer move away from the mill and be away two or three month when he return with all the event that subsequently occur you and the public be well inform this be the most precise and be generally consider to be the most correct account of the gold discovery other version of the story have be publish however and the follow from a article publish in the coloma _ argus _ in the latter part of the year 1855 be one of they the statement be evidently derive from weimer who live at coloma : that jame w marshall pick up the first piece of gold be beyond doubt peter l weimer who reside in this place state positively that marshall pick up the gold in he presence they both see it and each speak at the same time ` what be that yellow stuff ' marshall be a step in advance pick it up this first piece of gold be now in the possession of mr weimer and weigh six pennyweight eleven grain the piece be give to she by marshall himself the dam be finish early in January the frame for the mill also erect and the flume and bulkhead complete it be at this time that marshall and weimer adopt the plan of raise the gate during the night to wash out sand from the mill-race closing it during the day when work would be continue with shovel etc early in February -- the exact day be not remember -- in the morning after shut off the water marshall and weimer walk down the race together to see what the water have accomplish during the night have go about twenty yard below the mill they both see the piece of gold before mention and marshall pick it up after a examination the gold be take to the cabin of weimer and mr weimer instruct to boil it in saleratus-water but she be engage in make soap pitch the piece into the soap-kettle where it be boil all day and all night the follow morning the strange piece of stuff be fish out of the soap all the brighter for the boiling discussion now commence and all express the opinion that perhaps the yellow substance might be gold little be say on the subject but everyone each morning search in the race for more and every day find several small scale the indian also pick up many small thin piece and carry they always to mr weimer about three week after the first piece be obtain marshall take the fine gold amounting to between two and three ounce and go to san francisco to have the strange metal test on he return he inform weimer that the stuff be gold all hand now begin to search for the ` root of all evil ' shortly after captain sutter come to coloma and he and marshall assemble the indian and buy of they a large tract of country about coloma in exchange for a lot of bead and a few cotton handkerchief they under color of this indian title require one-third of all the gold dig on they domain and collect at this rate until the fall of 1848 when a mining party from oregon decline pay ` tithe ' as they call it during February 1848 marshall and weimer go down the river to mormon island and there find scale of gold on the rock some week later they send mr henderson sydney willi and mr fifield mormon down there to dig tell they that that place be better than coloma these be the first miner at mormon island marshall be a man of a active enthusiastic mind and he at once attach great importance to he discovery he idea however be vague he know nothing about gold-mining he do not know how to take advantage of what he have find only a experienced gold-miner could understand the importance of the discovery and make it of practical value to all the world that gold-miner fortunately be near at hand he name be isaac humphrey he be reside in the town of san francisco in the month of February when a mr bennett one of the party employ at marshall 's mill go down to that place with some of the dust to have it test for it be still a matter of doubt whether this yellow metal really be gold bennett tell he errand to a friend whom he meet in san francisco and this friend introduce he to humphrey who have be a gold-miner in georgium and be therefore competent to pass a opinion humphrey look at the dust pronounce it gold at the first glance and express a belief that the digging must be rich he make inquiry about the place where the gold be find and subsequent inquiry about the trustworthiness of mr bennett and on march 7th he be at the mill he try to induce several of he friend in san francisco to go with he they all think he expedition a foolish one and he have to go alone he find that there be some talk about the gold and person would occasionally go about look for piece of it but no one be engage in mining and the work of the mill be go on as usual on the 8th he go out prospect with a pan and satisfied himself that the country in that vicinity be rich in gold he then make a rocker and commence the business of wash gold and thus begin the business of mining in californium other see how he do it follow he example find that the work be profitable and abandon all other occupation the news of they success spread people flock to the place learn how to use the rocker discover new digging and in the course of a few month the country have be overturn by a social and industrial revolution mr humphrey have not be at work more than three or four day before a frenchman call baptiste who have be a gold-miner in mexico for many year come to the mill and he agree with humphrey that californium be very rich in gold he too go to work and be a excellent prospector he be of great service in teach the newcomer the principle of prospecting and mining for gold -- principle not abstruse yet not likely to suggest themselves at first think to man entirely ignorant of the business baptiste have be employ by captain sutter to saw lumber with a whipsaw and have be at work for two year at a place since call weber about ten mile eastward from coloma when he see the digging at the latter place he at once say there be rich mine where he have be saw and he express surprise that it have never occur to he before so experienced in gold-mining as he be but he afterward say it have be so order by providence that the gold might not be discover until californium should be in the hand of the american about the middle of march pb read a american now a prominent and wealthy citizen of the state then the owner of a large ranch on the western bank of the sacramento river near where it issue from the mountain come to coloma and after look about at the digging say that if similarity in the appearance of the country could be take as a guide there must be gold in the hill near he ranch and he go off declare he intention to go back and make a examination of they john bidwell another american now a wealthy and influential citizen then reside on he ranch on the bank of feather river come to coloma about a week later and he say there must be gold near he ranch and he go off with expression similar to those use by read in a few week news come that reading have find digging near clear creek at the head of the sacramento valley and be at work there with he indian and not long after it be report that bidwell be at work with he indian on a rich bar of feather river since call bidwell 's bar although bennett have arrive at san francisco in February with some of the dust the editor of the town -- for two papers be publish in the place at the time -- do not hear of the discovery till some week later the first publish notice of the gold appear in the _ californian _ -lrb- publish in san francisco -rrb- on march 15th as follow : in the newly make raceway of the sawmill recently erect by captain sutter on the american fork gold have be find in considerable quantity one person bring thirty dollar ' worth to new helvetia gather there in a short time californium no doubt be rich in mineral wealth great chance here for scientific capitalist gold have be find in almost every part of the country three day later the _ californium star _ the rival paper give the follow account of the discovery : we be inform a few day since that a very valuable silver-mine be situate in the vicinity of this place and again that its locality be know mine of quicksilver be be find all over the country gold have be discover in the northern sacramento district about forty mile above sutter 's fort rich mine of copper be say to exist north of these bay although these article be write two month after the discovery it be evident that the editor have hear only vague rumor and attach little importance to they the _ star _ of march 25th say : so great be the quantity of gold take from the new mine recently find at new helvetium that it have become a article of traffic in that vicinity none of the gold have be see in san francisco but at sutter 's fort man have begin to buy and sell with it the next number of the _ star _ bearing date April 1 1848 contain a article several column long write by doctor vj fourgeaud on the resource of californium he devote about a column to the mineral and in the course of he remark say : it would be utterly impossible at present to make a correct estimate of the mineral wealth of californium popular attention have be but lately direct to it but the discovery that have already be make will warrant we in the assertion that californium be one of the richest mineral country in the world gold silver quicksilver iron copper lead sulphur saltpetre and other mine of great value have already be find we see a few day ago a beautiful specimen of gold from the mine newly discover on the american fork from all account the mine be immensely rich and already we learn the gold from it collect at random and without any trouble have become a article of trade at the upper settlement this precious metal abound in this country we have hear of several other newly discover mine of gold but as these report be not yet authenticate we shall pass over they however it be well know that there be a placer of gold a few mile from lo angele and another on the san joaquin it be not until more than three month after marshall 's discovery that the san francisco papers state that gold-mining have become a regular and profitable business in the new placer the _ californian _ of April 26th say : from a gentleman just from the gold region we learn that many new discovery of gold have very recently be make and it be fully ascertain that a large extent of country abound with that precious mineral seven man with pick and spade gather one thousand six hundred dollar worth in fifteen day many person be settle on the land with the view of hold preëmptions but as yet every person take the right to gather all he can without any regard to claim the largest piece yet find be worth six dollar the news spread man come from all the settle part of the territory and as they come they go to work mining and gradually they move farther and farther from coloma and before the rainy reason have commence -lrb- in December -rrb- miner be wash rich auriferous dirt all along the western slope of the sierra nevada from the feather to the tuolumne river a distance of one hundred fifty mile and also over a space of about fifteen mile square near the place now know as the town of shasta in the coast mountain at the head of the sacramento valley the whole country have be turn topsy-turvy town have be desert or leave only to the woman and child field have be leave unreaped herd of cattle go without anyone to care for they but gold-mining which have become the great interest of the country be not neglect the people learn rapidly and work hard in the latter part of 1848 adventurer begin to arrive from oregon the sandwich island and mexico the winter find the miner with very little preparation but most of they be accustom to a rough manner of life in the western wild and they consider they large profit a abundant compensation for they privation and hardship the weather be so mild in December and January that they could work almost as well as in the summer and the rain give they facility for wash such as they could not have in the dry season in September 1848 the first rumor of the gold discovery begin to reach new york in October they attract attention in November people look with interest for new report in December the news gain general credence and a great excitement arise preparation be make for a migration to californium by somebody in nearly every town in the united state the great body of the emigrant go either across the plain with ox or mule team or round cape horn in sailing-vessel a few take passage in the steamer by way of panama not fewer than one hundred thousand man represent in they nativity every state in the union go to california that year of these twenty thousand cross the continent by way of the south pass and nearly all of they start from the missourus river between independence and st joseph in the month of may they form a army in daytime they train fill up the road for mile and at night they camp-fire glitter in every direction about the place bless with grass and water the excitement continue from 1850 to 1853 emigrant continue to come by land and sea from europe and america and in the last name year from china also in 1854 the migration fall off and since that time until the completion of the union pacific railroad californium receive the chief accession to she white population by the panama steamer the whole world feel a beneficent influence from the great gold yield of the sacramento basin labor rise in value and industry be stimulate from st loui to constantinople the news however be not welcome to all class many of the capitalist fear that gold would soon be so abundant as to be worthless and european statesman fear the power to be gain by the arrogant and turbulent democracy of the new world the author of a book entitle _ note on the gold district _ publish in london in 1853 thus speak of the fear excite in europe on the first great influx of gold from the californian mine : among the many extraordinary incident connect with the californian discovery be the alarm communicate to many class and which be not confine to individual but invade government the first announcement spread alarm but as the cargo of gold rise from one hundred thousand dollar to one million dollar banker and financier begin seriously to prepare for a expect crisis in england and the united state the panic be confine to a few but on the continent of europe every government rich or poor think it needful to make provision against the threaten evil a immediate alteration in price be look for money be to become so abundant that all ordinary commodity be to rise but more especially the proportion between gold and silver be to be disturb some thinking that the latter might become the dearer metal the government of france holland and russium in particular turn they attention to the monetary question and in 1850 the government of holland avail themselves of a law which have not before be put in operation to take immediate step for sell off the gold in the bank of amsterdam at what they suppose to be the highest price and to stock themselves with silver palladium which be likewise a superior white metal be hold more firmly and expectation be entertain that it would become available for plate the stock however be small the silver operation be carry on concurrent with a supply of bullion to russia for a loan a demand for silver in austrium and for shipment to indium and it do really produce a effect on the silver market which many mistook for the influence of californian gold the particular way in which the netherland operation be carry on be especially calculate to produce the greatest disturbance of price the

rome by the breach in porta pium have cast the grand defense of 1849 into the background of rash attempt and futile failure in these brief page we give merely the outline of the drama in which garibaldus be one of the lead actor the man who desire a republic do not exist as a party in rome previous to the flight of the pope but there exist a strong national anti-austrian party who as they have worship pio nono -lrb- pius ix -rrb- when he bless italy and the banner that the roman bear upward to the holy war now execrate he inasmuch as he have withdraw he sanction to that war and have bless the croat and the austrian who be butcher the italian in the north convince of the impossibility of favor the independence and unity of italy and remain at the same time the supreme head of the universal church pio nono flee for protection to the king of naple there he decline to accept from the king of piedmont he repeat offer of protection or mediation and appeal to austria alone to restore he pope-king absolute in rome very soon afterward the archduke of tuscany revoke the constituent assembly which he have grant and follow the saintly example of the holy father so that tuscany and rome be alike leave sheep without a shepherd in the roman state a appeal be make to universal suffrage and the people send up deputy known chiefly for they honesty and bravery to decide on the

of venice and of rome austrium cross the po and occupied ferrara march thence on bologna the neapolitan troops from the south march upward to the roman frontier even spain send she contingent to fiumicino but only when it be know that the french republic have vote a expedition with the specious object of guarantee the independence of the supreme pontiff do the roman and they ruler realize that the existence of rome and she newborn liberty be seriously menaced garibaldus write from rietus in April a enthusiastic letter worth record here : brother mazzinus : i feel that i must write you one line with my own hand may providence sustain you in you brilliant but arduous career -lrb- mazzinus have just be elect with armellinus and saffus triumvir of rome -rrb- and may you be enable to

send a plan propose to march along the via emilium to collect arm and volunteer proclaim the levy in mass and with a division station in the bolognese territory operate in the duchy unite tuscan ligurian and piedmontese force and once more assail the austrian but the news of piedmont defeat genoa bombard and vanquish convinced he that it would be difficult to re-arouse the disheartened population of northern italy hence he next propose to cross the neapolitan frontier fling himself upon the royal troops and seize the abruzzus a sensible project this to take the offensive against the pope 's defender but before the triumvirate could come to a definite decision it be know that the french troops by a disgraceful stratagem have land and take possession of civita vecchium general oudinot entwine the french flag with the roman tricolor and assure the roman that they only come to secure perfect freedom for the people to effect a reconciliation with pius ix but the people have no desire for such reconciliation the assembly decree that rome should have no garrison but the national roman guard : that if the republic be invade by force the invader by force should be repel a commission of barricade establish the people flock to erect and remain to man they the national guard summon by mazzinus all answer present and serve enthusiastically throughout the siege all the troops disperse in the province be summon to the capital and garibaldus and he volunteer march into the city amid the acclamation of the populace too thankful to welcome they to demur at the strange appearance they present now that garibaldus 's military and naval genius be fully recognize and the extraordinary fascination he exercise over officer and man the enthusiasm with which he fill whole population whom other fail to stir be undisputed many historian and critic have express they astonishment that he be not make at once commander-in-chief of the roman force and have blame the triumvirate for have fail to recognize in the hero of montevideo the good genius of rome such critic must be simply ignorant of the actual condition of rome and she government there exist in the first place the regular roman army which would have serve under none save regular general then there be the lombard battalion under manara whose member after fifteen month of regular campaigning be thoroughly drill and discipline who insist on retain the cross of savoy on they belt and until they prowess make they the idol of the roman be nickname the corps of aristocrat little do they imagine when they keep aloof from the legion that before three month be over they young hero chief would resign he command of they to assume the delicate post of head of garibaldus 's staff carlo pisacane -- educate in the military college of the nunziatellum who have serve as captain in the foreign legion in algier destine later to become the pioneer of garibaldus and he thousand and to lose he life in the attempt -- while recognize garibaldus 's prowess and talent as a guerilla chief in he military history of 1849 severely criticise he tactic and blame he send up a handful of boy against mass of the enemy and censure unhesitatingly he indiscipline at velletrus one of the deputy of the roman constituent write to the triumvirate beg they to send garibaldus with he motley crew to a terrible spot call for del diavolo between civita vecchium and rome on no account to allow they to enter the city as they be quite too disorderly now they have commit no disorder save that of carry off the mule and horse of the convent but when we think of the wild free peril-scorning life lead in the backwoods of america of how they recognize no law save they commander 's order how little used he have be to receive command from any it will be easily understand how this wild tan quaintly dress band fill the inhabitant of the town through which they pass with terror and dismay garibaldus 's violent tirade against priest and priestcraft the liberation of a gang of miscreant arrest by order of the roman government have not prepossessed man of order and of discipline in he favor and although personal contact dispel all unfavorable prepossession one see how impossible it be for mazzinus to place he in the position which he would himself have assign to he garibaldus alter in nothing he south american mode of warfare he and he staff in red shirt and poncho with hat of every form and color no distinction of rank or military accoutrements ride on they american saddle which when unrolled serve each as a small tent when they troops halt and the soldier pile they arm the general and all he staff attend each to the want of he own horse then to secure provision for they man when these be not at hand the officer spring on they bareback horse lasso on wrist dash full speed along the campagna till oxen sheep pig kid or poultry in sufficient quantity be secure and pay for then divide they spoil among the company officer and man fall to kill quartering and roast before huge fire in the open air garibaldus when no battle be rage or danger near -- if in the city select some lofty belfry-tower if in the country climb the loftiest peak and with brief minute of repose under he saddle-tent literally live on horseback post he own picket make he own observation sometimes pass hour in perfect silence scanning the most distant and minute object through he telescope ever a man of the fewest word a look a gesture a brief sentence suffice to convey he order to he officer when he trumpet signal departure the lasso serve to catch the horse grazing in the field the man fall into order and march none know nor care whither save to follow they chief council of war he never hold he order and be implicitly obey to he original legion be add some of the finest and bravest of the lombard volunteer who have learn he worth after the armistice while boy from ten to fourteen who be he pride and delight form he band of hope to-day for a act of courage a man would be raise from the rank and sword in hand command he company but woe to he if he fail in shoulder a musket or brandish a bayonet at need to onlooker this legion compose at first of but one thousand man seem a wild unruly set but this be not the case drunkenness and insubordination be unknown among the rank woe to a soldier who wrong a civilian three be shoot for petty theft during the brief roman campaign still while garibaldus feel within himself he own superiority to those around mazzinus who also feel it might as well have propose a indian chief to command the roman army as this man whom in later year no soldier in europe but would have be proud to call _ dux _ again it must not be forget that the grounds on which france explain she interference be the imposition by foreigner of a republic on the roman people desirous only to receive the pope with open arm that austria piedmont and the ultramontane faction in england represent the roman state as hand over to the demagogue to the riffraff of european revolutionist hence the absolute necessity that present itself to the mind of the triumvir for fill the civil and military office as far as possible with citizen of rome or the roman state unfortunately no capable roman commander-in-chief exist rossellus be choose as the least incapable but throughout garibaldus be regard as the soul the genius of the defense a very short time have suffice for mazzinus and the roman to come to so perfect a understanding that no exercise of authority no police force be necessary to keep order in the city as the french english and american resident and as the respective consul repeatedly affirm in public and in private letter oudinot too have warning from he own consul from he own friend within the city of all the preparation of the resolute determination of the inhabitant of the known valor of many of the combatant in past campaign yet to all such remonstrance he answer with french impertinence _ les italiens ne se battent pas _ and clearly he have imbue he officer with this belief at dawn on April 30th start from castel di guido leave they knapsack at magnianellum the officer in white glove and sheathe sword advance on rome take the road to porta cavallaggierus send sharpshooter through the woodland on the right the chasseur de vincenne on the height to the left avezzana war minister from the top of the cupola of san pietro in montorus on see the first sentinel advance give the signal for the ringing of the tocsin which bring the entire populace to the wall the roman matron clustering there to encourage they husband son and brother to the fight when the army arrive within a hundred seventy yard from the wall the artilleryman from the bastion of san marto fire they first salute to which the chasseur de vincenne respond so well that the roman narduccus major pallinus and several of he man fall mortally wound at they gun find themselves under a cross-fire from the wall and from the vatican the enemy place a counter-battery which do deadly mischief to the besiege who lose at once six officer numerous soldier and have a cannon dismount to boot not the slightest confusion occur woman and boy carry off the wound fresh soldier take the place of the fall compelling oudinot to summon both he brigade and plant two other piece of cannon but he now have to cope with a enemy whom frenchman in montevideo envy and calumniate who to himself and he follower be as yet a unknown quantity garibaldus who have have but two day to organize he man and take up position have at once perceive the importance of the scatter building outside the gate and occupy they all -- villa wood and the wall surround they as the enemy fall back from the first assault he fling he man upon they as stone from a sling at the head of the first company be captain montaldus who in a short time be cripple with nineteen bullet yet still fight on he knee with he broken sword and only when the french retreat do he man carry he dead from the field as fight he company so fight all under the eye of garibaldus who direct the fight from villa pamphillus then summon he reserve himself head the student who have never see fire but who have give each to the other the consign if i attempt to run away shoot I through the head he lead they into the open field and there give they they first lesson to the cry of to the bayonet to the bayonet -- a lesson oft repeat since a cry never after raise in vain number of he best officer and soldier fall but never a halt or panic make a pause in that eventful charge until in full open fight the french be compel to retreat leave garibaldus absolute master of the field number of the french be kill and wound other hide themselves in the wood and vineyard round a general retreat ensue while a portion continue the fire to protect it the gun have to be carry off by hand as four horse have be kill and at this retreat up to castel di guido general oudinot be force to assist in person sum up he loss he find that he have leave four hundred dead upon the field five hundred thirty wound and two hundred sixty prisoner he have besides the glory of deprive the roman republic of two hundred fourteen kill and wound twenty-five officer among they and of carry off one prisoner ugo basso the chaplain who have remain behind to assist a die man he only weapon be the cross of which the french be the knightly protector garibaldus 's first thought be naturally to pursue the fugitive to castel di guido to palus and civita vecchium to drive they in he own forcible language back to they ship or into the sea for this he demand strong reënforcements of fresh troops but the government of rome -- believe that it suffice for republican france to know that republican rome do not desire the return of the pope that it be not govern by a faction -- be resolve unanimously to resist all invasion decide against pursuit send back the french prisoner to the french camp accord oudinot 's demand for a armistice and enter into negotiation with the french plenipotentiary ferdinand de lessep for the evacuation of the roman territory the refusal be never forget never forgive by garibaldus and have always be a burning question between the exclusive partisan of mazzinus and garibaldus in whose eye to scotch and not to kill the snake be the essence of unwisdom it be also maintain by many garibaldian that a out-and-out victory could not have be conceal from the french assembly as the president and he accomplice do manage to conceal the affair of April 30th and that have the people and the army in france know what a humiliation have be inflict on they comrade they would have insist on the recall of oudinot and that thus the president 's own position would have be endanger on the other hand mazzinus 's partisan say grant -- what remain unproven -- that garibaldus could have succeed in drive every frenchman back to he ship or into the sea there can be no doubt that loui napoleon bent on restore the pope and thus gain the clergy to he side would have send reënforcements upon reënforcements until rome should be vanquish the disputant must agree to differ on this point though all surely must allow that it be necessary that the small force at the disposal of the republic should be husband for the repulse of other besides france who claim to be defender of the pope -- austria the king of naple and even spain and in fact a neapolitan army with the king at they head have cross the roman frontier and have take up position at albano and frascatus whence garibaldus be send to oust they the lombard brigade be add to he legion this neapolitan king-hunt form one of the characteristic episode of the roman campaign garibaldus usually lodge he man in convent to the terror and horror of they inmate send they thence to reconnoitre the enemy 's position and harass they by deed of daredevil courage the king be indeed at albano whence from palestrina garibaldus march to the attack which would probably have be successful have he not be suddenly summon back to rome as the movement of the french be by no means reassure however a fresh truce be proclaimed general rossellus with garibaldus under he order be send out again in full force against the neapolitan not a wise arrangement this as the volunteer and the regular -- unless at different post within the city -- have not yet unite in harmonious action garibaldus send by rossellus merely to explore the enemy 's movement find that they be retreat from albano give battle to a strong column about two mile from velletrus without give time to rossellus to come up with the main body so the neapolitan get into velletrus barricade themselves there and escape during the night by the southern gate recross the neapolitan frontier the king foremost in the van rossellus and the regular complain loudly that this disobedience to order have prevent they from make the king of naple prisoner the garibaldian maintain on they side that this would have be effect have the regular think less about they ration and come to the rescue when first they hear the distant shot messenger send by the general to the triumvirate bear the complaint of each rossellus be recall and garibaldus leave with full liberty of action but when the french government disavow they envoy-extraordinary -- the patriotic able straightforward de lessep -- instruct oudinot to enter rome by fair means or by foul send enormous reënforcements promise to follow up with the entire french army if necessary what could they do but recall garibaldus with all possible despatch be it not a proof of they confidence in he moreover on garibaldus 's return to rome mazzinus make a last effort to induce he to unburden he mind at least to himself by ask he in write to tell he frankly what be he wish here be the laconic answer characteristic of the writer frank and unabashed as the round clear handwriting of the original from which we copy : rome June 2d 1849 mazzinus : since you ask I what i wish i will tell you here i can not avail anything for the good of the republic save in two way : as dictator with unlimited plenary power or as a simple soldier choose unchangingly yours giuseppe garibaldus again garibaldi disapprove the conduct of mazzinus and the triumvirate because they refuse to allow any act of violence against religion or the professor of religion they have abolish the inquisition and use the edifice to house the people drive from they home by the siege have invite and aid monk and nun to return to they home and to lead the life of citizen but they have not allow the confessional to be burn in the public market-place a wretch name zambianchus who ill-treat some inoffending priest be severely punish for thus dishonor the republic and humanity moreover the easter ceremony be celebrate as usual the triumvirate and the assembly stand among the people in the church and in the square to receive the blessing from the outer balcony of st peter 's all this give umbrage to garibaldus but no hypocrisy and much wisdom inspire these act in the first place the triumvirate and especially mazzini the most religious man we have ever know be well aware that while the temporal power of the papacy might be destroy by fire and sword the spiritual power of the roman catholic hierarchy could be extinguish only in the name of a moral law recognize and accept as be higher and more authoritative than any other intermediary between god and the people -- they know that idea can be vanquish only by idea again as the responsible head of the roman republic the triumvir be wisely careful not to offend the heart and conscience of catholic abroad finally the very fact that with four army at they gate life its feast and fast its workday and holiday could go on as usual be one highly calculate to strengthen the roman ' faith in and affection for the new government no crime be commit the people come to the triumvir as child to they father and -- for italian a very remarkable thing -- they not only pay down current tax but they pay up arrears from garibaldus 's brief account it would almost seem that the triumvirate and the assembly surrender rome before absolute necessity constrain they so to do he do not tell we how when the french have actually enter rome by the breach he alone of all the civil and military commander refuse to head the troops to attack the invader in possession he give he own reason very wise one it seem to we in write many year later but in he _ memoirs _ he seem to have forget they the terrible tiding that the seventh bastion and the curtain unite it to the sixth have fall into the hand of the french spread through the city the triumvirate have the tocsin ring all the house be open at that sound in the twinkling of a eye all the inhabitant be in the street general rossellus and the minister of war all the officer of the staff mazzinus himself come to the janiculum the people in arm mass around we write garibaldus in a short record of the siege of rome clamor to drive the french off the wall general rossellus and the minister of war consent i oppose the attempt i fear the confusion into which we troops would have be throw by those new combatant and they irregular movement the panic that would be likely by night to seize on troops unaccustomed to fire and which actually have assail we bravest one on the night of the 16th i insist on wait for the daylight he here narrate the daring but unsuccessful attempt of the lombard student who fling themselves on the assailant and who have gain the terrace of casa barberini and continue : but at daylight i have count the force with which we have to contend i realize that another June 3d would bereave I of half of the youth leave to I whom i love as my son i have not the least hope of dislodge the french from they position hence only a useless butchery could have ensue rome be doom but after a marvellous and a splendid defense the fall of rome after such a siege be the triumph of democracy in europe the idea of preserve four or five thousand devoted combatant who know I who would answer at any time to my call prevail i order the retreat promise that at five in the evening they should again advance but i resolve that no assault should be make from this and other writings of garibaldus it be clear that from the night of June 21st he consider any further attempt to prevent the french from enter rome as worse than useless -- that hence he refuse to lead the remnant of he army to butchery on the breach how then be it possible for mazzinus to have retard the catastrophe indefinitely and reserve to rome the glory of fall last _ ie _ after venice and hungary mazzinus beside himself with grief that the armed people have not be allow to rush on to the bastion and drive the french from the wall write a reproachful letter to manara then chief of garibaldus 's staff and this patriot here seem to have keep the peace as on the 25th we find a friendly letter from garibaldus to the triumvirate in which he propose to leave manara in rome and to conduct himself a considerable number of he man out of rome to take up position between the french and civita vecchium to harass they in the rear and on the same day evidently after a meeting and the acceptance by mazzinus of garibaldus 's project the latter write : June 26th 8 pm mazzinus : i propose therefore -lrb- _ dunque _ -rrb- to go out to-morrow evening send I to-morrow morning the chief who be to assume the command here order the general-in-chief to prepare one hundred fifty mount dragoon who with the fifty lancer will make up two hundred horse i shall take eight hundred of the legion and to-morrow shall send they to change they shirt -lrb- _ ie _ doff they ` red ' for ` gray ' -rrb- answer at once and keep the plan a profound secret the attempt be not make probably because it be impossible to march out secretly from any gate and manara write from villa spada 1 pm on the same day : citizen triumvir : i have receive you letter i be somewhat better and at my post i have speak with pisacane -lrb- chief of rossellus 's staff -rrb- we be perfectly agree both animated by the same spirit it be impossible for petty jealousy to come between we be assure of this i have beg general garibaldus to return to san pancrazio so as not to deprive that post at this moment of he legion and he efficacious power he promise I that before dawn all will be here everything be quiet manara this be manara 's last letter to mazzinus at that same villa spada the yearned-for bullet pierce he heroic heart manara die as the barbarian enter rome and here to all appearance be garibaldus 's last letter write in rome to mazzinus : we have retake we position outside san pancrazio let general rossellus send I order this be now no time for change yours g garibaldus no time for anything but one last desperate onslaught at the point of the bayonet garibaldus in the foremost rank with sword unsheathed while medicus from villa savorellus renew the wonder of the vascello twice the assailant be drive back to they second line thrice they return in overpowering number but gain the gate they be receive with volley of musketry from the barricade at the ingress to villa spada and savorellus there fall the flower of the lombard boy of the band of hope garibaldus 's giant negro faithful brave anghiar six hundred add to the three thousand four hundred corpse on which the soldier of _ la grande nation _ reconstruct the throne of the supreme pontiff and guard it with they bayonet until the sword of they self-chosen master fall from he tremble hand at sedan -lrb- 1849 -rrb- livingstone 's african discovery david livinstone and thoma hughe although africa the second largest grand division of the earth have figure in history from ancient time still it have be rightly name and until recently be call with good reason the dark continent but though it have be thus designate as the least known of the world 's grand division the progress of discovery and settlement be rapidly dispel the ignorance and mystery to which the designation be due the ancient seat of african civilization be confine to the northern part of the continent the phoenician be say to have circumnavigate africa as early as the seventh century before christ in the middle of the fifteenth century of the present era the portuguese explore much of the coastline and in 1497 vasco da gama double the cape of good hope but no modern exploration of the interior be know to have be make until the latter part of the eighteenth century since jame bruce the scottish traveller explore the nile valley in 1768 more than thirty other have distinguish themselves by they discovery on the african continent none of livingstone 's predecessor equal the achievement of this scottish missionary and explorer who combine with he zeal in the cause of religion and humanity a spirit of investigation and adventure that make he also the servant of science the advance-agent of discovery settlement and civilization these be at last bring the dark continent into the light of a new day that begin to dawn in the remotest corner of the earth david livingstone be bear near glasgow scotland march 19 1813 and he die in central africa April 30 1873 after he have be admit to the medical profession and have study theology he decide to join robert moffat the celebrated missionary in africa livingstone arrive at cape town in 1840 and soon move toward the interior he spend sixteen year in africa engage in medical and missionary labor and in make he famous and most useful exploration of the country he own account of the beginning of he work take from he _ missionary travels _ show the sincere and simple spirit of the man and he natural power of observation and description be see in he own story of he first important discovery that of lake ngamus the narrative of thoma hughe the well-known english author whose favorite subject be manly man and they characteristic deed follow the explorer on the first of he famous journey in the zambesus basin david livingstone i embark for africa in 1840 and after a voyage of three month reach cape town spending but a short time there i start for the interior by go round to algoa bay and soon proceed inland and spend the follow sixteen year of my life namely from 1840 to 1856 in medical and missionary labor there without cost to the inhabitant the general instruction i receive from the director of the london missionary society lead I as soon as i reach kuruman or lattakoo then they farthest inland station from the cape to turn my attention to the north without wait longer at kuruman than be necessary to recruit the ox which be pretty well tired by the long journey from algoa bay i proceed in company with another missionary to the bechuana or bakwain country and find sechele with he tribe located at shokuane we shortly afterward retrace we step to kuruman but as the object in view be by no means to be attain by a temporary excursion of this sort i determine to make a fresh start into the interior as soon as possible accordingly after rest three month at kuruman which be a kind of head station in the country i return to a spot about fifteen mile south of shokuane call lepelole -lrb- now litubaruba -rrb- here in order to obtain a accurate knowledge of the language i cut myself off from all european society for about six month and gain by this ordeal a insight into the habit way of think law and language of that section of the bechuana call bakwain which have prove of incalculable advantage in my intercourse with they ever since in this second journey to lepelole -- so call from a cavern of that name -- i begin preparation for a settlement by make a canal to irrigate garden from a stream then flow copiously but now quite dry when these preparation be well advanced i go northward to visit the bakaa and bamangwato and the makalaka living between 22 ° and 23 ° south latitude the bakaa mountain have be visit before by a trader who with he people all perish from fever in go round the northern part of these basaltic hill near letloche i be only ten day distant from the lower part of the zouga which pass by the same name as lake ngamus and i might then -lrb- in 1842 -rrb- have discover that lake have discovery alone be my object most of this journey beyond shokuane be perform on foot in consequence of the draught oxen have become sick some of my companion who have recently join we and do not know that i understand a little of they speech be overhear by I discuss my appearance and power : he be not strong he be quite slim and only appear stout because he put himself into those bag -lrb- trousers -rrb- he will soon knock up this cause my highland blood to rise and make I despise the fatigue of keep they all at the top of they speed for day together till i hear they express proper opinion of my pedestrian power return to kuruman in order to bring my luggage to we propose settlement i be follow by the news that the tribe of bakwain who have show themselves so friendly toward I have be drive from lepelole by the barolong so that my prospects for the time of form a settlement there be at a end one of those periodical outbreak of war which seem to have occur from time immemorial for the possession of cattle have burst forth in the land and have so change the relation of the tribe to each other that i be oblige to set out anew to look for a suitable locality for a mission-station in go north again a comet blaze on we sight exciting the wonder of every tribe we visit that of 1816 have be follow by a irruption of the matabele the most cruel enemy the bechuana ever know and this they think might portend something as bad or it might only foreshadow the death of some great chief on this subject of comet i know little more than they do themselves but i have that confidence in a kind overrule providence which make such a difference between christian and both the ancient and modern heathen as some of the bamangwato people have accompany I to kuruman i be oblige to restore they and they goods to they chief sekomus this make a journey to the residence of that chief again necessary and for the first time i perform a distance of some hundred mile on oxback return toward kuruman i select the beautiful valley of mabotsa -lrb- latitude 25 ° 14 ' south longitude 26 ° 30 ' -rrb- as the site of a missionary-station and thither i remove in 1843 here a occurrence take place concern which i have frequently be question in england and which but for the importunity of friend i mean to have keep in store to tell my child when in my dotage the bakatlum of the village mabotsa be much trouble by lion which leap into the cattle-pen by night and destroy they cow they even attack the herd in open day this be so unusual a occurrence that the people believe they be bewitch -- give as they say into the power of the lion by a neighbor tribe they go at once to attack the animal but be rather a cowardly people compare to bechuana in general on such occasion they return without kill any it be well know that if one of a troop of lion be kill the other take the hint and leave that part of the country so the next time the herd be attack i go with the people in order to encourage they to rid themselves of the annoyance by destroy one of the marauder we find the lion on a small hill about a quarter of a mile in length and cover with tree a circle of man be form round it and they gradually close up ascend pretty near to each other be down below on the plain with a native schoolmaster name mebalwe a most excellent man i see one of the lion sit on a piece of rock within the now close circle of man mebalwe fire at he before i could and the ball strike the rock on which the animal be sit he bit at the spot strike as a dog do at a stick or stone throw at he then leap away break through the opening circle and escape unhurt the man be afraid to attack he perhaps on account of they belief in witchcraft when the circle be re-formed we see two other lion in it but we be afraid to fire lest we should strike the man and they allow the beast to burst through also if the bakatlum have act accord to the custom of the country they would have spear the lion in they attempt to get out see we could not get they to kill one of the lion we bent we footstep toward the village in go round the end of the hill however i see one of the beast sit on a piece of rock as before but this time he have a little bush in front be about thirty yard off i take a good aim at he body through the bush and fire both barrel into it the man then call out he be shoot he be shoot other cry : he have be shoot by another man too let we go to he i do not see anyone else shoot at he but i see the lion 's tail erect in anger behind the bush and turn to the people say stop a little till i load again when in the act of ram down the bullet i hear a shout start and look half round i see the lion just in the act of spring upon I i be upon a little height he catch my shoulder as he spring and we both come to the ground below together growl horribly close to my ear he shake I as a terrier dog do a rat the shock produce a stupor similar to that which seem to be feel by a mouse after the first shake of the cat it cause a sort of dreaminess in which there be no sense of pain nor feeling of terror though quite conscious of all that be happen it be like what patient partially under the influence of chloroform describe who see all the operation but feel not the knife this singular condition be not the result of any mental process the shake annihilate fear and allow no sense of horror in look round at the beast this peculiar state be probably produce in all animal kill by the carnivora and if so be a merciful provision by we benevolent creator for lessen the pain of death turn round to relieve myself of the weight as he have one paw on the back of my head i see he eye direct to mabalwe who be try to shoot he at a distance of ten or fifteen yard he gun a flint one miss fire in both barrel the lion immediately leave I and attack mebalwe bit he thigh another man -- whose life i have save before after he have be toss by a buffalo -- attempt to spear the lion while he be bite mebalwe he leave mebalwe and catch this man by the shoulder but at that moment the bullet he have receive take effect and he fall down dead the whole be the work of a few moment and must have be he paroxysm of die rage in order to take out the charm from he the bakatlum on the follow day make a huge bonfire over the carcass which be declare to be that of the largest lion they have ever see besides crunch the bone into splinter he leave eleven tooth wound on the upper part of my arm it be a long time in healing the exact position of lake ngamus have for half a century at least be correctly point out by the native who have visit it when rain be more copious in the desert than in more recent time and many attempt have be make to reach it by pass through the desert in the direction indicate but it be find impossible even for griqua who have some bushman blood in they may be suppose more capable of endure thirst than european it be clear then that we only chance of success be by go round instead of through the desert on July 4 1849 we go forward on horseback toward what we suppose to be the lake and again and again do we seem to see it but at last we come to the veritable water of the zouga and find it to be a river run to the northeast a village of bakurutse lay on the opposite bank these live among batletlus a tribe have a click in they language and who be find by sebituane to possess large herd of the great horned cattle they seem ally to the hottentot family mr oswell in try to cross the river get he horse bog in the swampy bank two bakwain and i manage to get over by wade beside a fishing-weir the people be friendly and informed we that this water come out of the ngamus this news gladden all we heart for we now feel certain of reach we goal we might they say be a moon on the way but we have the river zouga at we foot and by follow it we should at last reach the broad water when we have go up the bank of this beautiful river about ninety-six mile from the point where we first strike it and understand that we be still a considerable distance from the ngamus we leave all the ox and wagon except mr oswell 's which be the smallest and one team at ngabisane in the hope that they would be recruit for the home journey while we make a push for the lake twelve day after we departure from the wagon at ngabisane we come to the northeast end of lake ngamus and on August 1 1849 we go down together to the broad part and for the first time this fine-looking sheet of water be behold by european the direction of the lake seem to be north-northeast and south-southwest by compass the southern portion be say to bend round to the west and to receive the teoughe from the north at its northwest extremity we could detect no horizon where we stand look south-south west nor could we form any idea of the extent of the lake except from the report of the inhabitant of the district and as they profess to go round it in three day allow twenty-five mile a day would make it seventy-five or less than seventy geographical mile in circumference other guess have be make since as to its circumference range between seventy and one hundred mile it be shallow for i subsequently see a native punt he canoe over seven or eight mile of the northeast end it can never therefore be of much value as a commercial highway in fact during the month precede the annual supply of water from the north the lake be so shallow that it be with difficulty cattle can approach the water through the boggy reedy bank these be low on all side but on the west there be a space devoid of tree show that the water have retire thence at no very ancient date this be another of the proof of desiccation meet with so abundantly throughout the whole country a number of dead tree lie on this space some of they imbed in the mud right in the water we be inform by the bayeiye who live on the lake that when the annual inundation begin not only tree of great size but antelope as the springbuck and _ tsessebe _ -lrb- _ acronotus luna _ -rrb- be sweep down by its rush water the tree be gradually drive by the wind to the opposite side and become imbed in mud when the lake be full the water be perfectly fresh but brackish when low and that come down the tamunak ` le we find to be so clear cold and soft the higher we ascend that the idea of melting snow be suggest to we mind we find this region with regard to that from which we have come to be clearly a hollow the lowest point be lake kumadau the point of the ebullition of water as show by one of newman 's barometric thermometer be only between 207-1\/2 ° and 206 ° give a elevation of not much more than two thousand foot above the level of the sea we have descend above two thousand foot in come to it from kolobeng it be the southern and lowest part of the great river system beyond in which large tract of country be inundate annually by tropical rain a little of that water which in the country farther north produce inundation come as far south as 20 ° 20 ' the latitude of the upper end of the lake and instead of flood the country fall into the lake as into a reservoir it begin to flow down the embarrah which divide into the river tzo and teoughe the tzo divide into the tamunak ` le and mababe the tamunak ` le discharges itself into the zouga and the teoughe into the lake the flow begin in either march or April and the descend water find the channel of all these river dry out except in certain pool in they bed which have long dry space between they the lake itself be very low the zouga be but a prolongation of the tamunak ` le and a arm of the lake reach up to the point where the one end and the other begin the last be narrow and shallow while the zouga be broad and deep the narrow arm of the lake which on the map look like a continuation of the zouga have never be observe to flow either way thoma hughe before the middle of 1852 livingstone be ready to start on the journey which result in the opening of route from central africa to the west and east coast but the way be still beset with difficulty the missionary society be regard as unpatriotic by the authority at the cape and he as the most outspoken of critic and the most uncompromising denouncer of the slave-trade and champion of the native come in for a double share of they suspicion on the other hand he brethren give he only a half-hearted support and doubt he orthodoxy he find great difficulty even in procure ammunition a country postmaster whom he have accuse of overcharge threaten a action at the last moment which he compromise rather than be detain as it be he have anticipate he meager salary by more than a year and have to be content with very inferior ox and a wagon which require constant mending throughout the journey on June 8 1852 he at last get away take with he a mr fleme the agent of he friend mr rutherford a cape merchant in the hope of by degree substitute legitimate traffic for that in slave the heavy cape wagon with its ten poor ox drag heavily onward livingstone have so loaded himself with parcel for station up-country and he wagon and team be so inferior that he do not reach kuruman until September here he be detain by the breaking of a wheel the journey to linyantus by the new route be very try part of the country be flood and they be wade all day and force they way through reed with sharp edge with hand all raw and bloody on emerge from the swamp say livingstone when walk before the wagon in the morning twilight i observe a lioness about fifty yard from I in the squat way they walk when go to spring she be follow by a very large lion but see the wagon she turn back it require all he tact to prevent guide and servant from desert everyone but himself be attack by fever i would like say he journal to devote a portion of my life to the discovery of a remedy for that terrible disease the african fever i would go into the part where it prevail most and try to discover if the native have a remedy for it i must make many inquiry of the river people in this quarter again in another key : be i on my way to die in sebituane 's country have i see the last of my wife and child leave this fair world and know so little of it February 4 1853 : i be spare in health while all the company have be attack by fever if god have accept my service my life be charm till my work be do when that be finish some simple thing will give I my quietus death be a glorious event to one go to jesus they progress be tedious beyond all precedent we dig out several well and each time have to wait a day or two till enough water flow in for we cattle to quench they thirst at last however at the end of may he reach the chobe river and be again among he favorite makololo he have drop from the cloud the first of they say they take the wagon to piece and carry it across on canoe lash together while they themselves swim and dive among the ox more like alligator than man sekeletu son of sebituane be now chief he elder sister mamochishane have resign in disgust at the number of husband she have to maintain as chieftainess poor mamochishane after a short reign of a few month she have rise in the assembly and address she brother with a womanly gush of tear ' i have be a chief only because my father wish it i would always have prefer to be marry and have a family like other woman you sekeletu must be chief and build up we father 's house ' on November 11 1853 he leave linyantus and arrive at loanda on may 31 1854 the first stage of the journey be to be by water and sekeletu accompany he to the chobe where he be to embark they cross five branch before reach the main stream a wide and deep river full of hippopotamus the chief lend I he own canoe and as it be broader than usual i could turn about in it with ease i have three musket for my people and a rifle and double-barrelled shotgun for myself my ammunition be distribute through the luggage that we might not be leave without a supply we chief hope for food be in we gun i carry twenty pound of bead worth forty shilling a few biscuit a few pound of tea and sugar and about twenty pound of coffee one small tin canister about fifteen inch square be fill with spare shirt trousers and shoe to be use when we reach civilized life another of the same size be store with medicine a third with book and a fourth with a magic lantern which we find of much service the sextant and other instrument be carry apart a bag contain the clothes we expect to wear out in the journey which with a small tent just sufficient to sleep in a sheepskin mantle as a blanket and a horse rug as a bed complete my equipment a array of baggage would have probably excite the cupidity of the tribe through whose country we wish to pass the voyage up the chobe and the zambesus after the junction of those river be prosperous but slow in consequence of stoppage opposite village my man pitsane know of the generous order of sekeletu and be not dispose to allow they remain a dead letter in the rapid the man leap into the water without the least hesitation to save the canoe from be dash against the obstruction or catch in eddy they must never be allow to come broadside to the stream for be flat-bottomed they would at once be capsize and everything in they lose when free from fever he be delighted to note the number of bird several of they unknown which swarm on the river and its bank all carefully note in he journal one extract must suffice here : whenever we step on shore a species of plover a plaguy sort of public-spirited individual follow fly overhead and be most persevere in its attempt to give warn to all animal to flee from the approach danger but he be already weak with fever be seize with giddiness whenever he look up quickly and if he could not catch hold of some support fall heavily -- a bad omen for he chance of pass through the unknown country ahead -- but he purpose never falter for a moment on January 1 1854 he be still on the river but get beyond sekeletu 's territory and ally to a region of dense forest in the open glade of which dwell the balonda a powerful tribe whose relation with the makololo be precarious each be incline to raid on the other since the mambarus and portuguese half-caste have appear with manchester goods these excite the intense wonder and cupidity of both nation they listen to the story of cotton-mill as fairy dream exclaim : how can iron spin weave and print truly ye be god and be already incline to steal they neighbor ' child -- those of they own tribe they never sell at this time -- to obtain these wonder out of the sea happily livingstone have bring back with he several balonda child who have be carry off by the makololo this and he speech to manenko the chieftainess of the district and niece of shinte the head chief of the balonda gain they a welcome this amazon be a strapping young woman of twenty who lead they party through the forest at a pace which try the best walker she seem to have be the only native whose will ever prevail against livingstone 's he intend to proceed up to she uncle shinte 's town in canoe : she insist that they should march by land and order she people to shoulder he baggage in spite of he my man succumb and leave I powerless i be move off in high dudgeon to the canoe when she kindly place she hand on my shoulder and with a motherly look say ` now my little man just do as the rest have do ' my feeling of annoyance of course vanish and i go out to try for some meat my man in admiration of she pedestrian power keep remark ` manenko be a soldier ' and we be all glad when she propose a halt for the night shinte receive they in he town the largest and best lay out that livingstone have see in central africa on a sort of throne cover with leopard-skin the _ kotlum _ or place of audience be one hundred yard square though in the sweating stage of a intermittent fever livingstone hold he own with the chief give he a ox as he mouth be bitter from want of flesh advise he to open a trade in cattle with the makololo and to put down the slave-trade and after spend more than a week with he leave amid the warmest profession of friendship shinte find he a guide of he tribe intemese by name who be to stay by they till they reach the sea and at a last interview hang round he neck a conical shell of such value that two of they so he man assure he would purchase a slave soon they be out of shinte 's territory and intemese become the plague of the party though unluckily they could not dispense with he altogether in cross the great flood plain of lebalum they camp at night on mound where they have to trench round each hut and use the earth to raise they sleep place my man turn out to work most willingly and i could not but contrast they conduct with that of intemese who be thoroughly imbue with the slave spirit and lie on all occasion to save himself trouble he lose the pontoon too thereby add greatly to they trouble they now come to the territory of another great chief katema who receive they hospitably send food and give they solemn audience in he kotlum surround by he tribe a tall man of forty dress in a snuff-brown coat with a broad band of tinsel down the arm and a helmet of bead and feather he carry a large fan with charm attach which he wave constantly during the audience often laugh heartily -- a good sign for a man who shake he side with mirth be seldom difficult to deal with i be the great moene katema be he address i and my father have always live here and there be my father 's house i never kill any of the trader they all come to I i be the great moene katema of whom you have hear on hearing livingstone 's object he give he three guide who would take he by a northern route along which no trader have pass to avoid the plain impassable from the flood he accept livingstone 's present of a shawl a razor some bead and button and a powder-horn graciously laugh at he apology for its smallness and ask he to bring a coat from loanda as the one he be wear be old from this point trouble multiply and they begin to be seriously press for food the big game have disappear and they be glad to catch mole and mouse every chief demand a present for allow they to pass and the people of the village charge exorbitantly for all supplies on they flounder however through flood forest in cross the river loka livingstone 's ox get away from he and he have to strike out for the farther bank my poor fellow be dreadfully alarmed and about twenty of they make a simultaneous rush into the water for my rescue and just as i reach the opposite bank one seize I by the arm and another clasp I round the body when i stand up it be most gratifying to see they all struggle toward I part of my goods be bring up from the bottom when i be safe great be they pleasure when they find i could swim like themselves and i feel most grateful to those poor heathen for the promptitude with which they dash in to my rescue farther on the people try to frighten they with the account of the deep river they have yet to cross but he man laugh ` we can all swim ' they say ` who carry the white man across the river but himself ' i feel proud of they praise on march 4th they reach the country of the chiboque a tribe in constant contact with the slave-dealer next day they camp be surround by the nearest chief and he warrior evidently bent on plunder they pause when they see livingstone seat on he camp-stool with he double-barrelled gun across he knee and he makololo ready with they javelin the chief and he principal man sit down in front at livingstone 's invitation to talk over the matter and a palaver begin as to the fine claim by the chiboque the more i yield the more unreasonable they become and at every fresh demand a shout be raise and a rush make round we with brandish weapon one young man even make a charge at my head from behind but i quickly bring round the muzzle of my gun to he mouth and he retreat my man behave with admirable coolness the chief and he counsellor by accept my invitation to be seat have place themselves in a trap for my man have quietly surround they and make they feel that there be no chance of escape they spear i then say that as everything have fail to satisfy they they evidently mean to fight and if so they must begin and bear the blame before god i then sit silent for some time it be certainly rather try but i be careful not to seem flurried and have four barrel ready for instant action look quietly at the savage scene around the palaver begin again and end in the exchange of a ox for a promise of food in which he be wofully cheat it be impossible to help laughing but i be truly thankful that we have so far gain we point as to be allow to pass without shed blood he now strike north to avoid the chiboque and make for the portuguese settlement of cassange through dense forest and constant wet here another fever fit come on so violent that i could scarcely after some hour ' trial get a lunar observation in which i could repose confidence those who know the difficulty of make observation and commit they all to paper will sympathize with I in this and many similar instance at this crisis when the goal be all but at hand obstacle multiply till it seem that after all it would never be reach first he ride ox sindbad -- a beast bless with a most intractable temper and a habit of bolt into the bush to get he rider comb off by a climber and then kick at he -- achieve a triumph in he weak state when the bridle break and down i come backward on the crown of my head receive as i fall a kick on the thigh this last attack of fever reduce I almost to a skeleton the blanket which i use as a saddle be pretty constantly wet cause extensive abrasion of the skin which be continually healing and get sore again then the guide miss they way and lead they back into chiboque territory where the demand of the chief of every village for a man a ox or a tusk for permission to pass begin again worst of all sign of mutiny begin to show themselves among the batoka man of he party who threaten to turn back he appease they by give they a tired ox to be kill at the Sunday 's halt have thus as i think silence they murmur i sink into a state of torpor and be oblivious of all they noise on Sunday the mutineer be make a terrible din in prepare the skin i request they twice to be more quiet as the noise pained I but as they pay no attention to this civil request i put out my head and repeat it be answer by a impudent laugh know that discipline would be at a end if this mutiny be not quell and that we life depend on vigorously uphold authority i seize a double-barrelled pistol and dart out with such a savage aspect as to put they to precipitate flight they give no further trouble every night now they have to build a stockade and by day to march in a compact body know the forest to be full of enemy dog they path for now they have nothing to give as present the man have even divest themselves of all they copper ornament to appease the chiboque harpy nothing however disturb we and for my part i be too ill to care much whether we be attack or not they struggle on the chiboque native now join by body of trader oppose at every ford livingstone no longer wonder why expedition from the interior fail to reach the coast some of my man propose to return home and the prospect of be oblige to turn back from the threshold of the portuguese settlement distressed I exceedingly after use all my power of persuasion i declare that if they now return i should go on alone and return into my little tent i lift up my heart to he who hear the sighing of the soul presently the head man come in ` do not be dishearten ' he say ` we will never leave you wherever you lead we will follow we remark be only make on account of the injustice of these people ' other follow and with the most artless simplicity of manner tell I to be comfort ` they be all my child they know no one but sekeletu and I and would die for I : they have speak in bitterness of spirit feeling they could do nothing ' on April 1st they gain the ridge which overlook the valley of the quango and the portuguese settlement on the farther bank the descent be so steep that i be oblige to dismount though so weak that i have to be support below we at a depth of one thousand foot lay the magnificent valley of the quango the view of the vale of clyde from the spot where mary witness the battle of langside resemble in miniature the glorious sight which be here present to we view on the 4th they be close to the quango here one hundred fifty yard broad when they be stop for the last time by a village chief and surround by he man the usual altercation ensue livingstone refuse to give up he blanket -- the last article he possess except he watch and instrument and sekeletu 's tusk which have be faithfully guard -- until on board the canoe in which they be to cross i be try to persuade my people to move on to the bank in spite of they when a young half-caste portuguese sergeant of militia cypriano di abren who have come across in search of beeswax make he appearance and give the same advice they march to the bank -- the chief 's man open fire on they but without do any damage -- make term with the ferryman with cypriano 's help cross the quango and be at the end of they trouble four day they stop with cypriano who treat they royally kill a ox and strip he garden to feast they and send they on to cassange with provision of meal ground by he mother and she maid i carry letter from the chevalier du prat of cape town but i be incline to believe that my friend cypriano be influence by feeling of genuine kindness excite by my wretched appearance at cassange they be again most hospitably treat and here before start for loanda three hundred mile they dispose of sekeletu 's tusk which sell for much higher price than those give by cape trader two musket three small barrel of powder and english calico and baize enough to clothe my whole party with large bunch of bead be give for one tusk to the great delight of my makololo who have be use to get only one gun for two tusk with another tusk we purchase calico -- the chief currency here -- to pay we way to the coast the remain two be sell for money to purchase a horse for sekeletu at loanda livingstone be much strike both by the country he pass through and the term on which the portuguese live with the native most of they have family by native woman who be treat as european child and provide for by they father half-caste clerk sit at table with the whites and he come to the conclusion that nowhere in africa be there so much good-will between european and native as here the dizziness produce by he twenty-seven attack of fever on the road make it all he could do to stick on sindbad who manage to give he a last duck in the lombe the weakening effect of the fever be most extraordinary for instance in attempt to take lunar observation i could not avoid confusion of time and distance neither could i hold the instrument steady nor perform a simple calculation he rally a little in cross a mountain range as they draw near loanda the heart of he man begin to fail and they hint they doubt to he if you suspect I you can return he tell they for i be as ignorant of loanda as you but nothing will happen to you but what happen to I we have stand by one another hitherto and will do so till the last the first view of the sea stagger the makololo we be march along with we father they say believe what the ancient have tell we that the world have no end but all at once the world say to we : ' i be finish there be no more for I ' the fever have produce chronic dysentery which be so depressing that livingstone enter loanda in deep melancholy doubt the reception he might get from the one english gentleman mr gabriel the commissioner for the suppression of the slave-trade he be soon undeceived mr gabriel receive he most kindly and see the condition he be in give up to he he own bed never shall i forget the luxurious pleasure i enjoy in feeling myself again

mark the beginning of a new era in the history of australium cook take possession of the country for great britain from the resemblance of its coast to the southern shore of wale he call it new south

so greatly accelerate at first a few pastoral group occupy the land near the coast many of the newcomer be mere squatter bent on make money and then return to england but gradually small town and settle industry grow up increase number of farmer immigrate squatter be push toward the interior and a state of social organization begin up to 1850 however this nucleus of a new commonwealth have reach no great development as in the case of californium long before the great discovery of gold in australium there have be rumor of its existence in that country most of the early story tell by person say to have find specimen of the metal be scout in 1844 the distinguished geologist sir roderick impey murchison have compare specimen of australian rock bring to he with other specimen from gold-bearing land declare that he find in the former no trace of gold two year later however sir roderick declare he belief in the existence of gold in australium and in 1848 he announce that he have see specimen of gold from new south wale and recommend a government mineral survey there little attention might have be give to the matter then but for the discovery of gold in californium from the excitement cause by that the gold fever spread over the world nothing be do in the way of discovery of the metal in australium until many month have elapse but finally result of the utmost importance be obtain the story of the great australian gold discovery be here tell in a authentic and highly interesting manner by the historian of the australasian colony in the year 1851 edmund hammond hargrave a old settler in new south wale return thither from californium where he have spend about eighteen month in the search for gold he effort in californium result in no immediate prosperity but he gain much useful practical experience more than this as he look at the natural feature of the californium gold-field a great idea grow up in he mind though not a geologist he appear to have have a quick eye for stratiform resemblance and the more he study the peculiarity of rock and soil in californium the more he become convinced that he know in he own colony a district which present the same feature and which therefore might be expect to produce the same result remain in californium only long enough to verify he observation he return to sydney at the beginning of the year 1851 seldom have such absolute confidence in unverified observation prove so completely justified accord to hargrave 's own account he go without hesitation to a spot on the bank of a little stream know as lewe pond creek a tributary of summer hill creek itself a tributary of the macquarie river and there at once on February 12 1851 find alluvial gold in April he have so far advance as to be able to write to the government offer to disclose he treasure for five hundred pound but he subsequently decide to trust to the liberality of the government and offer at once to show he workings to the government geologist a official recently send out from england to report upon gold prospects on may 19th mr stutchbury officially report the discovery of gold in workable quantity at summer hill creek and by the end of the same month the immigration to the digging have begin hargrave himself take no part in the digging merely point out to other without reserve the place in which he experience lead he to predict discovery and instruct they in the process of wash and clean he be soon make a commissioner of crown land and receive a reward of ten thousand pound now begin a period which can have no complete parallel in earlier history save the almost contemporaneous parallel of californium for in day when news travel slowly and travel for ordinary man be still slower in day when government jealously prohibit the expatriation of they subject and only allow the immigration of alien under strict limitation nothing like the australian gold-rush could have take place as it be everything favor the stampede the australian colony themselves be anxious for immigrant the european disturbance of 1848 have lead many continental ruler to the conclusion that it be wiser to allow turbulent spirit to go than to attempt to keep they the new era of industry have completely unsettled the old relationship and awaken a spirit of restlessness finally the recent application of steam to sea-going ship have render a rapid decrease in the length of the voyage from europe a practical certainty from the moment that the genuineness of hargrave 's discovery be place beyond doubt a swarm of pilgrim from all part of the world set they face toward the digging many perhaps the majority of the arrival be totally unsuited for the actual work of mine some of these turn to other pursuit in the neighborhood and in no small number of case do far better than the digger whose gold they receive but thousand turn back in despair after a few day ' experience of the hardship of the life so that almost from the first there be a enormous traffic to and fro and strong division of party upon the gold question a extreme view of the effect upon population may be obtain from a comparison of the statistics of victorium at the close of the year 1850 and 1855 respectively at the former date the population be under seventy thousand at the latter it be upward of three hundred thousand but no other colony increase to anything like this extent during the gold rush the first care of the government at sydney on receive the official report of the existence of gold be to decide upon the attitude to be assume toward the digger it be abundantly clear that the establishment of mining industry would mean a great increase of expense to the government it be equally clear that as the law have be declare over and over again in the colony unauthorized digging on crown land constitute a trespass for which the digger be legally responsible but the governor be wise enough to see that no threat of prosecution would deter man bent on digging in unoccupied land even if it be possible to preserve the land of private owner from forcible intrusion the squat question have demonstrate that beyond a certain point the theory of crown occupation of waste land be liable to break down so the government adviser suggest a compromise fall back on a still older feudal doctrine they assert the indefeasible right of the crown to all gold find either on private or public land but recommend that licens to dig should be grant on easy term which would have the double effect of provide a revenue and of preserve a acknowledgment of the crown 's title act on this advice governor fitzroy on may 22 1851 issue a proclamation forbid all person to dig for gold on any land without license but express the willingness of the government to grant licens at a fee of thirty shilling a month to digger on crown land for the present the governor refuse to allow digging on private land without the owner 's consent the proclamation also announce that no license would be give to any laborer or servant unless he could produce a certificate of discharge from he last service at the same time the governor establish the practice of appoint special commissioner for the gold-field charge with the administration of the licensing system and the general maintenance of order in they respective district he also strengthen the police force by every means in he power and then await development he have not long to wait almost immediately after the issue of the proclamation another gold-field be discover on the turon river also a feeder of the macquarie only a few mile from lewe pond and shortly afterward a third be open up on the abercrombie a tributary of the murrumbidgee which take its rise in the cordillera south of bathurst by the beginning of June gold begin to pour into bathurst but mr hardy the chief commissioner be able to report a almost idyllic peace and plenty at the digging in the middle of July a event occur which at once produce a violent attack of gold fever this be the discovery of a enormous mass of virgin gold weigh upward of one hundred pound by doctor kerr a squatter on the meroo creek doctor kerr have be guide to the spot by a aboriginal who have be in he service several year and in he excitement he break the matrix in which the nugget be imbed and thus spoil what would have be the most magnificent specimen of gold quartz hitherto discover even as it be the display in bathurst of a single find of gold worth four thousand pound be enough to excite the feeling of the inhabitant to a pitch inconsistent with steady industry but doctor kerr 's find raise a point of some interest to the government in frame the licensing regulation the adviser of the crown have think only of the possibility of alluvial mining have they even direct they thought toward rock gold they would probably have consider it highly improbable that any explorer should be able to extract the metal without a amount of preparation which he would hardly undertake upon the security of a bare license but as it happen doctor kerr have not even a license when he discover the gold though he take one out as soon as possible afterward to strengthen its position the government seize the gold in the hand of a firm of shipper who be about to send it to england but on the firm 's representation it be release security be give for the payment of a royalty of 10 per cent if the crown should see fit to demand it early in August 1851 the governor announce that for the future licens would be hold to cover only alluvial gold and that for rock gold find on crown land the government would demand a royalty of 10 per cent half that amount if the working be on private land a fortnight later the government undertake the escort of gold from the digging to sydney thereby add considerably to the crown revenue and at the same time obtain additional power over the gold district by the end of August gold to the value of seventy thousand pound have be export from the colony but these figure be soon eclipse by those which follow the news of the gold discovery near bathurst have soon spread through the australian colony the more adventurous of the colonist start at once for the digging other often encourage by they government who foresee a constant drain of population in favor of the gold colony endeavor to find gold within they own limit rumor of discovery be constantly arise gold be find at echuca in south australia in the fingal district of tasmanium and in the curumandel range of new zealand but none of these discovery could compare for a moment with those which take place within the newly constitute colony of victorium even so early as August 1851 gold have be work at a place call deep creek -lrb- or anderson 's creek -rrb- not far from melbourne but this be soon abandon in favor of the digging at clune on the headwater of the stream which flow north from the great divide range to the murray river a month later these again be temporarily desert in favor of the rich buninyong district just south of the range whose chief center be ballarat finally at the beginning of October 1851 the wonderful find at mount alexander a spur of the macedon range to the north of melbourne be eclipse all previous discovery before the end of the year the export of gold from victorium alone have very nearly reach half a million in value in two year the population of the victorian gold-field almost equal the whole population of the colony at the close of 1850 most of the digger live in tent and have absolutely no interest in the colony beyond the mere hope of profit from the digging if a more profitable field have open elsewhere they would have leave at once by the end of the year 1851 the probable area of future discovery be pretty well recognize the gold-field with few exception be find to lie on one side or the other of the eastern cordillera or chain of mountain which begin with mount elliot in northern queensland follow the coast with remarkable precision till it reach port phillip bay but all the more northerly part of this chain be unexplored in 1851 and of course there be room for almost any development within such wide limit warn by event in new south wale the government of the other australian colony have make preparation for the crisis western australium be too remote to be much affect and she newly arrive supply of convict labor render she contented but south australium and tasmanium suffer severely from the drain of population which set in toward the digging in south australia the effect be in some district almost as if a pestilence have sweep away the man leave the woman and child untouch some of the emigrant really desert they family but the bulk be honorable man and remittance of gold soon begin to find they way to adelaide for distribution among relative in the colony after the comparative failure of the gold-digging in south australia the government have wisely set itself to secure some part of the prosperity of the gold discovery for its colony by establish both land and river traffic route in these effort it be highly successful many south australian make handsome fortune by send provision to the buninyong and mount alexander district and the new steamer on the murray prove a source of profit to the colony which last until the development of the railroad system unfortunately this prosperity could hardly be realize at the time owe to the great scarcity of coin money in the colony in 1851 the privilege of coin be still jealously monopolize by the mint in london while the rapid expansion of business in the latter part of that year have render the supply of coin in australium totally inadequate to the demand very soon after the discovery governor fitzroy have send home a memorial from the legislative council at sydney pray for the establishment of a branch mint in that city and similar application soon follow from the other colony on march 22 1853 a treasury minute sanction the application and colonial mint be shortly afterward establish by order in council but in the mean while the south australian have get over they difficulty by pass a colonial act authorize the issue by the colonial government of gold ingot of slightly higher intrinsic value than the coin they be suppose to represent stamped with a authentic mark these ingot be not make legal tender and the only object of the government mark be to guarantee quality and weight but they be generally accept in official and commercial transaction they tide over the crisis of scarcity and the home government though with due official caution approve the action of governor young in tasmanium the main difficulty arise from the drain of emigrant in August 1851 sir william denison write home urge the transportation of more convict or probationer on the ground that there would be a great demand for foodstuff by the neighbor colony while the supply of agricultural laborer would be shorter than ever both tasmanium and south australia unite in decide upon the continuance of the system by which free emigrant be send out at the expense of the land fund of each colony notwithstanding that such emigrant would probably leave for victorium immediately after they arrival of the existence of this contingency there could be little doubt on January 16 1852 the governor of tasmanium write : i have a number of man who have come back from mount alexander after a absence from this colony of not more than eight week with gold to the value of one hundred twenty pound to one thousand pound during the five month which follow the writing of this letter four thousand person -lrb- most of they wage-earner in the prime of life -rrb- leave tasmanium for victorium as the whole population of tasmanium be at this time only about fifty thousand the matter be serious nevertheless tasmania tide safely over the difficulty of the gold period and even be able to help she sorely try sister for it be upon the newly establish government at melbourne that the strain of the new era most severely fall the government at sydney be a old and try institution with tradition of more than half a century and a staff of experienced official under a exceptionally able chief when hargrave make he discovery in 1851 the population of the mother-colony be nearly a quarter of a million exclusive of the port phillip district and such a population mean a government organization of corresponding magnitude moreover the people of new south wale have always from circumstance be accustom to much governmental control and do not resent it while victorium have be start as a colony whose people be too prosperous and contented to require more than a minimum of guidance when the gold discovery suddenly draw into the colony not merely the most turbulent character of australium but the crew of desert ship and the general offscouring of the civilized world and when overcome by the contagion the government official throw up they post one and all and start for the digging it become evident that the lieutenant-governor have he hand full even so early as November 1851 he begin to anticipate trouble from the preemptive clause of the crown land lease act of 1847 by which the squatter have a right to purchase land in the neighborhood of the gold-field the claim of the squatter bar the way and the squatter themselves look with small favor upon a class of man whom they regard as troublesome intruder and whose proceedings render it almost impossible for the pastoralist to procure sufficient labor to carry on they operation the squatter choose to overlook two important fact viz that they have themselves originally acquire they position precisely as the digger acquire he and that the presence of the digger if it raise the price of labor also enormously increase the price of the squatter 's produce but more immediate financial trouble begin to press upon the government it have be necessary not merely to add largely to the number of the official staff -- to provide additional police commissioner magistrate custom officer etc -- but also to increase they pay in some proportion to the greatly increase cost of live even with a increase in they salary of 50 or 100 per cent the subordinate official would not stay the sight of the reckless and prosperous digger who come down to melbourne to spend the christmas of 1851 and who fling they gold about recklessly be too much for the feeling of the civilian they desert in troops on January 12 1852 lieutenant-governor latrobe write : the police in town and country have almost entirely abandon duty and he beg of the secretary of state to send military aid in may 1852 sir john pakington reply promising six company of the fifty-ninth regiment from china but subsequently decide to send a whole regiment direct from england a man-of-war be also to be station in australian water a still more welcome assistance come in the early part of the year from the governor of tasmanium who send at latrobe 's earnest request a body of two hundred pensioner who have be serve as convict guard and who might be expect to resist those temptation which if yield to would result in the loss of they pension but all this assistance mean money and the government soon fall into sore strait it be true that at first the revenue rise substantially compare the income for the quarter end December 31 1850 and December 31 1851 respectively we find on general account a increase of eleven thousand pound or about 30 per cent and on the territorial account or land fund a increase of seventy-three thousand pound about 100 per cent three month later the increase be about 200 per cent on the general revenue while the territorial revenue be about the same but the latter fact may be account for by the transferrence of the fee for gold licens to the general revenue it be more important however to notice that though the revenue be rise expense be increase still faster not only have the staff to be double or treble at a very large increase of pay but government contract for public building print store fitting and other necessaries could be place if at all only at extravagantly high price no tender can be obtain for supplies of boot and shoe order have be send to neighbor colony for they old furniture sell at about 75 per cent advance on the former price of new scarcely any mechanic will work latrobe estimate the deficit in the revenue of the year 1853 as nearly four hundred thousand pound notwithstanding that he reckon the whole gold revenue of six hundred thousand pound as available for general expense in he anxiety the lieutenant-governor have at first -lrb- December 1851 -rrb- propose to double the license fee of thirty shilling a month but the proposal have provoke such a storm of opposition that he withdraw it the revenue from licens be the source of much contention the government allege that it be not taxation but rent of crown land and at first devoted it exclusively to the service of the gold-field the digger denounce it as taxation without representation and the legislative council almost necessarily in opposition to the government while the latter be administer by nominee of the colonial office refuse to make up deficiency out of the general revenue thus the lieutenant-governor be place between two fire if he enforce the license fee he anger what be rapidly become the largest part of the population if he relinquish they he leave himself without means to carry on the government of the gold-field from this dilemma he be save by the receipt of a general permission from the colonial office toward the close of 1852 to deal with the gold revenue in the same manner as ordinary revenue by place this fund at the disposal of the colonial legislature the home government not only remove a great grievance and relieve the hand of the lieutenant-governor from the shackle previously lay upon they by the colonial office but it take a substantial step toward the end that be now acknowledge on all side to be the ultimate outcome of the new discovery viz the introduction of responsible government the same despatch contain a still more important concession authorize the lieutenant-governor to devote the remain part of the land revenue -- viz that arise from sale and pastoral licens -- to the purpose render urgent by the present crisis as this fund be jealously reserve by the exist constitution of the australian colony and devote under the provision of the crown land sale act exclusively to the purpose of emigration and public work it will be see that the colonial office take a strong step in sanction its diversion but it must be observe that the expenditure of this additional fund be place exclusively in the hand of the lieutenant-governor and he executive council act independently of the colonial legislature with this assistance the lieutenant-governor struggle on amid increase difficulty till the spring of the year 1853 by this time the agitation against the license fee have reach a alarming height for the first success of the new discovery have pass away and although the export of gold continue to increase it be by no means at its former rate nor in proportion to the increase of population at the beginning of September 1853 there be say to be nearly seventy thousand person live at the victorian gold-field and many of these in all probability earn very little more than mechanic employ in settle work hence there be a fair ground for a orderly agitation against the amount of the fee but unfortunately the digger prefer violent measure there be some excuse for they they be not represent in the legislative council for they have spring into existence as a body since the passing of the act of 1850 and though a measure have be introduce with a view to give they the franchise it have not yet receive the assent of the home government in the mean time therefore they could not through they representative in the council effectively criticise either the exist law or its administration with regard to the latter there be obviously room for complaint for the immense increase of business have compel the government to appoint a inferior class of official and some of these at least succumb to the strong temptation of they position at the beginning of August 1853 a petition have be present by the bendigo digger in which they urge the reduction of the license fee and the grant of representation to the digger the lieutenant-governor return a pacific reply but the delegate in charge of the petition be evidently bent on arouse strong feeling and they hold meeting in melbourne which go the extreme length permissible to loyal subject still the lieutenant-governor shrink from strong measure and endeavor to remove one ground of complaint by appoint as a nominee member of the legislative council a gentleman who be believe to possess the confidence of the digger the nomination be at once repudiate by the delegate of the latter and at the end of August a organize attempt be make to resist the renewal of licens on the old term hundred of digger pledge themselves to pay no more than a third of the sum previously demand and those who be incline to yield to the government 's demand be warn that the agitator would not be responsible for they safety if they remain at the digging the license system have by this time extend beyond the digger to the storekeeper and other tradesman at the gold-field who be make enormous profit out of the digger and these for the most part unhesitatingly comply with the demand of the agitator willing rather to pay the fine for breach of the government regulation than to offend they customer a daring attack on a private escort of gold near bendigo which occur about this time show that the colony be on the verge of civil war just at this moment a event occur which render it impossible for the government to maintain its position unimpaired with the scanty force at its disposal in the middle of September 1853 the total abolition of the license fee be seriously propose in the legislative council of new south wale the news fly like wildfire to victorium where the digger have hitherto look upon the colonial legislature -- in which it will be remember they be not yet represent -- as they natural enemy it seem to they now that they have everything in they own hand and it become clearly impossible for the government in the exist temper of the digger to exact the full amount of the license fee a proclamation hastily publish with a view to allay excitement by a unfortunate omission in the print copy lead the public to believe that the total abolition of the license system be contemplate by the victorian government a select committee of the legislative council report unfavorably upon the system the government make the best of a bad bargain and accept a fee of forty shilling for the three month end November 30 1853 and on the follow day the legislative council pass a new gold-field act which greatly reduce the fee for digger ' licens while it substantially increase those demand for permission to open store at the gold-field it also provide for the grant of lease of auriferous land at a royalty of not less than 5 per cent and give legal sanction to the custom regard the claim of digger which have gradually grow up to regulate the rival interest of neighbor miner offence against the act be to be decide upon by the magistrate but the accuse might demand a court of at least two member and there be to be a appeal to general session these measure be partly successful in restore order but it be obvious that the gold-field contain man who be averse to a peaceable settlement notwithstanding that the number of the elective member of the legislative council be more than once increase that with the full consent of the home government a bill be be prepare for the introduction of responsible government and that the material condition of the digger be be rapidly improve the lieutenant-governor have in January 1854 to report the formation of a digger ' congress which obviously have for its object the supersession of the ordinary government latrobe retire from office in may of the same year and one of the first point notice by he successor sir charle hotham be the existence of a agitation against the chinese at the bendigo digging notwithstanding the enthusiastic character of he reception in he progress through the gold-field in September the new governor soon have to face serious disturbance the event of the next few month form a crisis in the history not only of victorium but of australium naturally there be much dispute concern they and as the follow account be take chiefly from sir charles hotham 's report it be possible that the act of he opponent may not obtain strict justice but it be admit on all side that sir charle act with the most perfect good faith and the account give by the insurgent be far too contradictory and prejudiced to receive much credit on the night of October 16 1854 a miner name scobie be murder or at least kill at the eureka hotel near ballarat the eureka hotel be a place of no good repute keep by a man name bentley who as well as he wife be -lrb- it be say -rrb- a ex-convict from tasmanium suspicion fall upon the couple and they with a second man -lrb- name farrell -rrb- be arrest by the magistrate but almost immediately release for alleged default of evidence the dismissal of the charge excite a storm of indignation in the camp and a body of digger at once proceed to wreck the hotel and lynch the accuse in the latter object they fortunately do not succeed and so render themselves liable only to charge of riot and arson instead of the more serious charge of murder four of the ringleader be through the prompt measure of sir charle hotham shortly afterward arrest and commit for trial but the accusation of partiality against the official be too strong to be resist and a board of inquiry hastily institute by the governor disclose the ugly fact that dewe the magistrate who preside at the hearing of the charge against the bentley have be in the habit of borrow money from resident and that sergeant-major milne of the police force have be guilty of receive bribe the official implicate be at once dismiss and the bentley and farrell rearrest and convict but the governor very properly decline to release the arrest rioter who shortly before christmas 1854 be convict and sentence to short term of imprisonment meanwhile more disturbance have occur though a commission upon the general condition of the gold-field be hold its inquiry in November many digger again refuse to pay the reduce license fee and on the 30th of the month a serious riot take place the military be call out the riot act be read and there be some shooting eight capture be make but the lesson have not be severe enough and a state of open war ensue the digger intrench themselves in a fortified camp know as the eureka stockade openly drill they force in the presence of the authority and levy horse and ration from unwilling miner in the name of a commander-in-chief at the same time they issue a long political manifesto which while it do not avowedly disclaim allegiance to the crown contain proposal to which no regularly constitute government could ever have assent the governor at once order all the available military force to ballarat but before reinforcement arrive the coolness and promptitude of captain thoma -- the officer in command of the troops on the ballarat gold-field when the riot of November 30th take place -- have nip the insurrection in the bud captain thoma saw that while the eureka stockade threaten to become a serious obstacle to the government if its completion be allow in its uncompleted state it be really a source of weakness to the insurgent by collect they force in one spot and thus render they more expose to a crush attack and by draw off the man who threaten the government camp it really leave the commander of the troops free to act with decision accordingly captain thoma at once determine to attack the position assemble he force -lrb- somewhat fewer than two hundred man -rrb- at three o'clock on the morning of December 3d he move toward the stockade at about one hundred fifty yard from the intrenchment he be perceive by the scout of the insurgent who promptly fire on the advance troops thoma himself pasley -lrb- he aide-de-camp -rrb- rede -lrb- the resident commissioner -rrb- and racket -lrb- the stipendiary magistrate -rrb- all of whom be present at the attack positively assert that the insurgent fire before a shot be discharge by the troops upon this reception captain thoma give the order to fire and the intrenchment be carry with a rush after about ten minute of sharp fighting captain wise be fatally wound and three private be kill outright one officer and eleven private be wound of the insurgent about thirty be know to have be kill and many more wound nearly one hundred twenty prisoner be take the effect of the victory be so far as local disturbance be concerned instantaneous even before the reinforcement under general nickle appear all resistance to the authority have die away and though the governor at once proclaim a state of martial law he be able to recall the proclamation in less than a week in other district of the colony the effect be for a while doubtful the extreme reluctance of englishman to admit the necessity for military interference by the government tell strongly in favor of the rioter there be some danger that melbourne and geelong leave almost entirely unprotected by the concentration of troops and police at ballarat would be take possession of by rioter from the country district and sir charle hotham make hasty application to sir william denison the governor of tasmanium for military assistance very soon however the feeling of orderly citizen assert themselves special constable be swear in at melbourne and geelong marine from two men-of-war station at port phillip guard the prison and the powder store wealthy man volunteer to serve as mount police and the arrival of the ninety-ninth regiment from tasmanium on December 10th deal a final blow to the hope of the insurgent even before this event all the respectable class in the community have rally round the governor and he feel himself in a position to defy further outbreak but the ugliest feature of the whole affair be yet to be reveal out of the large number of prisoner take at the capture of the stockade only thirteen be commit for trial the magistrate be instruct to commit only when the evidence be of the clearest nature it be consider impossible to obtain a impartial trial by a local jury the prisoner be bring down to melbourne and after various delay the charge be proceed with on February 20 1855 a boston negro name john joseph and a reporter for the ballarat _ time _ name manning be first try the latter may have be merely lead away by professional ardor in the pursuit of copy though the fact that he have be openly drill and instruct in the use of a pike by the insurgent would seem to show that he zeal be somewhat excessive in the case of joseph the evidence be overwhelming he have actually be see to fire upon the troops and he be capture in a tent which have be use as a guard-room by the insurgent no counter-evidence be offer the prisoner ' counsel rely entirely on the alleged absence of treasonable intention nevertheless both prisoner be speedily acquit and although the government wisely withdraw the remain case for the time subsequent trial produce similar result ultimately however the difficulty of the situation be allay by the reform introduce on the recommendation of the commission appoint to consider the whole subject of the gold-field this body present on march 27 1855 a extremely able report in which it recommend the abolition of the license fee and the substitution therefor of a miner ' right or crown permission last for a year and grant for a nominal fee of one pound to occupy for mining purpose a specific piece of crown land the deficiency in revenue anticipate from the abolition of license fee be to be meet by the imposition of a export duty upon gold at the rate of a half-crown a ounce the commission strongly recommend the grant of the political franchise to holder of miner ' rights and the provision of liberal facility for the acquisition of land by the miner it also advocate the simplification of the exist complex system of government in the mining district whereby commissioner police authority commissariat official and magistrate all work independently of each other and suggest the substitution therefor of experienced warden at the head of elective board who should not only dispose with the aid of skilled assessor of dispute specially connect with mining operation but who should have power to issue by-law adapt to the special requirement of each district these recommendation be for the most part carry out by legislation of the same year -lrb- 1855 -rrb- and before he lament death in December 1855 sir charle hotham have the happiness be able to report to the home government the almost perfect tranquillity of the gold-field moreover the revenue have not suffer by the substitution of the export duty for the license fee but the collector of custom be of opinion that the result of the change have be to throw the entire burden of the tax upon the importer of the colony instead of upon the mining population the government be not however dispose to concern itself with consideration of abstract justice so long as it could collect a sufficient revenue without serious opposition -lrb- 1854 -rrb- the rise of the republican party abraham lincoln the election of 1852 virtually destroy the whig party and franklin pierce the candidate of the democratic party be elect by great majority if the whig party have perish because it have no distinct position upon the one overshadow question of the day so neither do the new president comprehend the nature and condition of that issue in he first message he complacently congratulate the country that the slavery question have be settle peacefully and forever by the compromise measure of 1850 he little know how ineffective be those compromise he never dream that it be a question that no compromise could settle permanently and probably have no conception of the new force that be to be give to it during he own term of office stephen a dougla a acknowledged aspirant to the presidency be chairman of the senate committee on territory introduce and carry through congress a measure call the kansas-nebraska bill which in provide for the admission of those territory as state embody he doctrine of popular sovereignty in that it permit the inhabitant to determine by popular vote whether they should come into the union as free state or as slave state and abolish the missourus compromise which for thirty-four year have forbid the acquisition of any slave territory north of the parallel of 36 ° 30 ' the abrogation of this compromise which have be look upon as a sacred compact convince a majority of the northern people that the system of slavery be fill with the spirit of aggressiveness and determine to spread itself into all the territory consequently there arise for the first time a powerful anti-slavery party which while deny that it have any purpose of meddle with that institution in the state where it already exist declare that it should never be extend into any more of the national domain at the same time this be a stronger party in favor of the protective tariff than have ever before exist this organization which give itself the name republican party come into existence in 1854 the same year in which senator dougla 's bill abrogate the missourus compromise there be several claimant for the honor of first propose it but as a fact it spring into existence with virtual simultaneousness in several of the northern state if there be a priority it be in massachusett where robert carter act as secretary of the convention and write the resolution two year later this party enter the presidential contest with john c frémont as its candidate it cast a enormous vote but be not successful mainly for the reason that the short-lived american -lrb- or know-nothing -rrb- party be then at its best and have its own ticket head by millard fillmore four year later still it nominate and elect abraham lincoln as president and the clearest argument for its existence that ever have be put forth be in lincoln 's first speech in he famous debate with senator dougla which be deliver in springfield illinoi June 17 1858 the full text of that speech follow herewith if we could first know where we be and whither we be tend we could better judge what to do and how to do it we be now far into the fifth year since a policy be initiate with the avowed object and confident promise of put a end to slavery agitation under the operation of that policy that agitation have not only not cease but have constantly augmented in my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have be reach and pass a house divide against itself can not stand i believe this government can not endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolve i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divide it will become all one thing or all the other either the opponent of slavery will arrest the further spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it be in the course of ultimate extinction or its advocate will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the state old as well as new north as well as south have we no tendency to the latter condition let anyone who doubt carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination -- piece of machinery so to speak -- compound of the nebraska doctrine and the dred scott decision let he consider not only what work the machinery be adapt to do and how well adapt but also let he study the history of its construction and trace if he can or rather fail if he can to trace the evidence of design and concert of action among its chief architect from the begin the new year of 1854 find slavery exclude from more than half the state by state constitution and from most of the national territory by congressional prohibition four day later commence the struggle which end in repeal that congressional prohibition this open all the national territory to slavery and be the first point gain but so far congress only have act and a indorsement by the people real or apparent be indispensable to save the point already gain and give chance for more this necessity have not be overlook but have be provide for as well as might be in the notable argument of squatter sovereignty otherwise call sacred right of self-government which latter phrase though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government be so pervert in this attempt use of it as to amount to just this : that if any _ one _ man choose to enslave _ another _ no _ third _ man shall be allow to object that argument be incorporate into the nebraska bill itself in the language which follow : it be the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate they domestic institution in they own way subject only to the constitution of the united state then open the roar of loose declamation in favor of squatter sovereignty and sacred right of self-government but say opposition member let we amend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the territory may exclude slavery not we say the friend of the measure and down they vote the amendment while the nebraska bill be pass through congress a _ law case _ involve the question of a negro 's freedom by reason of he owner have voluntarily take he first into a free state and then into a territory cover by the congressional prohibition and hold he as a slave for a long time in each be pass through the united state circuit court for the district of missourus and both nebraska bill and lawsuit be bring to a decision in the same month of may 1854 the negro 's name be dred scott which name now designate the decision finally make in the case before the then next presidential election the law case come to and be argue in the supreme court of the united state but the decision of it be defer until after the election still before the election senator trumbull on the floor of the senate request the lead advocate of the nebraska bill to state _ he opinion _ whether the people of a territory can constitutionally exclude slavery from they limit and the latter answer that be a question for the supreme court the election come buchanan be elect and the indorsement such as it be secure that be the second point gain the indorsement however fall short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred thousand vote and so perhaps be not overwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory the outgoing president in he last annual message as impressively as possible echo back upon the people the weight and authority of the indorsement the supreme court meet again do not announce they decision but order a reargument the presidential inauguration come and still no decision of the court but the incoming president in he inaugural address fervently exhort the people to abide by the forthcoming decision whatever it might be then in a few day come the decision the reputed author of the nebraska bill find a early occasion to make a speech at this capital indorse the dred scott decision and vehemently denounce all opposition to it the new president too seize the early occasion of the silliman letter to indorse and strongly construe that decision and to express he astonishment that any different view have ever be entertain at length a squabble spring up between the president and the author of the nebraska bill on the mere question of _ fact _ whether the lecompton constitution be or be not in any just sense make by the people of kansa and in that quarrel the latter declare that all he want be a fair vote for the people and that he care not whether slavery be vote _ down _ or vote _ up _ i do not understand he declaration that he care not whether slavery be vote down or vote up to be intend by he other than as a apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the public mind -- the principle for which he declare he have suffer so much and be ready to suffer to the end and well may he cling to that principle if he have any parental feeling well may he cling to it that principle be the only shred left of he original nebraska doctrine under the dred scott decision squatter sovereignty squat out of existence tumble down like temporary scaffolding like the mould at the foundry serve through one blast and fall back into loose sand help to carry a election and then be kick to the wind he late joint struggle with the republican against the lecompton constitution involve nothing of the original nebraska doctrine that struggle be make on a point -- the right of a people to make they own constitution -- upon which he and the republican have never differ the several point of the dred scott decision in connection with senator dougla 's care not policy constitute the piece of machinery in its present state of advancement this be the third point gain the point of that machinery be : firstly that no negro slave import as such from africa and no descendant of such slave can ever be a citizen of any state in the sense of that term as use in the constitution of the united state this point be make in order to deprive the negro in every possible event of the benefit of that provision of the united state constitution which declare that the citizen of each state shall be entitle to all privilege and immunity of citizen in the several state secondly that subject to the constitution of the united state neither congress nor a territorial legislature can exclude slavery from any united state territory this point be make in order that individual man may fill up the territory with slave without danger of lose they as property and thus to enhance the chance of permanency to the institution through all the future thirdly that whether the hold a negro in actual slavery in a free state make he free as against the holder the united state court will not decide but will leave to be decide by the court of any slave state the negro may be force into by the master this point be make not to be press immediately but if acquiesce in for a while and apparently indorse by the people at a election then to sustain the logical conclusion that what dred scott 's master might lawfully do with dred scott in the free state of illinoi every other master may lawfully do with any other one or one thousand slave in illinoi or in any other free state auxiliary to all this and work hand in hand with it the nebraska doctrine or what be leave of it be to educate and mould public opinion at least northern public opinion not to care whether slavery be vote down or vote up this show exactly where we now be and partially also whither we be tend it will throw additional light on the latter to go back and run the mind over the string of historical fact already state several thing will now appear less dark and mysterious than they do when they be transpire the people be to be leave perfectly free subject only to the constitution what the constitution have to do with it outsider could not then see plainly enough now it be a exactly fitted niche for the dred scott decision to come in afterward and declare the perfect freedom of the people to be just no freedom at all why be the amendment expressly declare the right of the people vote down plainly enough now the adoption of it would have spoil the niche for the dred scott decision why be the court decision hold up why even a senator 's individual opinion withhold till after the presidential election plainly enough now the speak out then would have damage the perfectly free argument upon which the election be to be carry why the outgoing president 's felicitation on the indorsement why the delay of a reargument why the incoming president 's advance exhortation in favor of the decision these thing look like the cautious patting and petting of a spirited horse preparatory to mount he when it be dread that he may give the rider a fall and why the hasty after-indorsement of the decision by the president and other we can not absolutely know that all these exact adaptation be the result of preconcert but when we see a lot of frame timber different portion of which we know have be get out at different time and place and by different workman -- stephen franklin roger and jame for instance -- and when we see these timber join together and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill all the tenon and mortise exactly fitting and all the length and proportion of the different piece exactly adapt to they respective place and not a piece too many or too few -- not omit even scaffolding -- or if a single piece be lack we see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in -- in such a case we find it impossible not to believe that stephen and franklin and roger and jame all understand one another from the beginning and all work upon a common plan or draft draw up before the first blow be strike it should not be overlook that by the nebraska bill the people of a _ state _ as well as territory be to be leave perfectly free subject only to the constitution why mention a state they be legislating for territory and not for or about state certainly the people of a state be and ought to be subject to the constitution of the united state but why be mention of this lug into this merely territorial law why be the people of a territory and the people of a state therein lump together and they relation to the constitution therein treat as be precisely the same while the opinion of the court by chief justice taney in the dred scott case and the separate opinion of all the concur judge expressly declare that the constitution of the united state neither permit congress nor a territorial legislature to exclude slavery from any united state territory they all omit to declare whether or not the same constitution permit a state or the people of a state to exclude it _ possibly _ this be a mere omission but who can be quite sure if mclean or curti have seek to get into the opinion a declaration of unlimited power in the people of a state to exclude slavery from they limit just as chase and mace seek to get such declaration in behalf of the people of a territory into the nebraska bill -- i ask who can be quite sure that it would not have be vote down in the one case as it have be in the other the nearest approach to the point of declare the power of a state over slavery be make by judge nelson he approach it more than once use the precise idea and almost the language too of the nebraska act on one occasion he exact language be except in case where the power be restrain by the constitution of the united state the law of the state be supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction in what case the power of the state be so restrain by the united state constitution be leave a open question precisely as the same question as to the restraint on the power of the territory be leave open in the nebraska act put this and that together and we have another nice little niche which we may ere long see fill with another supreme court decision declare that the constitution of the united state do not permit a _ state _ to exclude slavery from its limit and this may especially be expect if the doctrine of care not whether slavery be vote down or vote up shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise that such a decision can be maintain when make such a decision be all that slavery now lack of be alike lawful in all the state welcome or unwelcome such decision be probably come and will soon be upon we unless the power of the present political dynasty shall be meet and overthrow we shall lie down pleasantly dream that the people of missourus be on the verge of make they state free and we shall awake to the reality instead that the supreme court have make illinoi a slave state to meet and overthrow the power of that dynasty be the work now before all who would prevent that consummation that be what we have to do how can we best do it there be those who denounce we openly to they own friend and yet whisper we softly that senator dougla be the aptest instrument there be with which to effect that object they wish we to _ infer _ all from the fact that he now have a little quarrel with the present head of the dynasty and that he have regularly vote with we on a single point upon which he and we have never differ they remind we that he be a great man and that the largest of we be very small one let this be grant but a living dog be better than a dead lion judge dougla if not a dead lion for this work be at least a caged and toothless one how can he oppose the advance of slavery he do not care anything about it he avowed mission be impress the public heart to _ care nothing about it _ a lead dougla democratic newspaper think dougla 's superior talent will be need to resist the revival of the african slave-trade do dougla believe a effort to revive that trade be approach he have not say so do he really think so but if it be how can he resist it for year he have labor to prove it a sacred right of white man to take negro slave into the new territory can he possibly show that it be less a sacred right to buy they where they can be buy cheapest and unquestionably they can be buy cheaper in africa than in virginium he have do all in he power to reduce the whole question of slavery to one of a mere right of property and as such how can he oppose the foreign slave-trade -- how can he refuse that trade in that property shall be perfectly free -- unless he do it as a protection to the home production and as the home producer will probably not ask the protection he will be wholly without a ground of opposition senator dougla hold we know that a man may rightfully be wiser to-day than he be yesterday that he may rightfully change when he find himself wrong but can we for that reason run ahead and infer that he will make any particular change of which he himself have give no intimation can we safely base we action upon any such vague inference now as ever i wish not to misrepresent judge dougla 's position question he motive or do aught that can be personally offensive to he whenever if ever he and we can come together on principle so that we cause may have assistance from he great ability i hope to have interpose no adventitious obstacle but clearly he be not now with we he do not pretend to be -- he do not promise ever to be we cause then must be intrust to and conduct by its own undoubted friend -- those whose hand be free whose heart be in the work who _ do care _ for the result two year ago the republican of the nation muster over thirteen hundred thousand strong we do this under the single impulse of resistance to a common danger with every external circumstance against we of strange discordant and even hostile element we gather from the four wind and form and fight the battle through under the constant hot fire of a disciplined proud and pampered enemy do we brave all then to falter now -- now when that same enemy be waver dissevered and belligerent the result be not doubtful we shall not fail if we stand firm we _ shall not fail _ wise counsel may accelerate or mistake delay it but sooner or later the victory be sure to come -lrb- 1854 -rrb- the opening of japan matthew c perry in view of the event that have follow the ending of japan 's self-isolation and the opening of that country first to american commerce and later to world-wide intercourse must now be regard as a achievement of momentous consequence far exceed in importance all that even the most prophetic statesmanship of the time could foresee under the shogun -lrb- or military chief -rrb- who after the seventh century overshadow the hereditary ruler the mikado there grow up in japan a feudal system whereby the general recognize as overlord increase and perpetuate they power the attempt in the sixteenth and seventeenth century to introduce christianity be meet with resistance and persecution and end in failure in the same century japan trade with the portuguese but exclude they in 1638 after this the japanese isolation be complete except for restricted trade with the dutch until the conclusion of commodore perry 's treaty about the middle of the nineteenth century a large amount of american capital be invest in the whaling industry in japanese and chinese water and one motive for the send of perry 's expedition to japan be the protection of the whaler other thing lead to that step be : the discovery of gold in californium the growth of industrial and commercial centre on the pacific coast of the united state increase trade with china and the development of steam-navigation necessitate coaling-station and port for shelter in the orient at the same time progressive mind in japan be advance in knowledge of western science and political affair thus the east and the west be almost prepare for a change in they mutual relation in 1851 the united state government empower commodore john h aulick to negotiate and sign commercial treaty with japan on the eve of he intended departure he be prevent from sailing and in the following year commodore matthew c perry brother of oliver hazard perry the hero of lake erie succeed to he mission he be invest with extraordinary naval and diplomatic power he immediate object be to establish a coaling-station in japan on November 24 1852 he sail from norfolk with the mississippus leave other ship to follow as soon as ready with he squadron he enter the bay of tokio -lrb- then call yedo -rrb- in July 1853 cause great commotion among the inhabitant of the japanese capital who mistake he appearance for a hostile approach it require both firmness and tact on perry 's part to open friendly communication and present he proposal but he succeed in do so much and then say that in the follow spring he would come for a answer he withdraw to china in February 1854 he return to tokio with a fleet of eight vessel after some parley the japanese authority agree to a conference at kanagawa a seaport adjoining yokohama of the negotiation that follow and the treaty in which they result the follow page tell and commodore perry 's own account be the best record of he distinguished service not only to he own country and japan but likewise to the civilized world after concession make by the japanese the greatest good feeling prevail on both side and there seem every prospect of establish those national relation which have be the purpose of commodore perry 's mission in accordance with the harmony and friendship that exist there be a interchange of those courtesy by which mutual good feeling seek a outward expression the japanese have acknowledge with courtly thanks the present that have be bestow in behalf of the government and now on march 24th invite the commodore to receive the various gift that have be order by the emperor in return as a public recognition of the courtesy of the united state the commodore accordingly land at yokohama with a suite of officer and he interpreter and be receive at the treaty-house with the usual ceremony by the high commissioner the large reception-room be crowd with the present the object be of japanese manufacture and consist of specimen of rich brocade and silk of they famous lacquered ware such as _ chow-chow _ box table tray and goblet all skilfully work and finish with a exquisite polish of porcelain cup of wonderful lightness and transparency adorn with figure and flower in gold and variegated color and exhibit a workmanship that surpass even that of the ware for which the chinese be remarkable fan pipe-case and article of apparel in ordinary use of no great value but of exceed interest be scatter among the more luxurious and costly object with the usual order and neatness that seem almost instinctive with the japanese the various present have be arrange in lot and classify in accordance with the rank of those for whom they be respectively intend the commissioner take they position at the farther end of the room and when the commodore and he suite enter the ordinary compliment have be interchange the prince hayashus read aloud in japanese the list of present and the name of the person to whom they be to be give this be then translate by yenoske into dutch and by mr portman into english this ceremony be over the commodore be invite by the commissioner into the inner room where he be present with two complete set of japanese coin three matchlock and two sword these gift though of no great intrinsic value be significant evidence of the desire of the japanese to express they respect for the representative of the united state the mere bestowal of the coin in direct opposition to the japanese law which absolutely forbid all issue of they money beyond the kingdom be a act of marked favor as the commodore prepare to depart the commissioner say there be one article intend for the president which have not yet be exhibit they accordingly conduct the commodore and he officer to the beach where one or two hundred sack of rice be point out heap up in readiness to be send on board the ship as that immense supply of substantial food seem to excite some wonder on the part of the american yenoske the interpreter remark that it be always customary with the japanese when bestow royal present to include a certain quantity of rice although he do not say whether the quantity always amount as on the present occasion to hundred of sack while contemplate these substantial evidence of japanese generosity the attention of all be suddenly rivet upon twenty-five monstrous fellow who tramp down the beach like so many huge elephant they be professional wrestler and form part of the retinue of the prince who keep they for they private amusement and for public entertainment they be enormously tall and tremendously heavy they scant costume which be merely a color cloth about the loin adorn with fringe and emblazon with the armorial bearing of the prince to whom each belong reveal they gigantic proportion in all the bloated fulness of fat and extent of muscle two or three of these huge monster be the most famous wrestler in japan and rank as the champion tom cribb and sayer of the country koyanagi the reputed bully of the capital be one of they and parade himself with the conscious pride of superior size and strength he be especially bring to the commodore that he might examine he massive form the commissioner insist that the monstrous fellow should be minutely inspect that the hardness of he well-rounded muscle should be feel and that the fatness of he cushion frame should be test by the touch the commodore accordingly attempt to grasp he arm which he find as solid as it be huge and then pass he hand over the monstrous neck which fall in fold of massive flesh like the dewlap of a prize ox as some surprise be naturally express at this wondrous exhibition of animal development the monster himself give a grunt expressive of he flattered vanity they be so enormously big that they appear to have lose they distinctive feature and seem to be only twenty-five mass of fat they eye be barely visible through a long perspective of socket the prominence of they nose be lose in the puffiness of they bloated cheek and they head be set almost directly on they body with merely fold of flesh where the neck and chin be usually find they great size however be more owe to development of muscle than to deposition of fat for although they be evidently well feed they be not less well exercise and capable of great feat of strength as a preliminary exhibition of the power of these man the prince set they to remove the sack of rice to a convenient place on the shore for ship each of the sack weigh not less than one hundred twenty-five pound and there be only two of the wrestler who do not carry each two sack at a time they bear the sack on the right shoulder lift the first from the ground and adjust it without help but obtain aid for the raising of the second one man carry a sack suspend by he tooth and another take one in he arm turn repeat somersault as he hold it apparently with as much ease as if he weight of flesh have be only so much gossamer and he load a feather after this preliminary display the commissioner propose that the commodore and he party should retire to the treaty-house where they would have a opportunity of see the wrestler exhibit they professional feat from the brutal performance of these wrestler the american turn with pride to the exhibition -- to which the japanese commissioner be now in they turn invite -- of the telegraph and the railroad it be a happy contrast which a higher civilization present to the disgusting display on the part of the japanese official in place of the show of brute animal force there be a triumphant revelation to a partially enlighten people of the success of science and enterprise the japanese take great delight in see the rapid movement of the liliputian locomotive and one of the scribe of the commissioner take he seat upon the car while the engineer stand upon the tender feed the furnace with one hand and direct the diminutive engine with the other crowd of the japanese gather round and look on the repeat circling of the train with unabated pleasure and surprise unable to repress a shout of delight at each blast of the steam-whistle the telegraph with its wonder though before witness still create renew interest and all the beholder be unceasing in they expression of curiosity and astonishment the agricultural instrument have be explain to the commissioner by doctor morrow a formal delivery of the telegraph the railway and other article which make up the list of american present ensue the prince of mamasakus have be delegate by he coadjutor ceremoniously to accept and captain adam be appoint by the commodore to deliver the gift and each perform he function by a interchange of compliment and a half-dozen stately bow after this a detachment of marine from the squadron be put through they various evolution while the band furnish martial music the japanese commissioner seem to take a very great interest in this military display and express themselves much gratify at the soldierly air and excellent discipline of the man this close the performance of the day the next day -lrb- march 25th -rrb- yenoske accompany by kenzeiro he fellow-interpreter come on board the powhatan to acknowledge formally in behalf of the commissioner they gratitude for the exhibition of the marine the locomotive and the telegraph with all which they declare themselves highly delighted yenoske and he coadjutor be invite to seat themselves in the cabin of the commodore and after some expression of courtesy which the japanese official be careful never to intermit propose to talk over some point in connection with the project treaty the commodore say he have no objection to the discussion of the matter informally but he protest against consider the interpreter as the official representative of the commissioner with the latter of whom only he declare could he treat authoritatively Monday march 27th be the day appoint for the entertainment to which the commodore have invite the commissioner and they attendant accordingly great arrangement be make in the flagship preparatory to the occasion the quarterdeck be adorn with a great variety of flag and all part of the steamer be in perfect order while the officer marine and man dress themselves in they uniform and prepare to do honor in every respect to they expect visitor as it be know that the strictness of japanese etiquette would not allow the high commissioner to sit at the same table with they subordinate the commodore order two banquet one to be spread in he cabin for the chief dignitary and another on the quarter-deck previous to come on board the powhatan the commissioner visit the sloop-of-war macedonian be salute as they step on she deck by seventeen gun from the mississippus lie near the great gun and boarder have be exercise for they entertainment the commissioner with they numerous attendant leave for the powhatan the macedonian firing a salvo in they honor as they take they departure on arrive on board the flagship they be first conduct through the different department of the steamer and examine with minute interest the gun and the machinery a boat be lower with a howitzer in its bow and this be repeatedly discharge much to they amusement for they evidently have a great fondness for martial exercise and display the engine be next put in motion and they evince the usual intelligence of the higher class of japanese in they inquiry and remark the commodore have invite the four captain of the squadron he interpreter mr william and he secretary to join the commissioner at he table yenoske the japanese interpreter be allow the privilege as a special condescension on the part of he superior to sit at a side-table in the cabin where he humble position do not seem to disturb either he equanimity or he appetite hayashus who always preserve he grave and dignified bearing eat and drink sparingly but taste of every dish and sip of every kind of wine he be the only one in fact whose sobriety be proof against the unrestrained conviviality that prevail among he bacchanalian coadjutor the japanese party upon deck who be entertain by a large body of officer from the various ship become quite uproarious under the influence of overflow supplies of champagne madeira and punch which they seem greatly to relish the japanese take the lead in propose health and toast and be by no mean the most backward in drink they they keep shout at the top of they voice and be hear far above the music of the band that enliven the entertainment by a succession of brisk and cheerful tune in the eagerness of the japanese appetite there be but little discrimination in the choice of dish and in the order of course and the most startling heterodoxy be exhibit in the confused commingling of fish flesh and fowl soup and syrup fruit fricassee roast and boil pickle and preserve as a most generous supply have be provide there be still some remnant of the feast leave after the guest have satisfy they voracity which most of these japanese in accordance with they custom stow away about they person to carry off the japanese always have a abundant supply of paper within the left bosom of they loose robe in a capacious pocket this be use for various purpose one species as soft as we cotton cloth and withal exceedingly tough be use for a handkerchief another furnish the material for take note or for wrap up what be leave after a feast on the present occasion when the dinner be over all the japanese guest simultaneously spread out they long fold of paper and gathering what scrap they could lay they hand on without regard to the kind of food make up a envelope of conglomerate eatables in which there be such a confusion of the sour and sweet the albuminous oleaginous and saccharine that the chemistry of liebig or the practice taste of the commodore 's parisian cook would never have reach a satisfactory analysis they not only always follow this practice themselves but insist that they american guest when entertain at a japanese feast should adopt it also whenever the commodore and he officer be feast on shore paper parcel of the remnant be thrust into they hand on leave after the banquet the japanese be entertain by a exhibition of negro minstrelsy get up by some of the sailor the gravity of the saturnine hayashus be not proof against the grotesque exhibition and even he join in the general hilarity it be now sunset and the japanese prepared to depart with quite as much wine in they as they could well bear the jovial matsusakus throw he arm about the commodore 's neck crush in he tipsy embrace a pair of new epaulette and repeat in japanese with maudlin affection these word as interpret into english : nippon and america all the same heart he then go toddle into he boat support by some of he more steady companion and soon all the happy party have leave the ship and be make rapidly for the shore the saratoga fire the salute of seventeen gun as the last boat pull off from the powhatan and the squadron be once more leave in the usual quiet of ordinary ship 's duty the follow day the commodore land to have a conference in regard to the remain point of the treaty previous to sign he be meet at the treaty-house by the commissioner as soon as the commodore have take he seat a letter be hand to he which the japanese say they have just receive from simoda it be from commander pope and have be transmit through the authority overland its contents give a satisfactory report of simoda and the commodore at once say he accept that port but declare that it must be open without delay hakodate he add would do for the other and napha in riu kiu -lrb- loo choo island -rrb- could be retain for the third in regard to the other two he be willing he say to postpone they consideration to some other time the commodore now propose to sign the agreement in regard to the three port and direct he interpreter to read it in dutch when the document have be thus read and afterward carefully peruse by the japanese they say they be prepare to concur in everything except as to the _ immediate _ opening of simoda after discussion it be finally settle that though the port might be open the japanese would address a note to the commodore say that not everything which might be want by ship would be furnish there before the expiration of ten month but that wood and water and whatever else the place possess would be supply immediately and to this note the commodore promise to reply and express he satisfaction with such a arrangement the question now come up with respect to the extent of privilege to be grant to american who might visit simoda in the discussion of which it be plain that the japanese mean to be distinctly understand as prohibit absolutely at least for the present the permanent residence of american with they family in japan the distance also to which american might extend they excursion into the country around the port of simoda and hakodate be settle and it be observable that at the special request of the japanese the commodore name the distance they assent at once to that which he mention the proposition to have consular agent reside in japan evidently give great anxiety to the commissioner the commodore be firm in say there must be such agent for the sake of the japanese themselves as well as for that of he own countryman and it be finally concede that there should be one to live at simoda and that he should not be appoint until a year and eighteen month from the date of the treaty two more article include the new point that have be discuss be now add to the transcript of the propose treaty the japanese promise to bring on board the powhatan next day a copy in dutch of they understanding of the agreement as far as concur in and the commodore depart in the next two day several note pass between the commodore and the japanese commissioner in the course of which various question that have be already consider be definitely settle and the american interpreter be occupy in cooperation with the japanese in draw up the treaty in the chinese dutch and japanese language on the 29th the ship vandalium and southampton arrive from simoda with the confirmation of what commander pope have already say in he despatch -- which have be transmit by the japanese authority overland to the commodore -- namely that the harbor and town of simoda have be find on examination suitable in every respect for the purpose of the american all be now in readiness for the final signing of the treaty accordingly on Friday march 31 1854 the commodore go to the treaty-house with he usual attendant and immediately on he arrival sign three several draft of the treaty write in the english language and deliver they to the commissioner together with three copy of the same in the dutch and chinese language certify by the interpreter messr william and portman for the united state at the same time the japanese commissioner in behalf of they government hand to the commodore three draft of the treaty write respectively in the japanese chinese and dutch language and sign by the four of they body delegate by the emperor for that purpose immediately on the signing and exchange of the copy of the treaty the commodore present the first commissioner prince hayashus with a american flag remark that he consider it the highest expression of national courtesy and friendship he could offer the prince be evidently deeply impressed with this significant mark of amity and return he thanks for it with indication of great feel the commodore then present the other dignitary with the various gift he have especially reserve for they all formal business be now conclude to the satisfaction of both party the japanese commissioner invite the commodore and he officer to partake of a entertainment prepare for the occasion the table be spread in the large reception hall these be wide divan such as be use for seat and of the same height they be cover with a red-colored crape and arrange in order accord to the rank of the guest and they host a upper table raise somewhat above the rest be appropriate to the commodore he superior officer and the commissioner when all be seat the servitor bring in a rapid succession of course consist chiefly of thick soup or rather stew in most of which fresh fish be a component part these be serve in small earthen bowl or cup and be bring in upon lacquered stand about fourteen inch square and ten inch high and place one before each guest upon the table together with each dish be a supply of soy or some other condiment while throughout there be a abundant quantity serve in peculiar vessel of the japanese national liquor the _ sake _ a sort of whiskey distil from rice various sweeten confection and a multiplicity of cake be liberally intersperse among the other article on the table toward the close of the feast a plate contain a broil crawfish a piece of fried fish of some kind two or three boil shrimp and a small square pudding with something of the consistence of blancmange be place before each with a hint that they be to follow the guest on they return to the ship and they be accordingly send and duly receive afterward after the feast which pass pleasantly and convivially compliment be freely exchange and healths drunk in liliputian cup of sake the commissioner express great anxiety about the propose visit of the commodore to yedo they earnestly urge he not to take he ship any farther up the bay as they say it would lead to trouble by which the populace might be disturbed and they own life perhaps jeopard the commodore argue the matter with they for some time and as they still pertinaciously urge they objection to he visit to the capital it be agree that the subject should be further discuss by a interchange of note the meeting then break up when it be determine by we government to send a expedition to japan those in authority be not unmindful of the peculiar characteristic of that singular nation unlike all other civilized people it be in a state of voluntary long-continued and determine isolation it neither desire nor seek communication with the rest of the world but on the contrary strove to the uttermost to prevent it it be comparatively a easy task to propose to any power the port of which be freely visit by ship from every part of the world the term of a commercial treaty but not so when by any power commerce itself be interdict before general condition of commerce could be propose to such a power it be necessary to settle the great preliminary that commerce would be allow at all again if that preliminary be settle affirmatively a second point of great moment remain to be discuss viz to what degree shall intercourse for trading be extend among nation accustom to the usage of christendom the principle and extent of national comity in the interchange of commercial transaction have be so long and so well define and understand that as between they the term commercial treaty need no explanation its meaning be comprehend alike by all and in its stipulation it may cover the very broad extent that include everything involve in the operation of commerce between two maritime nation but in a kingdom which in its polity expressly ignore commerce and repudiate it as a evil instead of a good it be necessary to lay the very foundation as well as to adjust the term hence the instruction to commodore perry cover broad ground and he letter of credence conform to he instruction if he find the japanese disposed to abandon at once and forever they deliberately adopt plan of non-intercourse with foreigner -lrb- a event most unlikely -rrb- he power be ample to make with they a commercial treaty as wide and general as any we have with the nation of europe if they be dispose to relax but in part they jealous and suspicious system formally to profess relation of friendship and open some only of they port to we vessel to allow a trade in those port between they people and ours he be authorize to negotiate for this purpose and secure for he country such privilege as he could not inconsistent with the self-respect which as a nation we owe to ourselves it must not be forget in the contemplation of what be accomplish that we representative go to a people who at the time of he arrival among they have both by positive law and usage of more than two hundred year allow but one of they harbor nagasaki to be open to foreigner at all have permit no trade with such foreigner when they do come except under stringent regulation with the dutch and the chinese be in the habit of communicate with the world outside of they at second-hand only through the medium of the dutch who be imprison at dezima and a people who as far as we know never make a formal treaty with a civilized nation in the whole course of they history there be but two point on which the commodore 's instruction do not allow he a large discretion to be exercise accord to circumstance these be first that if happily any arrangement for trade either general or special be make it be to be distinctly stipulate that under no circumstance and in no degree would the american submit to the humiliating treatment so long bear by the dutch in carry on they trade the citizen of we country must be deal with as freeman or there should be no dealings at all the second point be that in the event of any of we countryman be cast in god 's providence as shipwrecked man on the coast of japan they should not be treat as prisoner confine in cage or subject to inhuman treatment but should be receive with kindness and hospitably care for until they could leave the country the nearest approach to a precedent be to be find in we treaty with china make in 1844 this therefore be carefully study by the commodore its purport be a treaty or general convention of peace amity and commerce and to settle the rule to be mutually observe in the intercourse of the respective country so far as commerce be concern it permit the citizen of the united state to frequent five port in china and to reside with they family and trade there and to proceed at pleasure with they vessel and merchandise to or from any foreign port and from either of the say five port to enter any other of they as to duty on article import they be to pay accord to a tariff that be make part of the treaty and in no case be to be subject to higher duty than those pay under similar circumstance by the people of other nation consul be provide for to reside at the five open port and those trade there be permit to import from they own or any other port into china and sell there and purchase therein and export to they own or any other port all manner of merchandise of which the importation or exportation be not prohibit by the treaty in short so far as the five port be concern there exist between we and china a general treaty of commerce the commodore cause to be prepare in the chinese character a transcript of the treaty with such verbal alteration as would make it applicable to japan with the view of exhibit it to the imperial commissioner of that country should he be so successful as to open negotiation he be not sanguine enough to hope that he could procure a entire adoption of the chinese treaty by the japanese he be not ignorant of the difference in national characteristic between the inhabitant of china and the more independent self-reliant and sturdy native of the japanese island he know that the latter hold the former in some degree of contempt and treat they in the matter of trade very much as they treat the dutch he be also aware that the chinese when they make they treaty do know something of the advantage that might result from intercourse with the rest of the world while as to the japanese in they long-continued isolation either they neither know nor desire such advantage or if they know they fear they might be purchase at too high a price in the introduction of foreigner who as in the case of the portuguese century before might seek to overturn the empire it be too much therefore to expect that the japanese would in all the particulars of a treaty imitate the chinese of the difficulty encounter even after the japanese have consent to negotiate the best account may be give from the conference and discussion between the negotiator of all which most accurate report be keep on both side in the form of dialogue at the first meeting of the commodore with the imperial commissioner on march 8th he act on the plan he have propose to himself with respect to the treaty with china and thus address they : _ commodore perry _ i think it would be better for the two nation that a treaty similar to the one between my country and the chinese should be make between we i have prepare the draft of one almost identical with we treaty with china i have be send here by my government to make a treaty with yours if i do not succeed now my government will probably send more ship here but i hope we shall soon settle matter amicably _ japanese _ we wish for time to have the document translate into the japanese language this be but one among a hundred proof of they extreme suspicion and caution for there be not one of the imperial commissioner probably who could not have read without the least difficulty the document as furnished by the commodore and certain it be that they interpreter could have read it off into japanese at once the commodore who wish to do as far as possible everything that might conciliate of course make no objection to a request so seemingly reasonable though he know it to be needless and be content to wait patiently for they reply in one week that reply come in write and be very explicit : as to open a trade such as be now carry on by china with you country we certainly can not yet bring it about the feeling and manners of we people be very unlike those of other nation and it will be exceedingly difficult even if you wish it to change immediately the old regulation for those of other country moreover the chinese have long have intercourse with western nation while we have have dealings at nagasakus with only the people of holland and china this answer be not entirely unexpected and put a end to all prospect of negotiate a commercial treaty in the european sense of that phrase it only remain therefore to secure for the present admission into the kingdom and so much of trade as japanese jealousy could be bring to concede at length after much and oft-repeated discussion the point be yield that certain port might be open to we vessel and then in the interview of march 25th come up the subject of consul _ japanese _ about the appointment of consul or agent the commissioner desire a delay of four or five year to see how the intercourse work the governor of the town and the official interpreter will be able to carry on all the business of supply provision coal and need article with the captain without the intervention of a consul _ perry _ the duty of a consul be to report all difficulty that arise between american citizen and japanese to he government in a authentic manner assist the japanese in carry out they law and the provision of the treaty and recover debt make by the american and also communicate to the government at washington whatever the japanese wish as no letter can be receive after this through the dutch and if no consul be receive then a ship-of-war must remain in japan constantly and she captain must do the duty of a consul _ japanese _ if we have not feel great confidence in you we should not have consent to open we port at all consul may be accept by and by after experience have show they need and we hope that all american citizen obey the law of they country and behave properly _ perry _ true and i hope no difficulty will arise and this appointment of consul in japan as they be in china hawaius and everywhere else be to prevent and provide for difficulty no american will report he own misdeed to he own government nor can the japanese bring they to we notice except through a government agent this provision must be in the treaty though i will stipulate for only one to reside at simoda and he will not be send probably for a year or two from this time and thus it be that the commodore have to explain everything and feel he way step by step in the progress of the whole negotiation _ japanese _ the commissioner wish every point desire by the admiral to be state clearly for the japanese be not equal to the american and have not much to give in exchange _ perry _ i have already state all my view as regard we intercourse in the draft of the treaty you have -lrb- this be one prepare by the commodore after the rejection of the transcript of the chinese treaty -rrb- let the commissioner state they objection to it this treaty now to be make be only a beginning and as the nation know each other the japanese will permit american to go anywhere to fujiyama -- all over the country _ japanese _ we have find restriction necessary against the portuguese and the english then follow observation by the japanese on pellew 's entry into nagasakus harbor which show how much dislike of the english that event have occasion a strong proof of they remarkable caution be furnish by the japanese at the conference hold on march 28th when most of the term of the treaty have be agree upon _ perry _ i be prepare now to sign the treaty about these three harbor mr portman interpreter then read in dutch that portion of the treaty which contain such point as have be already agree upon _ japanese _ it be all correct except that we have objection to open the port of simoda immediately if any vessel be to go there in distress we should be glad to furnish they with provision wood and water _ perry _ you have already consent in one of you letter to I to open that port immediately i be very desirous of settle that matter now as i wish to despatch the saratoga home to inform the government before congress adjourn how matter be advance that will take some time and there be no probability that any ship will come here before ten or twelve month have expire so that it will make no difference to you whether you put it in the treaty to be open now or in ten month _ japanese _ we be willing to put it in the treaty to be open now if you will give we a letter or promise that no ship will come here before the president give he permission _ perry _ i can not do that very well but i be willing to put it off ninety day that will be about the time i shall return from hakodate it be you own proposition yesterday to open that port immediately i consent to this however to show you how desirous i be to do what i can to please you i can not consent to a longer time _ japanese _ if we put it in the treaty to be open now we would like you to give we a order that no ship shall enter that port before ten month _ perry _ i can not do that but there be no probability that any ship will come here before that time as i shall not leave here for three month and they will not hear of it before that time and when they do hear of it it will take several month for ship to make the voyage here if you choose i will keep one of the ship at simoda for several month _ japanese _ if ship go there before that time we shall not be able to give they other than provision wood and water _ perry _ the ship that may go there will want such thing only as you may have if you have they not of course you can not and will not be expect to furnish they but as i say before there be no probability that ship will go there before the expiration of ten month _ japanese _ when you come back from matsumai we shall have plenty of provision at simoda for the whole squadron but to other ship we can not furnish more than wood water etc _ perry _ when we return from matsumai we shall not want many provision as we shall be go to a place where we shall get plenty it be only the principle i wish settle now i have come here as a peacemaker and i desire to settle everything now and thus prevent trouble hereafter i wish to write home to my government that the japanese be friend _ japanese _ we will write you a letter state that we can not furnish you anything before ten month but that we can furnish wood and water immediately and that we will furnish such other thing as we possibly can this letter we should like you to answer _ perry _ very well i will _ japanese _ -lrb- enter on another part of the term agree on -rrb- we will not confine american or prevent they from walk around but we should like to place a limit to the distance they may walk _ perry _ i be prepare to settle that matter now but they must not be confine to any particular house or street suppose we make the distance they may walk the same distance that a man can go and come in a day or if you choose the number of _ lis _ or _ ris _ may be agree upon _ japanese _ we be willing that they shall walk as far as they can go and come in a day _ perry _ there be no probability that sailor would wish to go on shore more than once from curiosity besides they will have they daily duty to attend to on board ship and will not be able to go on shore _ japanese _ we do not wish any woman to come and remain at simoda _ perry _ the probability be that few woman will go there and they only the wife of the officer of the ship _ japanese _ when you come back from matsumai we should like _ you _ to settle the distance that american be to walk it be difficult for _ we _ to settle the distance _ perry _ say the distance of seven japanese mile in any direction from the center of the city of simoda _ japanese _ very well a few mile will make no difference you be request not to leave agent until after you have experience that it be necessary _ perry _ i be willing to defer the appointment of a consul or a agent one year or eighteen month from the date of the sign the treaty and then if my government think it necessary it will send one in fact not a article of the treaty be make without the most serious deliberation by the japanese in answer to a question from captain adam in the very first stage of the negotiation they reply : the japanese be unlike the chinese they be adverse to change and when they make a compact of any kind they intend that it shall endure for a thousand year for this reason it will be best to deliberate and examine well the facility for trade and the suitableness of the port before any one be determine on probably nothing but the exercise of the most perfect truthfulness and patience would ever have succeed in make a treaty with they at all and from the language of one of they communication it be obvious that with characteristic caution they mean that they present action should be but a beginning of intercourse which might or might not be afterward make more extensive accord to the result of what they deem the experiment this it must be remember be the first formal treaty they ever make on the subject of foreign trade at least since the expulsion of the portuguese and they evidently mean to proceed cautiously by single step there be observable throughout the negotiation the predominate influence of the national prejudice against the permanent introduction of foreigner among they the word reside be but once use in the whole treaty and that in the article relative to consul the detail of conference already give show how anxiously they seek to avoid have consul at all indeed commodore perry say i could only induce the commissioner to agree to this article by endeavor to convince they that it would save the japanese government much trouble if a american agent be to reside at one or both of the port open by the treaty to whom complaint might be make of any malpractice of the united state citizen who might visit the japanese dominion they want no permanent foreign resident among they official or unofficial this be show most unequivocally in the remark already record in one of the conference -- we do not wish any woman to come and remain at simoda simoda be one of the port open for trade with we they know that we people have wife and daughter and that a man 's family be ordinarily resident with he in he permanent abode and that if the head of the family live in simoda as a japanese would live there would certainly be woman who would come and remain at simoda but more than this it will be remember that the commodore have submit to they we treaty with china and they have hold it under consideration for a week at the end of which time they say : as to open a trade such as be now carry on by china with you country we certainly can not yet bring it about the chinese have long have intercourse with western nation while we have have dealings at nagasakus with only the people of holland and china now what be such a trade as we carry on with china the japanese read in we treaty that five port be open to we that permission be give to the citizen of the united state to frequent they and further to reside with they family and trade there this they deliberately decline assent to when they refuse to make a treaty similar to that with china they surely would not afterward knowingly insert it in any treaty they might make with we the only permanent residence to which they give assent and that most reluctantly be the residence of a consul temporary residence be allow to we shipwrecked citizen as well as to those who go to simoda or hakodate on commercial business they be allow to land to walk where they please within certain limit to enter shop and temple without restriction to purchase in the shop and have the article send to the proper public office duly mark where they will pay for they to resort to public-house or inn that be to be build for they refreshment when on shore at simoda and hakodate and until build a temple at each place be assign as a resting-place for person in they walk they may accept invitation to partake of the hospitality of any of the japanese but they be not permit to enter military establishment or private house without leave without leave we citizen can not enter they within the territory of any nation with which we have a treaty in short the whole treaty show that the purpose of the japanese be to make the experiment of intercourse with we before they make it as extensive or as intimate as it be between we and the chinese it be all they could do at the time and much very much be obtain on the part of we negotiator in procure a concession even to this extent but as he know that we success would be but the forerunner of that of other power and as he believe that new relation of trade once commence not only with ourselves but with england france holland and russium could not fail in the progress of event to break up the old restrictive policy effectually and forever and open japan to the world and must also lead gradually to liberal commercial treaty he wisely in the ninth article secure to the united state and they citizen without consultation or delay all privilege and advantage which japan might hereafter grant to any other nation or nation and the commodore 's comment on this article conclusively show that _ he _ at least do not suppose he have make a commercial treaty : article ix this be a most important article as there can be little doubt that on hearing of the success of this mission the english french and russian will follow we example and it may be reasonable to suppose that each will gain some additional advantage until a commercial treaty be accomplished article ix will give to american without further consultation all these advantage all other power be force to be content in obtain just what we as pioneer obtain they treaty be like ours that of russium be copy from ours with no change but that of the substitution of the port of nagasakus for napha in riu kiu we respectfully submit therefore that all and indeed more than all under the circumstance that could have be reasonably expect have be accomplish -lrb- 1855 -rrb- the capture of sebastopol sir edward b hamely and sir evelyn wood this be the most famous event of the crimean war in which russian power be pit against the ally force of turkey france great britain and sardinium the war grow out of rival demand concern a protectorate in turkey in 1852 napoleon iii ask for the restoration of the protectorate of the holy place in the ottoman empire to the latin church support by russium the greek church have virtually supplant the latin church in turkish dominion and russium now put forward a demand for a protectorate over the greek subject of the sultan turkey have no interest in the religious question at issue and she pursue a waver course between the dispute power fear to offend either of they russia at last begin openly to threaten turkey and finding vacillation and diplomacy no longer avail for a postponement of the conflict the sultan declare war October 4 1853 in the early engagement of the war the turk gain some success over russian troops but the first important event be the destruction of a part of the turkish fleet at sinope November 30 1853 this be regard by england as a act of treachery on the part of russium bring great britain into the conflict the russian occupy the danubian principality and the battle of the alma in which the ally first confront russium be win by the former with greatly superior number September 20 1854 the siege of sebastopol begin in October and during its progress important battle occur -- that of balaklava that of inkerman November 5th in which the russian be defeat by the english and the french that of tchernaya August 16 1855 a victory for the russian and the storm of the malakoff describe below the capture of sebastopol be follow by the taking of kar by the russian November 28 1855 and the war end in accordance with the treaty of pari march 30 1856 russium abandon she claim to a protectorate over christian in turkey and the sultan agree to grant they more favorable term sir edward bruce hamley and sir henry evelyn wood british general who serve in the crimean war give we the best account of the siege and capture of sebastopol in which they be active participant the siege have continue through many week without decisive development when on June 18 1855 the french make a strong but unsuccessful assault on the malakoff which like the redan form one of the main defence the following narrative describe the british assault on the redan and the final storm of the malakoff by the french sir edward bruce hamley see how desperate be the condition of the fortress prince gortschakoff have resolve after the battle of the tchernaya to abandon sebastopol in letter to the minister of war of August 18 and 24 1855 he express this intention say there be not a man in the army who would not call it folly to continue the defense longer with a view to conduct a retreat he press forward rapidly the construction of the bridge across the harbor which be to have a roadway of sixteen foot and to bear heavy vehicle he also confer with todleben on other measure to protect the withdrawal and accordingly barricade be build across the street and form into armed and defensible work which be intend as a last resort to hold in check the assailant preparation be also make for blow up the principal fort and magazine another great cannonade have begin on August 17th the french line have now approach so close to the place that new addition to they be immediately destroy or render untenable by the fire from the malakoff and little redan and the shower of small shell easily cast into the trench from the rampart and call by the french bouquet greatly increase they loss for the silencing of the artillery which thus hinder the french sapper the ally battery open in full force against the part of the enemy 's line from the redan to the great harbor but the town front be not include and the english battery suffer greatly from want of support by the work on they leave on August 20th gortschakoff enter the fortress and go round the line of defense upon which the fire of the ally be just then at its height what he see might well confirm he in he resolution to retreat there be no longer either a city or a suburb to defend for both be heap of rubbish and cinder the parapet of the work dry in the heat of summer and split in huge fragment by the shot be crumble into the ditch the interior space be honeycomb with hole make by the shell gabion and sandbag could not be procure to repair the embrasure which remain in ruin many of the dismount gun could no longer be replace not because there be not plenty in the arsenal but because to mount they by night under the deadly fire of the mortar entail such frightful sacrifice of man the defender of the work be pack in cave under the parapet the gunner lay dead in heap on the battery the wound could not be remove by day because the communication with the rear be now search throughout by the fire of the ally and so lay where they fall in torment in the sun beside the more fortunate slay on landing the prince have pass the hospital full to overflow and the ambulance with the wound crowd what have be the square there be nothing to relieve the horrible monotony of destruction and devastation except the bridge which promise retreat from this misery and which be approach completion yet it be after this visit that the russian general change he mind in the direction of what he have before term folly i be resolve he write to the minister of war on September 1st to defend the south side to the last extremity for it be the only honorable course which remain to we calculate that the daily loss of the garrison be from eight hundred to nine hundred and that he could bring twenty-five thousand man from the army outside to reenforce it by leave only twenty thousand to guard the mackenzie height he consider he might still prolong the defense for a month everything be against such a cruel determination but he proceed to execute it so far as in he lay yet it do not rest with he to determine the end the cannonade once more reduce the malakoff its dependency and neighbor to absolute silence and enable the french to push they work yet closer the soil between the mamelon and malakoff could be cut into like a cheese and the trench be more easily make and better construct here than elsewhere the english trench before the redan have be stop by solid rock the french approach to the little redan now only forty yard from it have also get into soil so stony as no longer to afford cover the most advanced approach to the malakoff be separate from it by only twenty-five yard in the soft soil the trench might have be push to the very edge of the ditch but only with great loss and besides the facility of mining below they would increase as the distance lessen it be therefore deem that the time for assault have come and it only remain to determine the detail accordingly a council of war consider the matter after the member have deliver they opinion pélissier express himself thus : i too have my plan but i will not breathe it to my pillow there be however no need to be so reticent with the reader the french commander have learn that the relief of the troops in the work before he take place at noon and that in order to avoid the great additional loss which would be cause by introduce the new garrison before the old one move out the contrary course be follow of march out most of the occupant before replace they thus noon be the time when the malakoff would be find most destitute of defender and noon be to be the hour of the assault also another advantage be offer to the french the salient of the malakoff have be adapt to the form of the tower which it cover and be therefore circular consequently there be a space in it which could not be see or fire on from the flank that be the space upon which the troops be to be direct roadway twenty yard wide be make through the trench and then mask by gabion easily throw down by which the reserve could be bring up in the shortest time the malakoff the curtain and the little redan be each to be attack by a division support by a brigade and four division with other troops be destine to attack the central bastion and work near it and break thence by the rear into the flagstaff bastion but first the cannonade be to be renew it begin on September 5th and this time it encircle the whole fortress the french battery before the town opening no less vigorously than the rest at night a frigate in the harbor be set on fire by a shell and the conflagration for hour light up the surround scenery on the 6th and 7th the _ feu d'enfer _ go on the russian reply but feebly on the night of the 7th a line-of-battle ship be set on fire by a mortar and burn nearly all night it contain a large supply of spirit the blue flame from which cast a lugubrious light on the rampart from the harbor to the malakoff produce say todleben a painful impression on the soul of the defender of sebastopol daylight on the 8th find the russian defence completely man the gun load with grape and the reserve bring close up but the assault be not yet begin and the result of these preparation to receive it be increase havoc in the expose rank of the defender the attack on the redan be to be direct by general codrington he division and the second under general markham be to supply the column of attack of which the cover party the ladder party the work party -lrb- to fill up the ditch and convert what work we might gain to we own purpose -rrb- and the main body be to number seventeen hundred and the support fifteen hundred the remainder of these two division numbering three thousand be to be in reserve in the third parallel also in the last reserve be the third and fourth division no attack on the redan would have be undertake by the english as a isolate operation we compulsory distance from that work the want of a place of arm -lrb- that be to say a covered space in the advanced trench of sufficient extent to harbor large body of troops -rrb- the construction of which be forbid by the rocky soil and the still unsubdued fire from the rampart all condemn a assault but it be deem necessary as a distraction in aid of the french and it fulfil the purpose the portion of codrington 's troops destine to head the attack on the redan move rapidly and steadily across the open space though suffer much loss from the heavy fire of round-shot grape case and musketry now direct on they from every available point and those in front pass with ease over the battered rampart and enter the work but the rest with too strong a reminiscence of they mode of action in the trench lay down at the edge of the ditch and begin firing alongside of the cover troops who alone should have perform this duty the support also reach the ditch and some of they enter the work but the great reserve in move through the inch toward the point of issue be obstruct and discourage by meet the number of wounded man and they bearer who be of necessity bring back by the same narrow route a difficulty which also hinder some of the french attack colonel windham the leader of the attack troops find that he message for support produce no result take the ill-advised step of go back himself to procure reënforcements it be not surprising that before he return he man also have withdraw it be probably in reference to this that the _ engineer journal _ say in excuse the troops that they retire when they find themselves without any officer of rank they have be overwhelm by the number which the russian bring into the open work and as they hurry back they suffer not less heavily than in they advance it be unfortunate for they that the french have spike the gun in the malakoff instead of turn they on the enemy move into the redan as they ought to have do with the immense increase of difficulty in make way through the crowded trench and renew the attack against work now fully armed and man the attempt be postpone till next day when fresh troops head by the highlander be to renew it sir henry evelyn wood it may render my narrative of the final assault more readily comprehensible if i begin by say that the malakoff be now consider the key of the russian position it be determine that all other attack should be consider subsidiary to that which be to be direct against it general bosquet have command of all the french troops employ on the right of the english attack macmahon 's division be to assault the malakoff itself have de wimpffen 's brigade with camou 's division in reserve and with it two battalion of zouave of the guard on macmahon 's right la motterouge 's division compose of the brigade of bourbakus and picard be to attack the curtain it be support by four regiment two of grenadier and two of voltigeur of the guard still farther north be dulac 's division support by marolle 's brigade of camou 's division and one battalion of chasseur of the guard these be to attack the little redan pélissier himself take up he position in the mamelon and to avoid give warn to the enemy by any system of a general signal the watch of the staff and the general be carefully compare in order that the assault might be begin at twelve o'clock this hour be choose by pélissier in consequence of he have ascertain that the troops on duty in the russian trench be relieve at that hour and owe to the work be cramp from the number of traverse and blindage erect to cover they garrison from fire it have become the habit for the old guard of the work to march out before the relief march in and it be thus anticipate that at twelve o'clock the work would be nearly empty this surmise prove to be accurate the french have take great trouble to screen the concentration of they troops from the sight of the enemy each division have a separate access to the advanced trench in which the storm party be to assemble in place where the parapet have sink might have disclose to the view of the enemy the troops move into position they have be carefully raise cut have be make through parapet to admit of the support move forward in body and to allow field-artillery battery which be station at the victorium redoubt and the old lancaster battery to pass through to the front these aperture have be fill up with gabion and carefully conceal so that they position remain unknown to the enemy general herbillon still encamp on the tchernaya be direct to cause he force -lrb- less camou 's division call up to support la motterouge and dulac -rrb- to stand to arm at twelve o'clock and he command be reenforce by a brigade of cuirassier under general de forton the morning be dull and gloomy with a cold wind which drive cloud of dust into the air a little before twelve o'clock all the french storm party be crouch ready for the order bosquet himself be in the sixth parallel macmahon surround by he staff be stand in the front trench with he watch in he hand no one speak in this group in which the calm face show no sign of the excitement visible in the zouave on either side of they who though silent be tremble with impatience close at hand there be a corporal hold a little tricolor two minute before twelve o'clock the word be pass in a undertone ready and as the hand indicate it be twelve o'clock on a command from macmahon a shout arise of _ vive l'empereur _ bugle and drum sound the charge and the zouave dash straight at the malakoff macmahon allow two section to pass he and then follow by he staff climb over the parapet follow the advanced guard it place one ladder by which the general descend into the ditch and be it be say the first up the escarp of the work a friend of mine describe to I how he watch the tricolor on the parapet be carry slowly along thus indicate exactly how we ally in the body of the work be gain ground the zouave who cross the ditch on the proper left of the malakoff have some difficulty in climb up from the height and steepness of the escarp macmahon 's lead brigade cross the short intervene space without a shot be fire the enemy 's work party and gunner who be repair damages fight bravely with pick shovel and hand-spike but be eventually drive back the very few russian in the salient be completely surprise so much so that some of the superior officer be find at dinner in a underground chamber of the malakoff and the french without difficulty obtain absolute possession of the south end of the work although the enclosure cover a area of about four hundred yard by one hundred fifty there be but very little open space within it for behind the remnant of the stone tower be row of traverse stretch from side to side of the work behind these the russian take post as they come up from they bombproof shelter every separate parapet be fight for hand to hand and it be not till vinoy 's brigade which enter by the gervai battery get behind the traverse turn out the regiment grand duke michel that the enemy be finally drive from this part of the work the lead brigade of motterouge 's and dulac 's division head by they chief seize the curtain and the little redan the latter fall first as st pol 's brigade be nearer to it than bourbakus 's brigade be to the curtain once inside these work from which the russian be easily drive the french press on to the intrenchment then be build across the rear general pélissier now give general simpson the signal to attack the redan at the same time the french attack the malakoff and there the fate of sebastopol be really decide the possession of this fort be strongly contest the russian bring up field-battery the french be also fire on heavily by three steamer which circle round fire broadside into they and battery send shell from the north side of the harbor into the french support eventually after a prolonged struggle in which the french capture four field-gun st pol 's brigade be beat back lose its brigadier and with he fall the chief staff officer of the division and two colonel the russian follow up closely and bisson 's brigade which for want of space in the trench have be station in the careenage ravine be too far behind to afford effective aid bourbakus 's right be thus uncovered he also be drive back although support by motterouge 's other brigade after bourbakus and st pol have be repulse the voltigeur and grenadier of the guard and marolle 's brigade be send against the curtain and redan respectively these they carry but be once more expel from the little redan marolle and de pontevès fall dead at the head of they brigade and mellinet bisson and bourbakus be wound the french still hold the curtain and bosquet now order up the two field-battery then stand behind the victorium redoubt they descend the ridge at the trot unlimber in front of the sixth parallel and come into action fire with great effect on the russian infantry which offer a broad target yet the battery suffer terribly the command officer -lrb- souty -rrb- be kill and out of the one hundred fifty man he bring down only fifty-five return when the gun be drag back by hand because they lose all they horse except nineteen bosquet surround by several russian officer who be prisoner and they guard be interrogate the captive when a shell burst over they kill or wound both they and the guard -- the general only escape later when lean on the parapet watch the progress of the fight he be strike in the face by a fragment of a shell he have just strength to send word to general dulac to take he place when he faint the struggle in and around the malakoff be continue till three o'clock when gortschakoff withdraw he troops from the work which they have defend with such marvellous endurance for eleven month the prize be now win but at heavy cost macmahon 's division which assault with forty-five hundred bayonet and two hundred officer lose in kill and wound just half its strength soon after the russian have be drive from the salient of the malakoff the french troops occupy it be fire on from the lower part of the old masonry tower which be loophole and inside which five officer and sixty russian soldier have take refuge it be impossible to dislodge they as the only entrance be strongly block on the inside after a time some gabion be collect and have be place in position close to the loophole be light but before the defender could be smoke out a mortar fire against the door blow it away and the russian surrender the gabion burn fiercely the officer become alarmed lest the fire should be communicate to some of the surround magazine and a attempt be make to extinguish the blaze fragment as this be difficult sapper be set to work to dig a trench and throw the excavate earth on the fire while the man be digging four wire communicate with mine be find and cut while the russian officer be surrender a desperate struggle be carry on at the far end of the malakoff enclosure the russian come over the parapet in three heavy column khrouleff the fight general be wound have be replace by general martinau the combatant fight hand to hand till martinau lose a arm and he man be out of ammunition gortschakoff order they to give up the struggle and fall back between three and four o'clock a magazine blow up near the point where the curtain join the malakoff and the division at once run back to the french advanced trench this occur at a moment when general la motterouge be wound but he man be rally and get back into position ere the smoke and dust of the explosion clear away the flag of the ninety-first regiment be bury so deep that it be not find till next day when it be recover still grasp tightly in the hand of the lifeless officer who be carry it when the explosion take place when the russian withdraw general macmahon contemplate the possibility of further explosion from undiscovered mine in order to minimize possible loss of life send back the brigade under colonel decaen whom he order to hold himself in readiness and if vinoy 's brigade should be blow into the air to come forward immediately and replace it then turn to general vinoy macmahon observe it be possible general that you brigade will be blow up but decaen will replace you immediately so we shall still hold we position macmahon himself remain in the malakoff with vinoy 's brigade during the afternoon it be report to general pélissier that large number of russian troops be cross by the float bridge to the north side of the harbor but the ally do not yet feel confident that the end have quite come about midnight one of the maritime fort be blow up and explosion continue at interval throughout the night fire burst out wherever any inflammable substance remain at 3 be on the 9th corporal ross royal engineer who be employ in the advanced sap be strike by the unusual silence within the redan creep across the ditch and climb over the parapet find that the enemy have evacuate the work at daylight all the russian fleet except the vladimir have disappear under water and the last of this heroic garrison be see form up on the north side of the float bridge which be then cut leave on the southern side two hundred or three hundred man who have remain behind set fire to the house this be the last of the active operation gortschakoff withdraw he troops and place the cavalry on the belbeck extend the infantry along the mackenzie farm height position which he proceed to fortify the ally be now in possession of the bloodstained ruin of sebastopol and the last of the black sea fleet be at the bottom of the harbor perhaps it be well that peace ensue although we might have dislodge the russian from they position on the height it would have be difficult to obtain any further material advantage in the crimea -lrb- 1857 -rrb- the indian mutiny j talboy wheeler from the time when warren hasting the first english governor-general of indium be send to rule there -lrb- 1774 -rrb- the british power in that country grow steadily and many annexation be make to the territory under its control there be frequent war with the french england 's rival in indium and with the native in different province that one after another be absorb into the british possession the first serious menace against this grow power appear in a native movement the culmination of which be know as the indian or sepoy mutiny the cause of this rise be trace to distrust and hatred of the british ruler -- feeling that cause a ferment among the hindu and mahometan of indium who suspect a design for suppress they religion the native also become alarm at the introduction of western idea and improvement -- new method of education the steam-engine the telegraph etc -- portend to the indian people the substitution of a foreign civilization for they own the truth be that in attempt to abolish suttee and other ancient native custom and to introduce more enlighten practice the british government be act in the interest of general humanity the immediate provocation of the great mutiny among the sepoy or native troops in the british east-indian service be well show and the entire story of the revolt be equally well tell by mr wheeler this author while a secretary to the government of indium in the latter part of the nineteenth century enjoy peculiar advantage for study and research these advantage he turn to account by write a authoritative and interesting history of the land of he official residence early in the year 1857 it be say there be rumor of a come danger to british rule in indium in some part of the country _ chupatty _ or cake be circulate in a mysterious manner from village to village -lrb- footnote : the form of the cake convey information that a insurrection be in preparation -- a old custom -- understand by the native -- ed -rrb- prophecy be also rife that in 1857 the east indium company 's _ raj _ -lrb- rule -rrb- would come to a end lord canning have be blame for not take alarm at these proceedings but something of the kind always have be go on in indium cake of cocoanut be give away in solemn fashion and as the villager be afraid to keep they or eat they the circulation go on to the end of the chapter then again holy man and prophet have always be common in indium they foretell pestilence and famine : the downfall of british rule or the destruction of the whole world they be often suppose to be endow with supernatural power and to be impervious to bullet but these phenomenon invariably disappear whenever they come in contact with european especially as all such character be liable to be treat as vagrant without visible means of subsistence one dangerous story however get abroad in the early part of 1857 which ought to have be stop at once and for which the military authority be wholly and solely to blame the enfield rifle be be introduce it require new cartridge which in england be grease with the fat of beef or pork the military authority in indium with strange indifference to the prejudice of sepoy order the cartridge to be prepare at calcutta in like manner forget that the fat of pig be hateful to the mahometan while the fat of cow be still more horrible in the eye of the hindu the excitement begin at barrackpur sixteen mile from calcutta at this station there be four regiment of sepoy and no european except the regimental officer one day a low-caste native know as a lascar ask a brahmin sepoy for a drink of water from he brass pot the brahmin refuse as it would defile he pot the lascar retort that the brahmin be already defile by bite cartridge which have be grease with cow 's fat this vindictive taunt be base on truth lascar have be employ at calcutta in prepare the new cartridge and the man be possibly one of they the taunt create a wild panic at barrackpur strange to say however none of the new cartridge have be issue to the sepoy and have this be promptly explain to the man and the sepoy leave to grease they own cartridge the alarm might have die out but the explanation be delay until the whole of the bengal army be smite with the groundless fear and then when it be too late the authority protest too much and the terror-stricken sepoy refuse to believe they the sepoy have prove themselves brave under fire and loyal to they salt in sharp extremity but they be the most credulous and excitable soldiery in the world they regard steam and electricity as so much magic and they fully believe that the british government be bind indium with chain when it be only lay down railway line and telegraph wire the enfield rifle be a new mystery and the busy brain of the sepoy be soon at work to divine the motive of the english in grease cartridge with cow 's fat they have always take to themselves the sole credit of have conquer indium for the company and they now imagine that the english want they to conquer persium and china accordingly they suspect that lord canning be go to make they as strong as european by destroy caste force they to become christian and make they eat beef and drink beer the story of the greased cartridge with all its absurd embellishment run up the gange and jumna to benare allahabad agra delhus and the great cantonment at meerut while another current of lie run back again from meerut to barrackpur it be noised abroad that the bone of cow and pig have be ground into powder and throw into well and mingle with flour and butter in order to destroy the caste of the mass and convert they to christianity for a brief interval it be hope that the disaffection be suppress excitement manifest itself in various way at different station throughout the length of hindustan and the punjab -- at benare lucknow agra ambalum and sealkote in some station there be incendiary fire in other the sepoy be want in they usual respect to they european officer but it be believe that the storm be spend itself and that the dark cloud be pass away suddenly on may 3d there be a explosion at lucknow a regiment of oudh irregular infantry previously in the service of the mogul break out in mutiny and begin to threaten they european officer sir henry lawrence the new chief commissioner have a european regiment at he disposal namely the thirty-second foot that same evening he order out the regiment and a battery of eight gun man by european together with four sepoy regiment three of infantry and one of cavalry with this force he proceed to the line of the mutineer about seven mile off the oudh irregular be take by surprise they see infantry and cavalry on either side and the european gun in front they be order to lay down they arm and they obey at this moment the artillery light they port fire the mutineer be seize with a panic and rush away in the darkness but the leader and most of they follower be pursue and arrest by the native infantry and cavalry and confine pend trial subsequently it transpire that the native regiment sympathize with the mutineer and would have show it but for they dread of sir henry lawrence and the european the energetic action of lawrence suffice to maintain order for another month in oudh meanwhile the thirty-fourth native infantry be disband at barrackpur and again it be hope that the disaffection be stay the demon of mutiny be only scotch within a week of the outbreak at lucknow the great military station of meerut be in a blaze meerut be only forty mile from delhus and the largest cantonment in indium there be three regiment of sepoy two of infantry and one of cavalry but there be enough european to scatter four time the number namely a battalion of the sixtieth rifle a regiment of dragoon guard know as the carabineer two troops of horse-artillery and a light field-battery in spite of the presence of european there be more indication of excitement at meerut than at any other station in the northwest at meerut the story of the greased cartridge have be cap by the story of the bonedust and there be the same kind of incendiary fire the same lack of respect toward european officer and the same whisper resolve not to touch the cartridge as at barrackpur the station be command by general hewitt whose advance year unfitted he to cope with the storm which be burst upon hindustan the regiment of sepoy cavalry at meerut be strongly suspect of disaffection accordingly it be resolve to put the man to the test on may 6th it be parade in the presence of the european force and cartridge be serve out not the greased abomination from calcutta but the old one which have be use time innumerable by the sepoy and they father but the man be terrify and obstinate and eighty-five stand out and refuse to take the cartridge the offender be at once arrest and try by a court-martial of native officer they be find guilty and sentence to various period of imprisonment but recommend for mercy general hewitt see no grounds for mercy excepting in the case of eleven young trooper and on Saturday may 9th the sentence be carry out the man be bring on parade strip of they uniform and load with iron they implore the general for mercy and find it hopeless begin to reproach they comrade but no one dare to strike a blow in the presence of loaded cannon and rifle at last the prisoner be carry off and place in a jail not under european soldier but a native guard the military authority at meerut seem to have be under a spell the next day be Sunday may 10th and the hot sun rise with its usual glare in the indian sky the european barracks be at a considerable distance from the native line and the intervene space be cover with shop and house surround by tree and garden consequently the european in the barracks know nothing of what be go on in the native quarter meanwhile there be commotion in the sepoy line and neighbor bazaar the sepoy be taunt by the loose woman of the place with permit they comrade to be imprison and fetter at the same time they be smite with a mad fear that the european soldier be to be let loose upon they the european at meerut saw and hear nothing nothing be note on that Sunday morning except the absence of native servant from many of the house and that be suppose to be accidental morning service be follow by the midday heat and at five o'clock in the afternoon the european be again prepare for church suddenly there be a alarm of fire follow by a volley of musketry discordant yell the clattering of cavalry and the bugle sound a alarm the sepoy have work themselves up to a frenzy of excitement the prisoner be release with a host of jailbird the native infantry join the native cavalry and the colonel of one of the regiment be shoot by the sepoy of the other inspire by a wild fear and fury the sepoy run about murder or wound every european they meet and set house on fire amid deafening shout and uproar meanwhile there be fatal delay in turn out the european the rifle be parade for church and time be lose in get arm and serve out ball cartridge the carabineer be absurdly put through a roll-call and then lose they way among the shop and garden meanwhile european officer be be butcher by the infuriate sepoy man and woman be fire at or sabr while hurry back in a panic from church flaming house and crash timber be fill all heart with terror and the shades of evening be fall upon the general havoc and turmoil when the european reach the native line and find that the sepoy have go no one know whither the truth be soon tell the mutiny have become a revolt the sepoy be on the way to delhi to proclaim the old mogul as sovereign of hindustan and there be no gillespie to gallop after they and crush the revolt at its outset as have be do at vellore half a century before one thing however be do there be no european regiment at delhus nothing but three regiment of sepoy infantry and a battery of native artillery the station be command by brigadier grave and there be no european under he order except the officer and sergeant attach to the three native corps accordingly telegram be send to brigadier grave to tell he that the mutineer be on they way to delhi Monday at delhus be worse than the Sunday at meerut the british cantonment be situate on a rise ground about two mile from the city which be know as the ridge the great magazine contain immense store of ammunition be situate in the heart of the city one of the three sepoy regiment be on duty in the city the other two remain in the cantonment on the ridge the approach to delhi from meerut be defend by the little river hindun which be span by a small bridge it be propose to procure two cannon from the magazine and place they on the bridge but before this could be do the rebel cavalry from meerut be see cross the river and be subsequently follow by the rebel infantry the magazine remain in charge of lieutenant willoughby of the bengal artillery he be associate with two other officer and six conductor and sergeant the rest of the establishment be compose entirely of native brigadier grave do he best to protect the city and cantonment until the arrival of the expect european from meerut indeed throughout the morning and greater part of the afternoon everyone in delhus be expect the arrival of the european brigadier grave order all the non-military resident include woman and child to repair to flagstaff tower -- a round building of solid brickwork at some distance from the city late detachment of sepoy be send from the ridge to the cashmere gate under the command of they european officer to help the sepoy on duty to maintain order in the city presently the rebel troops from meerut come up accompany by the insurgent rabble of delhus the english officer prepare to charge they and give the order to fire but some of the sepoy refuse to obey or only fire into the air the english officer hold on expect the european soldier from meerut the sepoy hesitate to join the rebel out of dread of the come european at last the delhus sepoy throw in they lot with the rebel and shoot down they own officer the revolt spread throughout the whole city and the suspense of the english on the ridge and at flagstaff tower begin to give way to the agony of despair suddenly at four o'clock in the afternoon a column of white smoke arise from the city and a explosion be hear far and wide willoughby and he eight associate have hold out to the last waiting and hope for the come of the european they have close and barricade the gate of the magazine and they have post six-pounder at the gate load with double charge of grape and lay a train to the powder-magazine messenger come in the name of bahadur shah to demand the surrender of the magazine but no answer be return the enemy approach and raise ladder against the wall while the native establishment escape over some shed and join the rebel at this crisis the gun open fire round after round of grape make fearful havoc on the mass of humanity that be heave and surge round the gate at last the ammunition be exhaust no one could leave the gun to bring up more shoot the mutineer be pour in on all side lieutenant willoughby give the signal conductor scully fire the train and with one tremendous upheaval the magazine be blow into the air together with fifteen hundred rebel not one of the gallant nine have expect to escape willoughby and three other get away scorch maim bruise and nearly insensible but scully and he comrade be never see again willoughby die of he injury six week afterward while indium and europe be ring with he name still more terrible and treacherous be the tragedy enact at cawnpore a city situate on the gange about fifty-five mile to the southwest of lucknow cawnpore have be in the possession of the english ever since the beginning of the century and for many year be one of the most important military station in indium but the extension of the british empire over the punjab have diminish the importance of cawnpore and the last european regiment quarter there have be remove to the northwest at the close of the previous year in may 1857 there be four native regiment at cawnpore numbering thirty-five hundred sepoy there be no european whatever except the regimental officer and sixty-one artilleryman to these be add small detachment of european soldier which have be send in the hour of peril from lucknow and benare during the month of may the station of cawnpore be command by sir hugh wheeler a distinguished general in the company 's service who be verge on he seventieth year he have spend fifty-four year in indium and have serve only with native troops he must have know the sepoy better than any other european in indium he have lead they against they own countryman under lord lake against foreigner during the afghan war and against sikh during both campaign in the punjab the news of the revolt at meerut throw the sepoy into a ferment at every military station in hindustan rumor of mutiny or come mutiny form almost the only topic of conversation yet in nearly every sepoy regiment the european officer put faith in they man and fondly believe that though the rest of the army might revolt yet they own corps would prove faithful such be eminently the case at cawnpore yet general wheeler seem to have know better while the european officer continue to sleep every night in the sepoy line the veteran make he preparation for meet the come storm european combatant be very few at cawnpore but european _ impediment _ be very heavy besides the wife and family of the regimental officer of the sepoy regiment there be a large european mercantile community moreover while the thirty-second foot be quarter at lucknow the wife family and invalid of the regiment be live at cawnpore it be thus necessary to secure a place of refuge for this miscellaneous multitude of european in the event of a rising of the sepoy accordingly general wheeler pitch upon some old barracks which have once belong to a european regiment and he order earthwork to be throw up and supplies of all kind to be store in order to stand a siege unfortunately there be fatal neglect somewhere for when the crisis come the defence be find to be worthless while the supplies be insufficient for the besiege all this while the adopted son of the former _ peshwa _ -lrb- footnote : formerly a chief of the mahratta -- ed -rrb- be live at bithoor about six mile from cawnpore he real name be dandhu panth but he be better know as nana sahib the british government have refuse to award he the absurd life pension of eighty thousand pound sterling which have be grant to he nominal father but he have inherit at least half a million from the ex-peshwa and he be allow to keep six gun to entertain as many follower as he please and to live in half royal state in a castellated palace at bithoor he continue to nurse he grievance with all the pertinacity of a mahratta but at the same time he profess a great love for european society and be profuse in he hospitality to english officer he be popularly know as the raja of bithoor when the news arrive of the revolt at meerut on may 10th nana be loud in he profession of attachment to the english he engage to organize fifteen hundred fight man to act against the sepoy in the event of a outbreak on may 21st there be a alarm european woman and family with all european non-combatant be remove into the barracks and general wheeler actually accept from nana the help of two hundred mahratta and two gun to guard the treasury the alarm however soon blow over and nana take up he abode at the civil station of cawnpore as a proof of the sincerity of he profession at last on the night of June 4th the sepoy regiment at cawnpore break out in mutiny they be drive to action by the same mad terror which have be manifest elsewhere they care nothing for the mogul nothing for the pageant king at delhus but they have be panic-stricken by extravagant story of come destruction it be whisper among they that the parade-ground be undermine with powder and that hindu and mahometan be to be assemble on a give day and blow into the air intoxicate with fear and _ bhang _ they rush out in the darkness yell shooting and burning accord to they wont and when they excitement be somewhat spend they march off toward delhus sir hugh wheeler could do nothing he might have retreat with the whole body of european from cawnpore to allahabad but there have be a mutiny at allahabad and moreover he have no means of transport subsequently he hear that the mutineer have reach the first stage on the road to delhi and consequently he see no ground for alarm meanwhile the brain of nana sahib have be turn by wild dream of vengeance and sovereignty he think not only to wreak he malice upon the english but to restore the extinct mahratta empire and reign over hindustan as the representative of the forget peshwa the stampede of the sepoy to delhus be fatal to he mad ambition he overtake the mutineer dazzle they with fable of the treasure in wheeler 's intrenchment and bring they back to cawnpore to carry out he vindictive and visionary scheme at early morning on Saturday June 6th general wheeler receive from nana a letter announce that he be about to attack the intrenchment the veteran be take by surprise but at once order all the european officer to join the party in the barracks and prepare for the defense but the mutineer be in no hurry for the advance they prefer booty to battle and turn aside to plunder the cantonment and city murder every christian that come in they way not spare the house of they own countryman they appropriate all the cannon and ammunition in the magazine by way of preparation for the siege but some be wise enough to desert the rebel army and steal to they home with they ill-gotten spoil about noon the main body of the mutineer swell by the numerous retainer of nana get they gun into position and open fire on the intrenchment for nineteen day -- from June 6th to the 25th -- the garrison struggle manfully against a rake fire and fearful odds amid scene of suffering and bloodshed that can not be recall without a shudder it be the height of the hot weather in hindustan a blaze sun be burn over the head of the besiege and to add to they misery one of the barracks contain the sick and wound be destroy by fire the besieger however in spite of they overwhelming number be utterly unable to carry the intrenchment by storm but continue to pour in a rake fire meanwhile the garrison be starve from want of provision and hamper by a multitude of helpless woman and child indeed but for the latter contingency the gallant band would have rush out of the intrenchment and cut a way through the mob of sepoy or perish in the attempt as it be they could only fight on wait for reinforcement that never come until fever sunstroke hunger madness or the

protection of the english naturally flock for refuge to the stronghold of they old master the english who have be lord of hindustan ever since the beginning of the century have be closely besiege in the residency at lucknow ever since the final outbreak of may 30th for nearly two month the garrison have hold out with a dauntless intrepidity while confidently wait for reinforcement that seem never to come never surrender have be from the first the passionate conviction of sir henry lawrence and the massacre at cawnpore on June 27th impressed every soldier in the garrison with a like resolution

may 11th all political interest be centre at the ancient capital of the sovereign of hindustan the public mind be occasionally distract by the current of event at cawnpore and lucknow as well as at other station which need not be particularize but so long as delhus remain in the hand of the rebel the native prince be bewilder and alarm and its prompt recapture be deem of vital importance to the prestige of the british government and the reestablishment of british sovereignty in hindustan the great mogul have be little better than a mummy for more than half a century and bahadur shah be a mere tool and puppet in the hand of rebel sepoy nevertheless the british government have to deal with the astounding fact that the rebel be fight under he name and standard just as afghan and mahratta have do in the day of ahmed shah duranus and mahadajus sindhium to make matter worse the road to delhus be open from the south and east and nearly every outbreak in hindustan be follow by a stampede of mutineer to the old capital of the mogul meanwhile in the absence of railway there be unfortunate delay in bring up troops and gun to stamp out the fire of rebellion at the head center the highway from calcutta to delhus be block up by mutiny and insurrection and every european soldier send up from calcutta be stop for the relief of benare allahabad cawnpore or lucknow but the possession of the

blessing they enjoy under british rule they be stanch to the british government and eager to be lead against the rebel in some case terrible punishment be mete out to mutinous bengal sepoy within the punjab but the imperial interest at stake be sufficient to justify every severity although all must regret the painful necessity that call for such extreme measure on June 8th about a month after the revolt at delhus sir henry barnard take the field at alipur about ten mile from the rebel capital he defeat a advance division of the enemy and then march to the ridge and reoccupy the old cantonment which have be abandon on may 11th so far it be clear that the rebel be unable to do anything in the open field although they might fight bravely under cover they number about thirty thousand strong

terraced house mosque and other building and john nicholson the hero of the day while attempt to storm a narrow street near the kabul gate be strike down by a shot and mortally wound then follow six day of desperate warfare no quarter be give to man with arm in they hand but woman and child be spare and only a few of the peaceable inhabitant be sacrifice during the storm on September 20th the gate of the old fortified palace of the mogul be break open but the royal inmate have flee no one be leave but a few wounded sepoy and fugitive fanatic the old king bahadur shah have go off to the

in a public place for all man to see thus fall the imperial city capture by the army under brigadier wilson before the arrival of any of the reënforcements from england the loss be heavy from the beginning of the siege to the close the british army at delhus have nearly four thousand kill and wound the casualty on the side of the rebel be never estimate two body of sepoy break away from the city and flee down the valley of the jumna and gange follow by two fly column under brigadier greathe and shower but the great mutiny and revolt at delhus have be stamp out and the flag of england wave triumphantly over the capital of hindustan the capture of delhus in September 1857 be the turning-point in the sepoy mutiny the revolt be crush beyond redemption the rebel be deprive of they head center and the mogul king be a prisoner at the mercy of the power whom he have defy but there be still trouble in indium lucknow be still beleaguer by a rebel army and insurrection still run riot in oudh and rohilkhand in the middle of August general havelock have fall back on cawnpore after the failure of he first campaign for the relief of lucknow five week afterward havelock make a second

of delhus outram join havelock and neill at cawnpore with fourteen hundred man as senior officer he might have assume the command but with generous chivalry the bayard of indium waive he rank in honor of havelock on September 20th general havelock cross the gange into oudh at the head of twenty-five hundred man the next day he defeat a rebel army and put it to flight while four of the enemy 's gun be capture by outram at the head of a body of volunteer cavalry on the 23d havelock route a still larger rebel force which be strongly post at a garden in the suburb of lucknow know as the alumbagh he then halt to give he soldier a day 's rest on the 25th he be cut he way through the street and lane of the city of lucknow -- run the gauntlet of a deadly and unremitting fire from the house en both side of the street and also from gun which command they on the evening of the same day he enter the british intrenchment but in the moment of victory a chance shot carry off the gallant neill the defense of the british residency at lucknow be a glorious episode in the national annals the fortitude of the beleaguered garrison be the admiration of the world the woman nurse the wound and perform every womanly duty with self-sacrificing heroism and when the fight be over they receive the well-merited thanks of she majesty queen victorium during four long month the garrison have know nothing of what be go on in the outer world they be aware of the advance and retreat of havelock and that be all at last on September 23d they hear the booming of the gun at the alumbagh on the morning of the 25th they could see something of the grow excitement in the city the people abandon they house and fly across the river still the gun of the rebel keep up a heavy cannonade upon the residency and volley of musketry continue to pour upon the besiege from the loophole of the besieger but soon the firing be hear from the city the welcome sound come nearer and nearer the excitement of the garrison grow beyond control presently the relieve force be see fight its way toward the residency then the pent-up feeling of the garrison burst forth in deafening cheer and wound man in hospital crawl out to

with tear roll down they cheek and thank god that they have come in time to save they from the fate of the sufferer at cawnpore thus after a siege of nearly four month havelock succeed in relieve lucknow but it be a reenforcement rather than a relief and be confine to the british residency the siege be not raise and the city of lucknow remain two month longer in the hand of the rebel sir jame outram assume the command but be compel to keep on the defensive meanwhile reinforcement be arrive from england in November sir colin campbell reach cawnpore at the head of a considerable army he

position cut he way to the residency and at last bring away the beleaguered garrison with all the woman and child but not even then could he disperse the rebel and reoccupy the city accordingly he leave outram at the head of four thousand man in the neighborhood of lucknow and then return to cawnpore on November 24th the day after leave lucknow general havelock be carry off by dysentery and bury in the alumbagh he death spread a gloom over indium but by this time he name have become a household word wherever the english language be speak in the hour of surprise and panic as successive

of italy and it be the aim of victor emmanuel king of sardinium to throw off this hinderance to italian liberty and union it be the opinion of count cavor victor emmanuel 's minister that by act with the ally against russium sardinium would increase she prestige with the european power and thereby promote the movement for independence the success of the ally in the crimean war confirm the prescience of cavor napoleon iii wish to secure for france supremacy in southern europe in 1855 he inquire of the sardinian minister what can i do for italy the crimean war end with the treaty of pari in 1856 at the congress which conclude that peace cavor present the case of italy against austrium not long after this it become evident that napoleon be prepare to espouse the italian cause in 1858 it be agree that he should do this sardinium now prepare for war austrium send a ultimatum demand a reduction of the sardinian army to a peace footing this demand be refuse in January 1859 austria

this attitude as long as it be possible to hold back from the actual conflict cavor insist that austrium must be the aggressive party for in the treaty with napoleon iii it have be stipulate that france would come to the help of sardinium only in case of the latter be attack by austrium hence cavor be oblige to seek every means of put he country into the attitude of the provoke party how many disappointment uncertainty and anxiety crowd those day from February to the end of April 1859 in order to understand the enormous difficulty overcome by cavor it would be necessary to follow literally day by day the history of that period in march he repair to pari to ascertain napoleon 's action : it be too evident however that french public opinion be unfavorable to war and the emperor be waver russium and england suggest that the question should be solve by a congress to which proposal napoleon iii accede : cavor now believe all be lose since sardinium could not refuse without put herself in the wrong fortunately the difficulty be solve by austrium boldly insist that sardinium should disarm before be represent at the congress and on April 23d this demand be enforce by a ultimatum to be answer within three day now ensue a genuine declaration of hostility and most joyfully do victor emmanuel make the follow announcement to he troops : soldier austrium who mass she army on we frontier and threaten to invade we country because liberty and order rule there because concord and affection between sovereign and people -- and not force -- sway the state because there the anguished cry of oppressed italy be listen to -- austrium dare to tell we who be arm only in we own defense to lay down those arm and put ourselves in she power such a outrageous suggestion surely merit a condign response and i have indignantly refuse she request i announce this to you in the certainty that you will make the wrong do to you king and to you nation you own hence mine be a proclamation of war : arm yourselve therefore in readiness for it you will be confront by a ancient enemy who be both valiant and disciplined but against whom you need not fear to measure you strength for you may remember with pride goito pastrengo santa lucium sommacampagna and above all custozza where four brigade fight for three day against the enemy 's five _ corps d'armée _ i will be you leader you prowess in action have already be test in the past and when fight under my magnanimous father i myself proudly recognize you valor i be convince that on the field of honor and glory you will know how to justify as well as to augment you military renown you will have as comrade those intrepid french troops -- the conqueror in so many distinguished campaign -- with whom you fight side by side at tchernaya whom napoleon iii always prompt to further the defense of a righteous cause and the victory of civilization generously send in great number to we aid march then confident of success and wreathe with fresh laurel that standard which rally from all quarter the flower of italian youth to its threefold color point out you task of accomplish that righteous and sacred enterprise -- the independence of italy wherein we find we war-cry the austrian army to the number of one hundred seventy thousand man -- besides those remain in the lombardo-venetian fortress -- be command by general gyulaus the successor of radetzky who have die the year before at the age of ninety-one gyulaus mean to attack and rout the sardinian army before it could join its french ally on April 29th he cross the ticino then spread out he force along the sesium he reconnoitr as far as chivasso these district abound in cultivate rice-field and be intersect by many canal : it be therefore easy by flood the ground to hinder the march of the austrian troops on turin meanwhile the sardinian army compose of sixty thousand man await the arrival of the french force on the right bank of the po on may 12th napoleon iii already precede into italy by one hundred twenty thousand of he man debark at genoa and on the 14th be at alessandrium where near the mouth of the tanaro the ally army meet the austrian troops cover a long tract from novara to vercellus then extend down the line of the sesium as far as the po and thence reach the mouth of the tanaro gyulaus see the enemy concentrate on the right bank of the po believe that napoleon iii intend cross that river in the direction of piacenza -- as napoleon i have cross in 1796 -- and so mass he troops to the south at this juncture a portion of he army encounter the french and sardinian at montebello where the extreme right wing of the ally be post the austrian general meet with such a determine resistance that he imagine this must be the center of the enemy and feel convinced that he have guess the latter 's intention he therefore cause he army to pursue its march southward by this movement vercellus be abandon by the austrian and it be immediately reoccupy by the sardinian napoleon now prepare a bold flank movement by leave the po for the ticino and to mask this maneuver order the sardinian to make a advance thus while victor emmanuel at the head of he man fling himself from vercellus on palestro -- merit by the skill of he military tactic the acclamation of a regiment of zouave whom he head as corporal -- the french take ad vantage of the alessandrium casale and novara railway make for the bridge of buffalora over the ticino only then do gyulai perceive this clever stratagem which throw lombardy open to the ally and he be consequently oblige to cross the ticino to block the enemy 's way to milan on June 4th at magenta nearly the whole of the austrian army engage the french force the battle which be most desperate last all day and be remarkable for the prodigy of valor perform the austrian drive back into magenta itself maintain even in that village such a stout resistance that they have to be dislodge by house-to-house fighting on June 8th victor emmanuel and napoleon iii make they triumphal entry into milan -- now free from the austrian yoke on the same day a french corps repulse the austrian at melegnano while garibaldus enter bergamo from the other side garibaldus who have be the last to leave lombardy in 1848 be now the first to set foot in its territory in 1859 since may 23d he have lead he own cacciatorus to the lombard shore of lake maggiore have defeat the austrian at varese enter como route the enemy afresh at san fermo and be now proceed to bergamo and brescium with the intention of reach the trentine alp to cut off the enemy 's retreat after the battle of magenta gyulaus have be dismiss from the command and he post be assume by the emperor franci joseph himself assist by the aged marshal hess on the night of June 23d the retreat austrian cross the mincio but a few hour after retrace they step and take up they position on the hill to the south of the lake of garda on the morning of the 24th the franco-sardinian army begin they march at dawn and shortly afterward to they great amazement encounter the austrian who they imagine have cross the mincio the night before the struggle be terrible in fact the line cover by the fighting extend a distance of five league a series of hill dominate by solferino and san martino form the position the franco-sardinian army have to assail the french contest solferino with the austrian and after a hotly disputed battle of more than twelve hour succeed in occupy it the sardinian lead by victor emmanuel make a violent assault on san martino four time in succession do they take it only to lose it again but the fifth time they make themselves master of it for good and all by six o'clock in the evening the strength of the austrian army be everywhere break just then a frightful hurricane herald by cloud of dust and accompany by torrent of rain burst over the two army and thus favor the flight of the austrian battalion napoleon iii now fix he headquarters at cavriana in the same house that franci joseph have tenant during the action on that vast battlefield the combatant have number three hundred thousand man -- one hundred sixty thousand austrian and one hundred forty thousand french and sardinian -- of all these after that sanguinary struggle twenty-five thousand be leave dead or wound after a few day ' rest the franco-sardinian army cross the mincio and besiege peschiera now there seem a chance of the italian fulfil the hope they have so long cherish of expel the foreigner they confidently await news of fresh feat of arm in the quadrilateral and of the success of the fleet send by france and sardinium into adriatic water but instead come the most unexpected tiding imaginable on July 8th napoleon iii have meet franci joseph and three day later the preliminary of peace be sign at villafranca by this treaty austrium be to cede lombardy to napoleon who be to relegate it to sardinia the italian state be to be amalgamate into a confederation under the presidency of the pope but venice though form part of this same confederation be to remain under austrian rule great indeed be the mortification of all italy on hear such term of peace announce cavor who have devote all he marvellous talent to realize the ideal of national redemption and have believe he end so nearly attain hasten to he prince and in a melancholy interview advise he not to accept such condition but victor emmanuel although it cause he very heart to bleed sign the treaty add these word : i approve as far as i myself be concerned whereupon cavor send in he resignation what be the motive that have induce napoleon to break he lately make promise of free italy from the alp to the adriatic there be many reason which influence he : the sight of that immense battlefield strew with the body of the slay the determine resistance of the austrian soldier the difficulty which would have to be face in the quadrilateral the hostile attitude of prussium be all motive which combine to sway the french emperor 's mind but there be also another reason which count for much napoleon have be draw into this campaign without really know the state of italian public opinion he wish italy to be free from the alp to the adriatic but do not want italian unity rather do he desire the formation of a confederacy wherein france could always make she own predominance feel in the peninsula scarcely have he arrive in italy when he be force to see that italian ideal be very different from what he have imagine they to be trial have but ripen the virtue of prudence and wisdom in man 's mind : in 1859 the people be little likely to repeat the blunder of 1848 or 1849 and there be now no longer discussion over form of government but everywhere a unanimous resolve to rally round the liberal monarchy of savoy on the first proclamation of the war the grand duke of tuscany have be compel to fly from he state -lrb- April 27th -rrb- napoleon have imagine that in this province -- the ancient stronghold of italian municipalism -- it would be easy to form a new kingdom with a bonaparte to wear its crown with this aim in view the fifth french army corps command by prince jerome napoleon have debark at leghorn under the pretext of organize the military force of central italy and harass the austrian on the extreme left but the tuscan soon divine the real intention of the french and the provisional government in florence previously institute under bettino ricasolus suddenly avow its intention of unite tuscany to sardinium whereupon prince napoleon see the true attitude of the country find it advisable to affect to promote the annexation the duchy of parma and modena have also be desert by they duke and the papal legate have to quit romagna whose inhabitant now suddenly announce they fusion with sardinium indeed this impulse for annexation now begin to spread and to the cry of victor emmanuel the march and umbrium revolt against the pontiff but in these region the movement be sanguinarily suppress by the swiss troops napoleon iii be displeased to note how all italian aspiration tend to unity and thus it be that he have sign the treaty of villafranca peace be conclude at zurich in the November follow and there the idea of a italian confederation be moot afresh the fugitive prince ought to have return to they state but how be it possible they certainly could not hope to be recall by they subject for the latter have expel they occupy they kingdom with troops of they own be out of the question because they have none foreign aid moreover be not to be look for since napoleon iii have establish the principle of non-intervention then the people of central italy show themselves capable of a bold political _ coup : _ under the leadership of bettino ricasolus dictator in tuscany and luigus carlo farinus -- who hold a similar office in emilium and romagna -- they declare by means of they assemble deputy they earnest desire to be incorporate with sardinium the new ministry form at turin after cavor 's resignation have pursue its way timidly fear to rouse the suspicion and displeasure of the european power but at this momentous and difficult juncture cavor again accept the premiership -lrb- January 20 1860 -rrb- he immediately give a bolder impetus to king victor emmanuel 's policy by send a note to all the power in which he assert it to be now impossible for sardinium to offer any resistance to the inevitable course of event cavor imagine that since napoleon iii have obtain the imperial throne by a plebiscite he would not deny the validity of such a claim in italy and forthwith submit this idea to the emperor who be bind to approve of it but the french nation be discontented imagine that the blood it have shed for italy have profit nothing and be moreover very averse to the formation of a powerful kingdom beyond the alp now it be that cavor determine on a great sacrifice in the convention of plombières it have be agree that in the event of a kingdom of eleven million inhabitant be establish from the alp to the adriatic sardinium would cede savoy to france as however by the treaty of villafranca venetium have remain under the austrian yoke no more have be say about cession of territory but by the annexation of central italy the number of victor emmanuel 's subject be now augmented to eleven million in order to induce napoleon iii to approve of such a annexation cavor offer he savoy but the emperor claim nice as well and the minister be oblige to accede to he demand on march 24 1860 savoy the cradle of the reign dynasty and nice garibaldus 's native province be cede to france garibaldus deeply wound in he tenderest feeling violently abuse cavor in parliament but the chamber although it respect the hero 's emotion ratify the treaty which be at this crisis a necessary concession at the same time parma modena romagna and tuscany express by universal suffrage they cordial desire for union with sardinium and a few day later the fusion of these province with the dominion of the house of savoy be a accomplished fact on April 2 1860 at the opening of the new parliament victor emmanuel could thus sum up the result already obtain by the nationalist party : in a very short space of time a invasion

1859 -rrb- darwin publish he origin of species charle robert darwin whatever may be say of the credit due to other scientist for investigation or discovery in natural selection the preeminence of darwin in this field be undisputed if of any scientific book it can be say that its appearance be epoch-making it be true of darwin 's work _ on the origin of species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favored race in the struggle for life _ not only do it command the earnest attention of the scientific and literary world but it awaken the interest of thoughtful person everywhere later research and criticism have modify the effect of he conclusion and lead to new result but the darwinian theory or darwinism still hold and seem likely long to maintain a central place in the history of modern scientific development charle robert darwin be bear at shrewsbury england February 12 1809 he be the grandson of erasmus darwin a eminent physician naturalist and poet who in 1794-1796 publish a important work entitle _ zoönomia or the law of organic life _ charle darwin be heir to a fortune and in youth the possession of ample means prevent he from take any deep interest in study for a profession although he do study medicine and later for the church but before reach he majority he turn to natural history at cambridge he enjoy a intimacy with the distinguished botanist professor john s henslow who quicken the young man 's enthusiasm for scientific investigation in he twenty-third year darwin go as naturalist with a government expedition to patagonia the voyage in the beagle -lrb- 1831-1836 -rrb- be continue round the world darwin 's journal of the expedition serve he in he later work and also furnished much material for popular information from 1842 when he go to reside at down in kent he devote himself wholly to a life of scientific research and write since it be not a uncommon error to confound natural selection with evolution it may be well to point out that while base on evolution darwinism be distinct from it evolution be the development of new organism through heredity variation and adaptation darwinism or the doctrine of natural selection as best define in these page by darwin himself be see to involve quite different factor from those of evolution as thus restricted for candor and childlike simplicity the writings of darwin be especially noteworthy among the modest utterance of great man and nowhere be these quality more strikingly reveal than in the follow account of the production of he principal work from September 1854 i devoted my whole time to arrange my huge pile of note to observe and to experiment in relation to the transmutation of species during the voyage of the beagle i have be deeply impress by discover in the pampean formation great fossil animal cover with armor like that on the exist armadillo secondly by the manner in which closely ally animal replace one another in proceed southward over the continent and thirdly by the south american character of most of the production of the galapago archipelago and more especially by the manner in which they differ slightly on each island of the group none of the island appear to be very ancient in a geological sense it be evident that such fact as these as well as many other could be explain only on the supposition that species gradually become modify and the subject haunt I but it be equally evident that neither the action of the surrounding condition nor the will of the organism -lrb- especially in the case of plant -rrb- could account for the innumerable case in which organism of every kind be beautifully adapt to they habit of life -- for instance a woodpecker or a tree-frog to climb tree or a seed for dispersal by hook or plume i have always be much strike by such adaptation and until these could be explain it seem to I almost useless to endeavor to prove by indirect evidence that species have be modify after my return to england it appear to I that by follow the example of lyell in geology and by collect all fact which bear in any way on the variation of animal and plant under domestication and nature some light might perhaps be throw on the whole subject my first note-book be open in July 1837 i work on true baconian principle and without any theory collect fact on a wholesale scale more especially with respect to domesticated production by print inquiry by conversation with skilful breeder and gardener and by extensive reading when i see the list of book of all kind which i read and abstracted include whole series of journal and transaction i be surprise at my industry i soon perceive that selection be the keystone of man 's success in make useful race of animal and plant but how selection could be apply to organism live in a state of nature remain for some time a mystery to I in October 1838 that be fifteen month after i have begin my systematic inquiry i happen to read for amusement malthus 's _ essay on the principle of population _ and be well prepare to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere go on from long-continued observation of the habit of animal and plant it at once strike I that under these circumstance favorable variation would tend to be preserve and unfavorable one to be destroy the result of this would be the formation of new species here then i have at last get a theory by which to work but i be so anxious to avoid prejudice that i determine not for some time to write even the briefest sketch of it in June 1842 i first allow myself the satisfaction of write a very brief abstract of my theory in pencil in thirty-five page and this be enlarged during the summer of 1844 into one of two hundred thirty page which i have fairly copy out and still possess but at that time i overlook one problem of great importance and it be astonishing to I except on the principle of columbus and he egg how i could have overlook it and its solution this problem be the tendency in organic being descend from the same stock to diverge in character as they become modify that they have diverge greatly be obvious from the manner in which species of all kind can be class under genus genus under family family under sub-order and so on and i can remember the very spot in the road while ride in my carriage that to my joy the solution occur to I and this be long after i have come to down the solution as i believe be that the modify offspring of all dominant and increasing form tend to become adapt to many and highly diversified place in the economy of nature early in 1856 lyell advise I to write out my view fully and i begin at once to do so on a scale three or four time as extensive as that which be afterward follow in my _ origin of species _ yet it be only a abstract of the material which i have collect and i get through about half the work on this scale but my plan be overthrow for early in the summer of 1858 alfred russel wallace who be then in the malay archipelago send I a essay _ on the tendency of variety to depart indefinitely from the original type _ and this essay contain exactly the same theory as mine mr wallace express the wish that if i think well of he essay i should send it to lyell for perusal the circumstance under which i consent at the request of lyell and hooker to allow of a abstract from my manuscript together with a letter to asa gray dated September 5 1857 to be publish at the same time with wallace 's essay be give in the _ journal of the proceedings of the linnean society _ 1858 i be at first very unwilling to consent as i think mr wallace might consider my do so unjustifiable for i do not then know how generous and noble be he disposition neither the extract from my manuscript nor the letter to gray have be intend for publication and they be badly write mr wallace 's essay on the other hand be admirably express and quite clear nevertheless we joint production excite very little attention and the only publish notice of they which i can remember be by professor haughton of dublin whose verdict be that all that be new in they be false and what be true be old this show how necessary it be that any new view should be explain at considerable length in order to arouse public attention in September 1858 i set to work by the strong advice of lyell and hooker to prepare a volume on the transmutation of species but be often interrupt by ill-health and short visit to doctor lane 's delightful hydropathic establishment at moor park i abstract the manuscript begin on a much larger scale in 1856 and complete the volume on the same reduce scale it cost I thirteen month and ten day ' hard labor it be publish under the title of the _ origin of species _ in November 1859 though considerably add to and correct in the later edition it have remain substantially the same book it be no doubt the chief work of my life it be from the first highly successful the first small edition of twelve hundred fifty copy be sell on the day of publication and a second edition of three thousand copy soon afterward sixteen thousand copy have now -lrb- 1876 -rrb- be sell in england and consider how stiff a book it be this be a large number it have be translate into almost every european tongue even into such language as spanish bohemian polish and russian it have also accord to miss bird be translate into japanese and be much study in that country even a essay on it have appear in hebrew show that the theory be contain in the old testament the review be very numerous for some time i collect all that appear on the _ origin _ and on my related book and these amount -lrb- exclude newspaper review -rrb- to two hundred sixty-five but after a time i give up the attempt in despair many separate essay and book on the subject have appear and in germany a catalogue or bibliography on darwinismus have appear every year or two the success of the _ origin _ may i think be attribute in large part to my have long before write two condensed sketch and to my have finally abstract a much larger manuscript which be itself a abstract by this mean i be enable to select the more striking fact and conclusion i have also during many year follow a golden rule namely whenever a publish fact a new observation or thought come across I which be oppose to my general result to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once for i have find by experience that such fact and thought be far more apt to escape from the memory than favorable one owe to this habit very few objection be raise against my view which i have not at least notice and attempt to answer it have sometimes be say that the success of the _ origin _ prove that the subject be in the air or that man 's mind be prepare for it i do not think that this be strictly true for i occasionally sound not a few naturalist and never happen to come across a single one who seem to doubt about the permanence of species even lyell and hooker though they would listen with interest to I never seem to agree i try once or twice to explain to able man what i mean by natural selection but signally fail what i believe be strictly true be that innumerable well-observed fact be store in the mind of naturalist ready to take they proper place as soon as any theory that would receive they be sufficiently explain another element in the success of the book be its moderate size and this i owe to the appearance of mr wallace 's essay have i publish on the scale in which i begin to write in 1856 the book would have be four or five time as large as the _ origin _ and very few would have have the patience to read it i gain much by my delay in publishing from about 1839 when the theory be clearly conceive to 1859 and i lose nothing by it for i care very little whether man attribute more originality to I or to wallace and he essay no doubt aid in the reception of the theory i be forestall in only one important point which my vanity have always make I regret namely the explanation by means of the glacial period of the presence of the same species of plant and of some few animal on distant mountain summit and in the arctic region this view pleased I so much that i write it out _ in extenso _ and i believe that it be read by hooker some year before edward forbe publish he celebrated memoir on the subject in the very few point in which we differ i still think that i be in the right i have never of course allude in print to my have independently work out this view hardly any point give I so much satisfaction when i be at work on the _ origin _ as the explanation of the wide difference in many class between the embryo and the adult animal and of the close resemblance of the embryo within the same class no notice of this point be take as far as i remember in the early review of the _ origin _ and i recollect express my surprise on this head in a letter to asa gray within late year several reviewer have give the whole credit to fritz mueller and haeckel who undoubtedly have work it out much more fully and in some respects more correctly than i do i have material for a whole chapter on the subject and i ought to have make the discussion longer for it be clear that i fail to impress my reader and he who succeed in do so deserve in my opinion all the credit this lead I to remark that i have almost without exception be treat honestly by my reviewer pass over those without scientific knowledge as not worthy of notice my view have often be grossly misrepresent bitterly oppose and ridicule but this have be generally do as i believe in good faith on the whole i do not doubt that my work have be repeatedly and greatly overpraise i rejoice that i have avoid controversy and this i owe to lyell who many year ago in reference to my geological work strongly advise I never to get entangled in a controversy as it rarely do any good and cause a miserable loss of time and temper whenever i have find out that i have blunder or that my work have be imperfect and when i have be contemptuously criticise and even when i have be overpraise so that i have feel mortified it have be my greatest comfort to say hundred of time to myself that i have work as hard and as well as i could and no man can do more than this i remember when in good success bay in terra del fuego thinking -lrb- and i believe that i write home to that effect -rrb- that i could not employ my life better than in add a little to natural science this i have do to the best of my ability and critic may say what they like but they can not destroy this conviction during the last two month of 1859 i be fully occupy in prepare a second edition of the _ origin _ and by a enormous correspondence on January 1 1860 i begin arrange my note for my work on the _ variation of animal and plant under domestication _ but it be not publish until the beginning of 1868 the delay have be cause partly by frequent period of illness one of which last seven month and partly by be tempt to publish on other subject which at the time interested I more my _ descent of man _ be publish in February 1871 as soon as i have become in the year 1837 or 1838 convinced that species be mutable production i could not avoid the belief that man must come under the same law accordingly i collect note on the subject for my own satisfaction but not for a long time with any intention of publishing although in the _ origin of species _ the derivation of any particular species be never discuss yet i think it best in order that no honorable man should accuse I of conceal my view to add that by the work light would be throw on the origin of man and he history it would have be useless and injurious to the success of the book to parade without give any evidence my conviction with respect to he origin but when i find that many naturalist fully accept the doctrine of the evolution of species it seem to I advisable to work up such note as i possess and to publish a special treatise on the origin of man i be the more glad to do so as it give I a opportunity of fully discuss sexual selection -- a subject which have always greatly interested I this subject and that of the variation of we domestic production together with the cause and law of variation inheritance and the intercrossing of plant be the sole subject which i have be able to write about in full so as to use all the material which i have collect the _ descent of man _ take I three year to write but then as usual some of this time be lose by ill-health and some be consume by prepare new edition and other minor work a second and largely correct edition of the _ descent _ appear in 1874 -lrb- 1860 -rrb- the kingdom of italy establish

of italian statesman napoleon wish to see a italian confederation with the pope at its head but this plan be reject sicily and naple in southern italy be still govern by a bourbon prince it be necessary to get rid of he but victor emmanuel do not desire another war the matter be decide through the action of garibaldus whose first step toward end the last remnant of bourbon rule in italy be a bold descend upon sicily this movement he make against the wish of cavor and in furtherance of the plan of young italy he own account of he landing at marsalum and of the battle of calatafimus -- regard by he as one of the most memorable in he military experience -- be as characteristic of garibaldus the man and writer as be he exploit characteristic of garibaldus the soldier the event that quickly follow garibaldus 's descent upon sicily mark the beginning of a new era in italian history after he victory at calatafimus garibaldus move toward palermo the capital on may 24th the bourbon troops of franci ii king of the two sicily march out of the city to meet he by shrewd tactic garibaldus outmaneuvre they on the 26th he march on palermo with about three thousand man and attack the city on the 27th the battle be a confused struggle of military and civilian many citizen of palermo arm with dagger knife spit and iron instrument of any kind take part in favor of garibaldus in the street-fighting that accompany the more regular conflict the city fall through revolt of the people and defection of the king 's troops rather than by the assault of garibaldus 's man twenty thousand

nineteenth century giuseppe garibaldus as we approach the western coast of sicily we begin to discover sailing-vessel and steamer on the roadstead of marsalum two men-of-war be anchor which turn out to be english have decide on landing at marsalum we approach that port and reach it about noon on enter the harbor we find it full of merchant-vessel of different nation fortune have indeed favor we and so guide we expedition that we could not have arrive at a more propitious moment the bourbon cruiser have leave the harbor of marsalum that morning sailing eastward while we be arrive from the west indeed they be still in sight toward cape san marco as we enter so that by the time they come within cannon-shot we have already land all the man out of the piemonte and be begin to debark those on board the lombardo the presence of the two english man-of-war in some degree influence the determination of the bourbon commander who be naturally impatient to open fire on we and this circumstance give we time to get we whole force on shore the noble english flag once more help to prevent bloodshed and i the benjamin of these lord of the ocean be for the hundredth time protect by they the assertion however make by we enemy that the english have directly favor and assist we landing at marsalum be inaccurate the british color fly from the two men-of-war and the english consulate make the bourbon mercenary hesitate and i might even say impressed they with a sense of shame at pour the fire of they impose battery into a handful of man arm only with the kind of musket usually supply by the government to italian volunteer notwithstanding this three-fourth of the volunteer be still on the quay when the bourbon begin firing on they with shell and grape-shot -- happily without injury to anyone the piemonte abandon by we be carry off by the enemy who leave the lombardo which have ground on a sand-bank the population of marsalum thunderstruck at this unexpected event receive we pretty well all thing consider the common people indeed be delighted the magnate welcome we under protest i think all this very natural those who be accustom to calculate everything at so much per cent be not likely to be reassure by the sight of a few desperado who wish to ameliorate a corrupt society by eradicate from it the cancer of privilege and falsehood especially when these desperado few as they be and with neither three-hundred-pounders nor ironclad fling themselves against a power believe to be gigantic like that of the bourbon man of high rank -- that be the privileged class -- before risk anything in a enterprise wish to assure themselves which way the wind of fortune blow and where the large battalion be and then the victorious force may be certain of find they compliant cordial and even enthusiastic if need be be not this the history of human selfishness in every country the poor people on the other hand welcome we with applause and with unmistakable token of affection they think of nothing but the sacredness of the sacrifice the difficult and noble task undertake by that handful of gallant young fellow who have come from such a distance to the succor of they brethren we pass the remainder of the day and the follow night at marsalum where i begin to profit by the service of crispus a honest and capable sicilian who be of the greatest use to I in government business and in make all necessary arrangement which my want of local knowledge prevent my do myself a dictatorship be speak of and i accept it without hesitation have always believe it the plank of safety in urgent case amid the breaker in which nation often find themselves on the morning of the 12th the thousand -lrb- footnote : garibaldus land with a force of one thousand volunteer -- ed -rrb- leave for salemus but the distance be too great for one _ étape _ we stop at the farm of mistretta where we pass the night we do not find the proprietor at home but a young man he brother do the honor with kindly and liberal hospitality at mistretta we form a new company under griziottus on the 13th we march to salemi where we be well receive by the people and be join by the company of sant ' anna d'alcamo and some other volunteer of the island on the 14th we occupy vita or san vito and on the 15th come in sight of the enemy who occupy calatafimus and know of we approach in that direction have spread out the great part of they force on the height call _ il pianto dei romani _ the dawn of may 15th find we in good order on the height of vita and a little later the enemy whom i know to be at calatafimus leave the city in column march toward we the hill of vita be confront by the height of the pianto dei romani where the enemy deploy he column on the calatafimi side these height have a gentle slope easily ascend by the enemy who cover all the highest point while on the vita side they be steep and precipitous occupy the opposite and southern height i have be able to perceive exactly all the position hold by the bourbonist while the latter could scarcely see the line of sharpshooter form by the genoese carbineer under mosto who cover we front all the other company be draw up _ en échelon _ behind they we scanty artillery be station on we leave on the highroad under orsinus who succeed in spite of the poverty of he resource in make a few good shot in this way both we and the enemy occupy strong position front each other and separate by a wide space of undulating ground break by a few farmsteading we advantage therefore clearly lay in await the enemy in we own position the bourbon force to the number of about two thousand with some cannon discover a few of we man without distinguish uniform and mingled with peasant boldly advance a few line of bersaglierus with sufficient support and two gun arrive within firing distance they open with carbine and cannon while advance on we the order give to the thousand be to wait without firing for the enemy to come up though the gallant ligurian already have one man kill and several wound the blare of the bugle sound a american _ reveille _ bring the enemy to a halt as if by magic they understand that it be not the picciottus alone they have to deal with and they line with the artillery give the signal for a retrograde movement this be the first time that the soldier of despotism have quail before the filibuster -- for such be the title with which we enemy honor we the thousand then sound a charge -- the genoese carbineer in the van follow by a choose band of youth impatient to come to close quarter the intention of the charge be to put to flight the enemy 's vanguard and get possession of the two gun -- a maneuver that be execute with a spirit worthy of the champion of italian liberty but i have no intention of a front attack on a formidable position occupy by a strong force of bourbon troops but who could stop those fiery and impetuous volunteer in they rush on the foe in vain the trumpet sound a halt we man do not hear or imitate nelson 's conduct at the battle of copenhagen they turn a deaf ear to the order to halt sound by the trumpet and with they bayonet drive the enemy 's van back on they main body there be not a moment to be lose or that gallant handful would have perish immediately a general charge be sound and the entire corps of the thousand accompany by some courageous sicilian and calabrese march at a quick pace to the rescue the enemy have abandon the plain but fall back on the height where they reserve be hold firm and defend they position with a dogged valor worthy of a better cause the most dangerous part of the ground we have to cross be the level valley separate we from the enemy where we have to face a storm of cannon - and musket-ball which wound a good many of we man arrive at the foot of monte romano we be almost sheltered from attack and at this point the thousand somewhat diminish in number close up to the vanguard the situation be supreme we be bind to win in this determination we begin to ascend the first ledge of the mountain under a hail of bullet i do not remember how many but there be certainly several terrace to be gain before reach the crest of the height and every time we climb from one terrace to the next -- during which operation we be totally unprotected -- we be under a tremendous fire the order give to we man to fire but few shot be well adapt to the wretched weapon present to we by the sardinian government which nearly always miss fire on this occasion too great service be render by the gallant genoese who be excellent shot and arm with good carbine sustain the honor of we cause this ought to be a encouragement to all young italian to exercise themselves in the use of arm in the conviction that valor alone be not enough on modern battlefield great dexterity in the use of weapon be also necessary calatafimus the survivor of a hundred battle if in my last moment my friend see I smile once more with pride it will be at the recollection of that fight -- for i remember none more glorious the thousand attire just as at home worthy representative of they people attack -- with heroic coolness fight they way from one formidable position to another -- the soldier of tyranny brilliant in gaudily trim uniform gold lace and epaulette and completely route they how can i forget that knot of youth who fear to see I wounded surround I press themselves closely together and shelter I with they body if while i write i be deeply touch at the recollection i have good reason be it not my duty at least to remind italy of those brave son of hers who fall there -- montanarus schiaffino sertorio nullo vigo tukery taddeus and many more whose name i grieve to say i can not remember as i have already say the southern slope of monte romano which we have to ascend be form of those ledge or narrow terrace use by the cultivator of the soil in mountainous country we make all possible haste to reach the bank of each terrace drive the enemy before we and then halt under cover of the bank to take breath and prepare for the attack proceeding thus we gain one ledge after another till we reach the top where the bourbon troops make a last effort defend they position with great intrepidity many of they chasseur who have come to the end of they ammunition even throw down stone on we at last we give the final charge the bravest of the thousand mass together under the last bank after take breath and measure with they eye the space yet to be traverse before cross sword with the enemy rush on like lion confident of victory and trusting in they sacred cause the bourbon force could not resist the terrible onset of man fight for freedom they flee and never stop till they reach the town of calatafimi several mile from the battlefield we cease we pursuit a short distance from the entrance to the town which be very strongly situate if one give battle one ought to be sure of victory this axiom be very true under all circumstance but especially at the beginning of a campaign the victory of calatafimus though of slight importance as regard acquisition -- for we take only one cannon a few rifle and a few prisoner -- have a immeasurable moral result in encourage the population and demoralize the hostile army the handful of filibuster without gold lace or epaulette who be speak of with such solemn contempt have route several thousand of the bourbon 's best troops artillery and all command by one of those general who like lucullus be ready to spend the revenue of a province on one night 's supper one corps of citizen -- not to say filibuster -- animated by love of they country can therefore gain a victory unaided by all this needless splendor the first important result be the enemy 's retreat from calatafimus which town we occupy on the follow morning may 16 1860 the second result and one abundantly noteworthy be the attack make by the population of partinicio borgetto montelepre and other place on the retreat army in every place volunteer company be form which speedily join we and the enthusiasm in the surround village reach its height the disbanded troops of the enemy do not stop till they reach palermo where they bring terror to the bourbon party and confidence to the patriot we wound and those of the enemy be bring in to vita and calatafimus among ours be some man who could ill be spare montanarus my comrade at rome and in lombardy be dangerously wound and die a few day after he be one of those whom doctrinaire call demagogue because they be impatient of servitude love they country and refuse to bow the knee to the caprice and vice of the great montanarus be a modenese schiaffino a young ligurian from camoglus who have also serve in the cacciatorus delle alpi and in the guide be among the first to fall on the field bereave italy of one of she bravest soldier he work hard on the night of we start from genoa and greatly assist bixio in that delicate undertaking de amicus also of the cacciatorus and guide be another who fall at the beginning of the battle not a few of the choose band of the thousand fall at calatafimus as we roman forefather fall -- rush on the enemy with cold steel cut down in front without a complaint without a cry except that of _ viva l'italia _ i may have see battle more desperate and more obstinately contest but in none have i see finer soldier than my citizen filibuster of calatafimus the victory of calatafimus be indisputably the decisive battle in the brilliant campaign of 1860 it be absolutely necessary to begin the expedition with some striking engagement such as this which so demoralize the enemy that they fervent southern imagination even exaggerate the valor of the thousand there be some among they who declare they have see the bullet of they carbine rebind from the breast of the soldier of liberty as if from a plate of bronze far more man be kill and wound at palermo milazzo and the volturno but still i believe calatafimus to have be the decisive battle after a fight like that we man know they be bind to win and the gallant sicilian whose courage have be previously shake by the impose number and superior equipment of the bourbon force be encourage when a battle begin with such prestige with omen draw from such a precedent victory be sure john webb probyn on June 27 1860 about three week after garibaldus have take possession of palermo franci ii solemnly announce he intention to give a constitution to the kingdom of the two sicily adopt the italian flag and ally himself with sardinium these promise only provoke the cry of too late they do but recall how often the neapolitan bourbon have promise in the hour of danger and prove faithless to every promise when the danger be pass victor emmanuel and he government be now both unable and unwilling to agree to any such term with a sovereign who have reject similar offer at the beginning of he reign when such a settlement be possible every friend of freedom feel that the time have go by for any common action between the house of savoy and bourbon each have take its own line of action and each be now to abide by the result garibaldus have overthrow the neapolitan rule in sicily and raise the cry of italy and victor emmanuel which find a hearty response have be so successful he now determine despite the warning of friendly adviser and the hostility of enemy to carry he force from sicily to the mainland and take possession of naple itself he be at the head of about twenty thousand man under the command of general medici bixio cosenz and turr he have also the prestige of victory mingle with a kind of legendary fame which continually increase these be formidable aid to further success especially when bring to bear on the fervid feeling and imagination of a southern people franci of naple still possess a army of eighty thousand man of which he despatch more than twenty thousand to arrest if possible the progress of he formidable opponent victor emmanuel seek to dissuade garibaldus from a enterprise so full of danger as that of march upon naple against the wish of the unite cabinet of continental europe the king desire that matter should proceed by negotiation the basis of which should be that neapolitan and sicilian should be allow to decide they future destiny for themselves garibaldus who love and trust the honest king reply that the actual state of italy compel he to disobey he majesty when say the noble-hearted patriot i shall have deliver the population from the yoke that weigh they down i will throw my sword at you foot and will then obey you for the rest of my life in truth italian of all rank be now so rouse that neither victor emmanuel cavor nor even garibaldus himself could have stay the movement the overpowering strength of foreign army could alone have put it down circumstance however happily prevent so gross a abuse of mere force for once italian be allow to do as they wish in they own country instead of be compel by foreign power to do as those power command many thing concur to bring about this result the french emperor have just receive savoy and nice he have be spend the blood and treasure of france in give the first blow to the old despotism of italy how could he now fly in the face of he own principle of the national will in order to save the worst of those despotism he could not declare that sicilian and neapolitan should not dare have the opportunity of do what he have at last permit in central italy and profit by in nice and savoy to have allow austrium to do so would be to stultify himself in the eye of europe to enrage italian and to lead france to ask what be the use of call on she to make sacrifice for the overthrow of austrian domination in the peninsula if within a few month that domination be to be in a large measure restore austrium too have she own difficulty to encounter and they be both numerous and complicated she military and priestly despotism have suffer defeat she people dislike its rule and desire freer institution she finances be terribly disorder the emperor be begin to see the necessity of a change of system -- a change by no means easy to effect -- for the hungarian be demand the restoration of they ancient constitutional rights russium and prussium contented themselves with protest which have it may be some diplomatic value but be wholly without practical effect england be favorable to the extension of italian liberty and france be she ally in syrium and in china so it be that garibaldus have only to encounter the naval and military force of franci ii cross the strait of messina land in calabrium and march on reggio on August 21st the town be occupy and the citadel with its commander and soldier capitulate another victory be gain on the 23d disperse the force of the neapolitan general melendez and brigantus some of they soldier join garibaldus the rest return to they home and increase both he real and he legendary fame by they account of he victory the insurrection against the bourbon dynasty be now rapidly spread at cosenza in calabrium and at potenza in the basilica provisional government be proclaimed and be hail with delight the progress of garibaldus the force of franci be disappear from those province and leave the road to naple unprotect the fleet be as little to be count on as the army in naple itself all be confusion and contradiction in the government none of its member trust the other or believe in the duration of the bourbon dynasty year of corruption tyranny falsehood and cruelty have undermine the whole system and it fall before the storm as if by magic franci ii determine to leave he capital when he order the troops which still remain faithful to he to retreat upon capua and gaeta two-third of the staff send in they resignation as do many of the officer of the neapolitan fleet the king address a protest to the foreign power in which he declare he only quit he capital to save it from the horror of a siege he issue a proclamation to he people in which he express he wish for they happiness and declare that when restore to he throne it would be all the more splendid from the institution he have now irrevocably give on September 6 1860 he leave the capital on board a steamer accompany by two spanish frigate and be take to gaeta on September 7th garibaldus enter naple at midday in a open carriage accompany by some of he staff for long hour he receive a welcome such as have seldom if ever be give to any other man again and again he have to appear on the balcony of the palazzo d'angrus where he have take up he quarter to receive the applause of the multitude at eight o'clock that evening it be at length announce that wear out with fatigue and emotion he have retire to rest a sudden quiet fall upon the vast crowd and repeat to one another we father sleep they disperse to they home they right hand raise above they head with the first finger alone extend a sign expressive of the cry reiterate again and again that day _ italium una _ -lrb- one italy -rrb- on September 10th garibaldus issue a proclamation to he soldier head italy and victor emmanuel in it the general call upon they to aid he in carry to a successful termination the work so well begin nor do he hesitate to declare that rome must be italian and the line of the alp the frontier of italy he address another proclamation to the people in which he especially call on they to be unite : the first need of italy be concord in order to realize the union of the great italian family to-day providence have give we this concord since all the province be unanimous and labor with magnanimous zeal at the national reconstruction as to unity providence have further give we victor emmanuel -- a model sovereign who will inculcate in he descendant the duty which they should fulfil for the happiness of a people who have choose he as they chief with enthusiastic homage the proclamation go on to speak with kindly warmth of those italian priest who have side with the national cause and declare that such conduct be a sure means of gain respect for they mission and work repeat again the demand for concord the conclude word justly protest against all foreign interference : finally -lrb- be it know -rrb- we respect the house of other but we insist upon be master in we own whether it please or displease the ruler of the earth garibaldus unite the neapolitan to the sardinian fleet so form a italian naval force he appoint a ministry comprise liborio romano -lrb- who have serve under franci ii -rrb- scialoium cosenz and pisanellus he then proceed to promulgate the sardinian constitution throughout the neapolitan province but the bourbon force be still in possession of capua and gaeta it become necessary therefore to undertake military operation against they meanwhile the agitation in the papal province be increase the pope 's government have refuse to modify its policy or agree to any reduction of its territory it accept the protection of france in rome and its immediate neighborhood but decline further aid as it be raise force of its own under a french general lamoricière these soldier be man of various european nationality belong to that roman catholic party which be determine to maintain intact the temporal rule of the pope as against the wish of the vast majority of italian themselves roman catholic who desire to substitute for that rule the constitutional sovereignty of king victor emmanuel the italian be willing enough to remain under the spiritual headship of the roman pontiff but they would not have a temporal power uphold by foreign soldier the moment be like many other a very critical one in the history of italy garibaldus be victorious in naple the papal force compose chiefly of german and french under lamoricière be hold the inhabitant of umbrium and the march who be longing to join the national movement indeed some of the most influential man of those province among other marqui filippo gualterio of orvieto have already come to turin to obtain the intervention of its government and protection from the papal troops whose foreign extraction render they odious to the people on September 7th count delium minerva be send to rome to demand on the part of victor emmanuel the disbandment of the foreign troops which the papal government have get together under the command of general lamoricière the demand be refuse this refusal the papal government be quite competent to give but whether its policy in uphold its temporal power by the aid of foreign mercenary be wise or not be another matter it be hardly to be expect that italian any more than frenchman german or english would endure such a state of thing if they could prevent it the government of turin now order its troops to enter the papal province of umbrium and the march on September \*\* nth general fantus cross the frontier easily take possession of perugium with the aid of the inhabitant and oblige colonel schmidt the papal commander to capitulate the general advance with equal success against spoleto and in a few day be master of all the upper valley of the tiber at the same time general cialdinus operate on the eastern side of the apennine march rapidly to meet general lamoricière 's force which he encounter and defeat completely at castelfidardo compelling the french general to fly to ancona which he enter in company with only a few horseman who have escape with he from the rout of the papal army the italian fleet be off ancona before which general cialdinus 's troops now appear thus completely prevent the escape of lamoricière who be oblige to surrender in less than three week the campaign be over the sardinian troops have thus occupy umbrium and the march proceed to cross into the neapolitan province and march upon capua and gaeta austrium prussium and russium protest against the course thus pursue by the government of victor emmanuel the pope excommunicate all who have participate in the invasion of he territory franci ii protest with no less earnestness the emperor of the french withdraw he minister from turin and blame the proceedings of victor emmanuel 's government but in other respects napoleon remain a passive spectator of all that occur and maintain the principle of non-intervention -- at least as regard umbrium and the march sicily and naple -- except at gaeta where he fleet prevent for a time any attack be make against that fortress from the sea he also raise the number of he troops in rome and the province in which it be situate call the patrimony of st peter to twenty-two thousand man this be now all the territory leave to the temporal power of the pope napoleon determine to preserve that much to the roman see defend it from the attack of garibaldus and forbid its annexation to the kingdom of italy the english government however decidedly vindicate the course take under the circumstance by victor emmanuel and he adviser lord russell who be secretary of foreign affair under lord palmerston write on October 27 1860 a admirable despatch to sir jame hudson the english minister at turin who be allow to give a copy of it to count cavor in that despatch lord russell give good reason for dissent from the view express by the government of austrium prussium russium and france he justify the action of the government of turin admit that italian themselves be the best judge of they own interest show how in time past they vainly attempt regularly and temperately to reform they government say such attempt be put down by foreign power and conclude by declare that she majesty 's government will turn they eye rather to the gratifying prospect of a people build up the edifice of they liberty and consolidate the work of they independence amid the sympathy and good wish of europe it be gratify to remember that at this very critical juncture in the cause of italian unity and independence the english government give its very cordial support to that cause and ably defend the course pursue by king victor emmanuel he minister and he people the cause of italian unity and independence have indeed make prodigious stride due not only to the marvellous victory of garibaldus which have bring he in four month from marsalum to naple but also to the skilful campaign of general fantus and cialdinus in umbrium and the march cavor now follow up these success by advise a course calculate to give they consistency and endurance he counsel the immediate assemble of parliament the acceptance by victor emmanuel of the sovereignty of the papal neapolitan and sicilian province if such be the will of they inhabitant and the departure of the king from turin to take the command of he troops now advance toward capua victor emmanuel entirely agree with he minister 's advice on October 2 1860 cavor ask parliament for full power to annex all the new province of central and southern italy if they desire it he contend that the event which have take place be due to the initiative of the people the noble audacity of general garibaldus and the constitutional rule of victor emmanuel unite to he devotion to the cause of italian freedom even those deputy who represent the view of the extreme leave some of whose member avow a preference for republicanism -- in theory at any rate -- support the government one of they signor bertanus declare he would not now raise any point of difference and frankly acknowledge that in reality all italian wish the same thing -- italy one and free under victor emmanuel cavor further satisfy the chamber by say that rome and venice must in the end be unite to the mother country though the question involve in such union must out of deference to europe and france be postpone for the present a vote of two hundred ninety against six confirm the policy of the government and give full expression to the wish of the country garibaldus have in the mean time push on he force from naple toward capua and the line of the river volturno on September 19th he troops take caiazzo from which however they be dislodge on the 23d of the month after this success franci ii determine to take the offensive and attack in force the garibaldian line with the object of drive they back to naple or cut they off from that city this attempt be well plan and conduct on October 1 1860 the struggle be hotly maintain on both side throughout the day some company of bersaglierus arrive from naple and unite in resist the attack of the bourbon troops who be in the end repel and compel to retire but though beat they have fight well and still hold the fortress of gaeta and capua to which they have retreat the army of victor emmanuel however lead by the king in person be now rapidly advance easily overcome whatever resistance the bourbon troops be able to offer francis ii unable to prevent the junction of the king 's force with those of garibaldus withdraw with the bulk of he soldier to gaeta leave four thousand man in capua who be soon oblige to capitulate on October 26th victor emmanuel and garibaldus meet near the little town of teano they greet each other with great cordiality for though garibaldus have little faith in minister or diplomatist and could not forgive they cession of nice to france he feel the utmost confidence in the king himself victor emmanuel on he part have the greatest regard for the heroic patriot who have ever be so devoted to he country 's cause and whose marvellous exploit have now give freedom to sicily and naple as they grasp each other 's hand garibaldus cry behold the king of italy long live the king the soldier of both leader shout long live victor emmanuel king of italy on November 7th the king enter naple with garibaldus at he side the reception be enthusiastic in the extreme it reach its culminate point as victor emmanuel enter the royal palace long have it be the abode of those who hate and betray both constitutional liberty and national freedom now it be take possession of by one who have risk life and crown in they cause the king issue a proclamation in which he call to mind the increase responsibility which fall henceforth upon himself and he people alike nor do he fail to remind they of the necessity for union and abnegation : all party must bow before the majesty of italy which god have raise up we must establish a government which give guarantee of liberty to the people and of severe probity to the public at large in the succeed day he majesty receive the deputation of the newly acquire province of umbrium the march naple and sicily which come to present to he officially the result of the plebiscite by which the inhabitant of those province declare they wish to be unite to the rest of the king 's dominion and so form a single kingdom of italy many other reception there be of society belong to several rank and class of man particularly impressive be the welcome give to the deputation which come from the senate and chamber at turin in honor of so great a event as the union of southern with northern italy under the constitutional rule of one sovereign on December 1st victor emmanuel embark for palermo where he be receive with a enthusiasm at least as great as that which mark he arrival in naple in the capital of sicily all order of citizen press forward to pay he they willing homage these great result be not however achieve without difficulty for there be considerable diversity of opinion and not a little jealousy between those that surround garibaldus and those that follow the lead of cavor in parliament and in the country nor can it be deny that fault and mistake may fairly be lay to the charge of both those party despite they sincere attachment to the cause of they common fatherland a mistake be make by garibaldus himself when he wish to postpone the immediate annexation of the southern province to the northern kingdom and ask to be name dictator of naple for two year by victor emmanuel whom he further request to dismiss cavor and he actual adviser the king rightly refuse to agree to a course so subversive of all constitutional proceedings and liberty he could not even entertain the idea of dismiss minister at the request of any citizen however illustrious or however great the service he have render he country it be for the national representative alone to decide to what minister the king should give he confidence and what course should be take as to the annexation of naple and sicily garibaldus 's good sense and honesty of purpose lead he to give in to the king 's judgment victor emmanuel take the right view of the course to be pursue in this matter just as he have take the right view of the course to be pursue at the moment of the peace of villafranca in the one case he show himself wiser than cavor and in the other wiser than garibaldus the single-minded patriotism of the latter and the statesmanship of the former combine with the remarkably sure judgment and unfailing honesty of the king gradually overcome all the difficulty of the situation victor emmanuel ever keep aloof from political coterie while defer to the advice of he responsible minister so long as they have the confidence of parliament he ever show himself to be the head of the nation not the head of a party he unswerving determination to be guide by the nation 's will as express by the nation 's choose representative though nothing new in he career win for he the absolute confidence of all italian not one of whom avow it more frankly than garibaldus himself but what shall be say of the popular hero spring from the rank of the people who have give a kingdom to he sovereign rarely if ever have history record nobler conduct than that of the conqueror of sicily and naple when have liberate those province he lay down all power refuse all honor turn away alike wealth and title to betake himself to he island home of caprera there to work with he own hand to rejoice as he think of how greatly he have advance the independence of italy and to pray for the hour of its completion whatever defect may be find in the character or judgment of this heroic patriot he name will assuredly be hold in grateful remembrance wherever man be find who love freedom and rejoice as they see its blessing spread more and more among the nation of the earth as garibaldus retire to he quiet abode in caprera victor emmanuel return to he duty in turin but neither the one nor the other forget rome and venice the siege of gaeta be now be carry forward with great determination the place be defend with courage and endurance by franci ii and he queen for a time the french fleet prevent the italian from attack gaeta by sea but when napoleon withdraw he ship further resistance become hopeless on February 13 1861 gaeta surrender after a defense of which those who take part in it have a right to be proud the garrison march out with the honor of war the officer retain they rank franci and he wife embark for terracina and go thence to rome where they be receive by the pope and lodge in the quirinal palace the citadel of messina and of civitella del tronto surrender soon after and so pass away forever the rule of the neapolitan bourbon over the kingdom of the two sicily no less than twenty-two million of italian be now unite under the sceptre of victor emmanuel who in accordance with the advice of he prime minister count cavor dissolve the parliament the new election take place at the end of January 1861 the constitution as establish in sardinium be put in force from turin to palermo at the same time the king nominate as suggest by he responsible adviser sixty new senator or member of the upper house they be select chiefly among the most prominent and influential man of the province of central and southern italy the election be everywhere favorable to the new order of thing namely the formation of the single kingdom of italy under the constitutional rule of victor emmanuel the majority of the new chamber give a hearty support to count cavor on February 18 1861 the first italian parliament represent all the province of italy -- venetium and the roman patrimony alone except -- assemble in the palazzo carignano at turin the title assume by the king in concert with he minister and parliament be victor emmanuel ii by the grace of god and the will of the nation king of italy -lrb- footnote : it be almost ten year later -- when victor emmanuel enter rome September 20 1870 -- that the emancipation and union of italy be make complete -- ed -rrb- -lrb- 1861 -rrb- emancipation of russian serf andrew d white and nikolai turgenieff by the act that free the serf in russium alexander ii to whom it be in great measure due obtain a place of unusual honor among the sovereign that have rule he nation it be the grand achievement of alexander 's reign and cause he to be hail as one of the world 's liberator the importance of this event in russian history be not diminish by the fact that its practical benefit have not as yet be realize to the full extent anticipate in 1888 stepniak the russian author and reformer declare that emancipation have utterly fail to realize the ardent expectation of its advocate and promoter have fail to improve the material condition of the former serf who on the whole be worse off than before emancipation the same assertion have be make with respect to the emancipation of slave in the united state but in neither case do the objection invalidate the historical significance of a act that formally liberate million of human being from hereditary and legalized bondage in the two view here present the subject of the emancipation in russium be consider in various aspect andrew d white 's account be that of a american scholar and diplomatist familiar with the history and people of russium through he residence at st petersburg be of peculiar value embody the most intelligent foreign judgment white 's synopsis cover the entire subject of the serf system from its begin to its overthrow nikolai turgenieff the russian historian write while the emancipation act be bear its first fruit describe its workings and effect as observe by one intimately connect with the serf and the movement that result in they freedom andrew d white close upon the end of the fifteenth century the muscovite idea of right be subject to the strong mind of ivan the great and compress into a code therein be embody the best process know to he land and time : for discover crime torture and trial by battle for punish crime the knout and death but hide in this tough mass be one law of greater import than other thereby be all peasant forbid to leave the land they be then till except during the eight day before and after st george 's day this provision spring from ivan 's highest view of justice and broadest view of political economy the noble receive it with plaudit which have find echo even in these day the peasant receive it with no murmur which history have find any trouble in drown just one hundred year later upon the muscovite throne as nominal czar sit the weakling feodor i but behind the throne stand as real czar hard strong bori godunoff look forward to feodor 's death bori make ready to mount the throne and he see -- what all other mayor of the palace climb into the place of _ faineant _ king have see -- that he must link to he fortune the fortune of some strong body in the nation he break however from the general rule among usurper -- bribe the church -- and determine to bribe the nobility the greatest grief of the muscovite noble seem to be that the peasant could escape from they oppression by the emigration allow on st george 's day bori see he opportunity : he cut off the privilege of st george 's day and the peasant be fix to the soil forever no russian law ever directly enslave the peasantry but through this decree of boris the lord who own the soil come to own the peasant just as he own its immovable boulder and ledge to this the peasant submit but history have not be able to drown they sigh over this wrong they proverb and ballad make st george 's day representative of all ill-luck and disappointment a few year later bori make another bid for oligarchic favor he issue a rigorous fugitive-serf law and even wrench liberty from certain free peasant who have enter service for wages before he edict this complete the work and russium which never have have the benefit of feudalism have now fasten upon she feudalism 's worst curse a serf caste bind to the glebe the great good thing do by peter the world know by heart the world know well how he tear he way out of the fetichism of he time how despite ignorance and unreason he drag he nation after he how he dower the nation with thing and thought that transform it from a petty asiatic horde to a great european power we be present a few year since when one of those lesser triumph of he genius be first unfold it be in that room at the hermitage -- adjoining the winter palace -- set apart for the relic of peter we companion be two man note as leader in american industry -- one famed as a inventor the other famed as a champion of inventor ' rights suddenly from the inventor pull over some old dust-covered machine in a corner come loud cry of surprise the cry be natural indeed in that heap of rubbish he have find a lathe for turn irregular form and a screw-cutting engine once use by peter himself : specimen of he unfinished work be still in they they have lie there unheed a hundred fifty year they principle have die with peter and he workman and not many year since they be reinvent in america and give they inventor fame and fortune at the late pari universal exposition crowd flock about a american lathe for copying statuary and that lathe be in principle identical with this old forget machine of peter 's yet though peter fight so well and think so well he make some mistake which hang to this day over he country as bitter curse for in all he plan and work to advance the mass of man be one supreme lack -- lack of any account of the worth and right of the individual man lesser example of this be see in he grim jest at westminster hall -- what use of so many lawyer i have but two lawyer in russium and one of those i mean to hang as soon as i return or when at berlin have be show a new gibbet he order one of he servant to be hang in order to test it or in he review of parade fight when he order he man to use ball and to take the button off they bayonet greater example be see in he battle of narva when he throw away a army to learn he opponent 's game in he building of st petersburg where in drain marsh he sacrifice a hundred thousand man the first year but the greatest proof of this great lack be show in he dealings with the serf system serfage be already recognize in peter 's time as a evil peter himself once storm forth in protestation and invective against what he stigmatize as sell man like beast separate parent from child husband from wife which take place nowhere else in the world and which cause many tear to flow he declare that a law should be make against it yet it be by he misguided hand that serfage be compacted into its final black mass of foulness for peter see other nation spin and weave and he determine that russium should at once spin and weave he see other nation forge iron and he determine that russium should at once forge iron he never stop to consider that what might cost little in other land as a natural growth might cost far too much in russium as a forced growth in lack then of quick brain and sturdy spine and strong arm of pay workman he force into he manufactory the flaccid muscle of serf these thus lift from the earth lose even the little force in the state they have before great body of serf thus become slave worse than that the idea of a serf develop toward the idea of a slave and peter misguided deal one blow more cold-blooded official be set at take the census these adopt easy classification free peasant serf and slave be often huddle into the list under a single denomination so serfage become still more difficult to be distinguish from slavery as this base of hideous wrong be thus widen and deepen the noble build higher and stronger they superstructure of arrogance and pretension not many year after peter 's death they so overawe the empress anne that she thrust into the code of the empire statute which allow the noble to sell serf apart from the soil so do serfage bloom fully into slavery but in the latter half of the eighteenth century russium gain a ruler from whom the world come to expect much to mount the throne catharine ii have murder she husband to keep the throne she have murder two claimant whose title be better than she own she then become with she agent in these horror a second messalina to set herself right in the eye of europe she pay eager court to that hierarchy of scepticism which in that age make or mar european reputation she flatter the fierce deist by own fealty to _ le rous _ voltaire she flatter the mild deist by call in la harpe as the tutor of she grandson she flatter the atheist by call in diderot as a tutor for herself she murder and orgy be soon forget in the new hope for russian regeneration she dealings with russium strengthen these hope the official style require that all person present petition should subscribe themselves you majesty 's humble serf this formulum she abolish and boast that she have cast out the word serf from the russian language poet and philosopher echo this boast over europe -- and the serf wait the great empress spur hope by another movement she propose to a academy the question of serf emancipation as a subject for they prize essay the essay be write and crown it be fill with beautiful thing about liberty practical thing about moderation flattering thing about the great catharine -- and the serf wait again she arouse hope it be give out that she most intense delight come from the sight of happy serf and prosperous village accordingly in she journey to the crimea potemkin squander million on million in rear pasteboard village in drag forth thousand of wretched peasant to fill they in costume they to look thrifty in train they to look happy catharine be rejoice europe sing paean -- the serf wait she seem to go further : she issue a decree prohibit the enslavement of serf but unfortunately the palace intrigue and the correspondence with the philosopher and the destruction of polish nationality leave she no time to see the edict carry out but europe applaud -- and the serf wait two year after this come a deed which put a end to all this uncertainty a edict be prepared order the peasant of little russium to remain forever on the estate where the day of publication should find they this be vile but what follow be diabolic court pet be let into the secret these by good promise entice host of peasant to they estate the edict be now spring in a hour the courtier be make rich the peasant be make serf and catharine ii be make infamous forever so about a century after peter a wave of wrong roll over russium that not only drown honor in the nobility but drown hope in the people as russium enter the nineteenth century the heart of earnest man must have sink within they for paul i catharine 's son and successor be infinitely more despotic than catharine and infinitely less restrain by public opinion he have be bear with savage instinct and educate into ferocity tyranny be write on he feature in he childhood if he remain in russium he mother sneer and show hatred of he if he journey in western europe crowd gather about he coach to jeer at he ugliness most of those who have see gillray 's caricature of he issue in the height of english spite at paul 's homage to bonaparte have think it hideously overdrawn but those who have see the portrait of paul in the cadet-corps of st petersburg know well that gillray do not exaggerate paul 's ugliness for he could not and paul 's face be but a mirror of he character tyranny be work into he every fiber he demand a oriental homage as he carriage whirl by it be hold the duty of all other in carriage to stop descend into the mud and bow themselves himself throw he despotism into this formulum : know sir ambassador that in russium there be no one noble or powerful except the man to whom i speak and while i speak and yet within that hideous mass glow spark of reverence for right when the noble try to get paul 's assent to more open arrangement for sell serf apart from the soil he utterly refuse and when they overtask they human chattel paul make a law that no serf should be require to give more than three day in the week to the tillage of he master 's domain but within five year after he accession paul have develop into such a ravenous wild beast that it become necessary to murder he this duty do there come a change in the spirit of russian sovereignty as from march to may but sadly for humanity there come at the same time a change in the spirit of european politics as from may to march for although the new czar alexander i be mild and liberal the storm of french idea and army have generally destroy in monarch ' mind any poor germ of philanthropy which have ever find lodgement there still alexander breasted this storm find time to plan for he serf and in 1803 put he hand to the work of help they toward freedom he first edict be for the creation of the class of free laborer by this master and serf be encourage to enter into a arrangement which be to put the serf into immediate possession of himself of a homestead and of a few acre give he time to indemnify he master by a series of payment alexander throw he heart into this scheme and in he kindliness he suppose that the pretended willingness of the noble mean something but the serf-owning caste without openly oppose twist up bad consequence with good braided impossibility into possibility the whole plan become a tangle and be throw aside the czar now seek to foster other good effort especially those make by some earnest noble to free they serf by will but this plan also the serf-owning caste entangled and thwart at last the storm of war set in with such fury that all internal reform must be lose sight of russium have to make ready for those campaign in which napoleon gain every battle then come that peaceful meeting on the raft at tilsit -- worse for russium than any warlike meeting for thereby napoleon seduce alexander for year from plan of better he empire into dream of extend it come out of these dream alexander have to deal with such reality as the burning of moscow the battle of leipsic and the occupation of france yet in the midst of those fearful time -- when the grapple of the emperor be at the fiercest in the very year of the burning of moscow -- alexander rise in calm statesmanship and admit bessarabium into the empire under a proviso which exclude serfage forever hardly be the great european tragedy end when alexander again turn sorrowfully toward the wrong million of he empire he find that progress in civilization have but make the condition of the serf worse the newly ennoble _ parvenu _ be worse than the old _ boyar _ they hug the serf system more lovingly and the serf more hatefully the sight of these wrong rouse he he seize a cross and swear that the serf system should be abolish straightway a great and good plan be prepare its main feature be : a period of transition from serfage to personal liberty extend through twelve or fourteen year the arrival of the serf at personal freedom with ownership of he cabin and the bit of land attach to it the gradual reimbursement of master by serf and after this advance to personal liberty a advance by easy step to a sort of political liberty favorable as be this plan to the serf-owner they attack it in various way but they could not kill it utterly esthonia livonia and courland become free have fail to arrest the growth of freedom the serf-holding caste make every effort to blast the good fruit of freedom in courland they be thwart in esthonium and livonium they succeed during many year but the eternal law be too strong for they and the fruitage of liberty have grow richer and better after these good effort alexander stop discourage a few patriotic noble stand apart from they caste and strengthen he hand as lafayette and lincourt strengthen loui xvi they even draw up a plan of voluntary emancipation form a association for the purpose and gain many signature but the great weight of that besotted serf-owning caste be throw against they and all come to naught alexander be at last walled in from the great object of he ambition pretend theologian build between he and emancipation wall of scriptural interpretation pretend philosopher build wall of false political economy pretend statesman build wall of sham common-sense if the czar could but have muster courage to cut the knot alas for russium and for he he waste himself in effort to untie it he heart sicken at it he welcome death which alone could remove he from it alexander 's successor nichola i have be know before he accession as a mere martinet a good colonel for parade day wonderful in detect soil uniform terrible in administer petty punishment it seem like the story of stupid brutus over again altered circumstance make a new man of he and few thing be more strange than the change work in he whole bearing and look by that week of energy in climb he brother 's throne the great article in nicholas 's creed be a complete downright faith in despotism and in himself as despotism 's apostle hence he hate above all thing a limited monarchy he tell de custine that a pure monarchy or pure republic he could understand but that anything between these he could not understand of he former rule of poland as constitutional monarch he speak with loathing of this hate which nichola feel for liberal form of government there yet remain monument in the great museum of the kremlin that museum hold a immense number of interesting thing and mass of jewel and plate which make all other european collection mean the visitor wander among clump of diamond and sack of pearl and a nauseating wealth of ruby and sapphire and emerald there rise row upon row of jewelled cimeter and vase and salver of gold and old saddle stud with diamond and with stirrup of gold -- present of frightened asiatic satrap or fawn european ally there too be the crown of muscovy of russium of kazan of astrakhan of siberium of the crimea and pity to say it of poland and next this be a index of despotic hate -- for the polish sceptre be break and fling aside near this stand the full-length portrait of alexander i and at he foot be group capture flag of hungary and poland -- some with blood-mark still upon they but below all far beneath the foot of the emperor in dust and ignominy and on the floor be fling the _ very _ constitution of poland -- parchment for parchment ink for ink good promise for good promise -- which alexander give with so many smile and which nichola take away with so much bloodshed and not far from this monument of the deathless hate nichola bear that liberty he have sting to death stand a monument of he admiration for straightforward tyranny even in the most dreaded enemy he house ever know standing there be a statue in the purest of marble the only statue in those vast hall it have the place of honor it look proudly over all that glory and keep ward over all that treasure and that statue in full majesty of imperial robe and bee and diadem and face be of the first napoleon admiration of he tyrannic will have at last make he peaceful sovereign of the kremlin this spirit of absolutism take its most offensive form in nicholas 's attitude toward europe he be the very incarnation of reaction against revolution and he become the demigod of that horde of petty despot who infest central europe whenever then any tyrant 's lie be to be baptize he stand its godfather whenever any god 's truth be to be crucify he lead on those who pass by revile and wag they head whenever these oppressor revive some old feudal wrong nichola back they in the name of religion whenever they nation struggle to preserve some great right nichola crush they in the name of law and order with these pauper prince he child intermarry and he feed they with he crumb and clothe they with scrap of he purple the visitor can see today in every one of they dwarf palace some of he malachite vase or porcelain bowl or porphyry column but the people of western europe distrust he as much as they ruler worship and some of these same present to they ruler have become trifle-monument of no mean value in show that popular idea of russian policy foremost among these stand those two bronze mass of statuary in front of the royal palace at berlin represent fiery horse restrain by strong man pompous inscription proclaim these present from nichola but the people know the man and he measure have fasten upon one of these curb steed the name of progress check and on the other retrogression encourage a few day before nichola 's self-will bring he to he deathbed we see he ride through the st petersburg street with no pomp and no attendant yet in as great pride as ever despotism give a man at he approach noble uncovered and look docile soldier face about and become statue long-bearded peasant bow to the ground with the air of man on whose vision a miracle flash for there be one who could make or mar all fortune -- the absolute owner of street and house and passer-by -- one who own the patent and dispense the right to tread that soil to breathe that air to be glorified in that sunlight and amid those snow crystal and he look it all though at that moment he army be entrap by military stratagem and he himself be entrap by diplomatic stratagem that face and form be proud and confident as ever there be in this attitude toward europe -- in this standing forth as the representative man of absolutism and breast the nineteenth century -- something of greatness but in he attitude toward russium this greatness be wretchedly diminish for as alexander i be a good man entice out of goodness by the bait of napoleon nichola be a great man scare out of greatness by the ever-recurring phantom of the french revolution in those first day of he reign when he enforce loyalty with grape-shot and halter nichola dare much and stand firm but he character soon show another side fearless as he be before bright bayonet he be a utter coward before bright idea he laugh at the flash of cannon but he tremble at the flash of a new living think whenever then he attempt a great thing for he nation he be sure to be scare back from its completion by fear of revolution and so today he who look through russium for nichola 's work find a number of great thing he have do but each be single insulate not precede logically not follow effectively take as a example of this he railway-building he own pride and russian interest demand railway he scan the world with that keen eye of he saw that american energy be the best supplement to russian capital he will dart quickly strike afar and american come to build he road from st petersburg to moscow nothing can be more complete it be a air-line road and so perfect that the traveller find few place where the rail do not meet before and behind he in the horizon the track be double the rail very heavy and admirably ballast station-house and engine-house be splendid in build perfect in arrangement and surround by neat garden the whole work be worthy of the pyramid builder the traveller be whirl by culvert abutment and wall of dress granite through cutting where the earth on either side be carefully pave or turf to the summit range of greek column be rear as crossing in the midst of broad marsh lion ' head in bronzed iron stare out upon vast waste where never rise even the smoke from a serf 's kennel all this seem good and a ride of four hundred mile through such glory rarely fail to set the traveller at chant the praise of the emperor who conceive they but when the traveller note that complete isolation of the work from all condition necessary to its success he praise grow fainter he see that nichola hold back from continue the road to odessa though half the money spend in make the road a imperial plaything would have build a good solid extension to that most important seaport he see that nichola dare not untie police regulation and that commerce be wretchedly meager contrary to what would obtain under a free system this great public work find the country wretched and leave it wretch the traveller fly by no range of trim paling and tidy cottage he see the same dingy group of hut here as elsewhere the same cultivation look for no morrow the same token that the laborer be not think worthy of he hire this same tendency to great single work this same fear of great connected system this same timid isolation of great creation from principle essential to they growth be see too in nicholas 's church-building foremost of all the edifice on which nichola lavish the wealth of the empire stand the isak church in st petersburg it be one of the largest and certainly the richest cathedral in christendom all be polish pink granite and marble and bronze on all side be double row of titanic column each a single block of polished granite with bronze capital colossal mass of bronze statuary be group over each front high above the roof and surround the great drum of the dome be line of giant column in granite bearing giant statue in bronze and crowning all rise the vast central dome flank by its four smaller dome all heavily plate with gold the church within be one gorgeous mass of precious marble and mosaic and silver and gold and jewel on the tabernacle of the altar in gold and malachite on the screen of the altar with its pilaster of lapi lazulus and its range of malachite column fifty foot high be lavish million on million bulge from the ceiling be massy boss of siberian porphyry and jasper to decorate the wall with unfading picture nichola found a establishment for mosaic work where sixty picture be command each demand after all artistic labor the mechanical labor of two man for four year yet this vast work be not so striking a monument of nichola 's luxury as of he timidity for this cathedral and some other almost as grand be in part at least result of the deep wish of nichola to wean he people from they semi-idolatrous love for dark confine filthy sanctuary like those of moscow but here again be a timid purpose and half result nichola dare set no adequate enginery work at the popular religious training or moral training there have be such a organization the russian bible society favor by alexander i but nicholas sweep it away at one stroke of the pen evidently he fear lest scriptural denunciation of certain sin in ancient politics might be popularly interpret against certain sin in modern politics the corruption system in russium be old organize and respectable story tell of russian bribe and theft exceed belief only until one have be on the ground nichola begin well he make a imperial progress to odessa be welcome in the morning by the governor in full pomp and robe and flow of smooth word and at noon the same governor be work in the street with ball and chain as a convict but against such a chronic moral evil no government be so weak as you so-called strong government nichola set out one day for the kronstadt arsenal to look into the account there but before he reach they store storehouse and account-book be in ash so at last nichola fold he arm and wrestle no more for apart from the trouble there come ever in he dealings with thief that old timid thought of he that if he examine too closely they chief tenure they might examine too closely he despot tenure we have show this vague fear in nicholas 's mind thus at length and in different workings because thereby alone can be grasp the master-key to he dealings with the serf system toward he toiling million nichola always show sympathy let news of a single wrong to a serf get through the hedge about the russian majesty and woe to the guilty master many of these wrong come to nicholas 's notice and he come to hate the system and try to undermine it opposition meet he of course not so much the ponderous laziness of peter 's time as a opposition polite and elastic which never rant and never stand up -- for then nichola would have throttle it and stamp upon it but it do its best to entangle he reason and thwart he action he be tell that the serf be well-fed well-housed well-clothed well-provided with religion be contented and have no wish to leave they owner now nichola be not strong at spin sham reason nor subtle at weave false conscience but to he mind the very fact that the system have so degrade a man that he could laugh and dance and sing while other man take he wages he wife and homestead be the crowning argument against the system then the political economist beset he prove that without force labor russium must sink into sloth and poverty yet all this could not shut out from nicholas 's sight the great black fact in the case he see and wince as he see that while other european nation even under despot be comparatively active and energetic he own people be sluggish and stagnant that although great thought and great act be tower in the west there be in russium after all he galvanize no great author or scholar or builder or inventor but only two main product of russian civilization dissolute lord and abject serf nearly twenty year go by in this timid drop of grain of salt into a putrid sea but at last in 1842 nichola issue he ukase create the class of contracting peasant master and serf be empower to enter into contract the serf receive freedom the master receive payment in instalment it be a moderate innovation very moderate -- nothing more than the first failure of the first alexander yet even here that old timidity of nichola nearly spoil what little good be hide in the ukase notice after notice be give to the serf-owner that they be not to be molest that no emancipation be contemplate and that the ukase contain nothing new the result be as feeble as the policy a few serf be emancipate and nichola halt the revolution of 1848 increase he fear of innovation and finally the war in the crimea take from he the power of innovation the great man die we see he cold dead face in the midst of crown and cross very pale then very powerless then one might stare at he then as at a serf 's corpse for he who have scare europe during thirty year lay before we that day as a poor lump of chill brain and withered muscle and we stand by when amid chant and flare of torch and roll of cannon he son wrap he in he shroud of gold thread and lower he into the tomb of he father but there be show in those day far greater tribute than the prayer of bishop or the reverence of ambassador mass about the winter palace and the fortress of peter and paul stand thousand on thousand who in far-distant serf-hut have put on they best have toil wearily to the capital to give they last mute thanks to one who for year have stand between they welfare and they owner ' greed sad that he have not do more yet they know that he have wish they freedom and loathe they wrong for that come up the tribute of million the new emperor alexander ii have never be hope for as one who could light the nation from he brain the only hope be that he might warm the nation somewhat from he heart he be say to be of a weak silken fiber the strength of the family be say to be concentrate in he younger brother constantine but soon come a day when the young czar reveal to europe not merely kindliness but strength while he father 's corpse be still lie within he palace he receive the diplomatic body as the emperor enter the audience-room he seem feeble indeed for such a crisis that fearful legacy of war seem to weigh upon he heart mark of plenteous tear be upon he face nesselrode though old and bent and shrink in stature seem stronger than he young master but as he begin he speech it be see that a strong man have mount the throne with earnestness he declare that he sorrow over the exist war but that if the holy alliance have be break it be not through the fault of russium with bitterness he turn toward the austrian minister esterhazy and hint at russian service in 1848 and austrian ingratitude calmly then not as one who speak a part but as one who announce a determination he declare : i be anxious for peace but if the term at the approach congress be incompatible with the honor of my nation i will put myself at the head of my faithful russium and die sooner than yield strong as alexander show himself by these word he show himself stronger by act a policy properly mingle firmness and conciliation bring peace to europe and show he equal to he father a policy mingling love of liberty with love of order bring the dawn of prosperity to russium and show he the superior of he father the reform now begin be not stint as of old but free and hearty in rapid succession be sweep away restriction on telegraphic communication on printing on the use of the imperial library on stranger enter the country on russian leave the country a policy in public work be adopt which make nicholas 's greatest effort seem petty a vast network of railway be begin a policy in commercial dealings with western europe be adopt in which alexander though not apparently so impose as nichola be really far greater he dare advance toward freedom of trade but soon rise again that great problem of old -- that problem ever rise to meet a new autocrat and at each appearance more dire than before -- the serf question the serf in private hand now number more than twenty million above they stand more than a hundred thousand owner the princely strength of the largest owner be best represent by a few man possess over a hundred thousand serf each and above all by count scheremetieff who boast three hundred thousand the luxury of the large owner be best represent by about four thousand man possess more than a thousand serf each the pinch propensity of the small owner be best represent by fifty thousand man possess fewer than twenty serf each the serf might be divide into two great class the first comprise those work under the old or _ corvée _ system give usually three day in the week to the tillage of the owner 's domain the second comprise those work under the new or _ obrok _ system receive a payment fix by the owner and assess by the community to which the serf belong the character of the serf have be mould by the serf system they have a simple shrewdness which under a better system have make they enterprising but this quality soon degenerate into cunning and cheatery -- the weapon which the hopelessly oppressed always use they have a reverence for thing sacred which under a better system might have give the nation a strengthen religion but they now stand among the most religious people on earth and among the least moral to the picture of we lady of kazan they be ever ready to burn wax and oil to truth and justice they constantly omit the tribute of mere common honesty they keep the church fast like saint they keep the church feast like satyr they have curiosity which under a better system would have make they inventive but they plough in common use be behind the plough describe by vergil they have a love of gain which under a better system would have make they hardworking but it take ten serf to do languidly and poorly what two free man in america would do quickly and well they be naturally a kind people but let one example show how serfage can transmute kindness it be a rule well know in russium that when a accident occur interference be to be leave to the police hence you would see a man lie in a fit and the bystander give no aid but wait for the authority some year ago as all the world remember a theater take fire in st petersburg and crowd of people be burn or stifle the whole story be not so well know the theater be but a great temporary wooden shed -- such as be run up every year at the holiday in the public square when the fire burst forth crowd of peasant hurry to the spot but though they hear the shriek of the die separate from they only by a thin plank only one man in that multitude dare cut through and rescue some of the sufferer the serf when stand for great idea would die rather than yield napoleon i learn this at eylau napoleon iii learn it at sebastopol yet in daily life they be slavish beyond belief on a certain day in the year 1855 the most embarrassed man in all russium be doubtless we excellent american minister the serf coachman employ at wages be call up to receive he discharge for drunkenness come into the presence of a sound-hearted american democrat who never have dream of one mortal kneel to another ivan throw himself on he knee press he forehead to the minister 's foot fawn like a tame beast and refuse to move until the minister relieve himself from this nightmare of servility by a full pardon time after time we have enter the serf field and serf hut have see the simple round of serf toil and sport have hear the simple chronicle of self joy and sorrow : but whether he livery be filthy sheepskin or gold-laced caftan whether he lay on carpet at the door of he master or in filth on the floor of he cabin whether he give we cold stupid story of he wrong or flippant detail of he joy whether he bless he master or curse he -- we have wonder at the power which a serf system have to degrade and imbrute the image of god but astonishment be increase a thousand-fold at study of the reflex influence for evil upon the serf-owner themselves upon the whole free community upon the very soil of the whole country on all those broad plain of russium on the daily life of that serf-owning aristocracy on the whole class which be neither of serf nor serf-owner the curse of god be write in letter so big and so black that all mankind might read they farm be untilled enterprise deaden invention cripple education neglect life be of little value labor be the badge of servility laziness the very badge and passport of gentility despite the most specious half-measure despite all effort to galvanize it to coax life into it to sting life into it the nation remain stagnant not one traveller who do not know that the evil bring on that land by the despotism of the autocrat be as nothing compare to that dark network of curse spread over it by a serf-owning aristocracy into the conflict with this evil alexander ii enter manfully have be two year upon the throne have make a plan have stir some think through certain authorize journal he inspire the nobility in three of the northwestern province to memorialize he in regard to emancipation straightway a answer be send convey the outline of the emperor 's plan the period of transition from serfage to freedom be set at twelve year at the end of that time the serf be to be fully free and possessor of he cabin with a adjoining piece of land the provincial noble be convoke to fill out these outline with detail as to the work out by the serf of a fair indemnity to they master the whole world be stir but that province in which the czar hope most eagerly for a movement to meet he -- the province where beat the old muscovite heart moscow -- be stir least of all every earnest throb seem stifle there by that strong aristocracy yet moscow move at last some noble who have not yet arrive at the callous period some professor in the university who have not yet arrive at the heavy period breathe life into the mass drag on the timid fight off the malignant the movement have soon a force which the retrograde party at moscow dare not openly resist so they send answer to st petersburg apparently favorable but wrap in they phrase be hint of difficulty reservation impossibility all this study suggestion of difficulty profit the reactionist nothing they be immediately inform that the imperial mind be make up that the business of the muscovite nobility be now to arrange that the serf be free in twelve year and put in possession of homestead and enclosure the next movement of the retrograde party be to misunderstand everything the plainest thing be find to need a world of debate the simplest thing become entangled the noble assembly play solemnly a ludicrous game of cross-purposes straightway come a notice from the emperor which strip of official verbiage say that they must understand this set all in motion again imperial notice be send to province after province explanatory document be issue good man and strong be set to talk and work the nobility of moscow make another move to scare back the advance force of emancipation they elect as provincial leader three noble bear the greatest name of old russium and hater of the new idea to defeat these come a successor of st gregory and st bavon one who accept the thought that when god advance great idea the church must marshal they philarete metropolitan of moscow uphold emancipation and condemn its foe he earnest eloquence carry all the work progress unevenly -- noble in different government differ in plan and aim -- a assembly of delegate be bring together at st petersburg to combine and perfect a resultant plan under the eye of the emperor the grand council of the empire too be set at the work it be a most unpromising body yet the emperor 's will stir it the opposition now make the most brilliant stroke of its campaign just as jame ii of england prate of toleration and plan the enslavement of all think so now the bigoted plotter against emancipation begin to prate of constitutional liberty but alexander hold right on it be even hint that vision of a constitutional monarchy pleased he but then come test of alexander 's strength far more try mass of peasant hear vague news of emancipation -- learn doubtless from they master ' own spiteful lip that the emperor be endeavor to tear away property in serf -- take the master at they word and determine to help the emperor they rise in insurrection to the bigoted serf-owner this be a godsend they parade it in all light therewith they throw life into all the old commonplace on the french revolution timid man of good intention waver the czar would surely now be scare back not so alexander now hurl he greatest weapon and stunned reaction in a moment he free all the serf on the imperial estate without reserve now it be see that he be in earnest the opponent be dishearten once more the plan move and drag they on but there come other thing to dishearten the emperor and not least of these be the attitude of those who mould popular think in england be it say here to the credit of france that from she come constant encouragement in the great work wolowskus mazade and other true-hearted man send forth from lead review and journal word of sympathy word of help word of cheer not so england just as in the french revolution of 1789 while yet that revolution be noble and good while yet lafayette and bailly hold it leader in english thought who have quicken the opinion which have cause the revolution send malignant prophecy and prompt foul blow so in this battle of alexander against a foul wrong they seize this time of all time to show all the wrong and absurdity of which russium ever have be or ever might be guilty -- criticise carp send much haughty advice depressing sympathy and malignant prophecy review article base on no real knowledge of russium announce a desire for serf-emancipation and then in the modern english way with plentiful pyrotechnics of antithesis and paradox throw a gloomy light into the skilfully picture depths of imperial despotism official corruption and national bankruptcy they revive old world objection which to one acquaint with the most every-day workings of serfage be ridiculous it be say that if the serf lose the protection of they owner they might fall a prey to rapacious official as well might it have be argue that a mother should never loose she son from she apron-string it be say that serfism exclude pauperism -- that if the serf owe work to he owner in the prime of life the owner owe support to he serf in the decline of life no lie could be more absurd to one who have see russian life we be first greet on enter russium by a beggar who kneel in the mud at kovno eighteen beggar besiege the coach and kovno be hardly worse than score of other town within a day 's ride from st petersburg a woman beg piteously for means to keep soul and body together and finish the refutation of that sonorous english theory for she have be discharge from she master 's service in the metropolis as too feeble and have be send back to he domain afar in the country on foot and without money it be say that free peasant would not work but despite volley of prediction that they would not work if free despite volley of assertion that they could not work if free the peasant when set free and not crush by regulation have spring to they work with a earnestness and continue it with a vigor at which the philosopher of the old system stand aghast the free peasant of wologda compare favorably with any in europe and when the old tirade have grow stale english writer draw copiously from a new source -- from _ la vérité sur la russie _ -- pleasingly indifferent to the fact that the author 's praise in a previous work have notoriously be a thing of bargain and sale and that there be in full process of development a train of fact which lead the parisian court to find he guilty of demand in one case a blackmail of fifty thousand ruble all this argument outside the empire help the foe of emancipation inside the empire but the emperor meet the whole body of he opponent with a argument overwhelming on march 5 1861 he issue he manifesto make the serf free he have struggle long to make some satisfactory previous arrangement he motto now become : emancipation first arrangement afterward thus be the result of the great struggle decide nikolai turgenieff in 1857 the emperor alexander ii first raise the question of emancipation and declare it be time for it to be accomplish as might have be expect the idea of emancipation meet with great opposition from different side yet the opposition be direct not so much against the personal emancipation of the serf as against the appropriation to they when liberate of the land they hold the proprietor assemble in different committee which be establish all over the empire to discuss the matter end even by give up they right of possession in the person of the serf and mention only they right to the land occupy by the peasant claim pecuniary indemnity if that land be deliver to they the honorable gentleman whom the emperor intrust with this important task form a committee _ ad hoc _ declare from the first as a principle that the emancipate peasant must have land about in the same quantity as they have hitherto occupy on condition of a pecuniary indemnity to be pay to the proprietor that principle prevail thanks to the emperor 's firmness during the discussion of that question in russium i publish several writings on the matter my chief purpose and warmest desire be to secure to the peasant as soon as possible they personal freedom and complete liberty of labor i propose a method of emancipation claim the entire property of they home that be to say cottage and orchard and a small quantity of arable land and that without the slightest indemnity from they to they master which be to be leave to the government a sum of about two hundred million dollar accord to my calculation would have be sufficient for it meanwhile i inherit a small land property inhabit by about four hundred person of both sex i hasten to put in practice my method i abandon one-third of the land include they house to the peasant and let they the two remain third for a certain sum of money in my agreement with they it be settle that if the emancipation which the government be prepare -lrb- 1859 -rrb- turn out more advantageous to they they be to accept it in preference to mine it be needless to add that when the official emancipation be proclaim the peasant and i find it more advantageous and adopt it if i be to compare the two method i should say that mine tend chiefly to the liberty of the peasant ' person and labor and that of the government to give they a quantity of land sufficient for they subsistence the great inconvenience of this last method be that it oblige the peasant to pay a heavy rent to redeem they land and that during forty-nine year nevertheless they passion to possess land be so strong that they cheerfully submit to such hard condition the redeeming rent _ -lrb- rente de rachat _ -rrb- be to be pay by the peasant either in money accord to a estimate fix by law or by work do for the proprietor _ ie _ by _ corvy _ this last mode of payment sanction by law only for a short period disappear more and more every day so that the majority of the peasant no longer work for the proprietor but pay they rent in money i can say more : about two million of peasant be entirely liberate with regard to the proprietor thanks to a immediate payment of the redeeming rent in such case they annual rent -lrb- _ redevance _ -rrb- be capitalize and the government give the proprietor a obligation for the amount of the capital which bear five per cent interest and be to be redeem in the course of forty-nine year by annual drawing -lrb- _ tirage _ -rrb- the peasant then to pay they redeeming rent to government and thus become free and independent proprietor for some time both peasant and proprietor seem to find this proceed the most profitable and agreement of this kind become more and more frequent every day i can hardly say how happy i be when i saw for the first time my dear beloved and deeply respected russian peasant free at last and proprietor of the land they have till then cultivate as serf what a change the same creature serf yesterday become man conscious of they human dignity they aspect they language be those of free man in the mean while in get rid of they serfdom they preserve they usual good sense wisdom and _ bonhomie _ no impertinence no arrogance whatever can be detect in they they be full of self-respect yet polite i see they discuss with the authority some business of theirs they maintain they new rights and when wrong never hesitate to acknowledge it every district and every _ chef-lieu _ have every year a assembly of deputy who name a permanent committee for three year this committee be charge with the municipal administration under the control of the assembly everyone be call by law to the election of the deputy it happen in many place that the peasant be the more numerous and could therefore dispose of all the place in the administrative committee they be so inform no be they answer we want one or two member of the committee take from among ourselves they will watch over we interest as for defend they as for action the noble we name will do it better than we for they be more learn than we be in one of the assembly the noble move by the tact and moderation of the peasant insist and almost force a peasant to become president of the administrative committee of the district when the salary of the member of the committee have to be decide the peasant usually consider it too high for they and let the noble and the merchant have it get it diminish by one-half for themselves all the district assembly after vote for the formation of the administrative committee name the deputy for the larger assembly in the chief town in the province which in its turn choose among its own member the member for the provincial administrative committee the central committee seem to interest the peasant less than those of the district and this too be owe to they modesty and moderation another field be offer by the new law to the activity of the peasant in the local or municipal tribunal the law unite several rural commune in one canton _ -lrb- volost -rrb- _ each canton each commune choose a _ ancient _ assist by a _ conseil _ in every canton be a tribunal to judge the peasant ' affair ancient and judge be elect by peasant nobleman be not submit to these tribunal but it have happen that some of they preferred have they difficulty with peasant settle by municipal judge rather than by the usual tribunal this jurisdiction establish merely for peasant have great importance owe chiefly to the privilege of decide not only accord to general law but also accord to local custom opportunity be not want for the good sense of the peasant to show itself in these municipal tribunal and council and the success of the institution be clear to everyone -lrb-
