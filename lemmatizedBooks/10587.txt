literature the finest if not the greatest writer in the english language be bear at milston wiltshire on the 1st of may 1672 a fanciful mind might trace a correspondence between the particular month when celebrated man have be bear and the peculiar complexion of they genius milton the austere and awful be bear in the silent and gloomy month of December shakspeare the most versatile of all writer be bear in April that month of changeful sky of sudden sunshine and sudden shower burn and byron those stormy spirit both appear in the fierce January and of the former he himself say 'twa then a blast o ' januar-win ' blow welcome in on robin scott the broad sunny be visit we in August and in the same month the warm genius of shelley come as hunt use to tell he from the planet mercury to we earth coleridge and keat with whose song a deep bar of sorrow be to mingle like the music of fall leaf or of wind wail for the departure of summer arrive in October -- that month the beauty of which be the child of blast and its glory the flush of decay and it seem somehow fitting that addison the mild the quietly-joyous the sanguine and serene should come with the daisy and the sweet summer-tide on the 1st of may which buchanan thus hail -- salve fugaci glorium saeculi salve secunda digna die nota salve vetustae vitae imago et specimen venienti aevus hail glory of the fleeting year hail day the fairest happiest here image of time for ever by pledge of a bright eternity dr lancelot addison himself a man of no mean note be the father of we poet he be bear in 1632 at maltesmeaburn in the parish of _ corby ravensworth _ -lrb- what a name of ill-omen within ill-omen or as dr johnson would say inspissated gloom -rrb- in the county of westmoreland he father be a minister of the gospel but in such humble circumstance that lancelot be receive from the grammar-school of appleby into queen 's college oxford in the capacity of a poor child after pass he curriculum there be chiefly distinguish for he violent high church and monarchical principle for which he repeatedly smart he at the restoration be appoint chaplain to the garrison of dunkirk and soon after he accept a similar situation in tangier which have be cede by portugal to britain in this latter post he feel rather lonely and miserable and be drive in self-defence to betake himself to the study of the manners and the literature of the moor jew and other oriental nation this lead he afterwards to publish some work on barbary on hebrew custom and mohammedanism which shew a profound acquaintance with these subject and which not without reason be suppose to have color the imagination of he son joseph who be seldom more felicitous than when reproduce the gorgeous superstition and phantasy of the east for eight year old addison linger in loathe tangier nor when he return to england on a visit have he any purpose of permanently reside in he own country but he appointment be hastily bestow on another and it be fortunate for he that a private friend step in and present he with the living of milston near ambrosebury wilt worth # 120 a-year this which miss aiken call a pittance be probably equivalent to # 250 now at all event on the strength of it he marry jane daughter of dr gulstone and sister to the bishop of bristol who in due time become the mother of we poet lancelot be afterwards make prebendary of salisbury cathedral and king 's chaplain in ordinary about the time -lrb- 1675 -rrb- when he take the degree of dd subsequently he become archdeacon of salisbury and at last in 1683

and be twice marry swift meet she once and with some awe -lrb- for he like all bully have a little of the coward about he -rrb- describe she as a kind of wit and very like she brother the _ spectator _ seem to have be a wild and wayward boy he be say to have once act as ringleader in a bar out describe by johnson as a savage license by which the boy when the periodical vacation draw near use to take possession of the school of which they bar the door and bid the master defiance from the window on another occasion have commit some petty offence at a country school terrify at the master 's apprehend displeasure he make he escape into the field and wood where for some day he feed on fruit and sleep in a hollow tree till discover and bring back to he parent this last may seem the act of a timid boy and inconsistent with the former and yet be somehow congenial to we ideal of the character of we poet it require perhaps more daring to front the peril of the wood than the frown of the master and augured besides a certain romance in he disposition which find afterwards a vent in literature after receive instruction first at salisbury and then at lichfield -lrb- he connexion with which place form a link unite he in a manner to the great lexicographer who be bear there -rrb- he be remove to the charterhouse and there profit so much in greek and latin that at fifteen he be not only say macaulay fit for the university but carry thither a classical taste and a stock of learning which would have do honor to a master of art he have at the charter-house form a friendship destine to have important bearing on he after history with richard steele whose character may be sum up in a few sentence who have not hear of sir richard steele wordsworth say of one of he character -- she be know to every star and every wind that blow poor dick be know to every sponging-house and to every bailiff that blow in pursuit walk the london street a fine-hearted warm-blooded character without a atom of prudence self-control reticence or forethought quite as destitute of malice or envy perpetually sinning and perpetually repent never positively irreligious even when drunk and often excessively pious when recover sobriety -- steele reel he way through life and die with the reputation of be a orthodox christian and a -lrb- nearly -rrb- habitual drunkard the most affectionate and most faithless of husband a brave soldier and in many point a arrant fool a violent politician and the best natured of man a writer extremely lively for this among other reason that he write generally on he leg fly or meditate flight from he creditor and who embody in himself the title of he three principal work -- the christian hero the tender husband and the _ tatler _ -- be a christian hero in intention one of those intention with which a certain place be pave a tender husband if not a true one to he two lady and a _ tatler _ to all person in all circumstance and at all time when addison first know this original he be probably uncontaminated and must have be as he continue to the end to be a irascible but joyous and genial be and they become intimate at once although circumstance sever they from each other for a long period in 1687 addison enter queen 's college oxford but sometime after -lrb- macaulay say not many month johnson a year and miss aiken two year -rrb- dr lancaster of magdalene college have accidentally see some latin verse from he pen exert himself to procure they author admission to the benefit of a foundation then the wealthiest in europe we poet be first elect demy then probationary fellow in 1697 and in the year follow actual fellow during the ten year he reside at oxford he be a general favorite remarkable for he diligence in study for the purity and tenderness of he feeling for he bashful and retire manners for the excellence of he latin composition and for he solitary walk pursue in a path they still point out below the elm which skirt a meadow on the bank of the cherwell -- a river we need scarcely say which there wed the isis it be in such lonely evening or Saturday stroll that he probably acquire the habit of pensive reverie to which we owe many of the finest of he speculation in after day such as that in _ spectator _ no 565 beginning i be yesterday about sunset walking in the open field when insensibly the night fall upon I & c prose english essay however be as yet stranger to he pen he ambition be to be a poet and while still under twenty-two he produce and print some complimentary verse to dryden then decline in year and fall into comparative neglect the old poet be please with the homage of the young aspirant which be as graceful in expression as it be generous in purpose for instance allude to dryden 's project translation of ovid he say that ovid thus transform shall reveal a nobler change than he himself can tell this however although happy start a different view of the subject it suggest the idea that most translation be metamorphosis to the worse like that of a live person into a dead tree or at least of a superior into a inferior be in pope 's iliad you have the metamorphosis of a eagle into a nightingale in dryden 's virgil you have a stately war-horse transform into a hard-trotting hackney in hoole 's version of the italian poet you have nymph nail up in timber while on the other hand in coleridge 's wallenstein you have the nobler change speak of by addison of -- shall we say-a cold and stately holly-tree turn into a murmuring and oracular oak that after thus introduce himself to dryden he meet he occasionally seem certain although the rumor circulate by spence that he teach the old man to sit late and drink hard seem ridiculous dryden introduce he to congreve and through congreve he make the valuable acquaintance of charle montague then leader of the whig in the house of common and chancellor of the exchequer he afterwards publish a translation of that part of the fourth book of the georgic refer to bee on which dryden who have procure a preface to he own complete translation of the same poem from addison compliment he by say -- after he bee my later swarm be scarcely worth hive he publish too a poem on king william and a account of the principal english poet in which he venture on a character of spenser ere he have read he work it thus be as might have be expect poor and non-appreciative and speak of spenser as a poet pretty nearly forget some time after this he collect a volume entitle musæ anglicanæ in which he insert all he early latin verse charle montague himself a poet of a certain small rank and a man of great general talent become -- along with somer -- the patron of addison he divert he from the church to which he own taste seem to destine he suggest that civil employment have become very corrupt through want of man of liberal education and good principle and should be redeem from this reproach and declare that though he have be call a enemy of the church he would never do it any other injury than keep mr addison out of it it be likely that the timid temperament of we poet concur with these suggestion of montague in determine he decision he failure as a parliamentary orator subsequently seem to prove that the pulpit be not he vocation after all he Saturday papers in the _ spectator _ be as fine as any sermon of that age and he perhaps do more good serve as a volunteer than have he be a regular soldier in the army of the christian faith somer and montague wish to employ they _ protégé _ in public service abroad there be however one drawback addison have plenty of english greek and latin but he have little french this he must be send abroad to acquire and for the purpose of defray the expense of he travels a pension of # 300 a-year be confer upon he pay thus as few poet or writer of any kind be in advance and have he fellowship besides addison like a young nobleman instead of a parson 's son set out upon he tour this be in the summer of 1699 he be twenty-seven year of age exactly one year younger than byron and three year younger than milton when they visit the same region he go first to pari and be receive with great distinction by montague 's kinsman the earl of manchester and he beautiful lady he travel with he eye quietly open especially to the humorous aspect of thing in a letter to montague he say that he have not see a _ blush _ from he first landing at calai and give a sarcastic description of the spurious devotion which the example of the old repentant _ roué _ loui xiv have render fashionable among the _ literati _ of france : there be no book come out at present that have not something in it of a air of devotion dacier have be force to prove he plato a very good christian before he venture upon he translation and have so far comply with the taste of the age that he whole book be overrun with text of scripture and the notion of pre-existence suppose to be steal from two verse of the prophet the sincere believer be usually the first to detect and be disgust with the sham one and addison be always a sincere believer but he have also that happy nature in which disgust be carry quickly and easily off through the safety-valve of a smile from paris he go to bloi the capital of loir-and-cher a small town about 110 mile south-west of pari here he have two advantage he find the french language speak in its perfection and as he have not a single countryman with whom to exchange a word he be drive on he own resource he remain there a year and spend he time well study hard rise early have the best french master mingle in society although subject as in previous and after part of he life to fit of absence he life be as pure as it be simple he most intimate friend at bloi the abbe philippeaux say : he have no amour whilst here that i know of and i think i should have know it if he have have any during this time he send home letter to he friend in england -- to montague colonel froude congreve and other -lrb- 1 -rrb- -- which contain sentence of exquisite humor thus describe the famous gallery at versaille with the painting of loui ' victory he say : the history of the present king till the sixteenth year of he reign be paint on the roof by le brun so that he majesty have action enough by he to furnish another gallery much longer than the first he be represent with all the terror and majesty that you can imagine in every part of the picture and see he young face as perfectly draw in the roof as he present one in the side the painter have represent he most christian majesty under the figure of jupiter throw thunderbolt all about the ceiling and striking terror into the danube and rhine that _ lie astonished and blast with lightning a little above the cornice _ this be addison all over and quite as good be he picture of the general character of the french : ` tis not in the power of want or slavery to make they miserable there be nothing to be meet with in the country but mirth and poverty every one sing laugh and starve they conversation be generally agreeable for if they have any wit or sense they be sure to shew it they woman be perfect mistress in the art of shew themselves to the best advantage they be always gay and sprightly and set off the worst face in europe with the best air every one know how to give herself as charming a look and posture as sir godfrey kneller could draw she in from blois he return to pari and be now better qualify from he knowledge of the language to mingle with its philosopher savant and poet he have some interesting talk with malebranche and boileau the former of whom very much praise mr newton 's mathematics shake he head at the name of hobbe and tell I he think he a _ pauvre esprit _ here follow a genuine addisonianism : he book be now reprint with many addition among which he shew I a very pretty hypothesis of color which be different from that of cartesius or newton _ though they may all three be true _ boileau now sixty-four deaf as a post and full of the swelter venom of ill-natured criticism nevertheless receive addison kindly and when present by he with he musæ anglicanæ be say from that time to have conceive a opinion of the english genius for poetry addison say that boileau hate a ill poet unfortunately however for he judgment it be notorious that he slight shakspeare milton and corneille and that next to homer and virgil he great idol be arnaud and racine in December 1700 tired of french manners which have lose even they power of move he to smile and it may be apprehensive of the war connect with the spanish succession which be about to inflame all europe addison embark from marseille for italy after a narrow escape from one of those sudden mediterranean storm in which poor shelley perish he land at savona and proceed through wild mountain path to genoa he afterwards commemorate he deliverance in the pleasing line publish in the _ spectator _ begin with -- how be thy servant bless o lord one verse in which be wont to awaken the enthusiasm of the boy burn what though in dreadful whirl we hang high on the broken wave & c the survivor of a shipwreck be or should be ever afterwards a sadder and a wiser man and addison continue long to feel subdue and thankful and could hardly have be more so though he have outlive _ that _ shipwreck which bear now the relation to all recent wreck which _ the _ storm of November 1703 as we shall see bear to all inferior tempest -- the loss of the _ royal charter _ -- the stately and gold-laden bark which on Wednesday the 26th October 1859 when on the verge of the haven which the passenger so much desire to see be lift up by the blast as by the hand of god and dash into ten thousand piece -- hundred of man woman and alas alas child drown mutilate crush by fall machinery and that too at a moment when they have just be assure that there be no immediate danger and when hope be begin to sparkle in the eye that be sink into despair -- sovereign spray and the mangled fragment of human body mass together as if in the anarchy of hell and hurl upon the rock addison no more than one of the escape from that saloon of horror and sea of death could forget the special providence by which he be save and the hymn above refer to and that other still finer commence -- when all thy mercy o my god my rise soul survey seem a pillar erect on the shore to he that have protect and redeem he from genoa he go to milan and thence to venice where he see a play on the subject of cato enact and begin himself to indite he celebrated tragedy of which he complete four act ere he quit italy on he way to rome he visit the miniature mountain republic of san marino which he contemplate and describe with much the same feeling of interest and amazement as afterwards in the _ guardian _ the little colony of ant immortalise there like swift -lrb- whom macaulay accuse of steal from addison 's latin poem on the pigmy some hint for he lilliput -rrb- addison have a finer eye for the little than for the vast he enjoy marino therefore and must have chuckle over the description of it in the geography as much as if it have be a stroke of he own inventive pen besides the mountain on which the town stand the republic possess _ two adjoining hill _ at rome he do not stay long at this time but as if afraid of the attraction of the approach holy week -- that blaze of brilliant but false light in which so many moth have be consume -- he hurry to naple and see vesuvius burn over its beautiful bay with less admiration than have be feel since by many inferior man he return to rome and live there unharmed during the sickly season thence he go to florence survey with interest the glory of its art and in fine he cross the alp by mount ceni to geneva compose on he way a poetical epistle to montague now lord halifax the alp do not seem to have much delighted he imagination there be a few even still who look upon mountain as excrescence and deformity and give to glencoe only the homage of they unaffected fear which be certainly better than the false rapture of other but in addison 's day admiration for wild scenery be neither pretend nor feel we poet love indeed the great silent starry night and have whisper and stammer out some beautiful thing in its praise but he do this so to speak below he breath while the white alp seem the shroud corpse of the fall titan take that breath away and he shudder all the road through they and descend delightedly to the green pasture and the still water of lower region at geneva where he arrive in December 1701 he remain some time expect from lord manchester the official appointment for which he be now qualify but while wait there he hear the tiding of king william 's death which put a end to he hope as well as to those of he party he pension too be stop and he be oblige to become a tutor to a young englishman of fortune with he he visit many part of switzerland and germany and spend a portion of he leisure in write not only he travels but he recondite dialogue on medal -- a book of considerable research and great ingenuity which be not publish however till after he death from germany he pass to holland where he hear the sad intelligence that he father be no more during he stay in holland he watch with keen yet kindly eye the manners of the inhabitant and in he letter hit at they drinking habit with a mixture of severity and sympathy which be very characteristic toward the close of 1703 he return home and we doubt not feel at first desolate enough he father be dead he pension withdraw he political patron out of power and he literary fame not yet fully establish but on the other hand he be only thirty-one he have make some new and influential friend on the continent particularly the eminent edward wortley montague husband of the still more celebrated mary wortley montague and he have in he portfolio a volume of travels of some mark and likelihood nearly ready for the press besides the whig low as they be now in political influence be still true to they party and they welcome addison as one of they rise hope into the famous kit-cat club a _ omniumgaiherum _ of all whose talent learn accomplishment wit or wealth be think useful to the whig cause addison 's arrival in england seem to have synchronise or precede the great tempest of November 1703 to which we have already refer and to which he afterwards allude in he simile of the angel in the campaign -- such as of late o'er pale britannium past we reader will find a sketch of this terrific tempest in the commencement of ainsworth 's jack shepherd macaulay say of it it be the only tempest which in we latitude have equal the rage of a tropical hurricane no other tempest be ever in this country the occasion of a parliamentary address or of a national fast whole fleet have be cast away large mansion have be blow down one prelate have be bury beneath the ruin of he palace london and bristol have present the appearance of city just sack hundred of family be throw into mourn the prostrate trunk of large tree and the ruin of house attest in all the southern county the fury of the blast how addison feel or fare during this storm we have no means of know perhaps he timid nature shrink from it in spite of its appeal to imagination or perhaps the poetry that be in he triumph over he fear and as he feel what _ zanga _ be afterwards to say -- i love this rock of the battlements the image of the angel afterwards to be dilate into the vast form of wrath describe in the campaign rise on he vision and remain there indelibly fix till the time arrive when use with artistic skill it float he into fame meanwhile he spend this winter and spring of 1703-4 in a rather precarious manner and like a true poet he be lodge in a obscure garret in the haymarket up three stair when one day the right honorable henry boyle the chancellor of the exchequer call on he and communicate a project that have be concoct between godolphin and halifax the whig be now again in the ascendant and the battle of blenheim fight on the 13th August 1704 have bring they triumph to a climax halifax and godolphin be mortify at the bad poem in commemoration of it which pour from the press they feeling be sincerely that which byron affect in reference to wellington and waterloo -- i wish you bard would sing it rather better they bethink themselves of addison and send boyle to request he to write some verse on the subject he readily undertake the task and when he have half-finish the campaign he shew it to godolphin who be delighted especially with the angel and in gratitude instantly appoint the lucky poet to a commissionership worth about # 200 a-year and assure he that this be only a foretaste of greater favor to come the poem soon after appear it be receive with acclamation and addison feel that he fortune and he fame be both secure yet in truth the campaign be not a great poem nor properly speak if we except the angel a poem at all it be simply a _ gazette _ do into tolerable rhyme and its chief inspiration come from its zealous party-feeling marlborough though a first-rate marshal be not a great man not by any means so great as wellington far less as napoleon and how can a heroic poem be write without a hero yet the poem fall in with the humor of the time and be cry up as though it have be another book of the iliad shortly afterwards he publish he travels which be think rather cold and classical to they succeed the opera of rosamond which be ill-set to music fail on the stage but become and be still a favorite in the closet it be in the lightest and easiest style of dryden -- that in which he write alexander 's feast and some other of he lyric -- but be sustain for some fifteen hundred line with a energy and a grace which we doubt if even dryden could have equal its verse not only move but dance the spirit be genial and sunny and above the mazy motion shine the light of genuine poetry johnson truly say that if addison have cultivate this style he would have excel from the date of the campaign addison 's life become a ascend scale of promotion we find he first in hanover with lord halifax then appoint under-secretary to sir charle hodge and in a few month after to the earl of sunderland in 1708 he be elect member for malmesbury and the next year he accompany thoma earl of wharton lord-lieutenant of ireland to that country as he secretary and become keeper of the record in birmingham 's tower -- a nominal office worth # 300 a-year he secretary 's salary be # 2000 per annum previous to this he have resume he intimacy with steele to whom he lend money and on one occasion be say to have recover it by send a bailiff to he house this have be call heartless conduct but the probability be that addison be provoke by the extravagant use make of the loan by he reckless friend in parliament it be well-known addison never speak but he surround himself in private life with a parliament of he own and like cato give he little senate law that senate consist of steele ambrose phillip the wretched eustace budgell who afterwards drown himself sometimes swift and pope and ultimately tickell who become he most confidential friend and the depositor of he literary remains in mixed society he be silent but with a few select spirit around he and especially after the good wine do the good office of banish he bashfulness and taciturnity he become the most delightful and fascinating of converser the staple of he conversation be quiet sly humor but there be fine sentiment touch of pathos and now and then imagination peep over like a alp above meaner hill swift alone we suspect be he match but he power lay rather in severe and pungent sarcasm in broad coarse though unsmiling wit and at time in the fierce and terrible sally of misanthropic rage and despair addison on leave england have by he modesty geniality and amiable manners become the most popular man in the country so much so that say swift he might be king a ' he have a mind in ireland -- although he sit as member for cavan and appear in parliament to have get beyond he famous i conceive -- i conceive -- i conceive -- -lrb- have as the wag observe conceive three time and bring forth nothing -rrb- and speak sometimes if not often -- he do not feel himself at home he must have loathe the licentious and corrupt wharton and feel besides a longing for the society of london the _ nocte coenoeque deûm _ he have leave behind he it be in ireland however that he real literary career begin steele in the spring of 1709 have commence the _ tatler _ a thrice-a-week miscellany of foreign news town gossip short sharp papers _ de omnibus rebus et guibusdum aliis _ with a sprinkling of moral and literary criticism when addison hear of this scheme he readily lend he aid to it and then as honest richard admit i fare like a distressed prince who call in a powerful neighbor to he aid -- i be undo by my auxiliary to the _ tatler _ addison contribute a number of papers which if slighter than he better one in the _ spectator _ be nevertheless highly characteristic of he singular power of observation character-painting humor and invention in November 1709 he return to england and not long after he share in the downfall of he party and lose he secretaryship this also be think to have injure he in a tender point he have already conceive a affection for the countess-dowager of warwick who have be dispose to encourage the address of the secretary but look coldly on those of the mere man and scribbler joseph addison who to crown he misfortune at this time have resign he fellowship suffer some severe pecuniary loss of a kind and from a quarter which be both obscure and be tremble lest he should be deprive of he small irish office too yet although reduce and well-nigh beggared never do he mind approve itself more rich besides write a great deal in the _ tatler _ he publish a political journal call the _ whig examiner _ in which although the wit we think be not so fine as in he _ freeholder _ there be a vigor and masculine energy which he have seldom equal elsewhere when it expire swift exult over its death in term which sufficiently prove that he be annoyed and oppressed by its life he might well say johnson rejoice at the death of that which he could not have kill on the 2d of January 1711 the last _ tatler _ come forth and on the 1st of the follow march appear the _ spectator _ which be now the main pillar of addison 's fame and the fullest revelation of he exquisite genius without be as a whole a great or in any part of it a profound work there be few production which if lose would be more miss in literature one recline on its page as on pillow the sweetness of the spirit -- the tremble beauty of the sentence like that of a twilight wave just touch by the west wind 's balmy breath -- the nice stroke of humor so gentle yet so overpowering -- the feminine delicacy and refinement of the allusion -- the art which so dexterously conceal itself -- the mild enthusiasm for the work of man and god which glow in all its serious effusion -- the good nature of its satire -- the geniality of its criticism -- the everlasting April of the style so soft and vivid -- the purity and healthiness of the moral tone -- and the childlike religion which breathe in the Saturday papers -- one or two of which such as the vision of mirza be almost scriptural in spirit and beautiful simplicity -- combine to throw a charm around the _ spectator _ which work of far loftier pretension if they need not certainly do not possess macaulay -lrb- whom we love for he love of addison and bunyan more than for aught else about he work -rrb- truly observe that few writer have discover so much variety and inventiveness as addison who in the papers of a single week sometimes traverse the whole gamut of literature supply keen sarcasm rich portraiture of character the epistle the tale the allegory the apologue the moral essay and the religious meditation -- all first-rate in quality and all suggest the idea that he resource be boundless and that the half have not be tell he criticism have be ridicule as shallow but while he lucubration on milton be useful in they day as plain finger-post quietly point up to the stupendous sublimity of the theme he essay on wit be subtle and he papers on the pleasure of imagination throw on the beautiful topic a light like that of a red evening west give and receive glory from the autumnal landscape in the end of 1712 the _ spectator _ which have circulate at one time to the extent of 4000 copy a-day be discontinue and in a few week the _ guardian _ supply its place it be two month ere addison begin to write and during that time it be flippantly dull but when he appear its character change and he contribution to the new periodical be quite as good as the best of he _ spectator _ in April 1713 he cato be act with immense success and in circumstance so well know that they need not be detail at length pope write the prologue booth enact the hero steele pack the house peer both tory and whig crowd the box clap of applause be echo back from high churchman to the member of the kit-cat club bolingbroke send fifty guinea during the progress of the play to booth for defend the cause of liberty against a perpetual dictator -lrb- marlborough -rrb- and with the exception of growl denni everybody be in rapture the play have long find its level it have passage of power and thought of beauty but it have one radical fault -- formality mandeville describe addison as a parson in a tie-wig cato be a parson without the tie-wig a intolerable mixture of the patriot and the pedant few would now give one of the _ spectator 's _ little papers about sir roger de coverley for a century of cato in September 1713 the _ guardian _ stop but in June 1714 addison now separate from steele who be carry on a political paper call the _ englishman _ add a eighth volume to the _ spectator _ its contents be more uniformly serious than those of the first seven volume and it contain besides addison 's matchless papers some only inferior to these especially four by mr grove a dissent minister in taunton it be record in boswell that baretti have on the continent meet with grove 's paper on novelty it quicken he curiosity to visit britain for he think if such be the lighter periodical essay of we author they production on more weighty occasion must be wonderful indeed when george i succeed to the throne addison 's fortune begin to improve a council have be appoint to manage matter till the king arrive addison be choose they secretary and afterwards he go over again to ireland in he old capacity sunderland be now lord-lieutenant here much as he differ from swift in politics he resume he intimacy with he -- a intimacy consider the disposition of the two man singular as though a lamb and a flayed bear be to form a alliance in 1715 we poet return to england and obtain a seat at the board of trade early in the year he bring out anonymously on the stage he comedy of the drummer which be coldly receive and towards the close of it he commence a very clever periodical call the _ freeholder _ we only meet with this series a few year ago but can assure we reader that some of the most delectable bit of addison be to be find in it there be a tory fox-hunter yet ride along there whom we would advise you to join if you would enjoy one of the richest treat of humor and there be a jacobite army still on its way to preston the only danger connect with approach which be lest you be kill with laughter shortly after occur he famous quarrel with pope to which we have already refer in we life of that poet and do not intend to recur next year addison 's long courtship come to a successful close he wed the dowager warwick go to reside at holland-house and become miserable for life she be a proud imperious woman who instead of seek to wean addison from he convivial habit -lrb- if such habit in any excessive measure be he -rrb- drive he deeper into the slough by she bitter word and haughty carriage the tavern which have formerly be he occasional resort become now he nightly refuge in 1717 he receive he highest civil honor be make secretary of state under lord sunderland but as usual the slave soon appear in the chariot he health begin to break down and asthma soon oblige he to resign he office on receive a retire pension of # 1500 a-year next steele and he have take opposite side in politics get engage in a paper war -- steele in the _ plebeian _ and addison in the _ old whig _ and personality of a disagreeable kind pass between the two friend in the meantime addison be die fast dropsy have supervene on asthma and the help of physician be vain he prepare himself like a man and a christian to meet the last stern foe he send for gay and ask he forgiveness for some act of unkindness he have do he gay grant it although utterly ignorant of what the offence have be he have probably on account of he toryism be deprive through addison 's means of some preferment he entrust he work to the care of tickell and dedicate they to cragg he successor in the secretaryship in a touching and beautiful letter write a few day before he death he call it be say the young earl of warwick he wife 's son a very dissipate young man and of unsettled religious principle to he bedside and say i have send for you that you may see how a christian can die he breathe he last on the 17th June 1709 forty-seven year old and leave one child a daughter who die at a advanced age at bilton warwickshire in 1797 he funeral take place at dead of night in westminster abbey bishop atterbury meet the procession and read the service by torch-light he be lay beside he friend montague and in a few month he successor cragg be lay beside he nearly a century elapse ere the present monument be erect over he dust tickell write a fine poem to he memory and a splendid edition of he work be publish by subscription in 1721 addison be cut off in the prime of life and interrupted in some literary undertaking and project of great pith and moment he have write a portion of a treatise on the evidence of christianity and be meditate some work such as a metrical version of the psalm and a tragedy on the history of socrate still more suitable to he cast of mind we have already indicate we opinion alike of addison 's character and genius but must be permit a few closing remark both partook of the feminine type he be a amiable and highly gifted rather than a strong or great man he shrink timidity of temperament he singular modesty of manners he quiet sly power of humorous yet kindly observation he minute style of criticism even the peculiar cast of he piety all serve to stamp the lady-man in taciturnity alone he bear the sex no resemblance and hence it be that campbell in poetry and addison in prose be or be the great favorite of female reader he have many weakness but as in the character of woman they appear beautiful and cognate to he gentle nature he fear of give offence be one of the most prominent of these in he writings and in he life he seem always tread on thin ice pope say truly of he -- he hint a fault and hesitate dislike but this be not owe to malice but to the bashful good nature which distinguish he it be true too that he hint a beauty and hesitate in he expression of love he say himself the finest thing and then blush as if detect in a crime or he praise a obvious and colossal merit in another and then start at the sound himself have make he encomium resemble the evening talk of lover be low sweet and tremble be we to speak of addison phrenologically we should say that next to veneration wit and ideality he principal faculty be caution and secretiveness he be cautious to the brink of cowardice we fancy he in a considerable fright in the storm on the ligurian gulf amidst the exhalation of the unhealthy campagna and while the avalanche of the alp -- the thunderbolt of snow -- be fall around he we know that he walk about behind the scene perspire with agitation while the fate of cato be still undecided have it fail addison never could as dr johnson when ask how he feel after irene be damned have reply like the monument we know too that he seek to soothe the fury and stroke down the angry bristle of john denni to call the author of the campaign a coward be go too far but he feel we believe more of a martial glow while write it in he haymarket garret than have he mingle in the fray and as to he secretiveness he still deep scarce-rippling stream of humor he habit commemorate by swift when he find any man invincibly wrong of flattering he opinion by acquiescence and sink he yet deeper in absurdity even the fact that no word be find more frequently in he writings than secret -lrb- secret joy secret satisfaction secret solace be phrase constantly occur -rrb- prove that whatever else he have possess of the female character the title of the play a wonder -- a woman keep a secret have be no paradox in reference to he have he lip in general bar by the double bolt of caution and secretiveness one cease to wonder that the invisible spirit of wine be welcome by he as a key to open occasionally the rich treasure of he mind but that he be a habitual drunkard be one calumny that he write he best _ spectator _ when too much excite with wine be another and that he die drunk be a third -- and the most atrocious of all propagate though it have be by walpole and byron he habit however be undoubtedly too careless and convivial and there use to be a float tradition in holland-house that when meditate he writings there he be wont to walk along a gallery at each end of which stand a separate bottle out of both of which he never fail _ en passant _ to sip this after all however may be only a mythical fable while as a author the favorite of lady of the young and of catholic-minded critic generally addison have have and have still severe and able detractor who be wont to speak of he in such a manner as this : -- he be a highly cultivate artist but not one thought of any vivid novelty do he put out in all he many book you become placid read he but think of ossian and shakspeare and be silent he be a lapidary polish pebble -- a pretty art but not vest with the glory of sculpture nor the mathematical magnitude of architecture he do not walk a demigod but a stiff anglicised imitator of french pace he be a symmetrical but a small invisible personage at rapier practice now clever as this be it only prove that addison be not a shakspeare or milton he do not pretend to be either he be no demigod but he be a man a lady-man if you will but the lovelier on that account besides he be cut off in he prime and when he might have girt himself up to achieve greater thing than he have do and although the french taste of he age somewhat affect and chill he genius yet he know of other model than racine and boileau he drink of siloa 's brook he admire and imitate the poetry of the bible he love not indeed its wilder and higher strain he get giddy on the top of lebanon the valley of dry bone he tread with timid step and he look up to the terrible crystal be more of fright than of exultation but the lovelier softer simpler and more pensive part of the bible be very dear to the gentle _ spectator _ and be finely if faintly reproduce in he writings indeed the principle which would derogate from addison 's work would lead to the depreciation of portion of the scripture too ruth be not so grand as the revelation the song of solomon be not so sublime as the song of song which be isaiah 's and the story of joseph have not the mystic grandeur or rush fire of ezekiel 's prophecy but there they be in the same book of god and be even dearer to many heart than the loftier portion and so with addison 's papers beside the work of bacon milton and coleridge he poetry be now in we reader ' hand and should be read with a candid spirit they will admire the elegance and gracefully-used learning of the epistle to halifax they will not be astonish at the campaign but they will regard it with interest as the lever which first lift addison into he true place in society and letter they will find much to please they in he verse to dryden somer king william and he ode on st cecilium 's day and they will pause with peculiar fondness over those delightful hymn some of which they have sing or repeat from infancy which they will find again able to beat the heavenward flame and start the tender and pious tear and which be of themselves sufficient to rank addison high on the list of christian poet -lrb- footnote 1 : among these other be abraham stanyan plenipotentiary extraordinary at neufchatel at the settlement of the rival claim of the duke of brandenberg holland and france to that principality he be afterwards ambassador to france he marry a daughter of dr

and from you judgment must expect my fate who free from vulgar passion be above degrading envy or misguided love if you well pleased shall smile upon my lay secure of fame my voice i 'll boldly raise

dusty plain when through the thick embattled line he break now plunge amidst the foe now lose in cloud of smoke _ 20 oh that some muse renown for lofty verse in daring number would thy toil rehearse

notwithstanding he fault and feebleness now find a vent the prince and princess of wale not only subscribe but give he a liberal present and some of the nobility who regard he as a agreeable plaything and lapdog of genius take a number of copy the result be that he gain a thousand pound he ask the advice of he friend how to dispose of this sum and as usual take he own lewi steward to lord oxford advise he to entrust it to the fund and live on the interest arbuthnot to live upon the principal pope and swift to buy a annuity gay prefer to sink it in the south-sea bubble then in all its glory at

not have bear any other to make for he he next condescend to court mr howard the mistress of george ii and that good howard commemorate in the heart of mid-lothian but this too be in vain and then he retire from the attempt growl out probably -lrb- if we can imagine he in fable not as queen caroline call he the hare but a bear -rrb- the word put not you faith in prince he be the more excusable as two year before sir robert walpole have for he surmised toryism turn he out of the office of commissioner of the lottery which have bring he in # 150 a-year but now for once gay catch fortune on the

pastoral would make on this hint gay act prefer however to expand it into a comedy hence come the beggar ' opera a hit in literature second to none that ever occur in that fluctuate region it be first perform in 1728 although much of it have be write before and only a few satirical stroke found on he disappointment at court attest they recent origin swift and pope watch its progress with interest but without hope congreve pronounce that it would either take greatly or be damned confoundedly gibber at drury lane refuse it it be accept by he rival rich and soon the _ on dit _ run that it have make gay rich and rich gay on its first night there be a brilliant assemblage what painter shall give they head and face on that anxious evening -- swift 's lower front -- pope 's bright eye contrast with the blind orb of congreve -lrb- if _ he _ indeed be there -rrb- -- addison 's quiet thoughtful physiognomy as of one retire into some vision of mirza -- the duke of argyle with he star and stately form and animated countenance -- and poor gay himself perhaps like some other play-wright in the same predicament perspire with trepidation as if again about to recite the captive at first uncertainty prevail among the patron-critic and strange look be exchange between swift and pope till by and by the latter hear argyle exclaim it will do it must do i see it in the eye of 'em and then the critic breathe freely and the applause become incontrollable and the curtain close at last amidst thunder of applause and gay go home triumphant amidst a circle of friend who do not know whether

we suspect when we life of william somerville be end not a few will find in it a parallel for that comprehensive chapter although we strenuously maintain that the fault of a insipid and uninteresting life be not always to be charge on the biographer in sartor resartus we reader remember a epitaph somewhat coarse although disguise in good dog-latin upon a country squire and he saying and doings in this world we have not a copy of that work at hand and can not quote the epitaph nor would we though we could since even the dog-latin be too plain and perspicuous for many reader we recommend those however who choose to turn it up and they will find in it -lrb- with the exception of the writing of the chase -rrb- the full history of william somerville of whom we know little but that he be bear that he hunt eat drink and die he be bear in 1682 but in what month or on what day we be not inform he estate be in warwickshire its name edston and he have inherit it from a long line of ancestor he family pride itself upon be the first family in the county he himself boast of have be bear on the bank of avon which have thus at least produce two poet of somewhat different calibre indeed -- the one a deer-stealer and the other a fox-hunter -- shakspeare and somerville somerville be educate at winchester school and be afterwards elect fellow of new college from he study -- of he success in which we know nothing -- he return to he native county and there say johnson be distinguish as a poet a gentleman and a skilful and useful justice of the peace -- we may add as a jovial companion and a daring fox-hunter he estate bring he in about # 1500 a-year but he extravagance bring he into pecuniary distress which weigh upon he mind plunge he into intemperate habit and hurry he away in he 60th year shenstone who know he well thus mourn aver he departure in one of he letter : -- we old friend somerville be dead i do not imagine i could have be so sorry as i find myself on this occasion _ sublatum quoerimus _ i can now excuse all he foible impute they to age and to distressed circumstance the last of these consideration wring my very soul to think on for a man of high spirit

great age have a jointure of # 600 he describe himself in verse address to allan ramsay as a squire well-born and six foot high he seem from the affection and sympathy discover for he by shenstone to have possess the virtue as well as the vice of the squirearchy of that age they frankness sociality and heart as well as they improvidence and tendency to excess and may altogether be call a sublimate squire western as to he poetry much of it be beneath criticism he fable tale hobbinol or rural game & c have all in they poetical line but can not as a whole be call poetry he write some verse entitle address to addison on the latter purchase a estate in warwickshire -lrb- he give he countess # 4000 in exchange for it -rrb- in this there be two line which dr johnson highly commend say they be write with the most exquisite delicacy of praise they exhibit one of those happy stroke that be seldom attain -- here be this bepraised couplet : -- when pant virtue she last effort make you bring you clio to the virgin 's aid clio of course refer to addison 's signature in the spectator consist of the four letter compose the name of the muse of history use in alternation we can not coincide in johnson 's encomium the allusion be we think at once indecent and obscure and what after all do it say but that addison 's papers aid the struggle cause of virtue in the same verse we find a fulsome and ridiculous preference of addison to shakspeare in heaven he sing on earth you muse supply the important loss and heal we weep eye correctly great she melt each flinty heart with equal genius but superior art surely the force of falsehood and flattery can go no further it be a pleasure to turn from these small and shallow thing to the chase which if not a great poem be found on a most poetical subject and which here and there sparkle into fine fancy dr johnson truly remark that somerville set a good example to man of he own class by devote a part of he time to elegant knowledge and have shew by the subject which he poetry have adorn that it be practicable to be at once a skilful sportsman and a man of letter but besides this purpose to be the poet -- and hitherto he have be almost the sole poet of the squirearchy as consider apart from the aristocracy -- somerville have the merit of be inspire by a genuine love for the subject he write directly from the testimony of he own eye and the impulse of he own heart he have obviously have the mould of he poem suggest by thomson 's season but it be the mould only the thought and feeling which be pour into it be he own he love the giddy ride over stock and stone hedge and petty precipice the invigoration which the keen breath of autumn or winter like that of a sturdy veteran give the animal spirit the animated aspect of the assemble jockeyship of half a province the wild music of hound and horn and holla vie with each other in mirth and loudness the breathless interest of the start the emulous pant of the courser the excitement of the moment when the fox appear the sweeping tumult of the pursuit the dreamlike rapidity with which five-barred gate be clear the yellow or naked wood be pass and the stubble-ridge swallow up in the fierceness and rage of the rush steed the indifference of those engage in the headlong sport to the danger or even the death of they companion the lengthening and deepen howl of the hound as they near they prey the fierce silence of the die victim and the fiercer shout of victory which announce to the echo that the brush be win and the glorious -lrb- or inglorious -rrb- day 's work be over -- all this somerville love and have paint with considerable power in the course of the poem he sing also of the mystery of the dog-kennel -- pursue the blood-hound on he track of death -- describe a stag-hunt in windsor forest -- paint the fearful phenomenon of canine madness -- hunt the hare in a joyous spirit -- and go down after the otter into its watery recess and watch its diving and devious motion as with the eye of a sea-eagle and besides -lrb- here also imitate thomson -rrb- he be lead away from the comparatively tame chase of england to the more dangerous and more inspiring sport of other land where the huntsman be up in arabium in pursuit of the wolf where the bear be bay amidst forest dark as itself where the leopard be snare by its own image in a mirror where the lion fall roar into the prepared pit and where the chase be pursue on a large scale by assemble prince amidst the jungle of indium we doubt not however that be a genuine poet of this age take up the chase as a subject for song and avail himself of the account of recent traveller themselves often true poet such as lloyd livingstone cum bruce and charle boner -lrb- see the admirable chamoix hunting in bavarium of the latter -rrb- he would produce a strain incomparably higher than somerville 's wilson at least as we know from he christopher in he sport jacket and many other article in _ maga _ be qualify in part by nature and in part by extensive experience to have write such a poem indeed one sentence of he be superior to anything in the chase speaking of the charge of the cruelty of chase such a insignificant animal as a fox he say what though it be but a smallish reddish-brown sharp-nosed animal with pricked-up ear and passionately fond of poultry that they pursue after the first tallyho reynard be rarely see till he be run in upon -- once perhaps in the whole run skirt a wood or cross a common it be a _ idea that be pursued _ on a whirlwind of horse to a storm of canine music worthy both of the largest lion that ever leap among a band of moor sleep at midnight by a extinguish fire on the african sand we do not answer for the humanity of this description but
