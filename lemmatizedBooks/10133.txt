repeat in she daughter 's eye the vigil of venus the _ pervigilium veneri _ -- of unknown authorship but clearly belong to the late literature of the roman empire -- have survive in two mss both preserve at paris in the _ bibliothèque nationale _ of these two mss the better write may be assign -lrb- at earliest -rrb- to the close of the seventh century the other -lrb- again at earliest -rrb- to the close of the ninth both be corrupt the work of two illiterate copyist who -- strange to say -- be both smatterer enough to betray they little knowledge by convert _ pervigilium _ into _ per virgilium _ -lrb- _ scilicet _ by virgil -rrb- : thus help we to follow the process of think by which the middle age turn virgil into a wizard here and there the text become quite silly separately or in consent and just where they agree in the most surprising way -- _ ie _ in the arrangement of the line -- the conjectural emendator be invite to do he worst by a note at the head of the older codex sunt vero versus xxii -- there be rightly twenty-two line this have start much ingenious guess-work but no really convincing rearrangement have be achieve as yet and i have be content to take the text pretty well as it stand with a few correction upon which most scholar agree with a poem of paratactic structure the best of we may easily go astray by transpose line or block of line to correspond with _ we _ sequence of thought and i shall be content if follow the only text to which appeal can be make -lrb- 1 -rrb- my translation be generally intelligible it run pretty closely line for line with the original because one may love and emulate classical terseness even while despair to rival it but it do not attempt to be literal for even be it worth do i doubt if it be possible for anyone in we day to hit precisely the note intend by a author or hear by a reader in the eighth century man change subtly as nation succeed to nation religion to religion philosophy to philosophy and it be a property of immortal poetry to shift its appeal it do not live by continue to mean the some thing it grow as we grow we smile for instance when some interlocutor in a dialogue of plato take a line from the _ iliad _ and apply it seriously _ au pie de la lettre _ we can hardly conceive what the great line convey to he but it may mean something equally serious to we though in a different way
