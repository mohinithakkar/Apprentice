produce by dagny and david widger with zolum in england a story of exile tell by ernest alfr vizetelly to violette and to victor to dora and to both marie dear wife and romp daughter i lovingly inscribe this little book he beg for light lo darkness fall and round he cast its stifle pall in vain he clamour ev'ry hell pour forth its fume to drown he call he cry for truth lo falsehood come in robe of impudence array would pollute patriotism 's name degrading honor to a trade he ask for justice lo between he and the judgment-seat there rise the sword of menace ever keen to smite the braggart war-wolf 's foe light truth and justice all deny he struggle on ` mid threat and blow -- a brave voice battle by he side -- till error 's minion strike he low yet be he faith not dead nor mine : o'er deepest gloom o'er worst distress ever the mighty sun doth shine aglow with truth and righteousness the blackest cloud be rent at last and the divine resistless flame through all some morn its blaze shall cast the wrong disclose the right proclaim e a v February 23 1898 -lrb- print in ` the star ' on the morrow of m zolum 's condemnation in pari -rrb- preface all that i claim for this little book reprint from the column of ` the evening news ' be the quality of frankness i do not desire to check or disarm criticism but i have a right to point out that i have perform my work rapidly and have largely subordinate certain literary consideration to a desire to write my story naturally and simply in much the same way as i should have tell it in conversation with a friend very rarely i think have i depart from this rule the book supply a accurate account of emile zolum 's exile in this country but some matter i have treat briefly because he himself propose to give the world -- probably in diary form -- some impression of he sojourn in england with a record of he feeling day by day whilst the great campaign in favor of the unfortunate alfred dreyfus be in progress first however m zolum intend to collect in a volume all he publish declaration article and letter on the affair secondly he will recount in another volume he trial at pari and versaille and only in a third volume will he be able to deal with he english experience the last work can scarcely be ready before the end of 1900 and possibly it may not appear until the following year and this be one of the reason which have induce I to offer to all who be interested in the great french writer this present narrative of mine should the master 's promise record duly appear my own will sink into oblivion but if for one or another reason m zolum be prevent from carry out he plan here then will at least be find some account of one of the most curious passage in he life and then perchance my narrative may attain to the rank of _ memoire pour servir _ i have say that i claim for my book the quality of frankness in this connection i may point out that i have make in it a full confession of certain delinquency which be force on I by circumstance i trust however that my brother-journalist will forgive I if i occasionally lead they astray with regard to m zolum 's presence in england for i do so purely and simply in the interest of the illustrious friend who have place himself in my hand that m zolum should have apply to I directly he arrive in london will surprise none of those who be aware of the confidence he have for several year repose in I a newspaper refer to we connection recently call the great novelist ` my employer ' but there have never be any question of employer or employ between mr zolum and I i should certainly never think of accept remuneration for any little service i might have be able to render he nor would he dream of hurt my feeling by offer it no the simple truth be that for some year now i have translate m zolum 's novel into english and that i have take my share of the proceeds of the translation for the rest we intercourse have be purely and simply that of friend it be because i believe i know and understand emile zolum so well that i never once lose confidence in he throughout the event which lead to he exile in england that exile curiously enough i foreshadow in a letter address to the ` star ' some month before it actually begin when however one have be intimate with the french for thirty year or so it be not to my think so very difficult to tell what be likely to happen in a give french crisis the unexpected have to be reckon with of course and much depend on ability to estimate the form which the unexpected may take here experience familiarity with detail of contemporary french history and personal knowledge of the man concern in the issue become indispensable on January 16 1898 three day after m zolum 's famous ` j' accuse ' letter appear in ` l'aurore ' and two day before the french government instruct the public prosecutor to proceed against its author i write to the ` westminster gazette ' a long letter deal with m zolum 's position in this letter which appear in the issue of the 19th i begin by establish a comparison between zolum and voltaire whose action with regard to the memory of jean cala i briefly epitomise curiously enough at that moment m zolum as i afterwards learn be tell the pari correspondent of the ` daily chronicle ' that the opposition offer to he advocacy of the cause of alfred dreyfus be identical with that encounter by voltaire in he championship of cala this be a curious little coincidence for i write my letter without have any communication with m zolum respect it it contain some pass which i here venture to quote in a book deal with the great novelist these passage may not be out of place as they serve to illustrate he general attitude towards the dreyfus case ` truth ' i write ` have be the one passion of emile zolum 's life \* may all be reveal so that all may be cure have be he sole motto in deal with social problem light more light -- the last word gasp by goethe on he death-bed -- have ever be he cry hold the view he hold he could not do otherwise than come forward at this crisis in french history as the champion of truth and justice silence on he part would have be a denial of all he principle all he past life against he be marshal all the power of darkness all the energy of those who prefer concealment to light all the enmity of the military hierarchy which have never forget la debacle all the hatred of the roman hierarchy which will never forgive lourde and rome and the fetish of patriotism be brandish hither and thither rally even free-thinker to the cause of concealment while each and every appeal for light and truth be meet by the clamorous cry : down with the dirty jew \* he himself write these very word seventeen month later in he article ` justice ' publish in pari on he return from exile ` for even as jean cala be guilty of be a protestant so be alfred dreyfus guilty of be a jew and at the present hour unhappily there be million of french people who can no more believe in a jew 's innocence than they forerunner could believe a protestant to be guiltless zolum for he part be no jew nor can he even be call a friend of the jew -- in several of he book he have attack they somewhat violently for certain tendency show by some of they number -- but most assuredly do he regard they as fellow-men and not as loathsome animal in the same way voltaire write pungent page against the narrow practice of calvinism and yet espouse the cause of cala and sirven even as zolum have espouse that of dreyfus the only remain question be whether zolum will prove as successful as he famous forerunner -lrb- nearly the whole of the european press be at that stage express doubt on this point -rrb- in this connection i may say that i regard zolum as a man of very calm methodical judicial mind he be no ranter no lover of word for word ' sake no fiery enthusiast each of he book be a most laborious painstaking piece of work if he ever bring forward a theory he base it on a mountain of evidence and he invariably subordinate he feeling to he reason i therefore venture to say that if he have come forward so prominently in this dreyfus case it be not because he _ feel _ that wrong have be do but because he be absolutely _ convinced _ of it doubtless many of the expression in he recent letter to president faure have come from he heart but they be in the first place dictate by he reason it be not for I here and at the present hour to speak of proof however great may be public curiosity but most certainly zolum have not take up this case without what he consider to be abundant proof i do not say he will be able to prove each and every item of he great indictment but when you wish to bring everything to light it be often necessary to cast you net so wide that none shall escape it none linger in concealment with they action unexplained and i take it that whatever be the verdict of zolum 's countryman whether or not alfr dreyfus be again and this time absolutely prove guilty zolum himself will have do good work in strive to bring the whole truth to light so that it shall be as evident to one and all as the very sun itself and this when all be say be really zolum 's one great object in this terrible business ' i may add that he be risk far more than he great predecessor risk in favor of cala voltaire plead from he retirement on the swiss frontier zolum plead the cause he have adopt on the very spot on the very scene of all the agitation anonymous assassin threaten he with death in letter and postcard fanatical jew-baiter march through the street anxious for a opportunity to wreck he house and murder not only himself but he wife also in the sacred name of patriotism \* should they menace be escape there remain the assize court with a jury that will need to be brave indeed if it be to resist all the pressure of a deliberately organise terror at the end possibly lie imprisonment fine disgrace ruin how jubilantly some be already rub they hand in the bishop ' palace the parsonage the sacristy of france ah no stone will be keep unturned to secure a conviction but emile zolum do not waver it may be the truth the whole truth will only be know to the world in some distant century but he anxious to hasten its advent and prevent the irreparable courageously stake all that he have person position fame affection and friendship and this he do for no personal object whatsoever but in the sole cause of truth and justice ever repeat the cry common to both goethe and himself : light more light \* there be not the slightest doubt that m zolum incur the greatest personal danger between January and April 1898 m ranc the old and try republican who know what danger be have lately pointed this out in forcible term in the pari journal _ le matin _ ` ah to all the true heart that have follow and love he through year of mingled blame and praise hard-earned victory and unmerited revile he be at this hour dearer even than he be before for he have now put the seal upon he principle and to the force of precept have add that of the most courageous personal example ' this then be what i write immediately after the publication of zolum 's letter ` j' accuse ' base myself simply on my knowledge of the master 's character of the passion let loose in france and of a few matter connect with the dreyfus case then keep secret but now public property and have i to write anything of the kind at the present time i should i think have but few word to alter beyond substitute the past for the present or future tense in one respect i be mistaken i do not imagine the truth to be quite so near at hand since January 1898 however nine-tenth of it have be reveal and the rest must now soon follow and i hold as all hold who know the inner workings of l'affaire dreyfus that m zolum 's exile like he letter to president faure and he repeated trial for libel have in a large degree contribute to this victory of truth for by go into voluntary banishment he keep not only he own but also dreyfus 's case ` open ' and thus help to foil the last desperate attempt that be be make to prevent the truth from be discover i should add that in the follow page i deal very slightly with l'affaire dreyfus on which so many book have already be write indeed as a rule i have only touch on those incident which have any marked influence on m zolum during he sojourn in this country e a v merton surrey June 1899 with zolum in england i zola leave france from the latter part of the month of July 1898 down to the end of the ensue August a frequent head to newspaper telegram and paragraph be the query ` where be zolum ' the wildest supposition concern the eminent novelist 's whereabouts be indulge in and the most contradictory report be circulate it be on July 18 that m zolum be try by default at versaille and sentence to twelve month ' imprisonment on the charge of have libel in he letter ` j' accuse ' the military tribunal which have acquit commandant esterhazy on the evening of the 19th he disappearance be signal by various telegram from paris most of these assert that he have go on a tour to norway a course which the ` daily news ' correspondent declare to be very sensible on m zolum 's part give the tropical heat which then prevail in the french metropolis on the 20th however the telegram give out that zolum have leave paris on the previous evening by the 835 express for lucerne be accompany by he wife and she maid later the same day appear a graphic account of how he have dine at a paris restaurant and thence despatch a waiter to the eastern railway station to procure ticket for himself and a friend the very number of these ticket be give yet a further telegram assert that he have be recognize by a fellow-passenger have leave the train before reach the swiss frontier and have gaily continue he journey on a bicycle but another newspaper correspondent treat this account as pure invention and pledge he word that m zolum have go to holland by way of brussels on July 21 he destination be again allege to be norway but -- so desperate be the effort make to reconcile all the conflict rumor -- he route be say to lie through switzerland luxemburg and the netherland he wife -lrb- so the papers report -rrb- be with he and they be bicycling up hill and down dale through the aforenamed country two day later it be declare that he have actually be recognize at a cafe in brussels whence he have flee in consequence of the threat of the customer who be enraged ` by the presence of such a traitor ' then he repair to antwerp where he be also recognize and where he promptly embark on board a steamer bind for christianium however on July 25 the ` petit journal ' authoritatively assert that all the report hitherto publish be erroneous m zolum say the pari print be simply hide in the suburb of pari hope to reach le havre by night and thence sail for southampton but fortunately the prefecture of police be acquaint with he plan and at the first movement he might make he would be arrest that same morning we own ` daily chronicle ' announce m zolum 's presence at a london hotel and on the follow day the ` morning leader ' be in a position to state that the hotel in question be the grosvenor both ` chronicle ' and ` leader ' be right but as i have receive press instruction to contradict all rumor of m zolum 's arrival in london i do so in this instance through the medium of the press association i here frankly acknowledge that i thus deceive both the press and the public i act in this way however for weighty reason which will hereafter appear at this point i would simply say that m zolum 's interest be in my estimation of far more consequence than the claim of public curiosity however well mean and even flattering its nature one effect of the press association 's contradiction be to revive the norway and switzerland story several papers while adhering to the statement that m zolum have be in london add that he have since leave england with he wife and that hamburg be they immediate destination and thus the game go merrily on m zolum 's arrival at hamburg be duly report then he sail on the ` capellum ' for bergen where he advent be chronicle by reuter next he be set out for trondhiem whence in a few day he would join he friend bjornstjerne bjornson the novelist at the latter 's estate of aulestad in the gudbrandsdalen bjornson as it happen be then at munich in germany but this circumstance do not weigh for a moment with the newspaper the norway story be so generally accept that a report be spread to the effect that m zolum have solicit a audience of the emperor william who be in norway about that time and that the kaiser have peremptorily refuse to see he so great be the imperial desire to do nothing of a nature to give umbrage to france as i have already mention the only true report -lrb- so far as london be concern -rrb- be those of two english newspaper but even they be inaccurate in several matter of detail for instance the lady currently speak of as mme zolum be my own wife who it so happen be a frenchwoman at a later stage the ` daily mail ' hit the nail on the head by signalling m zolum 's presence at the oatland park hotel but so many report have already prove erroneous the ` mail ' be by no means certain of the accuracy of its information and the dubitative form in which its statement be couch prevent the matter from go further at last a period of comparative quiet set in and though gentleman of the press be still anxious to extract information from I nothing further appear in print as to m zolum 's whereabouts until the ` time ' pari correspondent m de blowitz contribute to he paper early in the present year a most detailed and amusing account of m zolum 's flight from france and he subsequent movement in exile in this narrative one find mme zolum equip she husband with a nightgown for he perilous journey abroad and secrete bank note in the lining of he garment then carry a slip of paper in he hand the novelist have be pass on through london from policeman to policeman until he take train to a village in warwickshire where the little daughter of a innkeeper have recognize he from see he portrait in one of the illustrated newspaper there be something also about he acquaintance with the vicar of the locality and a variety of other particulars all of which help to make up as pretty a romance as the ` time ' reader have be favor with for many a day but excellent as be m de blowitz 's narrative from the romantic standpoint he information be sadly inaccurate of he _ bona fides _ there can be no doubt but some of m zolum 's friend be rather partial to a little harmless joking and it be evident that a trap be lay for the shrewd correspondent of the ` time ' and that he in a unguarded moment fall into it on the incident which immediately precede m zolum 's departure from france i shall here be brief these incident be only know to I by statement i have have from m and mme zolum themselves but the rest be well within my personal knowledge as one of the first thing which m zolum do on arrive in england be to communicate with I and in certain respects place himself in my hand this then be a plain unvarnished narrative -- firstly of the step that i take in the matter in conjunction with a friend who be by profession a solicitor and secondly of the principal incident which mark m zolum 's view on some matter of interest as impart by he to I at various time but ultimately m zolum will himself pen he own private impression and on these i shall not trespass it be because accord to he own statement to I he book on he english impression -lrb- should he write it -rrb- could not possibly appear for another twelve month that i have put these note together the real circumstance then of m zolum 's departure from france be these : on July 18 the day fix for he second trial at versaille he leave paris in a livery-stable brougham hire for the occasion at a cost of fifty franc he companion be he _ fidus achate _ m fernand desmoulin the painter who have already act as he bodyguard at the time of the great trial in pari versaille be reach in due course and the judicial proceedings begin under circumstance which have be chronicle too often to need mention here when m zolum have retire from the court allow judgment to go against he by default he be join by maitre labori he counsel and the pair of they return to pari in the vehicle which have bring m zolum from the city in the morning m desmoulin find a seat in another carriage the brougham convey messr zola and laborus be drive to the residence of m george charpentier the eminent publisher in the avenue du bois de boulogne and there they be presently join by m george clemenceau mme zolum and a few other it be then that the necessity of leave france be press upon m zolum who though he find the proposal little to he liking eventually signify he acquiescence the point urge in favor of he departure abroad be as follow : he must do he utmost to avoid personal service of the judgment give against he by default as the government be anxious to cast he into prison and thus stifle he voice if such service be effect the law would only allow he a few day in which to apply for a new trial and as he could not make default a second time and could not hope at that stage for fresh and decisive evidence in he favor or for a change of tactic on the part of the judge this would mean the absolute and irrevocable loss of he case on the other hand by avoid personal service of the judgment he would retain the right to claim a new trial at any moment he might find convenient and thus not only could he prevent he own case from be close against he and become a _ choose jugee _ but he would contribute powerfully towards keep the whole dreyfus affair open pend revelation which even then be foresee and naturally england which so freely give asylum to all political offender be choose as he proper place of exile the amusing story of the nightgown tuck under he arm and the bank note sew up in he coat be of course pure invention a few toilet article be press upon he and he wife empty she own purse into he own that be all then he set out for the northern railway station where he catch the express leave for calai at 9 pm fortunately enough he secure a first-class compartment which have no other occupant m clemenceau have previously suggest to he that on he arrival at london he might well put up at the grosvenor hotel and it be quite possible that the same gentleman hand he -- as state in the ` time ' narrative -- a slip of paper bear the name of that note hostelry but at all event this paper be never use by m zolum he have a excellent memory and when he reach victorium station at forty minute past five o'clock on the morning of July 19 the name of the hotel where he have arrange to fix he quarter for a few day come readily enough to he lip there be however one thing that he do not know and that be the close proximity of this hotel to the railway station so have secure a hansom he briefly tell the jehu to drive he to the grosvenor at this cabby look down from he perch in sheer astonishment then doubtless in a considerate and honest spirit -- for there be still some considerate and honest cabbie in london -- he try to explain matter at all event he speak at length but m zolum fail to understand he ` grosvenor hotel ' repeat the novelist and then see that the cabby seem bent on further expostulation he resolutely take he seat in the vehicle this driver doubtless after the fashion of certain of he pari colleague must be try to play some trick in order to avoid a long journey it be as well therefore to teach he to refrain from trifle with he ` fare ' however cabby say no more or if he do he word fail to reach m zolum the rein be jerk the scraggy night-horse break into a spasmodic trot turn out of the station and pull up in front of the caravansary which a eminent butcher have do so much to immortalise zolum be astonish at reach he destination with such despatch and suddenly become conscious of the cabby 's real motive in expostulate with he however he ascend the step enter the hotel produce one of the few hundred-franc note which he purse contain and ask first for change and afterwards for a bedroom english money be hand to he for he note and the night porter carry cabby the regulation shilling for the journey of a few yard which have be make then as m zolum have no luggage with he he be request to deposit a sovereign with the hotel clerk and to inscribe he name in the register this he do and the tell-tale signature of be pascal pari ' still remain as a token of the accuracy of this narrative such then be the way in which m zolum travel across london obligingly pass on from policeman to policeman and carry a slip of paper -- a ` way-bill ' as it be -- in he hand as the above account be give to I by himself it will probably be deem more worthy of credit than the amusing romance which be so successfully palm off on m de blowitz of the ` time ' of he journey from pari that night he recline alone in he compartment as the calai express rush across the plain of picardy under a star-lit sky of he embark on board the little channel boat amidst the glimmer of lantern he transference to a fresh train at dover follow by another and even faster rush on to london of he gloomy thought at this sudden severance from one and all at speeding in this lonely fashion into exile and return surreptitiously as it be to the city where but a few year previously he have be receive as one of the king of literature he will ever retain a keen impression it be at victorium that he journey end even as it have end in 1893 but how change the scene he find the station gaunt and well-nigh desert the few passenger be glide away like phantom into the morning air the porter loiter around and the custom officer discharge they duty in a perfunctory sleepy way no crowd of pressman and sightseer be present there be no delegate and address and flower and cheer as of yore only cabby who expostulate and who doubtless think this frenchman a bit of a crank to insist upon be drive just around the corner and at the hotel no army of servant appear to marshal the master to the best suite of room on the principal floor in lieu thereof come a doubtful greet and a demand for a deposit of money for fear lest he should be some vulgar bilker then once he be in the lift he go up and up without stop until the very topmost floor be reach and afterwards he be march along interminable passage with wall paint a crude hideous shade of blue so offensive to all artistic instinct as verily to make one 's gorge rise then at last he find himself in a room which high as it be situate be of lowly common aspect yet he be only too glad to reach it and throw himself on the bed to rest awhile and to think new experience be await he he be far away from the mob that pelt he window with stone and yell ` conspuez conspuez ' whenever he leave he house here there be no hostility here quietude prevail save for the shrill whistle of arrive or depart train yet he be also far from the great majority of he affection and friendship but at this remembrance a fresh thought come to he he take one of he visit card from he pocket-book pencil a few line on it and enclose it in a envelope ready to be post then he again lie down tire as he be after he exciting day at versaille and he wearisome night journey he soon fall soundly asleep ii in london on Tuesday July 19 i go to london on business and do not return to my home in the south-western suburb until nearly seven o'clock in the evening my wife immediately place in my hand a envelope address to I in the handwriting of m zolum at first have notice neither the stamp nor the postmark i imagine that the communication have come from pari on open the envelope however i find that it contain a card on which be write in french and in pencil : -- ` my dear confrere -- tell nobody in the world and particularly no newspaper that i be in london and oblige I by come to see I to-morrow Wednesday at eleven o'clock at grosvenor hotel you will ask for m pascal and above all absolute silence for the most serious interest be at stake ` cordially 'em ile zola ' i be for a moment amaze and also somewhat affect by this message the first address by m zolum to anybody after he departure from france since the publication of he novel ` paris ' which have follow he first trial i have not see he and we have exchange but few letter i have write to express my sympathy over the outcome of the proceedings at versaille but owe to he sudden flitting my note have fail to reach he and now here he be in london -- in exile as curiously enough i myself have foretell as probable some time before in a letter to one of the newspaper my first impulse be to hurry to the grosvenor immediately but i reflect that i might not find he there and that even if i do i might inconvenience he as he have appoint the follow day for my call so i contented myself with telegraph as follow : ` pascal grosvenor hotel -- rely on I tomorrow eleven o'clock ' and as a precautionary measure i sign the telegram merely with my christian name as i afterwards learn m zolum have spend that day companionless walk about the mall and st jame 's park and purchase a shirt a collar and a pair of sock at a shop in or near buckingham palace road where know no english he explain he requirement by pantomime he have further study several street scene and have give some time to wonder what purpose might be serve by a certain ugly elongate building overlook a drive and a park there be a sentry at the gate but the place have such a gaunt clumsy and mournful aspect that m zolum could not possibly picture it as the london palace of she most gracious majesty the queen however evening find he once more in he room at the grosvenor and feeling tired and feverish he lay down and doze when he awake between nine and ten o'clock he perceive a buff envelope on the carpet near by he it have be thrust under the door during he sleep and its presence greatly astonish he for he expect neither letter nor telegram for a moment as he have tell I he imagine this to be some trap wonder if he have be watch and follow to london and almost make up he mind to leave the hotel that night but when after a little hesitation he have open the envelope and read my telegram he realize how groundless have be he alarm on the morrow when i reach the grosvenor and inquire at the office there for m pascal i be ask my name on give which i receive a note from m zolum say that he unexpectedly find himself oblige to go out but would return at 230 pm as i stand reading this note i espied a couple of individual scrutinise I in what i deem a most suspicious manner both be frenchman evidently they wear billycock hat and carry stout stick and one of they swarthy and almost brigandish of aspect have the ribbon of the legion of honor in he buttonhole it be easy to take these individual for french detective and i hastily jump to the conclusion that they be on be pascal 's ' track to make matter even more suspicious when after place zolum 's note in my pocket i begin to cross the vestibule the other deliberately follow I and in all likelihood i should have flee never to return if a well-known figure in a white billycock and gray suit have not suddenly advance towards we from the direction of the staircase in another moment i have exchange greeting with m zolum and my suspicious scrutiniser have be introduce to I as friend one of they be none other than m fernand desmoulin they have arrive from pari that morning and be about to sally forth with m zolum in search of mr fletcher moulton qc to whom they have bring a letter of introduction from maitre laborus hence the note which m zolum have already deposit for I at the hotel office have i be a moment later i should have find they go my arrival lead to a change in the program it be resolve to begin matter with lunch at the hotel itself to postpone the quest for mr fletcher moulton until the afternoon i make at the time a note of we menu the ` bitter bread of exile ' consist on this occasion of a omelet fry sole fillet of beef and potato to wash down this anchoretic fare m desmoulin and myself order sauterne and apollinari but the contents of the water bottle suffice for m zolum and the other gentleman with waiter move to and fro nearly always within hearing there be little conversation at table but we afterwards chat in all freedom in m zolum 's room just under the roof ah that room i have already refer to the dingy aspect which it present around grosvenor hotel encompass its roof run a huge ornamental cornice behind which be the window of room assign i suppose to luggageless visitor from the room themselves there be nothing to be see unless you throw back you head when a tiny patch of sky above the top line of the cornice become visible you be as it be in a gloomy well the back of the cornice with its plaster stain and crack confront you eye and with a little imagination you can easily fancy yourself in a dungeon look into some castle moat ' _ le fosse de vincennes _ ' so m zolum suggest and that sum up everything yet it seem to he very appropriate to he circumstance and he absolutely refuse to exchange room with m desmoulin who be somewhat more comfortably lodge the appointment of m zolum 's chamber be i remember of a summary description there be few chair and so one of we sit on the bed we succeed in procure some black coffee though the chambermaid regard this as a most unusual ` bedroom order ' at that hour of the day and when m desmoulin have light a cigar he friend a pipe and myself a cigarette a regular council of war be hold -lrb- nb -- m zolum give up tobacco in he young day when it be a question of he spending twopence per diem on himself or of allow he mother the wherewithal to buy a extra pound of bread -rrb- the council deal mainly with two point -- first what be m zolum to do in england should he go into the country or to the seaside or settle down in the london suburb since he wish to avoid recognition it would be foolish for he to remain in london particularly at a hotel like the grosvenor then for my benefit the legal position be set forth as well as the object of take maitre labori 's letter to mr fletcher moulton the chief point be could the french government in any way signify the judgment of the versaille court to m zolum personally while he remain in great britain if the french official could legally do nothing of that kind there would be less necessity for m zolum to court retirement after the hurly-burly of _ l'affaire dreyfus _ he certainly need some rest and privacy but the question be whether retirement would be a necessity or a mere matter of convenience now the choice of a place of sojourn depend on the answer to the second question and it be resolve _ nem con _ that m desmoulin who speak a little english and know something of london should forthwith drive to mr fletcher moulton 's house in onslow square sw in accordance with the address give on m laborus 's letter m desmoulin 's friend on he side be to return to pari that afternoon by the club train so the council over both these gentleman go off leave m zolum and myself together we have a long and desultory chat now on the dreyfus affair generally now on m zolum 's personal position the probable duration of he exile and so forth he himself do not think that he would remain abroad beyond October at the latest and as there might be a delay if not a difficulty in get any clothes send to he from paris he propose to make a few purchase it be then that he tell I how he have already buy a shirt collar and sock on the previous day ' i have nothing but what i be wear ' say he ' i have be to versaille and have sit perspire in the crowded court then i have spend the night travel i look dirty and i feel abominably uncomfortable so i go out yesterday morning and see a shop with shirt necktie collar and sock in the window i go in i take hold of my collar i pull down my cuff i tap my shirt front the shopman smile he understand I he measure my neck he give I a shirt and some collar but then we come to the sock and i pull up my trousers and point to those i be wear he understand immediately he be very intelligent he climb he step and pull parcel and box from he shelf ` here be sock of all color dark and light spotted striped in mixture in cotton in wool some ribbed and some with silk clocking but they be huge i look at one pair it be too big he show I another and another they be still of a larger size then impatient and perhaps rather abruptly i hold out my fist for the man to measure it and thus gauge the length of my foot as be do in pari but he do not understand I he draw back close to the shelf as if he imagine that i want to box he and when i again lift my foot to call he attention to its size he show even greater concern fortunately a idea come to I i take one of the mammoth sock that be lie on the counter and fold part of it neatly back so as to make it appear very much smaller than it be then the shopman suddenly brighten tap he forehead climb he step again and pull yet more box and parcel from he shelf and here at last be the small sock so i choose a pair and pay the bill and the man bow he thanks well please it seem to find that in thrust out my fist and raise my foot i have be actuate by no desire to injure he ' i be still chuckle over m zolum 's anecdote when m desmoulin return from he journey to onslow square he have there interview a smart boy in button who have inform he that he learn master be out of town electioneering and might not be home again for a week or two desmoulin have therefore retain possession of maitre labori 's note of introduction i now remembered what i ought to have recall before -- namely that mr fletcher moulton be at that moment a candidate for the parliamentary representation of the launceston division of cornwall under such circumstance it be unlikely that he advice would be available for some little time to come and so all idea of apply to he be abandon it may be that this narrative should it meet the learn gentleman 's eye will for the first time acquaint he with what be intend by m zolum act under maitre labori 's advice m zolum i should add remain most anxious to secure a english legal opinion on he position and i therefore suggest to he that i should that evening consult a discreet and reliable friend of mine a solicitor we of course well know that there could be no extradition but it be a point whether a copy of the versaille judgment might not be legally be place in m zolum 's hand under such convention as might exist between france and great britain this i think could be ascertain within the next forty-eight hour and meantime m zolum might remain where he be for i could not well offer he a asylum in my little home my connection with he as he english translator be so widely known newspaper reporter be certain to call upon I and what ever precaution i might take he presence in my house would speedily be discover on the other hand m desmoulin wish to go to brighton or hasting but in my estimation both those place crowd with holiday-maker be not desirable spot leave the grosvenor the three of we discuss these matter while stroll up buckingham palace road it be a warm sunshiny afternoon and the street be full of people all at once a couple of lady pass we and one of they after turn she head in we direction make a remark to she companion ` do you hear that ' desmoulin eagerly inquire ` she speak in french ' ` ah ' i reply ` what do she say ' ` why she exclaim there be m zolum we secret be as good as go now it will be all over london by to-morrow ' we feel somewhat alarm who could those lady be for my part i have scarcely notice they desmoulin opine however that they might perchance be french actress member possibly of madame sarah bernhardt 's company which be then in london and again he urge the necessity of immediate departure they must go to hasting brighton ramsgate -- some place at all event where the author of ` j' accuse ' would incur less chance of recognition to I it seem that some quiet retired country village would be most suitable in any town m zolum would incur great risk of be identify moreover he appearance be conspicuous he white billycock he glass he light gray suit he rosette of the legion of honor he many characteristic gesture all attract attention if anything be to be do he must begin by anglicise he appearance but whatever i might urge i find he stubborn on that point and as for departure from london he prefer to postpone this until i should have see my friend the solicitor ` everything be as good as lose ' cry m desmoulin ` how foolish too of clemenceau to have send you to a swell hotel in a fashionable neighborhood i be certain there be other french people stay at the grosvenor -- i hear somebody talk french there this morning ' this again might lead to unpleasantness and i could see that the master be gradually grow anxious by this time however we have reach st jame 's park and there as we seat ourselves on some chair beside the ornamental water i lead the conversation into another channel by produce a evening newspaper and reading therefrom successive narrative of how m zolum have sail for norway how he have take train at the eastern terminus in pari and how he have be bicycling through the oberland on he way to some mysterious helvetian retreat then we laugh -- ah those journalist -- and fear be at a end the duck paddle past we the droop foliage of the island tree stir in the warm breeze on a bench near at hand a couple of vagrant sit doze with they toe protrude through they wretched footgear then a soldier smart and pert stroll up a flower between he lip and a good-looking girl beside he away in front of we be the top window and the roof of st anne 's mansion farther on the leave the clock tower of westminster glint in the sun-rays ` fine duck ' say m zolum ' a pretty corner ' add desmoulin wave he hand towards some branch that droop to the water 's edge and suddenly i remembered and tell they of another french exile the epicurean st evremond whose need be relieve by charle ii appoint he governor of yonder duck island at a salary of three hundred pound a year ` well i have little money in my pocket ' quoth zolum ` but i do not think i shall come to that i hope that my pen alone will always yield I the little i require ' but big ben strike the hour it be six o'clock so we separate messr zola and desmoulin to retire to the dungeon at the grosvenor and i to go in search of my friend the solicitor at he private house at wimbledon iii danger signal that evening i call upon my friend -- mr f w wareham of wimbledon and ethelburge house bishopsgate street -- and lay before he the legal point i afterwards arrange to see he on the follow morning in town when i hope to fix a meeting between he and m zolum my first call on Thursday July 21 be make to the grosvenor hotel where i find both the master and m desmoulin in a state of anxiety m zolum for he part feel altogether out of he element after the excitement of he trial and he journey to england and the novelty of find himself strand in a strange city a kind of reaction have set in and he be extremely depressed m desmoulin on he side have procure several morning newspaper have explore they column to ascertain whether the lady by whom the master have be recognize in the street on the previous day have by any chance noise the circumstance abroad however the press be still on the norway and holland scent and as yet not a paper so much as suggest m zolum 's presence in england ` there have hardly be time ' say desmoulin to I ` but there will probably be something fresh this afternoon those actress be certain to tell people and we shall have to make ourselves scarce ' i try to cheer and tranquillise both he and m zolum and then arrange that wareham should come to the hotel at 2 pm meantime say i whatever m desmoulin might do it would be as well for m zolum to remain indoors several commission be entrust to I and i go off promising to return about noon i betook myself first to messr chatto and windus be in st martin 's lane where i arrive a few minute before ten o'clock neither mr chatto nor he partner mr percy spalding have as yet arrive and i therefore have to wait a few minute when mr spalding make he appearance he greet I with a smile and while lead the way to he private room exclaim ` so we friend zolum be in london ' to describe my amazement be beyond my power i could only gasp ` how do you know that ' ` why my wife see he yesterday in buckingham palace road ' i be confound for my part i have scarcely glance at the lady whom desmoulin have conjecture to be french actress -- simply because they be young prepossessing and speak french -- and certainly i should not readily have recognize mr spald whom i have only meet once some year previously it now seem to I rather fortunate that she should be the person who have recognize m zolum since she would naturally be discreet as soon as the situation should be make clear to she after i have explain the position i ascertain that the only person besides herself who know anything so far be she husband and the lady friend who have accompany she on the previous day ' i will telegraph to my wife at once ' say mr spalding ` and you may be sure that the matter will go no further we certainly have a hearty laugh at breakfast this morning when we read in the telegraph of zolum bicycling over the swiss frontier but of course as from what you tell I the matter be serious neither my wife nor myself will speak of it ' ` and she friend ' i exclaimed ` she know nothing of the necessity for secrecy and may perhaps gossip about it ' ` she be go to hasting to-day ' ` hasting ' say i ` why m desmoulin zolum 's companion do nothing but talk of go to hasting i be glad i know this hasting be bar for good so far as zolum be concern ' ` well i will arrange for my wife to see she friend this morning before she start ' mr spalding rejoin ` and in this way we may be sure that she friend will say nothing ' this excellent suggestion be act upon immediately mr spalding telegraph full instruction to he wife and later in the day i learn that everything have be satisfactorily arrange but for this timely action follow upon my lucky call at messr chatto and windus 's establishment it be virtually certain that the meeting in the buckingham palace road would have be talk about and the game of ` where be zolum ' bring to a abrupt conclusion as it happen both lady be duly warn preserved absolute secrecy after go to bishopsgate street to see wareham and execute several minor commission i return to the grosvenor where zolum and desmoulin be much amuse when i tell they of the outcome of the previous day 's fright ` it be a remarkable coincidence certainly ' say m zolum ` at a low calculation i daresay a thousand woman pass I in the street yesterday just one of they recognize I and she you say be mrs spalding shortsighted as i be not have see she too since i be in england a few year ago i have no notion she be the person who turn as she pass along and say there be monsieur zolum ` but the curious part of it be that you should have have to go to chatto 's and should have learn the lady 's name so promptly from she husband mathematically there be untold chance that this lady who recognize I might be some stranger 's wife and that we might never more hear anything of she yet you discover she identity at once this be the kind of thing which occasionally occur in novel but which critic say never happen in real life well now we know the contrary ' and he add gaily ` you see it be another instance of my good luck which still attend I in spite of all the strive of those who bear I grudge ' so far as the lady be concerned thing be indeed very satisfactory but the same could hardly be say of the position at the grosvenor neither m zolum nor m desmoulin could leave the hotel or return to it without be scrutinise they have also notice many a glance in they direction at meal-time in the dining-room and they have come to the conclusion that departure be imperative i do not gainsay they for i share they view and in fact i have already discuss the matter with wareham i explain however that one must have a few hour to devise suitable plan seaside place be dangerous at that time of the year and the best course would probably be to take a furnished house in the country meantime say i wareham have kindly offer to accommodate m zolum at he residence at wimbledon while m desmoulin might sleep close by at the house of mr everson -lrb- wareham 's managing clerk -rrb- who also dispose of a spare bedroom further discussion of these matter be postpone however until wareham 's arrive at the grosvenor in the afternoon as zolum and desmoulin both distrust the inquisitive glance of the visitor and the attendant at the hotel we lunch i remember at a restaurant in or near victorium street -- a deep narrow place crowd with little table and here again m zolum in he light garment with the rosette of the legion of honor show brightly in he buttonhole become the observe of all observer he be indeed so conspicuous so characteristic a figure that look backward and remember how repeatedly the illustrated papers have portray he and how many photograph of he be to be see in shop window i often wonder how it happen that he be not recognize a hundred time during those few day spend in london it may be that many do recognize he but hold they tongue as yet certainly there be not a word in the newspaper to set he adversary upon he track it be in a corner of the smoking-room at the grosvenor a hot gloomy apartment overlook victorium station that i introduce wareham to the novelist the former have already form some opinion but a few point remain for consideration the chief of these as wareham explain be how far the french republic might claim jurisdiction over frenchman in matter of process some country assert a measure of authority over they subject wherever they might be and the question be what might be the law of france in that respect of course m zolum could not be extradite the offence for which he have be sentence do not come within the purview of the extradition act again -lrb- in reply to a query from m zolum -rrb- there be no diplomatic channel through which a french criminal libel judgment could be signify in england but suppose that french detective should discover m zolum 's whereabouts and suppose a french process-server should quietly come to england with a couple of witness and by some craft or good luck should succeed in place a copy of the versaille judgment in m zolum 's hand unless a breach of the queen 's peace be commit it might be difficult for the english authority to interfere there appear to be no case or precedent in england apply to such a matter in germany a foreign process-server would be liable to penal servitude but of course that be not to the point again although the service by a foreigner might not hold good in english law that have nothing to do with it the process-server and he witness would immediately return to france they would there prove to the satisfaction of they employer that they have serve the judgment on m zolum personally and they would be able to snap they finger at english lawyer should the latter complain that the thrust of a document into a man 's hand under such circumstance be a technical assault they would have gain they point judgment would have be serve and in accordance with french law m zolum would be call upon to enter a appearance against it at versaille ` thing must largely depend ' conclude wareham ` on whether french law allow process to be serve on a subject out of the jurisdiction and that be a point rather for french legal adviser than for I still i shall look into the matter further and if at the same time maitre labori can be communicate with and can supply he opinion on the question so much the better i now raise the point because it seem the crux of the whole matter and if it go against we it be certain that m zolum ought to remain in close retirement for the present it be as well that he should run as little risk as possible ' m zolum acquiesce in the suggestion of write to he french counsel on the point which have be raise and the conversation then go on in the same low tone that have be preserve from the outset on enter the smoking-room we have find it desert but whilst wareham be speak a couple of gentleman have come in one i remember be a elderly florid man with mutton-chop whisker and a buff waistcoat who take he stand beside the fireplace at the further end of the room and puff away at a big cigar he look inoffensive enough and pay no attention to we but the other a middle-aged individual tall and slim with military moustache eye we very keenly change he position two or three time and finally install himself in a chair whence while trifle with a cigarette he command a good view of m zolum 's face desmoulin i think be the first to notice this and to call the novelist 's attention to it zolum then shift he position and the military look gentleman soon do the same at last doubtless have satisfy he curiosity he leave the room not however without a sharp comprehensive survey of we party as he pass we on he way out i do not now exactly remember how it happen that wareham be not receive in the ` dungeon ' instead of the smoking-room the choice of the latter apartment be unfortunate i have no doubt that if some of the newspaper be a day or two afterwards able to state that m zolum be stay at the grosvenor hotel it be through certain remark make by the inquisitive military look gentleman to whom i have refer on the other hand he curiosity exercise decisive influence over m zolum 's subsequent movement he have hitherto be rather chary of accept wareham 's hospitality for fear lest he should inconvenience he but the offer now be renew be promptly accept and it be agree that i should take both messr zola and desmoulin to wimbledon that evening as it be to be expect that several letter from pari would arrive at the hotel address to m pascal i arrange to call or send for they the same course be adopt with regard to a few article which m zolum have give to be wash and which have not yet be return to he some of these thing be significantly mark with the letter ` z ' and for this reason it be desirable that they should be recover here i may mention that during the next few day my wife repeatedly call at the grosvenor for m zolum 's correspondence a circumstance which doubtless give rise to the rumor that mme zolum have join she husband in london the exodus from the hotel be not particularly impose m desmoulin have originally intend to stay but one day in london and thus merely have a dressing-case with he as for m zolum he few belongings -lrb- inclusive of a small bottle of ink which he would not part with -rrb- be stuff into he pocket or go towards the making of a peculiarly shaped newspaper parcel tie round with odd bit of string dressing-case and parcel be duly bring down into the grand vestibule where the hotel servant smile on they benignly there be indeed some little humor in the situation the novelist with he gold pince-nez and gold watch-chair he red rosette and a large and remarkably fine diamond spark on one of he little finger look so eminently respectable that it be difficult to associate he with the wretched misshapen newspaper parcel -- he only luggage -- which he eye so jealously however as the attendant be all liberally fee would they remain strictly polite even if they feel amuse i order a hansom to be call and we just contrived to squeeze ourselves and the precious newspaper parcel inside it the dressing-case be hoist aloft then the hotel porter ask I ` where to sir ' ` chare cross station ' i reply and the next moment we be bowl along buckingham palace road perhaps a minute elapse before i tap the cab-roof with my walk stick on cabby look down at I i say ` do i tell you chare cross just now driver ah well i make a mistake i mean waterloo ' ` right sir ' rejoin cabby and on we go it be a paltry device perhaps this trick of give one direction in the hearing of the hotel servant and then another when the hotel be out of sight but as the reader must know this kind of thing be always do in novel -- particularly in detective story and recollection have come to I of some of gaboriau 's tale which long ago i have help to place before the english public it might be that the renowned monsieur lecoq or he successor or perchance some english _ confrere _ like mr sherlock holme would presently be after we and so it be just as well to play the game accord to the orthodox rule of romance after all be it not in something akin to a romance that i be live iv a change of quarter it should be mention that the departure of messr zola and desmoulin from the grosvenor hotel take place almost immediately after wareham have return to he office we be not to meet we friend the solicitor again until the evening at wimbledon but the hotel be apparently a dangerous spot it be think best to quit it forthwith when we reach waterloo the dressing-case and the newspaper parcel be deposit at one of the cloak-room and after make the round of the station we descend into the waterloo road at first we saunter towards the new cut and of course m zolum could not help notice the contrast between the dingy surroundings amidst which he now find himself and the stylish shop and road he have see in the buckingham palace road the vista be not cheer so i propose that we should retrace we step and go as far as waterloo bridge there seem to be little risk in do so for as usual hereabouts in the middle of the afternoon there be few people to be see the great successive rush of homeward-bound employer clerk and workpeople have not yet set in and moreover there be plenty of time for wareham have important business in town that day could not possibly be at wimbledon till half-past six at the earliest we reach the bridge -- ` that monument ' as a famous frenchman once put in ` worthy of sesostri and the caesar ' -- and go about half-way across it be splendid weather and the thame be aglow with the countless reflection of the sunbeam that fall from the hot whitening sky london be before we ` with she palace down to the water ' and m zolum stop short gaze intently at the scene ` up-stream the view be spoil ' say he ` by the hideous hungerford bridge unworthy alike of the city and the river ' -- a erection such as no pari municipality would have tolerate for four and twenty hour it be the more obtrusive and aggravating since beyond it one discern but little of the tower of westminster ` admit ' add the novelist ` that a bridge be need at that point for railway traffic surely there be no reason why it should be so surprisingly ugly however from all i see it seem more and more evident that you english people be very much in the habit of sacrifice beauty to utility forget that with a little artistic sense it be easy to combine the two ' then however he turn slightly and look down-stream where the victorium embankment spread past the temple to blackfriar the colonnade of somerset house show boldly and with a certain majesty in the foreground whilst in the distance high over every roof arise the leaden dome of st paul 's this vista be rather to m zolum 's liking close beside we on the bridge be one of the semi-circular embrasure garnish with stone seat a pitiful-looking vagrant be loll there but this make no difference to m zolum he install himself on the seat with desmoulin on one hand and myself on the other and there we remain for some little time look about we and chat ` this be the only thing want ' say desmoulin who generally have some humorous remark in readiness for every situation ` yesterday at the grosvenor we be in the _ fosse de vincennes _ and now as they say in the melodrama of the knight of the fog -lrb- les chevaliers du brouillard \* -rrb- we be homeless wanderer strand on the bridge of london ' \* the french dramatic adaptation of ainsworth 's ` jack sheppard ' the allusion to the fog rouse m zolum from he contemplation ` but where be the savoy hotel where i stay in ' 93 ' he inquire ` it must be very near here ' i point it out to he and he be astonished ` why no -- that can not be it be so large a place and now it look so small what be that huge building beside it ' ` the hotel cecil ' i reply then again he shake he head in disapproval from a artistic standpoint he strongly object to the huge caravansary on which builder hobb and pious jabez balfor spend so much of other people 's money soar massively and pretentiously into the sky it dwarf everything around and thus in he opinion utterly spoil that part of the embankment ` to think too ' say he ` that you have such a site here along the river and allow it to be use for hotel and club and so forth there be room for a louvre here and you want one badly for you national gallery which i well remember visit in '93 be a most wretched affair architecturally ' ` but i want to see rather more of the south side of the river ' he add after a pause ' i should like to ascertain if my lion be still there i recollect that there be some fog about on the morning after my arrival at the savoy in '93 and when i go to the window of my room i notice the mist parting -- one mass of vapor ascend skyward while the other still hover over the river and in the rent between i espied a lion poise in mid air it amuse I vastly and i call my wife say to she come and see here be the british lion wait to bid we good-day ' we go to the end of the bridge and thence espy the lion which surmount the brewery of that name m zolum recognize it immediately desmoulin would then have lead we strandward but the strand say i be about the most dangerous thoroughfare in all london for those who wish to escape recognition so we go back over the bridge and again down the waterloo road ' i should like very much to send a line to pari to-day to stop letter from go to the grosvenor ' say m zolum ` be there any place hereabouts where i could write a note ' this question perplex I for the numerous facility for letter-writing which be supply by the cafe of pari be conspicuously absent in london and this i explain to m zolum a postage stamp may often be procure at a public-house but only now and again can one there obtain ink and paper however i think we might as well try the saloon bar of the york hotel which abut on the famous ` poverty corner ' so much frequent by lady and gentleman of the ` hall ' when sorely against they inclination they be ` rest ' it be Thursday afternoon still there be several disconsolate-looking individual lounge about the corner and in the saloon bar we find some fourteen or fifteen loudly dress man and woman typical of the spot i forget what i order for desmoulin and myself but m zolum i know imbibe mainly for the good of the house ' a small lemon plain ' then we ascertain that the young lady at the bar have neither stamp nor paper nor envelope and so we be again in a quandary fortunately i recollect a little stationer 's shop in the york road and leave the other in the saloon bar i go in search of the requisite material when i return i find the master a object of general attention he extremely prosperous appearance he white billycock he jewellery and so forth couple with the circumstance that he converse in french with desmoulin have lead some of those present to imagine that he be a continental music-hall director on the look out for english ` artist ' again and again i notice as it be a ` hungry ' glance in he direction and when after procure a inkstand from over the bar i have ensconce he in a corner where he be able after a fashion to pen he correspondence a vivacious and it seem to I somewhat bibulous gentleman in a check suit sidle up to where i stand and introduce himself in that easy way which repeat ` drop ' of ` mountain dew ' be apt to engender ` ah ' say he after a few pointless remark ` you friend be over here on business eh right thing splendid thing it be only by look round that one can get real tip-top novelty oh i know paree and the bouleyward well enough i be on at the follee bergey only a few year ago myself a good place that -- pay well eh i should not at all mind take a trip across the water again there be nothing like a change you know set a man up eh ' then mysteriously -- lift he forefinger and lower he voice ` now you friend want talent eh real genuine talent i could put he in the way -- ' but i interpose : ` you have apply to the wrong shop ' i say by way of a joke ` my friend have all the talent he require he be quite full up ' a sorrowful look come over the angular feature of the gentleman in the check suit ` it be like my luck ' say he ` there be a fellow over from amsterdam the other day but he would only take girl i think the continental line 's pretty nigh play out ' he heave a sigh and glance in the direction of he empty glass then see that the novelist and desmoulin be rise to join I he whisper hurriedly _ ' i say guv ` nor you have not get a tanner you could spare have you ' _ i have foresee the request nevertheless i press a few copper into he hand and then hurry out after my ward though it be still early we decide to start at once for wimbledon the master i think might like to see a little of the place pend wareham 's arrival the journey through lambeth vauxhall and queen 's road be not calculate to give the intelligent foreigner a particularly favourable impression of london still m zolum do not at first find the surroundings very much worse than those one observe on leave pari by the northern or eastern line but as the train go on and on and much the same scene appear on either hand he begin to wonder when it would all end on approach clapham junction a sea of roof be to be see on the right stretch away through battersea to the thame while on the leave a huge wave of house ascend the acclivity know i believe as lavender hill and at the sight of all the mean dusty street line with little house of uniform pattern each close press to the other -- at the frequently recur glimpse of squalor and shabby gentility -- m zolum explode ` it be awful ' he say we be alone in we compartment and he look first from one window and then from the other next come a torrent of question : why be the house so small why be they all so ugly and so much alike what class of people live in they why be the road so dusty why be there such a litter of fragment of paper lie about everywhere where those street never water be there no scavenger ' service and then a remark : ` you see that house it look fairly clean and neat in front but there look at the back-yard -- all rubbish and poverty one notice that again and again ' we pass clapham junction pursue we journey through the cutting which intersect wandsworth common ` well ' i say ` you may take it that except as regard the postal and police service you be now out of london proper ' presently indeed we emerge from the cutting and field be see on either hand one could breathe at last but as we approach earlsfield station all m zolum 's attention be give to a long row of low-lying house whose yard and garden extend to the railway line now and again a trim patch of ground be see here too there be a little glass-house there a attempt at a arbor but litter and rubbish be only too often apparent ` this i suppose ' say the novelist ` be what you call a london slum invade the country you tell I that only a part of the bourgeoisie care for flat and that among the lower middle class and the work class each family prefer to rent its own little house be this for the sake of privacy if so i see no privacy here leave out the question of be overlook from pass train observe the open four-foot fence which separate one garden or yard from the other there be no privacy at all to I the manner in which you poorer class be house in the suburb pack closely together in flimsy building where every sound can be hear suggest a form of socialism -- communism or perhaps rather the phalansterian system ' but earlsfield be already pass and we be reach wimbledon here m zolum 's impression change true he do not have occasion to perambulate what he would doubtless have call the ` phalansterian ' street of new south wimbledon i spare he the sight of the chess-board of brick and mortar into which the speculative builder have turn acre after acre north of merton high street but the hill road the broadway the worple road and the various turning that climb towards the ridgeway pleased he and he comment very favourably on the shop in the broadway and the hill road which in the wane sunshine still look gay and bright at every moment he stop to examine something such display of fruit and fish poultry meat and provision of all kind the draper ' window all aglow with summer fabric and those of the jeweller coruscate with gold and gem then the public-house -- dignified by the name of hotel though i explain that they have no hotel accommodation -- bespeak all the wealth of a powerful trade there be a impose bank too and a stylish carriage builder 's with furniture shop stationer pastrycook hairdresser ironmonger and so forth whose display testify to the prosperity of the town again and again do m zolum express the opinion that these wimbledon shop be by far superior to such as one would find in a french town of corresponding size and at a similar distance from the capital we saunter up and down the hill road look in at the free library on we way then on pass the alexandra road i explain to desmoulin that he would sleep there at no 20 where wareham have a local office and where he managing clerk everson by name reside the arrangement with wareham have be conclude so precipitately that to spare he unnecessary trouble at home we have arrange to dine that evening at a local restaurant -- in fact the only restaurant possess by wimbledon wareham be to join we there the proprietor mr genonus be of foreign origin but wareham know he personally have assure I that even should he suspect we friend 's identity he discretion might readily be rely upon and so the sequel prove during we repast however i feel a little doubtful about one of the waiter who know french and i therefore caution m zolum and m desmoulin to be as reticent as possible after dinner we adjourn to wareham 's house in prince 's road where mr wareham give the traveller the most cordial of welcome the conversation be chiefly confine to the question of find some suitable place where m zolum might settle down for he term of exile he himself be so take with what he have see of wimbledon that he suggest rent a furnished house there this seem a trifle dangerous both to wareham and myself but the novelist be not to be gainsay and as wareham in anticipation of he service be require have make special arrangement to give m zolum most of he time on the morrow we arrange to see some house agent engage a landau and drive round to visit such place as might seem suitable it be nearly half-past eleven when i leave wareham 's to escort desmoulin to the alexandra road i there leave he in charge of he host mr everson and then turn -lrb- by way of a short cut -rrb- into the lover 's walk which the south western railway company so considerately provide for amorous wimbledonian i hurry homeward wonder what the morrow would bring forth v wimbledon -- oatland it will be obvious to all reader of this narrative that from the moment m zolum leave paris and throughout he sojourn in london and its immediate neighborhood there be little if any skill show in the matter of keep he movement secret in point of fact blunder upon blunder be commit a first mistake be make in go to a hotel like the grosvenor a second in openly promenade some of the most frequented of the london street and a third in decline to make the slightest alteration with regard to personal appearance again although press of circumstance render departure for wimbledon a necessity as it be imperative to get m zolum out of london at once this change of quarter be in the end scarcely conducive to secrecy a good many wimbledonian be aware of my connection with m zolum and even if he be not personally recognize by they the circumstance of a french gentleman of striking appearance be see in my company be fate to arouse suspicion my home be but a mile or so from the center of wimbledon and m zolum 's proposal to make that locality he place of sojourn seem to I such a dangerous course that when i return to wareham 's house on the morning of Friday July 22 i be determine to oppose it in the master 's own interest as vigorously as might be possible however i find messr zola and desmoulin ready to start for a inspection of such furnished house as might seem suitable for they accommodation and nothing urge either by wareham or by myself could turn they from they purpose so the four of we take we seat in the landau which have be order and be soon drive in the direction of wimbledon park where stand the first of the eligible residence enter in the book of a local house agent the term for these house vary if i recollect rightly from four to seven guinea a week some we do not trouble to enter other however be carefully inspect nothing in the way of a terrace house would suit for m zolum be not yet a phalansterian and in like way he object to the semi-detached villa he wish to secure a somewhat retire place girt with foliage and thus screen from the observation of neighbor and passer-by the low garden railing and fence usually meet with be by no means to he taste the flimsy party wall of the semi-detached villa through which every sound so swiftly pass be equally objectionable to he and i must say that i view with some little satisfaction he dislike for several of the house which we visit for this make it easier to dissuade he from he plan of fix he abode in wimbledon where unless he should rigidly confine himself within door it be certain that he presence would be know before a week be over there be however some house which the master find to he liking and here he linger awhile inspect the room take stock of the furniture examine the engraving and water-colour on the wall and view the trim garden with visible satisfaction one place a large house in one of the precipitous road lead from the ridgeway to the worple road be perhaps rather too open for he requirement but its appointment be perfect and at he bidding i ply the lady of the house with innumerable question about plate linen and garden produce the servant she offer to leave behind she and so forth she be a tall and stately dame with silver hair and a soft musical voice -- a perfect type of the old marquise such as one see portray at time on the board of the comedie francaise and after i have act as interpreter for a quarter of a hour or so she suddenly turn upon the master and to the surprise of all of we address he in perfect french it be this which break the spell though m zolum be take aback he respond politely enough and the conversation go on in french for some minute but i could already tell that he have renounce he intention of rent the house when we drive away after promise the lady a decisive answer within a day or two he say to I : ` that would never do the lady 's french be too good she look at I rather suspiciously too she would soon discover my identity she have probably hear of I already ' ` who have not ' i respond with a laugh and once again i bring forward the objection that occur to I with respect to the plan of remain at wimbledon it be a center of roman catholic activity there be a jesuit college there numbering both french professor and french pupil moreover several french family reside in wimbledon and with some of they i be myself acquaint then also the population include a good many literary man journalist and other who take a interest in the dreyfus case and finally the town be far too near to london to be in anywise a safe hiding-place nevertheless m zolum only abandon he intention with regret in that bright sunshiny weather there be a attractive _ je ne sais quoi _ about wimbledon which charm he not that it be in he estimation a ideal place the descent from the hill and the ridgeway -lrb- though he admire the beautiful view they afford stretch as far as norwood -rrb- appal he from certain practical standpoint and he be never weary of expatiate on the pluck of the girl who cycle so boldly and gracefully from the hill crest to the lower part of the town here it may be mention that m zolum have become reconcile to the skirt as a cycling garment once upon a time he be a uncompromising partisan of ` rational ' and ` bloomers ' a warm adherent of the view which lady harberton and she friend uphold but sojourn in england have change all that -- at least so far as the english type of girl be concern those who have read he novel ` paris ' may remember that he therein ascribe the follow remark to he heroine -- marie : ` ah there be nothing like rational to think that some woman be so foolish and obstinate as to wear skirt when they cycle to think that woman have a unique opportunity of put themselves at they ease and release they limb from prison and yet will not do so if they fancy they look the prettier in short skirt like schoolgirl they be vastly mistaken skirt be rank heresy ' well so far as englishwoman be concerned m zolum himself have become a heretic ` rational ' he have more than once say to I of recent time ` be not suit to the lithe and somewhat spare figure of the average english girl moreover i doubt if there be a costumier in england who know how to cut rational properly such woman as i have see in rational in england look to I horrible they have not the proper figure for the garment and the garment itself be badly make for rational to suit a woman she figure should be of the happy medium neither too slim nor over-developed now the great bulk of you girl be extremely slim and appear in skirt to advantage in cycling moreover they carry themselves much better than the majority of frenchwoman do they sit they machine gracefully and the skirt instead of be a mere bundle of stuff fall evenly and fittingly like a necessary adjunct -- the drapery which be need to complete and set off the ensemble ' at the same time the master do not cry ` haro ' on the ` bloomer ' it be admirably suit he maintain to the average frenchwoman who be more inclined to a reasonable plumpness than she english sister ` the skirt to england ' say he ` the bloomer to france ' the whole question be one of physique and latitude the esquimaux lady would look ungainly and feel uncomfortable if she exchange she moose fur for the wisp of calico which be patronise by the lady of senegal and in the like way the englishwoman be manifestly ungainly and uncomfortable when she borrow the breeches of the parisienne this digression may seem to carry one away from wimbledon but i should mention that many of the point enunciate be touch upon by m zolum for the first time while we postpone further house-hunt to drive over wimbledon common the historic mill and caesar 's camp and the picturesque mere be all view before the horse ' head be turn to the town once more by this time the master have come to the conclusion that however pleasant wimbledon might be it be no fit place for he and that he best course would be to pitch he tent ` far from gay city and the way of man ' within a few hour i have some proof of the wisdom of he decision and a week have not elapse before i find that m zolum 's sojourn at wimbledon have become know to a variety of people mr genonus the restaurateur have be one of the first to identify he but as he explain to I he be no spy or betrayer and whatever he might think of the dreyfus business -- he be a reader of that anti-revisionist print the ` petit journal ' -- m zolum 's secret be he assure I quite safe in he hand but independently of mr genonus the secret soon become _ le secret de polichinelle _ a french resident in wimbledon recognize m zolum as he stand one day by the railway bridge admire some fair cyclist then a gentleman connect with the local petty session court espy he in my company and shrewdly guess he identity subsequently a local hairdresser a englishman but one well acquaint with pari and parisian matter ` spot ' he in the hill road other follow suit and at last one afternoon a member of the ` globe ' staff call upon I and supply I with such circumstantial particulars that i could not possibly deny the accuracy of he information but m zolum have then leave wimbledon and thus i be able to fence with my visitor and inform he that even if the novelist have ever be in the town he be not there at that time it have be arrange that some of the lead london house agent should be write to with the view of secure some secluded country house preferably in surrey and on the south western line but the question be where in the meantime could m zolum be conveniently install have leave england in the year 1865 and apart from a few brief sojourn in london have remain abroad till 1886 my knowledge of my native land be very slight indeed year spend in foreign country have make I a stay-at-home -- one who nowadays bury himself in he little london suburb go to town as seldom as possible and without need of country or seaside trip since at merton where i live there be green field all around one and every vivify breeze that can be wish for thus i be the worst person in the world to take charge of m zolum and pilot he safely to a haven of refuge fortunately mr wareham know he way about as the say go and he cycling experience prove very useful he suggest that until a house could be secure m zolum should be install at a country hotel and he mention two or three place which seem to he of the right character one of these be oatlands park and wareham who although a solicitor claim to have some little poetry in he nature wax so enthusiastic over the charm of oatland and neighbouring locality that both m zolum and m desmoulin fervent admirer of scenery as they be become curious to visit this leafy district of surrey where as will be remembered king loui philippe spend he last year of life and exile one afternoon then i start with messr zola and desmoulin for walton from which station the oatland park hotel be most conveniently reach a gladstone bag have now replace the master 's newspaper parcel and as m desmoulin 's dressing-case be as large as a valise there be at least some semblance of luggage i fully realize that it be hardly the correct thing to present oneself at oatland park and ask for room there _ ex abrupto _ as with hostelry of that class it be usual for one to write and secure accommodation beforehand however there be no time for this and we decide to run the risk of find the hotel ` full up ' particularly as wareham have inform we that in such a case we might secure a temporary billet at one or another of the smaller hotel of walton or weybridge thus we go we way at all hazard and during the journey i devise a little story for the benefit of the manager at oatland park that gentleman as i have surmise be a trifle astonish at we appearance but i tell he that my friend be a couple of french artist who have be spend a few week in london ` do the lion ' there and who have hear of the charming scenery around oatland and wish to view it and possibly make a few sketch and at the same time a solicitor 's recommendation being of some value since it might mean a good many future customer i hand the manager one of wareham 's card there be i remember some little difficulty at first in obtain room for the hotel be nearly full but everything end satisfactorily i may mention perhaps that in describe messr zola and desmoulin as french artist i have at least tell half the truth m fernand desmoulin be of course well know in the french art world and moreover he have already speak to I of purchase a water-colour outfit for the very purpose of sketch as i have state then too m zolum first distinguish himself in literature as a art critic the defender of manet the champion of the school of the ` open air ' and if he make no sketch whilst he remain at oatland he at least take several photograph sapient critic will stop I here with the oft-repeated dictum that photography be not art but however that may be so many painter nowadays have recourse to the assistance of photography that m zolum 's ` snap-shot ' largely help to bear out the account which i have give of he at the hotel oatland park be a large pile standing on the site of a magnificent palace build by henry viii anne of denmark wife of jame i reside there and henrietta marium there give birth to the duke of gloucester the brother of we second charle and second jame the palace be almost entirely destroy during the civil war and subsequently the property pass in turn to jermyn earl of st alban herbert the admiral first earl of torrington and henry seventh earl of lincoln a descendant of the last-named sell the estate to frederick duke of york the son of george iii and commander-in-chief of the british army soon afterwards the house at oatland be destroy by fire and the prince erect a new building some portion of which be incorporate in the present hostelry a pathetic interest attach to those remains of york house within those wall be spend many of the honeymoon hour of a fair and virtuous princess one whose early death plunge england into the deepest grief it have know for century there she conceive the child who in the ordinary course of nature might have become king of great britain but the babe so anxiously await by the whole nation -lrb- there be no princess victorium at that time -rrb- prove stillborn and of the unhappy ` mother of the moment ' byron write in immortal line : of sackcloth be thy wedding garment make thy bridal 's fruit be ash in the dust the fair-hair would daughter of the isle be lay the love of million i be bind to add that the tragic story of the princess charlotte be not that which most appeal to m zolum 's feeling at oatland park nor be he particularly impressed by the far-famed grotto which the hotel handbook state ` have no parallel in the world ' the grotto a artificial affair the creation of which be due to a duke of newcastle whom it cost 40000 pound besides give employment to three man for twenty year consist of numerous chamber and passage whose wall be inlay with color spar shell coral ammonite and crystal this work be ingenious enough but when one enter a bath-room and find a stuff alligator there keep company with a statue of venus and a terra-cotta of the infant hercule one be apt to remember how perilously near the ridiculous be to the sublime ridiculous also to some mind may seem the duchess of york 's dog and monkey cemetery in which half a hundred of that lady 's canine and simian pet lie bury with headstone to they tomb commemorate they virtue this cemetery however greatly commend itself to m zolum who as some may know be a rare lover of animal among the various distinction accord to he in happier time by he compatriot there be none that he have ever prize more highly than the diploma of honor he receive from the french ` society for the protection of animal ' and i believe that one of the happiest moment he ever know be when as government delegate at a meeting of that society he fasten a gold medal on the bosom of a blush little shepherdess a certain mlle camelin of trionne in upper burgundy a girl of sixteen who at the peril of she life have engage a ravenous wolf in single combat kill he and thereby save she flock and m zolum 's book teem with he love of animal during he long exile one of the few request address to he from france to which he incline a favourable ear be a appeal on behalf of a new journal devote to the interest of the animal world to this he could not refuse he patronage and he give it enthusiastically well know how much remain to be accomplish in inculcate among the mass such affection and patience as be rightful with regard to those dumb creature who serve man so well the duchess of york 's cemetery remind he of he own below he house at medan a green islet rise from the seine this he purchase some year ago and there all he favorite have since be bury : a old horse a goat and several dog during he exile a fresh interment take place in this island cemetery that of he last canine favorite the poor ` chevalier de perlinpinpin ' who after vainly fret for he absent master die at last of sheer grief and loneliness those only can understand emile zolum who have see he as i see he then bow down with sorrow distraught indifferent to all else both the weightiest personal interest and the very triumph of the cause he have champion and this because he pet dog have pine away for he and be beyond all possibility of succor it be of course a pass weakness with he such weakness as may fall upon a man of kindly heart in zolum 's case it come however almost like a last blow amidst the sorrow and loneliness of the exile which he be endure in silence for the sake of he much-loved country vi still at oatland for a time at all event messr zola and desmoulin find themselves in fairly pleasant quarter they could stroll about the garden at oatland or along the umbrageous road of walton or beside the pretty reach of the thame amidst all desirable quietude after all he worry the master need complete mental rest and he laugh at he friend 's repeat appeal for newspaper at that period i procure a few french journal every time i go to town and post they to oatland where they be eagerly con by m desmoulin on whom the dreyfus fever be as strong as ever but m zolum during the first fortnight of he exile do not once cast eye upon a newspaper and the only information he obtain respect pass event be such as desmoulin or myself impart to he and in this he evince little interest half of it he say be absolutely untrue and the other half be of no importance there be certainly much force and truth in this curtly-worded opinion as apply to the contents of certain pari journal however communication be now be open up between the master and he pari friend and every few day wareham or myself have occasion to go to oatland there be sundry false alarm too through stranger call at wareham 's office and now and again my sudden appearance at the hotel throw messr zola and desmoulin into anxiety in other respects they life be quiet enough the people stay at oatland be on the whole a much less inquisitive class than those whom one have find at the grosvenor there be various honeymoon-making couple who be far too busy feast they eye on one another to pay much attention to two french artist then also the family people give time to the superintendence of they son and daughter whilst the old folk only seem to care for a leisurely stroll about the grounds follow by long spell of book or newspaper reading under the shelter of tree or sunshade moreover the exile see little of the other inmate of the hotel excepting at the table d'hote dinner m zolum then bring he faculty of observation into play and after a lapse of a few day he inform I that he be astonish at the ease and frequency with which some english girl raise they wine-glass to they lip it upset all he idea of propriety to see young lady of eighteen toss off they moselle and they champagne as to the manner bear in france the daughter who be properly train contents herself with water just color by the addition of a little bordeaux or burgundy and the contrast between this custom and incident which m zolum notice at oatland -- and to which he once or twice call my attention -- make a deep impression on he the people stay at the hotel be certainly all of a good class there be several well-known name in the register and know how much have be write on the happy decrease of drinking habit ` in the upper middle-class of england ' i be myself slightly surprise at what be point out to I when m zolum discover too that sundry gentleman -- leave wine to they wife and daughter -- be addict to drink whisky with they meal he be yet more astonished for he claim that in france nowadays greatly as the consumption of alcohol have increase among the mass it have decline almost to vanish point among people with any claim to culture on this matter however i remind he that wine be often expensive in england that beer disagree with many people and that some who feel the need of a stimulant be thus drive to whisky and water when the master and desmoulin wander down to the thame towing-path they find fresh food for observation and comment among the boat fraternity with some gay party be damsel whose disregard for decorum be strongly reminiscent of asniere and joinville-le-pont and it be slightly embarrassing to stroll near the river in the evening when at every few yard one find young couple exchange kiss in the shadow of the tree after all it be surprise rather than embarrassment which the exile experience for they have scarcely imagine that english training be conducive to such public endearment at a later stage a bicycle be procure for the master and he be then able to extend he sphere of observation but in the earlier day at oatland he ramble be confine to the vicinity of walton and weybridge at the latter village he lay in a fresh stock of linen and be soon complain of the exiguous proportion of english shirt the frenchman it should be remember be a man of many gesture and desire all possible freedom of action for he arm he shirt be cut accordingly and a superabundance rather than a deficiency of material in length as well as breadth be the result but the english shirt-maker proceeds upon different line he always seem afraid of waste a few inch of longcloth and thus if the ordinary ready-made shirt on sale at shop of the average class be dressy-looking enough it be also often supremely uncomfortable to those who like they ease such at least be the master 's experience and in certain respects say he the english shirt be not only uncomfortable but indecorous as well this astonished he with a nation which claim to show so much regard for the propriety the desire to clothe himself accord to he wont become so keen that m desmoulin decide to make a expedition to pari all this time mme zolum have remain alone at the house in the rue de bruxelles outside which as at medan -lrb- where the zola have they country residence -rrb- detective be permanently station mme zolum be shadow wherever she go the idea of course be that she would promptly follow she husband abroad she have however ample duty to discharge in pari at the same time she much wish to send she husband a trunkful of clothes as well as the material for a new book he have plan in order that he might have some occupation in he sorrow and loneliness most people be by this time aware that m zolum 's gospel be work in diligent study and composition he find some measure of solace for every trouble at time it be hard for he to take up the pen but he force himself to do so and a hour later he have largely banish sorrow and anxiety and at time have even dull physical pain he himself heavy heart as he be when the first novelty of he stroll around oatland have wear off feel that he must have something to do and be therefore well pleased at the prospect of receive the material for he new book ` fecondite ' at that date he certainly do not imagine that the whole of this work would be write in england that he exile would drag on month after month till winter would come and spring return follow once more by summer in those day we use to say : ` it will all be over in a fortnight or three week or a month at the latest ' and again and again do we hope alternately collapse and revive thus the few chapter of ` fecondite ' which he think he might be able to pen in england multiply and multiply till they at last become thirty -- the entire work it be m desmoulin who bring the necessary material -- memorandum cutting and a score of scientific work -- from pari and at the same time he have a trunk with he full of clothes which have be smuggle in small parcel out of m zolum 's house carry to the residence of a friend and there properly pack desmoulin also bring a hand camera which likewise prove very acceptable to the master and enable he to take many little photograph -- almost a complete pictorial record of he english experience during desmoulin 's absence the master remain virtually alone at oatland and as he still care nothing for newspaper i send he a few book from my shelf and among other stendhal 's ` la chartreuse de parme ' he write I afterwards ' i be very grateful to you for the book you send now that i be utterly alone they enable I to spend a pleasant day yesterday i be read la chartreuse i be without news from france if you hear of anything really serious pray let I know about it ' by this time proper arrangement have be make with regard to m zolum 's correspondence he exact whereabouts be keep absolutely secret even from he most intimate friend everybody he wife and maitre laborus also address they letter to wareham 's office in bishopsgate street here the correspondence be enclose in a large envelope and redirect to oatland with regard to visitor wareham and i have decide to give the master 's address to none wareham intend to take they card ascertain they london address and then refer the matter through I to m zolum later on a regular supply of french newspaper be arrange and those journal be re-transmit to the master by wareham or myself on the other hand i usually address m zolum 's letter for he to the house of a trusty friend in pari this precaution be a necessary one as m zolum 's handwriting be so extremely characteristic and so well know in france and thus we be convince that any letter arrive in paris address by he would immediately be send to the ` cabinet noir ' where all suspicious correspondence be open by certain official who immediately report the contents to the government it have be pretend that of recent year this secret service have be abolish but such be by no mean the case it flourish to-day in the same way as it flourish under the second empire when napoleon iii make a point of acquaint himself with the private correspondence of he own relative he minister and he general after the revolution of September 1870 hundred of copy of more or less compromise letter covert attack on or criticism of the imperial government _ billet-doux _ also between imperial prince and they mistress and so forth be find at the palace of the tuillery and some of they be even publish by a commission nominate by the republican government much of the same kind of thing go on to-day and m zolum when in pari during the earlier stage of the dreyfus case have make it a point to trust no letter of the slightest importance to the postal service on one occasion a short time after he arrival in england we have reason to fear that a letter address by I to paris have go astray and all correspondence on m zolum 's side be thereupon suspend for several day however the miss letter turn up at last and from that time till the conclusion of the master 's exile the arrangement devise between he wareham and myself work without a hitch vii excursion and alarum already at the time of m zolum 's arrival in london i have receive a summons to serve upon the jury at the July session of the central criminal court i have be excuse from service on a previous occasion but this time i have no valid excuse to offer and it follow that i must either serve or else pay such a fine as the common serjeant might direct there be always a certain element of doubt in these matter and while i might perhaps luckily escape service after a day or two on the other hand i might be keep at the old bailey for more than a week at any other time i should have accept my fate without a murmur but i be greatly worry as to what might befall m zolum during my absence in london and i more than once think of default and ` pay up ' but the master would not hear of it he be now located at oatland and feel sure that he would have no trouble there moreover say he it would always be possible for I to run down now and again of a evening dine with he and attend to such little matter as might require my help so on the Monday morning when the session open i duly repair to town and on the journey up i saw in the ` daily chronicle ' the announcement of m zolum 's recent presence at the grosvenor hotel this give I quite a shock so the press be on the right track at last start from the grosvenor hotel might not the reporter trace the master to wimbledon and thence to he present retreat i have no time for hesitation my instruction moreover be imperative for the benefit of m zolum personally and for the benefit of the whole dreyfus cause i have order to deny everything so i drive to the press association office send up a contradiction of the ` daily chronicle 's ' statement and then hurry up ludgate hill to the court where my name be soon afterwards call i find myself on the second or third jury get together and that day i be not empanel but on the morrow i be require to do duty and between then and the latter part of the week i sit upon four or five case -- all crime of violence and one describe in the indictment as murder this position be the more unpleasant for I as i be by strong conviction a adversary of capital punishment i absolutely deny the right of society to put any man or any woman to death whatever be he or she crime my proper course then seem to lie in the direction of a public statement which would have create i suppose some little sensation or scandal but happily the prosecute counsel in he very first word abandon the count of murder for that of manslaughter and i be thereby relieve from my predicament the case on which i sit and those to which i listen while i remain in attendance need not be particularise i will merely mention that they be nearly all due to drink mr justice lawrance who sit upon the bench be visibly impress by the circumstance to which he more than once allude in he summing up in one case he be so good as to refer to a question put by I from the jury box as a proper and pertinent one at which i naturally feel vastly compliment on the second or third day either before the proceedings begin or when the court rise for luncheon -- i do not exactly remember which -- a gentleman approach I and introduce himself as a member of the press say he ' i have be ask mr avory for you you be mr vizetelly i believe ' ` that be my name ' i answer ` well i have come to speak to you about m zolum 's presence in england ' i should here mention that in spite of my contradiction of the ` chronicle ' story there remain some people who have reason to believe it moreover it have be more or less confirm by the ` morning leader ' and some editor rightly surmise that if m zolum be in london he would very likely be in communication with he usual translator have despatch reporter to my house where my wife have see they on learn that i be quietly during jury service at the old bailey some have apparently conclude that i be not concern in m zolum 's movement which so it happen be the very conclusion i have desire they to arrive at one gentleman however not content with he repulse at my house have follow I to the court i answer he inquiry with a variety of suggestion zolum in england and in london too well we have hear that before say i but be it a probable course for the novelist to take he know no english and have but few personal friend in england he portrait however be in several shop and in many newspaper and only a few year previously he have be see by a thousand english pressman and other so would he not be liable to recognition almost immediately now the only modern language besides french of which m zolum have any knowledge be italian and if i be in he place i say i should go to italy -- for instance to one of the little town in the north whence if needful one could cross over into switzerland though of course there be little likelihood that the italian government would ever surrender the distinguished writer to he persecutor continue in this strain i give my interviewer material for a very plausible article which i remember be duly publish and which thus help to divert attention from the right scent at the week-end have give considerable time to jury duty i be compel to spend Saturday morning in london on business and in the afternoon i allow myself a few hour ' relaxation reach wimbledon about eight in the evening i call on wareham who receive I with a great show of satisfaction for say he my service have be require for some hour past and nobody have know where i might be that day it seem just before wareham have leave he bishopsgate street office he have receive a visit from a most singular-looking little frenchman who have present one of maitre labori 's visit card and request a interview with m zolum question as to he business the only explanation he would give be that he have with he a document in a seal envelope which he must place in m zolum 's own hand wareham have wire to I on the matter but owe to my absence from home have of course receive no reply then on reach wimbledon he have call on I and find I out and finally he have go down to oatland and have there see m zolum who have hand he a note authorise maitre labori 's messenger to call at the hotel on the morrow however the messenger and he manners have seem very suspicious to wareham -- as indeed they afterwards seem to I -- and the question arise be he a genuine envoy be the write on maitre labori 's card perchance a forgery and what be the document in a seal envelope which be to be hand to nobody but m zolum himself well say i at a guess perhaps it be a copy of the versaille judgment and this be simply a impudent attempt to serve it wareham still have zolum 's note in he possession and we resolve to go to town that evening to interview the messenger and extract from he some decisive proof of he bona fides before allow matter to go any further the envoy 's address be the salisbury hotel salisbury court fleet street which i think a curious one be in the very center of the london newspaper district and all the way up to town my suspicion of have to do with a ` plant ' steadily increase it be quite ten o'clock when we reach the hotel and on inquire for we party find that he have go to bed ` well ' say wareham sharply ` he must be rouse we must see he at once ' i speak to the same effect and the hotel servant look rather surprised i have a idea that they fancy we have come to arrest the man in about ten minute he be bring downstairs he appearance be most unprepossessing he be very short with a huge head and a remarkable shock of coal-black hair have hastily rise from bed he have retain he pyjamas but a long frock-coat hang nearly to he slipper and in one hand he carry a pair of glove and in the other a huge eccentric silk hat of the true chimney-pot type these be detail and one might have pass they over but the man 's face be sadly against he he have the slyest eye i have ever see that peculiar shifty glance which invariably set one against a individual and thus i become more and more convinced that we have to deal with some piece of trickery we enter the smoking-room where the gas be burn low a gentleman stop at the hotel be snore in solitary state in one of the arm chair reach a table near a window we sit down and at once engage in battle ' i have not bring you a definite answer ' say wareham to the envoy ` but this gentleman be in m zolum 's confidence and wish further proof of you bona fides before allow you to see m zolum ' then i take up the tale now in french now in english for the envoy speak both language who be he i ask do he claim to have receive laborus 's card from labori himself what be the document in the envelope which he would only deliver to m zolum in person and he reply that he be a diamond-broker do i know so-and-so and so-and-so of hatton garden they know he well they do business with he they could vouch for he honorability but no i be not acquaint with so-and-so and so-and-so i never buy diamond besides it be ten o'clock on Saturday night and the party mention be certainly not at they office for I to refer to they afterwards the little envoy begin to speak of he family connection and he pari friend mention various well-known name but the proof i desire be not forth-coming and when he finally admit that he have not receive maitre labori 's card from that gentleman himself all my suspicion revive true he add that it have be give he by a well-known revisionist leader to whom maitre laborus in a moment of emergency have nobody of he own whom he could send abroad have hand it but what be in the envelope that be the great question the envoy could or would not answer it he know nothing certain on that point then we -- wareham and i -- bring forward we heavy artillery we could not allow a document to be hand to m zolum under such mysterious condition we must see it but no the envoy have strict instruction to the contrary he could not show it to we in that case we rejoin he might take it back to pari he have produce no proof of any of he assertion for all we know he might have tell we a fairy tale and the mysterious document might simply be a copy of the much dreaded judgment of versaille this suggestion produce a visible impression on the little man and for half a hour we sit argue the point finally he begin to compliment we : ` oh you guard he well ' he say ' i shall tell they all about it when i get back to pari but you do wrong to distrust I i be honorable i be well know in hatton garden i have do business there ten twelve year with so-and-so and so-and-so i speak the truth : you may believe I ' we shrug we shoulder for my part i could not shake off the bad impression which the envoy have make on I the gleam of craft and triumph which now and again i have detect in he eye be not to my liking assuredly few man be responsible for any physical repulsiveness we can not all be ` belvedere ' apollo but then the envoy be not only of the ugly but also the cunning-looking class yet a more honorable man never breathe he at once thrust one hand into the depths of a capacious inner pocket produce the mysterious envelope and open it in we presence it contain simply a long letter from maitre laborus accompany by a document concern the prosecution which have be institute with reference to the infamous article that ernest judet of the ` petit journal ' have recently write accuse zolum 's father of theft and embezzlement whilst he be a wardrobe officer in the french foreign legion in algerium it be needful that zolum should see this document and return it by messenger to pari immediately the affair in question be still _ sub judice _ and i must therefore speak of it with some reticence but all who be interested in m zolum 's origin and career will do well to read the admirable volume write by m jacque dhur and entitle ` le pere d'emile zola ' which the societe libre d'edition des gens de lettres -lrb- 30 rue laffitte pari -rrb- publish a short time ago this will show they how strong be the presumption that the document cite by judet in proof of he abominable charge be rank forgery -- similar to those of henry and lemercier-picard in this connection it afford I much pleasure to be able to supply certain extract from francesco zolum 's work at the british museum show how subsequent to the date at which the novelist 's father be allege to have purloin state money he be receive with honor by king louis-philippe the prince de joinville the minister of war and other high personage of the time -- incident which all tend to establish the falsity of the accusation by which judet in he venomous spite and malignity hope to cast opprobrium on the parentage of my dear master and friend but i must return to maitre labori 's envoy when i have see the contents of he envelope i heartily apologise to he for the suspicion which i have cast upon he good faith at this he smile more maliciously and triumphantly than ever and then candidly remark : ` well if you have test I i have test you and i shall be able to tell all we friend in pari that m zolum be in safe hand ' accord to we previous agreement we re-seal the envelope write across it that it have be open in the presence of wareham and myself and afterwards we reconciliation also be ` seal ' over a friendly glass nevertheless the envoy never see m zolum m desmoulin luckily turn up on the morrow and arm with a fresh note from the master persuade we little french friend to hand he the document we leave the salisbury hotel wareham and i well pleased to find that we suspicion have be unfounded nevertheless the whole conversation of the last hour have leave its mark on we and for my part i be in much the same state of mind as in the old day of the siege of pari when the spy mania lead to so many amusing incident thus the circumstance of find two person at the corner of salisbury square as we leave it -- two person who be speak in french and who eye we very suspiciously -- revive my alarm they even follow we along fleet street towards the ludgate circus and though we dodge they through the cavernous ludgate hill railway station across sundry court and past the store of messr spier and pond we again find they wait for we on we return towards the embankment determine so it seem to convoy we home we hasten we step and they hasten theirs we loiter they loiter also at last wareham make I dive into a side street and thence into a maze of court and though the other seem bent on follow we we at last manage to give they the slip i never see these man again but i have retain a strong suspicion that no mere question of coincidence could explain that seem pursuit i take it that the individual have come over to england on the track of the little french envoy for it be after he have bid we good-night outside the salisbury hotel that they have turn to follow we he have tell we too that earlier in the evening he have spend a hour smoking and stroll about salisbury court whilst anxiously await wareham 's arrival with he promise answer whether these man be french police spy whether they be simply member of some swell mob who know that the little gentleman with the huge head and the coal-black hair sometimes journey to london with a fortune in diamond in he possession must remain a mystery as for wareham and myself when we have again reach fleet street we hail a pass hansom and drive away to waterloo viii other personal adventure i have another alarm a few day later return one evening by train from waterloo i be follow into the compartment i select by a party of five man two of whom i recognize one be the landlord of the rayne park hotel now decease and the other he son they companion prove to be frenchman which somehow strike I as a curious circumstance this be the time when a letter address by I to pari for m zolum appear to have go astray and when we be therefore rather apprehensive of some action on the part of the french authority could it be that the two frenchman who have follow I into the railway carriage in the company of a local licensed victualler be actually stay at rayne park within half a mile of my home and if so what could be they purpose i remain silent in my corner of the carriage pretend to read a newspaper but on glance up every now and then i fancy that i detect one or another of the frenchman eye I suspiciously they converse in french either together or with the landlord 's son -- who speak they language i find -- on a variety of commonplace topic until we have pass earlsfield and be fast approach wimbledon then all at once one of they inquire of the other : ` shall we get out at wimbledon or rayne park ' ` we 'll see ' reply the other and at the same time it seem to I that he dart a very expressive glance in my direction i now begin to feel rather nervous it be my own intention to alight at wimbledon as i have a important message from m zolum to communicate to wareham that evening but it now occur to I that the best policy might be to go straight home if these man be french detective or french newspaper man of the anti-dreyfusite party who by shadow I hope to discover m zolum 's retreat it would be most unwise for I to go to wareham 's if once the latter 's name and address should be ascertain by detective communication between m zolum and he friend would be jeopardise on the other hand of course i might be mistake with regard to the man and before all else i ought to make sure whether they really have any hostile intention so i resolve to leave the train at wimbledon as i have originally propose do and then shape my course by theirs as soon as the train pull up i rise to alight and at that same moment the frenchman who have say ` we 'll see ' exclaim to he companion : ` well i think we will get out here ' i wait to hear no more i rush off throw my ticket to a inspector climb the step from the platform descend another flight into the station-yard hurry into the hill road and do not pause until i reach the first turn on the right this happen to be the alexandra road in which wareham 's local office be situate then i turn round and sure enough i see the two frenchman the licensed victualler and he son deliberately come towards I forthwith under cover of a pass vehicle i cross the street to the corner of st george 's road which offer a convenient shady retreat then i await development to my great relief the party of four go straight on up the hill road nevertheless this might only be a feint and i hesitate about go to wareham 's immediately before anything i have better let those suspicious frenchman get right away so i retrace my step towards the station and enter the saloon bar of the south-western hotel there i find a foreign gentleman whether french or italian i do not know whom i have previously meet about wimbledon on various occasion a short rather stout and elderly man formerly i believe in business in london and now live on he income he have more than once speak to I of the dreyfus case zolum esterhazy and all the other and on this particular evening he approach I with a smile and inquire if there be any truth in the report he have hear to the effect that m zolum have lately be see in wimbledon nervous as i be at that moment i be about to give he a sharp reply when the door of the saloon bar open and to my intense alarm in march the two frenchman who have already inspire I with so much distrust they friend be behind they and i could only conclude that my movement have somehow be observe by they and that now i be virtually catch like a rat in a trap i be the more startled too when my foreign acquaintance -lrb- about whom i really know very little -rrb- abruptly quit I to accost the new comer but this give I breathing time the door be free and so leave the refreshment i have order untouched i bolt out of the house in much the same way as a thief might have do and run as if for my life right down the alexandra road until i reach wareham 's office and there i seize the knocker in a frenzy and make such a racket as might have awaken the dead the door suddenly open and i fall into the arm of everson wareham 's managing clerk ` great scott ' say he ` what be the matter you have nearly bring the house down ' ` shut the door ' i reply ` shut the door ' ` but what have happen to you ' i have seat myself on the stair and a full minute go by before i could begin my story then i tell everson all that have befall I some frenchman be on zolum 's track they must be the very same man who have shadow wareham and myself from the salisbury hotel some night previously and now they be in wimbledon have hear no doubt that m zolum have be see there wareham must be warn of it every precaution must be take we must remove we charge from oatland and so forth everson puff away at he pipe and listen meditatively at last he remark ` well it be a curious business if what you say be true what be these frenchman like ' forthwith i begin to describe they as accurately as i could the first likeness i sketch must have be a faithful one for everson start and exclaim ` and the other be he not so-and-so and so-and-so ' ` yes he be but how do you know that ' i rejoin with considerable surprise ` why because i know who the man be although you see they with mr savage of the rayne park hotel it do not follow that they be stay at rayne park as a matter of fact they live here in this very road they have be here i daresay eight or nine month now and as for be detective my dear sir they be musician ' ` you do not mean it ' i collapse again to think that out of a mere chain of chance coincidence i should have forge a perfect melodramatic intrigue to think that i should have let my fancy run away with I in such a fashion and have work myself into such a state of nervousness and alarm i could not help feel a trifle ashamed ` well ' i plead ` for my part i have never see the man before either in wimbledon or elsewhere of course i be short-sighted and my eye sometimes play I trick however as you be sure -- ' ` sure ' repeat everson and again he describe the man in such a way as to convince I that there be no mistake in the matter ` moreover ' he add ' i see they go past the house this very morning when they go up to town ' ` well ' i rejoin ' i suppose i be lose my head ten minute ago i could have swear that those man be after I ' ` you statement that you never see they before ' say everson ` do not surprise I as a rule they go to town every morning and as you be seldom in wimbledon in the evening you can not very well meet one another ' ' i suppose you regard I as a bit of a fool ' i inquire ` oh no the circumstance be curious enough and in you place i might have draw the same conclusion only i do not think i should have hurry off to a friend 's house and have nearly knock it down ' we both laugh and then i apologise ` as a matter of fact ' say i ` all this be the natural outcome of event the beginning be long ago i have a secret which i find haunt I when i get up in the morning all day long it occupy my mind at night it cling to I and follow I through my sleep and i grow more and more suspicious it seem as if everybody i meet have design upon my secret every frenchman i do not know be a detective or a process server with a copy of the versaille judgment in he pocket and thus i shall soon become a monomaniac if i do not discover some remedy i think i shall try the shower-bath system ' then i recall experience date from long prior to m zolum 's arrival in england first mysterious offer of important document bear on the dreyfus case -- document forge a la lemercier-picard hawk about by adventurer who try to dispose of they now in paris now in brussels and now in london needless to say that i like other have reject they with contempt then have come a incident that everson already know of : a stranger with diver alias beseech I for private interview in m zolum 's interest a request which i ultimately grant and which lead to a rather curious experience i have decline to see my correspondent alone and have give he the address of wareham who have be present at the interview and at first the stranger a tall and energetic look man with sunburnt face and heavy moustache have refuse to disclose he business in wareham 's presence if at last he do so it be solely because i tell he that before come to any decision in the matter which he might have to submit to I i should certainly lay they before my solicitor so the result would be the same whether he speak out before wareham or not and wareham very properly add that a solicitor be in a measure a confessor bind to observe professional secrecy at last the man tell we he business and it prove to be a scheme for rescue dreyfus from devil 's island and carry he to a american port neither wareham nor myself be able to take the matter seriously but we visitor speak with great earnestness as though he already see the suggest feat accomplish he have a ship at he disposal and a crew also he give particulars about both if i remember rightly the ship lay at bristol he know cayenne and devil 's island and royal island and so forth he be convince of the practicability of the venture he have weigh all the _ pro _ and _ con _ and it rest with dreyfus 's friend and relative to decide whether or no he -lrb- the prisoner -rrb- should be a free man within another six week wareham laugh he be think of ` captain kettle ' and say so but the would-be rescuer protest that all this be no romance oh he be not a philanthropist he should expect to be well pay for he service but the dreyfus family be rich and m zolum too be a man of means so surely they would not begrudge the necessary fund to release the unhappy prisoner from bondage but i reply that though the dreyfus family and m zolum also be anxious to see dreyfus free they be yet more anxious to prove he innocence personally i know nothing of the dreyfus family and could give no letter of introduction to any member of it such as i be ask for and as regard m zolum i be sufficiently acquaint with he character to say that he would never join in any such enterprise he intend to pursue he campaign by legal means alone and it be useless to refer the matter to he then the interview end rather abruptly a french client of wareham 's happen to call at that very moment and be hear speak in french in the hall this seem to alarm the stranger who cease press he request that i should give he letter of introduction to prominent dreyfusite he rise abruptly say that the time would come when we should probably regret have refuse to entertain he proposal and hurry past the wait french client he run off down the alexandra road in much the same way as i myself subsequently run off from the french ` detective ' who be simply harmless disciple of st cecilium to this day i do not know whether the man be a lunatic a imposter seek money or a _ agent provocateur _ that be one who imagine that he might through I inveigle m zolum into a illegal act which would lead to prosecution and imprisonment the last-mentioned status that i have ascribe to my interviewer be by no mean a impossible one consider the many dastardly attempt make to discredit and ruin m zolum and yet suspicious and abrupt as be the man 's leave-taking when he hear french be speak outside wareham 's private room -lrb- where the interview take place -rrb- i nowadays think it more charitable to assume that he be a trifle crazy one thing be certain he have come to the wrong person in apply to I to aid and abet he in the foolhardy enterprise he speak of this be the first time i have tell this anecdote in any detail but at the period when the incident occur i speak of it casually to a few friend to which circumstance i be incline to attribute the earlier paragraph which appear in the newspaper about american scheme for deliver dreyfus the person whom i saw be i believe a german-american well this incident preposterous as it may appear -lrb- but truth remember be quite as fantastic as fiction -rrb- have prove another link in the chain of suspicious occurrence in which i have be mix up prior to m zolum 's exile other curious little incident have follow and thus for many month i have be live -- even as we live long ago in besiege pari -- in distrust of all stranger and the climax have come with my foolish fear respect a couple of french musician the story i have tell go against I but the man who can not tell a story against himself when he think it a good one can have i think little grit in he composition from the time of my adventure with the french musician i steel myself against excessive fear whilst remain duly vigilant on one point i be still anxious which be that m zolum should be able to settle down in a convenient retreat where he himself would enjoy all necessary quietude whilst we wareham and i know he to be well screen from he enemy would be less liable to those ` excursion and alarum ' which have hitherto troubled we as the next chapter will show this consummation be near at hand ix a quiet home and a haunt house it be m zolum himself who after some stay at oatland discover in the course of he excursion with m desmoulin a retreat to he like it be a house in that part of surrey belong to a city merchant who be willing to let it furnish for a limited period the owner meet m zolum on various occasion and show himself both courteous and discreet the detail of the ` let ' be arrange between he and mr wareham and my wife hastily procure servant for the new establishment these servant however do not speak french and i settle with m zolum that my eldest daughter violette should stay with he to act in some measure as he housekeeper and interpreter this be thrust a young girl not quite sixteen into a position of considerable responsibility but i think that violette would be equal to the task provide she follow the instruction and advice of she mother and as she be then at home for the summer holiday she be send down to m zolum 's without more ado i shall have occasion to speak of she hereafter in some detail in connection with a very curious incident which mark m zolum 's exile here i will merely mention that a parisienne by birth and speak french from she infancy it be easy for she to understand and explain the master 's requirement like m zolum she be provide with a bicycle and the pair of they occasionally spend a afternoon speeding along leafy surrey lane and visit quaint old village the morning however be devote to work for it be now that m zolum start on he novel ` fecondite ' the first of a series of four volume which will be he consider he literary testament these book indeed be to embody what he regard as the four cardinal principle of human life first fruitfulness as oppose to neo-malthusianism which he hold to be the most pernicious of all doctrine next work as oppose to the idleness of the drone whom he would sweep away from the human community then truth as oppose to falsehood hypocrisy and convention and finally justice to one and all in lieu of charity to some oppression to other and favor for the privileged few all four book -- ` fruitfulness ' ` work ' ` truth ' and ` justice ' -- be to be story for year ago m zolum arrive at the conclusion that mere essay on sociology though they may work good in time among people of culture fail to reach and impress the mass in the same way as a story may do it be i take it largely on this account that emile zolum have become a novelist he have certainly write essay but he know how inconsiderable have be they sale in comparison with those of he work embody precisely the same principle but place before the world in the form of novel to criticise he as a mere story-teller be arrant absurdity he himself put the whole case in a nutshell when he remark ` my novel have always be write with a higher aim than merely to amuse i have so high a opinion of the novel as a means of expression that i have choose it as the form in which to present to the world what i wish to say on the social scientific and psychological problem that occupy the mind of think man i might have say what i want to say to the world in another form but the novel have to-day rise from the place which it hold in the last century at the banquet of letter it be then the idle pastime of the hour and sit low down between the fable and the idyll to-day it contain or may be make to contain everything and it be because that be my creed that i be a novelist i have to my think certain contribution to make to the thought of the world on certain subject and i have choose the novel as the best means of communicate these contribution to the world ' if critic in review one or another of m zolum 's book would only bear these declaration of the author in mind the read public would often be spare many irrelevant and foolish remark m zolum 's device be _ nullum die sine linea _ and even before the material for ` fecondite ' be bring to he from france he have give a hour or two each day to the penning of note and impression for subsequent use with the arrival of he book and memorandum work begin in a more systematic way at half-past eight every morning he partake of a cup of coffee and a roll and butter no more and shortly after nine he be at he table in a small room overlook the garden of the house he have rent and there he remain regularly hard at work until the luncheon hour cover sheet after sheet of quarto paper with serried line of he firm characteristic handwriting m zolum have retain possession of the mss of almost every work write by he and i know that these mss often differ largely from the book actually give to the world the ` copy ' be not only extremely clear but remarkably free from erasure and interpolation but when he first proof reach he m zolum revise they with the greatest care he will strike out whole passage in the most drastic manner and alter other until they be almost unrecognisable he will even at the last moment change some character 's name and i know all the inconvenience that arise on certain occasion from have have to prepare portion of my translation from first proof through lack of time to wait for the correct matter this be notably the case with my version of ` paris ' while that work be pass through the press m zolum be already in all the throe of the dreyfus affair and somehow as he have acknowledge to I with regret he forget to tell I that at the last moment he have change the name of several personage in the story thus duthil -lrb- as originally write and give in my translation -rrb- become dutheil in the french book sagnier be change to sanier the princess de horn be rename harn and finally harth and young lord george eliott become elson of course some of the reviewer of my translation attack I virulently for my unwarrantable presumption in change the very name of m zolum 's character they be unaware that the name give by I be those first select by the author who have afterwards alter they and forget to tell I of it come back to ` fecondite ' i should say that m zolum write a average of three page per day of that book during he exile in england work cease at the luncheon hour as i have say and consequently he could dispose of he afternoon but it will be remember that the summer of 1898 be exceptionally hot so hot indeed that m zolum though many year of he childhood be spend under the scorching sun of provence find a siesta absolutely necessary after the midday meal it be only later that he venture out on foot or on he bicycle often take he hand camera with he at some distance from the house where he be reside in the midst of large desert grounds overrun with grass and weed there stand a mournful-looking unoccupied private residence of some architectural pretension on the building of which a considerable sum have evidently be expend the place take m zolum 's fancy the first time he pass it on he bicycle the iron entrance gate be break and he be able to enter the garden and peep through the ground-floor window all speak of decay and abandonment and when through my daughter m zolum begin to make inquiry about the place he be tell a fantastic tragic story a murder it be say have be commit there many year previously a poor little girl have be kill by she stepmother and she remains have be bury beneath a scullery floor there be also talk of the child 's father who at night drive up to the house in a phantom carriage draw by ghostly horse and hammer at the door of the mansion and shout aloud for he dead child the story be allege to be well know and it be say that not a girl from chertsey to esher from walton to byfleet would have dare to pass that house after nightfall when harrowing voice ring out through the tree and the shadowy horse of the ghostly carriage trot swiftly and silently over the gravel the story not only impressed my daughter violette but it greatly interested m zolum on whose behalf i make various inquiry for instance i closely question a old gardener who have know the district for long year all he could tell I however be that there be certainly some strange rumor abroad among the womenfolk but that for he own part he have never hear of any crime and have never see any ghost and at last other tell I quite a different story of the house 's abandonment and this i here venture to give though i certainly can not vouch for its accuracy the place have be build it seem some forty year previously by a retire and wealthy london pawnbroker a gaunt shrivel old man who mount on a white mare have in he decline year be a familiar figure on the road of the district extremely eccentric he have largely furnished and decorate the house with unredeemed article that have be pledge with he there be nothing _ en suite _ old chair of diver pattern be mingle with odd table and sideboard and sofa there be also innumerable daub ` ascribe ' to old master and a wonderful display of wardour-street _ bric-a-brac _ but indeed one have only to look at a average pawnbroker 's shop to picture what kind of article the house must have contain it seem that the old fellow in question have three daughter whom he keep more or less imprison on he recently-acquired property though they be charming girl well worthy of be seek in marriage and the story i hear be that three officer sojourn in the district have one day espy the three forlorn damsel over the garden hedge and have forthwith begin to court they much to the ire of the misanthropic retired pawnbroker that stern old gentleman order he daughter into the house and then keep they in stricter confinement than ever but love laugh at locksmith and the amorous officer eventually carry the place by storm and beat down all parental resistance three wedding follow on the same day and all end for a time as in a fairy tale but the old pawnbroker subsequently marry again to relieve he solitude and after he death he will be attack and a interminable lawsuit ensue with the result that the property be leave unoccupied now it appear it be for sale and before long would probably be cut up into building plot whatever romantic element there might be in the story of the pawnbroker and he daughter m zolum much prefer the popular and gruesome legend of the little girl murder in the scullery and some time later when he consent to write a short story for ` the star ' it be this legend which he take as he basis build thereon the pathetic sketch of ` angeline ' the scene of which he transfer to france he have state in he article ` justice ' publish in pari on he return from exile that during most of the time he spend in england he be virtually in a desert there be people about he of course but he retire into himself as it be commune with he own thought and seek no intercourse with stranger this be true of the period to which i be now refer still he do not complain of solitude in fact he know that quiet be essential for he work only once or twice do anything happen of a nature to cause any anxiety neither wareham nor myself be much trouble at this period there be a lull even in the periodical visit which gentleman of the press kindly favor I still we have take we precaution by admit a mutual friend mr a w pamplin into we confidence if m zolum 's communication with pari through wareham and myself should be threaten mr pamplin be to take upon himself the duty of re-establish they at m zolum 's house there be so far as i be aware but one brief _ alerte _ this occur one afternoon when a servant come to my daughter with the tiding that there be a french hunchback at the door violette impulsively rush off to tell m zolum of it but when in she turn she go to the door to see who the person might be she find that he be a englishman a traveller for some county directory who have merely perform he legitimate work in request to know the name of the occupier of the house of course the only name give be that of the owner then absent at the seaside thus the hot day speed by peacefully enough m zolum have at least find occupation and quietude though it be naturally impossible that he should feel content with he lot each day bring more and more home to he the consciousness that he be in exile and that contumely have be he reward for seek to save france from the shame of a great crime i have previously mention that during the first week or so of he sojourn in england he have refuse to look at newspaper and -- at least so it seem to I -- have seek to banish the dreyfus affair and he own trouble from he mind much as one might seek to drive away a hateful nightmare but before long he again fall under the spell and follow the course of event with the keenest interest and again and again reading of the great battle be wage in france he long to return home and grow restless and impatient moreover a complaint from which he have suffer on and off for some year trouble he on more than one occasion he always rally however and return to he work with renew energy ` fecondite ' be already take shape in the leafy solitude in which he dwell and undoubtedly the steady task of creation resume morning by morning greatly help he to quiet the anguish of heart which the course of event in france would otherwise have render intolerable note -- while this work be appear serially in the ` evening news ' i receive numerous letter from reader interested in various matter mention by I with respect to the foregoing chapter a lady living at staine write say that she be look out for ' a cheap haunt house ' and ask for the address of the one i have mention i be unable to comply with she request as personally i do not believe the house be haunt at all moreover to prevent the sale or let of any particular house by assert it to be haunt would be a offence under the libel law as i could not tell what course my lady-correspondent might take in the matter i prefer not to answer she may she forgive I my impoliteness x ` le reve ' : the dream when the owner of the house which m zolum have rent desire to resume possession it become necessary to find new quarter of a similar character for the master and so he be transfer to another surrey country house where the arrangement remain much the same as previously : work every morning rest or bicycling in the afternoon follow by newspaper reading and letter-writing in the evening the grounds of m zolum 's new retreat be very extensive and in part very shady which last circumstance prove extremely welcome to the novelist who on come to ` cold damp foggy england ' as the french put it have never imagine that he would have to endure a temperature approach that of the tropics the heat deprive he of appetite and moreover he do not particularly relish some of the dish provide for he by a new cook who have lately be engage we all know how great be the servant difficulty even under the best of circumstance and when cook and maid have to be secure in hot haste a entirely satisfactory result be hardly to be expect moreover many servant refuse to live in country retirement far away from they ` follower ' and thus one have at time to take such as one can find as for the cookery to which m zolum be at certain period treat he behold it with wonder and repulsion he taste be simple but to he the plain boil watery potato and the equally watery green be abomination plum tart though serve hot -lrb- why not cold like the french _ tarte _ -rrb- might be more or less eatable but surely apple pudding -- the inveterate breeder of indigestion -- be the invention of a savage race and why when a prime steak be grilled should the cook water it in order to produce ` gravy ' instead of apply to it a little butter and chop parsley this dundreary-wise be one of those thing which nobody not even m zolum could understand however a visit to a fishmonger 's shop have make he acquaint with the haddock the kipper and likewise the humble bloater and occasionally i believe when he appetite need a stimulant he turn to the smoked fish which seem so novel to he palate the cook of course be mightily incensed thereat for she part she most certainly would not eat haddock or kipper for dinner she have too much self-respect to do such a thing so she boil or roasted a leg of mutton for she own repast and the maid ' i do not say that she be wrong and indeed m zolum never force people to eat what they do not care for but in the same way he wish for something that he himself could eat and he be weary of the perpetual joint and the vegetable _ a l'eau _ one day when in a jocular spirit he be talk to I on this subject i tell he that we english have a say to the effect that ` god send we food but the devil invent cook ' ` you be quite right ' he reply ` only as a frenchman i should put it this way : god send we food but the devil invent english cook ' towards the end of August he again become very dispirited the 'cause ' do not at that time appear to be prosper in france where so many people remain under the spell of the deceptive declaration and document which have be make public in the chamber of deputy by war minister cavaignac early in July of course the revisionist be still hard at work but in the face of m cavaignac 's speech placard throughout the 36000 township of france they seem to have a very uphill task before they the anti-dreyfusite on they side be more arrogant than ever and although m zolum never once lose faith in the justice of he cause and its ultimate triumph he do on more than one occasion question whether that triumph would come in a peaceful way felix faure be then still president of the republic and i be abuse i think no confidence in say that m zolum regard that vain showy man as one of the great obstacle to the victory of truth and justice faure he say to I have undoubtedly at one time enjoy well-deserved popularity he zola have be receive by he and in the most cordial manner but the president 's intercourse with crown head and he intimacy with arrogant general officer couple with all the flummery of the protocole all the pomp and display observe whenever he stir from the palace of the elysee have virtually turn he head he be in the hand of those military man who oppose revision and he shield they because they downfall would mean he own he be bent on the hushing-up course lest he presidency should become synonymous with a great judicial crime he fear that he might be force to resign even before he term of office be over or at all event that he might have to abandon all hope of re-election and thus with the president and the more prominent general oppose to revision m zolum though confident in the final issue more than once say to I that there might be serious trouble before all be over he be now keep very well inform of all that take place in france intelligence often reach he before it appear in the newspaper and now and again he tell I what be brew go backward too he confide to I some curious particulars of the genesis of the revisionist campaign but he will himself some day tell all this in a book of he own and i must not anticipate he i will only say that various important thing he mention to I in the autumn of 1898 have since become well-known acknowledge fact and i have every reason to believe that time will duly show the accuracy of those which have not as yet be publicly reveal there be one point to which i must refer at more length in he declaration ` justice ' publish on the expiration of he exile m zolum state that he have long suspect colonel henry though he have possess no actual proof of that officer 's guilt this be so true that i well recollect listen to a conversation between he and m desmoulin during the first day of they sojourn in england when they compare note with respect to they impression of henry whom they have particularly notice at versaille on the occasion of m zolum 's sentence by default they have then observe how nervous and crestfallen the colonel look -- the very picture indeed of a man who dread the discovery of he guilt this be the more remarkable as henry 's confident arrogance at the earlier trial in paris have be so conspicuous the man have a skeleton in he cupboard -- to zola and desmoulin that be certain m zolum be a good physiognomist and he friend -lrb- as a portraitist -rrb- be scarcely less gifted in that respect and they feel equally certain of henry 's culpability as yet they could not say that it be he who have actually forge that famous ` absolute proof ' of dreyfus 's guilt which they know to have be forge by some one but that time would prove he guilty of some abominable machination be to they a foregone conclusion one day it must have be i suppose the 31st of August a rather strange telegram in french reach I for transmission to m zolum it come from pari and be so far as i remember to this effect : ` be prepare for a great success ' a name i be acquaint with follow but what the telegram might mean i know not there be absolutely nothing in the newspaper with reference to any great success achieve at that moment by the revisionist party but possibly the message might refer to one or another of m zolum 's lawsuit such as that with the ` petit journal ' or that with the handwriting expert i re-telegraphed it to m zolum and that day at all event i think no more of the matter but i afterwards learn that the telegram have perplex he quite as much as it perplex I a great success what could it be he rack he mind in vain he review all the phase and aspect of the dreyfus case wonder whether this or that have happen but not suspect the public revelation which be then impend the tragedy which be be enact for a while he walk up and down feverish and anxious -lrb- he be at the time in poor health -rrb- and then he would fling himself on a sofa still and ever indulge in he surmise with that kind of prescience which he have so frequently display in the dreyfus affair he feel certain that something very important have occur for otherwise such a mysterious telegram would never have be send he this last the whole evening my daughter violette be with he at the time and he feverishness doubtless gain on she at last she retire to rest while m zolum accord to he wont carry a lamp into he own room to sit there a while and read some french newspaper which have reach he via wareham by the evening delivery there be nothing in they of a nature to explain the mysterious telegram still he read on and on in the hope as it be of quiet himself it be i believe between eleven o'clock and midnight when he rise to go to bed and as he do so he hear some loud exclamation follow by a cry at first he fancy that the call come from one of the servant ' room and he pause on the landing then however as they be repeat he find that they come from my daughter 's apartment with fatherly solicitude he wait and listen violette be call in she sleep practical enough in matter of everyday life this girl of mine have literary partiality of a somewhat gruesome kind and she avowed ambition -lrb- i quote she own word -rrb- be to write some day story full of witch and wizard that shall make people 's flesh creep for this reason i keep such of anne radcliffe 's uncanny novel as i possess carefully lock up i can well remember my daughter tell I at time of strange thing dream by she in she sleep but not of be of a romantic or a mystical turn myself i have usually pooh-poohed all this as nonsense and such i believe be the course which father usually adopt if they daughter ' imagination begin to run riot as for m zolum when he hear violette call in she sleep he first impulse be to rouse she but all suddenly become still again the girl have probably sink into a more peaceful slumber and so after wait a few minute longer he think it best to leave she as she be nothing further disturbed m zolum that night but on the follow morning when he meet violette downstairs he ask she how she feel and tell she that he have hear she calling in she sleep he have probably form the same opinion as i should have form under the circumstance namely that it be a case of indigestion or a little excitement but she turn to he and reply ` oh i have such a frightful dream i be in a big black place and there be a man on the ground cover with blood and people be crowd round he talk with great excitement and i see you monsieur zolum and you come up look like a giant and wave you arm again and again and seem well pleased ' m zolum be dumbfounded he could make nothing of it a man in a pool of blood and other round he and he zola wave he arm and look well pleased it be nonsense and he be dispose to laugh at the girl and chide she but a little later with the arrival of some morning newspaper the position suddenly change here i should mention that as the pari journal only reach m zolum with a delay of twelve or four-and-twenty hour it have just be arrange that he should be supply with two or three london papers every morning and that he and violette between they should put the telegram concern the dreyfus business into french he open one of these english newspaper -- which it be i do not recollect -- and there he see a whole column deal with the arrest and confession of colonel henry the head to the telegram the very word ` arrest ' and ` confession ' make everything intelligible to m zolum and beneath all this come a brief wire head i think ` paris midnight ' and word much to this effect : ` colonel henry have be find dead in he cell at mont valerien ' so that be the man whom violette in she dream have see weltering in a pool of blood surround by he custodian who have rush in full of excitement m zolum 's presence in that vision be so to say symbolical ` he have wave he arm and have seem well pleased ' -- so the girl have put it in she frank artless way ` well pleased ' may perhaps appear to be scarcely the correct expression at all event it need to be interpret most certainly zola never desire the death of a sinner but on the other hand he could only feel some satisfaction at know that henry 's crime be at last divulged to the world this then be how my daughter dream henry 's death i do not wish to insist unduly on the incident and i have no intention of appeal to the psychical research society to test corroborate or disprove the case there be one rather curious feature that i have not yet mention my daughter have assure I that during the same night she dream the same thing over and over again she try to banish the vision but ever and ever it return as if to impress itself indelibly upon she mind and ever do she see m zolum wave he arm as he hover round the scene at that time the girl know nothing of colonel henry she understand very little about the dreyfus case and all she have to go upon be the enigmatical telegram and m zolum 's talk during the evening when he be express he thought aloud but at that moment he have foresee no death murder or suicide and if the possibility of any arrest have occur to he it be that of m du paty de clam which the revisionist papers be then demand it be true that in infancy my daughter have often see mont valerien as i live for some year at boulogne-sur-seine and the hill and fortress towering across the river be then familiar object to we all but the girl be little more than a baby at the time and so this circumstance can have exercise no influence upon she moreover she have tell I that she have no notion as to what might be the actual scene of she dream it merely appear to she that she be in france because the people she see raise ejaculation in french pass from this incident i may point out that the telegram send to m zolum through I be explain by the news in the english newspaper it be evident that the ` great success ' refer to in the message be the discovery of henry 's forgery and possibly he arrest directly i see the news in a london newspaper i hurry off to m zolum 's and when i reach he abode about noon i find he expect I we then go over matter together the press telegram my daughter 's dream and the probable outcome of the whole affair as be natural m zolum be quite excited first the document which henry have confess to have forge be the very one that general de pellieux have import into the zolum trial in pari as convincing proof of dreyfus 's guilt at that time already its effect have be very great it have destroy all chance of m zolum 's acquittal then too it have be solemnly bring forward in the chamber of deputy by war minister cavaignac who have vouch for its authenticity and now as previously allege by colonel picquart it be show to be a forgery of the clumsiest kind here at least be ' a new fact ' warrant the revision of the whole dreyfus case surely the blindest bigot could not resist such evidence of the machination of those who have send dreyfus to devil 's island truth and justice would speedily triumph and in a week or two he zola would be able to return to france again but he do not take sufficient account of human obstinacy and vileness he friend to whom he appeal on the subject of he return urge he to remain where he be for the battle they say be by no means over and he name be still like the red scarf of the matador that goad the bull to fury the advice prove good for again be passion stir henry the ignoble forger be raise to the position of martyr and cavaignac and zurlinden and chanoine in turn strive to impede the course of justice ` hope defer maketh the heart sick ' and thus m zolum finding so many difficulty in the way of he return abandon for a time all work and fall into brooding melancholy xi through the autumn important event be now take place in pari cavaignac resign the position of war minister and be succeed by zurlinden du paty de clam be turn out of the army esterhazy who have likewise be ` retire ' flee from france mme dreyfus address to the minister of justice a formal application for the revision of she unfortunate husband 's case and that application be in the first instance refer to a commission of judge and functionary then general zurlinden resign he ministerial office and again become governor of pari apprehend the gallant picquart on a ridiculous charge of forgery and cast he into close confinement in a military prison there be talk too of a military plot in pari and again and again be attempt make to prevent the grant of revision throughout those day of alternate hope and fear m zolum suffer keenly it be too about this time that he hear of the death of he favorite dog -- a incident to which i have previously refer as come like a blow of fate in the midst of all he anxiety when he rally he speak to I of he desire to familiarise himself in some degree with the english language with the object principally of arrive at a more accurate understanding of the telegram from pari which he find in the london newspaper a dictionary a conversation manual and a english grammar for french student be then obtain and whenever he feel that he need a little relaxation he take up one or another of these book and read they as he put it to I ` from a philosophical point of view ' later i procure he a set of messr nelson 's ` royal reader ' for child when he greatly praise declare they to be much superior to the similar class of work current in france afterwards he himself purchase a prettily illustrated edition of the classic ` vicar of wakefield ' -lrb- the work to which all french young lady be put when learn we language -rrb- but he find portion difficult to understand and a french friend then procure he a edition in which the text be print in french and english on alternate page one day when he have be dip into english papers and book he tackle I on rather a curious point ` why be it ' say he ` that the englishman when he write of himself should invariably use a capital letter that tall i which recur so often in a personal narrative strike I as be very arrogant a frenchman refer to himself write _ je _ with a small _ j _ a german though he may gratify all he substantive with capital letter employ a small _ i _ in write _ ich _ a spaniard when he use the personal pronoun at all bestow a small _ y _ on he _ yo _ while he honor the person he address with a capital _ v _ i believe indeed -- though i be not sufficiently acquaint with foreign language to speak with certainty on the point -- that the englishman be the only person in the world who apply a capital letter to himself that i strike I as the triumph of egotism it be tall commanding and so brief i -- and that suffice how do it originate ' it be difficult for I to answer m zolum on the point i be a very poor scholar in such a matter and i could find nothing on the subject in any work of reference i have by I i surmised however that the capital i as a personal pronoun be a survival of the time when english whether write or print be stud with capital even as german be to-day if i be wrong perhaps some one who know better will correct I one thing i have often notice be that a child 's first impulse be to write ` i ' and that it be only after admonition that the aggressive and egotistical ` i ' supplant the humbler form of the letter this do not surprise m zolum since vanity like most other vice be acquire not inherent in we nature but in a chaff way he suggest that one might write a very humorous essay on the english character by take as one 's text that tall stiff and self-assertive letter ` i ' how far m zolum actually carry he study of english i could hardly say but during the last month of he exile he more than once astonished I by he knowledge of a irregular verb or of the correct comparative and superlative of a adjective and if he seldom attempt to speak english he at least make considerable progress in read it by the time he return to france he could always understand any dreyfus news in the english papers of course the language in which the news be couch be of great help to he as in three instance out of four it be simply direct translation from the french in this connection while praise many feature of the english press m zolum more than once express to I he surprise that so much of the paris news print in london should be simply take from pari journal some correspondent say he never seem to go anywhere or to see anybody themselves they purely and simply extract everything from newspaper this he be able to check by means of the many pari print which he receive regularly ` here ' he would say ` this paragraph be take verbatim from le figaro this other appear in le temp this other in le siecle ' and so forth and he be not allude to extract from editorial but to descriptive matter -- account of demonstration and ceremony fashionable wedding and other social function interview and so forth the practice upset all he idea of a foreign correspondent 's duty which should be to obtain first-hand and not second-hand information in principle this be of course correct but a correspondent can not be everywhere at the same time and nowadays moreover english journalist in paris do not enjoy quite the same facility as formerly as regard more particularly the dreyfus business the french with a sensitiveness that can be understand have all along deprecate anything in the way of foreign interference and the english pressman of inquire mind on the subject have more than once meet with a rebuff from those in a position to give information again the political difficulty between the two country of recent year have often place the pari correspondent in a very invidious position this bring I to the fashoda trouble which arise last autumn while m zolum be still in he country retreat the great novelist 's enemy have often allege that he be no true frenchman but for my part after thirty year ' intimacy with the french i would claim for he that he country count no better patriot he be on principle oppose to warfare but there be a higher patriotism than that which consist in perpetually beat the big drum and that higher patriotism be zolum 's the fashoda difficulty trouble he sorely and directly it seem likely that the situation might become serious he tell I that it would be impossible for he to remain in england the progress of the negotiation between france and great britain be watch with keen vigilance and m zolum be ready to start at the first sign of those negotiation collapse as all he friend be oppose to he return to france -lrb- they have again virtually forbid it late in September when the brisson ministry finally submit the case for revision to the criminal chamber of the cour de cassation -rrb- he would probably have go to belgium but i doubt whether he would have remain long in that country i have say that m zolum be oppose to warfare on principle he view in this respect have long be share by I life 's keenest impression be those acquire in childhood and youth and in my youth -- i be but seventeen though already act as a war correspondent the youngest i suppose on record -- i witness war attend by every horror : -- a city pari starve by the foreigner and subsequently in part fire by some of its own child and between those disaster have pass through the hostile line i see a army of 125000 man with 350 gun that of chanzy irretrievably route after battle in a snowstorm of three day ' duration cast into highway and byway with thousand of barefooted straggler beg they bread with hundred of farmer bewail they crop they cattle and they ruin homestead with mother innumerable weep for they son and fair girl in the heyday of they youth lament the lad to whom they troth be plight and in that ` retraite infernale ' as one of its historian have call it i see want hunger cupidity cruelty disease stalk beside the war fiend so no wonder that like zolum i regard warfare as the greatest of abomination that fall upon the world i often regret that short of actual war itself and its disaster and misery there should be no means of bring the whole horror of the thing home to those silly arm-chair jingo journalist of many country we own include who view war simply as a means of impose the will of the stronger upon the weaker and lose sight of all that attend it save martial pomp and individual heroism ever clamor for the exercise of force as soon as any difficulty arise between two government tie of affection bond of marriage as well as long year of intimacy link I moreover to the french people and more keenly perhaps than even the master himself do i realize what war between france and england might mean thus we both have a anxious time during the fashoda trouble fortunately for the general peace hostility be avert and m zolum be thus able to remain in he secluded english home and to continue the writing of he novel the weather be still very fine and now and again he venture upon a little excursion the principal one be to virginia water where he stroll round the lake then drive through part of the great park and thence on to windsor castle where he see all the sight the state apartment st george 's hall and chapel the albert memorial chapel and so forth and as he have bring he hand camera with he he be able to take a few snapshot of what he see i be not present on that occasion he companion be a french gentleman a very intimate friend and my daughter but i be please to hear that he have at all event see windsor as a rule it be extremely difficult to induce he to emerge from he solitude when he take a walk or a bicycle ride he destination be simply some sleepy surrey village or desert common he appreciate english scenery around oatland he have be much strike by the beauty of the tree and be greatly astonish to find such lofty and perfect hedge of holly run at time for a mile almost without a break on either side of the road i suppose that some of the finest holly hedge in england be to be find in that district then too the rookery surprised and interested he there be one he could see from he window at the last half of he country residence and many a idle half-hour be spend by he in watch the flight of the bird or they occasional parliament nobody recognize he on he ramble i even doubt if people generally think he a foreigner he have long cease to wear he rosette of the legion of honor and he have replace he white billycock by a english straw hat towards the close of the fine weather he purchase a ` bowler ' which greatly alter he appearance indeed there be nothing like a ` bowler ' to make a foreigner look english wareham and i have now quite cease to fear that any attempt would be make to serve the versaille judgment on m zolum we be only trouble by gentleman of the press both french and english for since esterhazy have flee from france and the case for revision have be formally refer to the cour de cassation several newspaper have become desirous of ascertain m zolum 's view on the course of event my instruction remain however the same as formerly : i be to tell every applicant that m zolum decline to make any public statement and that he would receive nobody i be occasionally incline to fancy that some of those who call on I imagine that these instruction be of my own invention and that i be simply keep m zolum _ au secret _ for purpose of my own but nothing be further from the truth personally at certain moment when the revision proceedings begin when m brisson fall from office when m dupuy listen to the clamor of a pack of jackal transfer the revision inquiry from the criminal chamber to the entire court of cassation i think that it might really be advisable for he to speak out but anxious though he be disgusted indignant too at time he would do nothing to add fuel to the flame passion be rouse to a high enough pitch already and he have no desire to inflame they more besides the cause be in very good hand clemenceau and vaughan yve guyot and reinach jaure and gerault-richard pressense cornely and score of other be fight admirably in the press and he intervention be not require many a man circumstance as m zolum be would have rush into print for the mere sake of notoriety but he condemn himself to silence stifle the word which rise from he throbbing heart and after all be not that course more worthy more dignified thus i could only return one answer to the newspaper man who write to I or call at my house late in autumn there be a average of three application a week one or two gentleman i believe imagine that m zolum be stay very near I and fail to learn anything at my place they try to question one or two tradesman in the neighborhood one of these a grocer become so irate at the frequent inquiry as to whether a frenchman who write book and have a gray beard and wear glass be not stay in the vicinity that he end by receive the reporter with far more energy than politeness not only order they out of he shop at the double quick but pursue they with he vituperative eloquence ` take one consideration with another a reporter 's lot at time be not a happy one ' a climax be reach when one gentleman after communicate with m zolum by letter through various channel and receive no answer from he ascertain my address and call there as servant be not always to be depend upon we have make it virtually a rule at home that whenever a stranger be see at the front door my wife herself should if possible answer it and she do so in the instance i be refer to well the gentleman first ask for I and on learn that i be absent he explain that he be a friend a private friend of m zolum whom he wish to see on a important private matter could she my wife oblige he with m zolum 's address no she could not he have better write and he letter would be duly forward by I then the applicant start on another story it be no use he write he must see I should i be at home on the morrow the matter be of great importance it would mean a large sum of money for myself and so on my wife have not much confidence in what be tell she but she request the visitor to leave he name and address in order that i might make a appointment with he should i think such a course advisable she be at the moment far more amaze and amuse than indignant she bid the gentleman keep he money and then show he to the door to I that evening she do not mention the incident and indeed i only hear of it after i have take the trouble to communicate with m zolum respect the gentleman 's urgent private business which -lrb- so it turn out -rrb- be purely and simply connect with journalism my visitor have act on behalf of the owner of a well-known london newspaper i do not know whether he principal have any knowledge of he impudent attempt at bribery for my own part i much regret that my wife -lrb- i suppose in the interest of peace -rrb- should have keep it from I at that time as she do for the gentleman might otherwise have experience as he deserve a rather unpleasant ten minute xii the final resting-place at last the time arrive when it become necessary to remove m zolum from he country quarter and by he desire wareham and i then look around we for a suitable suburban hotel the autumn be now far spend and m zolum feel confident that he would be back in pari by the end of the year have he foresee that he exile would prove so long he would certainly have send for a couple of he french servant and have set up a quiet establishment in some other furnished house but for another month or two he consider that hotel accommodation would well suffice the place select for he by wareham and myself be the queen 's hotel upper norwood and there he remain from late in the autumn of 1898 until he departure from england a glance at the queen 's hotel show one that it be compose of what be once separate house now connect together by building of one storey only each of these house or as one may perhaps call they pavilion have a separate entrance and staircase and the advantage of this to one circumstance as m zolum be must be obvious a person lodge in one of the pavilion can come and go freely there be no vast hall to cross with a dozen servant stand around ready to scrutinise you as you pass in and out you have you suite of room in one or another pavilion you take you meal there in you own dining-room and you can shut yourself off as it be from the greater part of the establishment and enjoy privacy and quiet this no doubt be the reason why so many well-to-do people who dislike the stir and bustle of the ordinary hotel patronise the hostelry at upper norwood there at one time -- when consult sir morell mackenzie i believe -- stay the unfortunate emperor frederick and now it may add to its list of patron the most famous frenchman of he day it seem to wareham and I that the queen 's hotel would under the circumstance prove a ideal retreat for m zolum moreover upper norwood stand on very high ground and it be probable therefore that he would largely escape the winter fog of course the crystal palace be comparatively near but it be not very largely patronise in the winter and besides if m zolum wish to escape a crowd he have only to take he walk in another direction the queen 's hotel stand back from the road but in the first instance as a precautionary measure it be think best to select for m zolum a suite of room overlook the extensive garden as time go on however the tree lose they last leave the vista from these room charming enough in summer become very cheerless so the master 's quarter be shift to a larger suite on the ground floor with the window of the two communicate sitting-room overlook both the road and the garden the two sitting-room be a advantage particularly during the time that mme zolum stay at the queen 's hotel -lrb- for she join she husband on and off -rrb- as he could devote one of they entirely to he work but when mme zolum finally leave england -lrb- in a very ailing state after a terrible cold have keep she within door for some week -rrb- she husband move once again and install himself on the second floor where the room be smaller and therefore easier to warm it be then mid-winter the various room m zolum occupy and in which he spend from seven to eight month -- that be by far the greater portion of he exile -- be all part of the same house or pavilion this be the last of the pavilion constitute the hotel proper adjoining be a lower building belong to the same proprietary as the hotel but in a measure distinct from it most of m zolum 's tenancy be spend in the topmost room after bring the master up from the country i take he one morning down to norwood and he cordially approve of the arrangement which have be make for he there be only one thing amiss wareham and i have be promise that he should have a waiter speak french to attend on he and the one provide know perhaps just a few word of that language however he be very intelligent very discreet very willing to oblige -- a pattern waiter of the good old english school and when i have explain to he exactly what would be require he take due note of everything and for many month the arrangement that be make work virtually without a hitch if m zolum 's surroundings have alter the routine of he life remain the same as formerly with regard to he novel ` fecondite ' he have as the say go ` warm to he work ' which he pursue at the queen 's hotel with unflagging energy know he habit i never -lrb- unless under exceptional circumstance -rrb- visit he till he have finish he daily quantum of ` copy ' that be about the luncheon hour then we would talk business communicate to one another such news as might be necessary and at time exchange impression with regard to the incident of the day among other matter often discuss be the english birth-rate and the rearing of english child point which deeply interested m zolum as they be germane to the subject of ` fecondite ' i could at first only give he general information but the rev r ussher vicar of westbury buck the able author of ` neo-malthusianism ' very kindly send I a copy of he exhaustive work which contain many particulars on the point that principally interested m zolum moreover mr george p brett the president of the macmillan company of new york -lrb- m zolum 's american publisher -rrb- supply he with some interesting information respect the united state with regard to england m zolum have be much strike by certain proceedings institute during he exile against medical man midwife and other proceedings which seem to point to the existence in this country of a state of affair much akin to that prevail in france the affair of the brother chrime who first sell bogus medicine and then proceed to blackmail the woman who have purchase they be in zolum 's estimation particularly significant for here be hundred and hundred of englishwoman apply to those man for the means of accomplish the greatest crime against nature there could be on that point m zolum speak in no uncertain language he understand well enough that the authority could not justly single out a few of those hundred of woman for prosecution and punishment : but he censure the woman quite as much as he censure the convict man who be after all but common scoundrel and he be amaze to find that so few english newspaper venture to speak out on the matter there be plenty of leaderette on the cunning show by the man but the alacrity of the woman to purchase the bogus medicine be as a rule lightly pass over and great as be m zolum 's admiration for the english press in many respects he could but regard its attitude towards the chrime case as lamentably inadequate and lack in moral courage ' a great responsibility ' say he ` rest with those who possess commanding influence refrain from requisite action and who instead of seek to cure proved and acknowledge evil connive at drive they beneath the surface where in secret they steadily grow and expand ' and all this for the sake of the ` young person ' to whose mythical innocence the welfare of a whole nation be often sacrifice m zolum 's view be sum up in the word : ` let all be expose and discuss in order that all may be cure ' he regard neo-malthusianism and its practice as abominable and when he have learn more of the actual situation in england he be emphatically of opinion that he book ` fecondite ' though apply to france alone might well with little alteration be apply to this country also the fluctuation in the english birth-rate from 1872 to 1897 be to he full of mean at a certain period for instance they show all the harm work by the abominable bradlaugh-besant campaign but what he dwell on still more be the absolute physical incapacity of so many english mother to suckle they own offspring circumstance be much the same both in france and the united state at least among the older colonial family in three or four generation the woman of a family in which the practice of suckling have cease be altogether unable to give the breast and the ` bottle ' ensue with its thousand evil and a gradual deterioration of the race on the last occasion when jame russell lowell come to england he be ask what change if any he remark since he last visit among the people he meet and he reply that he be most strike by the fall off in height and breadth of shoulder of the average man in the london street though matter have not yet reach such a point as in france and elsewhere it be i think incontestable that the english race like many another be physically deteriorate athletics tend to improve the standard but there must be proper material to work upon and m zolum i find hold the view that for a race to be healthy its womenfolk should be willing and able to discharge the primary duty of nature when he discover that so many englishwoman would not or could not suckle they babe he remark that england have start on the same downward course as france he often watch the troops of nursemaid and child whom he meet during he afternoon stroll he notice and tell I how many of the former neglect they charge stand about flirt or gossip or look into shop window while the baby in the bassinette or the mail-cart suck away at that vile invention the bone and gutta-percha ` soother ' and he be astonish that lady should apparently consider it beneath they to accompany baby on the promenade indeed the invariable absence of the mother give he a rather bad opinion of they : for surely they must know that many of the nurse-girl neglect the infant and yet they exercise no supervision ` of course ' say he ` they be visit or receive or read novel or bicycling or play lawn tennis ah well that be hardly my conception of a mother 's duty towards she infant whatever be she station in life ' now and again at interval i accompany he on he afternoon walk these generally take a semi-circular form we descend from the plateau of upper norwood on one side to climb to it again on another sometimes we pass by way of beulah spa then round by some field and a recreation ground with the name of which i be not acquaint there be several shapely oak tree thereabout which he greatly admire and even photograph ` do you know ' he remark to I one afternoon ` when i come out all alone for my usual constitutional and want to shake off some worrying thought i often amuse myself by count the number of hairpin which i see lie on the foot-pavement oh you need not laugh it be very curious i assure you i already have idea for two essay -- one on the capital i in its relation to the english character and another on the physiology of the english guillotine window and the form it affect not forget the circumstance that whenever a architect introduce a french window into a english house it invariably open outwardly so as to be well buffet by the wind instead of into the room as it should do well now i be begin to think that i might write something on the carelessness of englishwoman in fasten up they hair and the phenomenal consumption of hairpin in england for the consumption must be enormous since the loss be so great as i will show you ' then he proceed to ocular demonstration as we walk on for half a hour or so principally along road border by the umbrageous garden of villa residence we count all the hairpin we could see there be about four dozen and he be careful to point out that we have chiefly follow a route where there be but a moderate amount of traffic not one man in a thousand probably would have think of count the lose hairpin in the street but then m zolum be a observer and if i tell this anecdote which some may think puerile it be by way of illustrate he power of observation and the length to which he occasionally carry they on one point i tell he he be rather in the wrong the great loss of hairpin do not proceed so much from the carelessness of woman in fasten they hair as from they ` pennywise and pound-foolish ' system of buy cheap hairpin with few and inefficient ` twist ' these cheap hairpin never ` catch ' properly in they coiled-up tress the woman go out walk rapidly toss they head perchance and one at least of they hairpin fall to the ground suppose one hundred woman pass along a certain road or street in the course of the day it would not be surprising to find that at least thirty hairpin be lose there and i conclude by say that to the best of my belief the aforesaid hairpin be ` make in germany ' another thing which amuse and interested m zolum when he take he walk around norwood be to note the often curious and often high-sounding name bestow on villa residence as a rule the smaller the place the more grandiose the appellation bestow on it some of the name m zolum have now make progress with he english could readily understand other too be virtually french such as bellevue beaumont and so forth but there be several that i have to interpret such as oakdene thornbrake beechcroft hillbrow woodcote fernside fairholme inglenook etc and there be one name that i could not explain to he at all -- a awful name which i fancy might be gaelic or celtic though i appeal in vain to scottish irish and welsh friend for a interpretation of its mean it be write thus : ` ly-ee-moon ' nobody of my acquaintance be able to explain it to I m zolum write it down in he memorandum-book as a abstruse puzzle however while this narrative be appear in the ` evening news ' several correspondent kindly inform I that ly-ee-moon -lrb- at time write ` lai-mun ' -rrb- be chinese be the name of a narrow passage or strait between the island of hong-kong and the mainland of china -lrb- now transfer to great britain -rrb- at the eastern entrance to the harbor of the city of victorium on the island it seem also that ly-ee-moon be a name often give to ship sailing in the china sea and in the case of the norwood house build by a retired shipowner and sea captain the name be take from a vessel ply on the australian coast for many year and ultimately wreck with great loss of life the owner of the norwood house have a engraving of the ship execute on a plate-glass window of this hall until these explanation reach I both m zolum and myself be quite as much at sea -lrb- with regard to ` ly-ee-moon ' -rrb- as ever its owner and captain be when i spend a afternoon at norwood with m zolum we generally return to the hotel about half-past four for a cup of tea and on the way back -lrb- particularly during the last month -rrb- i frequently purchase postage stamp for he at the chief post-office he might of course have buy they himself and as a matter of fact he do at time do so but he be aware i think that he be regard with some suspicion by the young lady clerk under the control of the duke of norfolk at certain period christmas time and the new year for instance m zolum 's correspondence become extensive and on the first occasion when he enter the upper norwood post-office and ask for fifty 2 1_2 d stamp he be look at with surprise when a couple of day later he apply for another fifty the young lady eye he as if he be a genuine curiosity a hundred 2 1_2 d stamp in four day what could he do with they nobody could tell when shortly afterwards he return for another supply of the same kind the norwood post-office be convulse and i doubt if even now some of the young lady have quite get over that brief but extraordinary run on the so-called ` foreign stamp ' i hope they do not imagine that m zolum be hungry and buy those stamp to eat xiii winter day the winter be hardly a cold one but it prove very tempestuous and upper norwood stand high as it do feel the full force of the gale christmas find m zolum alone still this do not particularly affect he as christmas save as a religious observance be but little keep up in france where festivity and holiday-making be reserve for the new year in m zolum 's room the only token of the season be a huge branch of mistletoe hanging over the chimney-piece this he have buy himself after i have tell he of the privilege attach to mistletoe in england there be however no young lady to kiss and if i remember rightly mme zolum who have be absent in pari do not return to norwood until a day or two before the new year while she husband form a fairly favourable opinion of england its custom and its climate mme zolum i fear be scarcely please with this country at all event she finally leave it vow that she would never return but then for three or four week bronchitis and kindred ailment have keep she absolutely imprison in she room -- she illness last the longer perhaps because she be unwilling to place herself in the hand of any medical man the new year be but a day or two old when one of the london morning newspaper announce with a great show of authority that a application for the extradition of m zolum be imminent somebody moreover inform the same journal that he have recognize and interview m zola a evening or two previously to which statement be append a brief account of some of m zolum 's view all this amaze I the more as on the very day mention in the newspaper i have be with the master till nine pm and i could hardly believe than anybody have interview he after that hour moreover my wife have since see he and he have say nothing to she of any visit or interview nevertheless as other papers proceed to copy the statement to which i have refer i think it well to communicate with we exile on the subject through the carelessness of one of m zolum 's friend wareham 's name and address have lately be give to a english journalist usually resident in pari and this journalist have then come to london to try to discover the master 's whereabouts it be therefore possible that there might be some truth in the story but m zolum promptly wire to I that such be not the case and follow up he telegram with a note in which he say : ` my dear confrere and friend -- i have just telegraph to you that the whole story of a journalist have interview I be purely and simply a falsehood i have see nobody again there can be no question of extradition in my case all that could be do would be to serve I with the judgment of the assize court those people do not even know what they write about ` as for ----- 's indiscretion this be to be regret i be write to he for the sake of we communication i have always desire that wareham 's name and address should be know only to those on whom one can depend tell he that he must remain on he guard and _ never _ acknowledge that he know my address persevere in that course yourself i will wait a few day to see if anything occur before decide whether the correspondence arrangement should be alter it would be a big affair and i should afterwards regret a change if it be to prove uncalled for let we wait ' go through the many memorandum and note i receive from m zolum during he exile i also find this dated February : ` you do right to refuse mr ----- my address i absolutely decline to see anybody no matter who may call on you under whatever pretext it be preserve the silence of the tomb less than ever be i dispose to let people disturb I ' again a little later : ` no i will see neither the gentleman nor the lady tell they so distinctly in order that they may worry you no more ' with the new year it will be remember have come a succession of startling event which keep m zolum in a state of acute anxiety the violent attack of the anti-revisionist on the criminal chamber of the cour de cassation culminate in the resignation of q de beaurepaire in a inquiry into the criminal chamber 's method of investigation and finally in the passing of a law which transfer the task of the criminal chamber to the whole of the supreme court on the many intrigue of that period i often converse with m zolum who be particularly anger by the blind opposition of president faure and the impudent duplicity of prime minister dupuy these two be undoubtedly do they utmost to impede the course of justice then suddenly on February 17 come a thunderbolt faure have die on the previous evening and by he death one of the greatest obstacle to the triumph of truth be for ever remove we talk of the defunct president at some length m zolum adhering to the opinion that he have express during the summer but the great question be who would succeed m faure when m brisson have fall from office after initiate the revision proceedings m zolum have say to I : ` brisson 's present fall do not signify it be bind to come but hereafter he will reap he reward for he courage in favor revision brisson will be faure 's successor as president of the republic ' in express this opinion m zolum have imagine that faure would live to complete he full term of office he death in the very midst of the battle entirely change the position m brisson 's time have not come and consider he age it indeed now seem as if he might never attain to the supreme magistracy the future look blank but m loubet be elect president and a feeling of great relief follow i have reason to believe that m zolum regard the death of president faure as the crucial turning-point in the whole dreyfus business have faure live every means would still have be employ to shield the guilty all the influence of the elysee would as before have be bring to bear against the unhappy prisoner of devil 's island during those January and February day m zolum be a eager reader of the newspaper rumor of all kind be in circulation and once again in m zolum 's mind do despondency alternate with hopefulness i must say however that he be not particularly impress by paul deroulede 's attempt to induce general roget to march on the elysee he regard deroulede as a scarcely sane individual and hold view on parisian demonstration which may surprise some of those who believe everything they read in the newspaper these view may be epitomise as follow : the government can always put down trouble in the street when it desire to do so if trouble occur it be because the government allow it three-fourths of the ` demonstration ' that have take place in pari during the last year or two have be simply ` get up ' by professional agitator the man who start the shouting and the march be pay for they service the tariff be as a rule two franc per demonstration with 500 franc that be 20 l one can get 250 man together these be join by as many fool and a small contingent of enthusiast and then you have a rumpus on the boulevard and half the newspaper in europe announce on the morrow : ` serious disturbance in paris impend revolution ' some people may ask where do the money for many of these demonstration come from the answer be that it come largely from much the same source as those whence general boulanger 's fund be derive -- that be from the orleanist party as for military insubordination plot or anything of that kind m zolum often point out to I that no general could effect a revolution for the simple reason that he could not rely on he man to follow he in a illegal attempt it be quite possible that now and again other general besides boulanger have dream of overturn the republic but they have not the means to do so it be as likely as not that the officer foolhardy enough to make the attempt would be shoot in the back by some of the socialist among the rank and file boulanger no doubt could have count on a good many man and ` non-com ' as he be popular with they but few if any officer above the rank of captain would have follow he to-day moreover intense jealousy still reign among the french general officer there be not one among they of sufficient pre-eminence and popularity to gather round he a large contingent of military man of high rank for any political purpose and this of course -- quite apart from the opinion of the mass -- largely make for a continuance of the republican regime with a weak government in office one with a policy of drift everything may become possible but so long as foresight and vigilance be show the republic remain impregnable if military malcontent become obstreperous it be only necessary to treat they as general boulanger be treat i recollect hearing m yve guyot who be a member of the cabinet which put down ` the brave general on the black horse ' and who be also one of the few french friend who visit m zolum during he exile give a brief account of some of the decisive step which be take to stop the boulangist agitation the prefect of police of that time be summon to the ministry of the interior where two or three member of the government await he arrival amongst other order give he be one -lrb- if i remember rightly -rrb- for the dissolution of m deroulede 's ` league of patriot ' which then as more recently be at the bottom of much of the agitation the prefect hesitate he be afraid to execute he order ` very well then ' say m constan m guyot and other ` you may regard you resignation as accept you be not the man for the situation if you be afraid there be plenty who be not and we shall immediately replace you ' the threat of the loss of office work a immediate change in the prefect he become as brave as he have be timorous and with all due energy he proceed to carry out he instruction boulangism be crushed and hold up to public opprobrium and ridicule and but for the culpable weakness and connivance of m felix faure and he favorite prime minister m meline it would never have revive in its varied form of anti-semitism anti-dreyfusism etc french functionary those of the civil service be as a rule a docile set but every now and again a government find some laxity among prefect and sub-prefect make a few example three or four prefect of department be transfer in disgrace to less important town two or three be cashier and the same method be follow with some of the sub-prefects thereupon all the other prefect and ` sub ' throughout the eighty and odd department of france hasten to show themselves vigilant and if need be energetic take one consideration with another this system of frightening the prefect into obedience and vigilance have so far as the maintenance of public order be concerned answer admirably well whenever it have be apply during the last fifty year it have undoubtedly be adopt at time for the furtherance of purely despotic or arbitrary aim but if ever it be justified such be the case during the dreyfus agitation if the government have not connive for purpose of its own at the proceedings of what the french call the ` militarist ' party there would have be no turmoil at all but those in power desire to shield culprit of high rank and to defend the effete organization of the french war-office and those who thus misuse the power they hold who sacrifice the national interest who trample truth and justice under foot and render they country a object of amazement distrust and ridicule throughout the length and breadth of europe -lrb- russium not except -rrb- will be censure and condemn in no uncertain voice by the france of to-morrow but i be forget the prefect and sub-prefect i mention they partly because m zolum himself might have be one of they it be not generally know i believe that at the time of the franco-german war he in some degree assist one of the sub-prefect in the discharge of he duty and -lrb- have he only so choose -rrb- might even have become a sub-prefect himself he have be a opposition a republican journalist before the fall of the empire and m gambetta during he virtual dictatorship throughout the latter part of the franco-german war be very fond of appoint journalist of that description to office both in the army and the civil service m zolum then might have become a sub-prefect to begin with and later a full-blown prefect picture he in a cocked hat and a uniform bedizen with gold lace and with a slender sword dangling by he side that at all event be how sub-prefect and prefect use to array themselves when ` in the exercise of they function ' i doubt of m zolum would ever have make a good functionary he character be too independent and in all likelihood he would have resign the very first time that he happen to have ' a few word ' with he minister but politics have catch he in they grasp he would doubtless -lrb- like the few functionary of independent view who throw up they post in france -rrb- have next come forward as a candidate for the chamber or the senate and then -- why not he might have be a under-secretary of state later a minister and finally president of the republic true as he himself know and readily admit he be no orator but then orator be not always the man who get on in france thier be a ready and fluent speaker but macmahon could scarcely say -lrb- or learn by heart -rrb- twenty consecutive word grevy it be true could be long-winded prosy and didactic but the power of elocution which carnot and felix faure possess be infinitesimal and so the idea of emile zolum president of the republic may not be so far-fetched after all particularly when one remember zolum 's great power of observation analysis and foresight have he take to politics in he younger day he would at least have make he mark in the career thus choose and it may be that in some respects french public life might then have be healthier than it have prove during the last quarter of a century perchance too on the other hand many old maid and young person not to mention ecclesiastic and vigilance society would have be spare manifold pious ejaculation and gasp of horror again my poor father -- imprison ruin and hound to he death -- might still have be alive unless some other courageous man have arise to tear the veil away from before human life such as it be in so-called civilised community and show society its own self in all its rottenness foulness and hypocrisy -- so that on more than one occasion shrink guiltily from its own image it have denounce the plain unvarnished truth as libel -- there would have be no ` nana ' and no ` pot bouille ' no ` assommoir ' and no ` germinal ' and no ` la terre ' ` la debacle ' and ` lourde ' and ` rome ' ` paris ' and ` fecondite ' and all the other book that have flow from emile zolum 's busy pen would have remain unwritten but for my own part i would rather that the world should possess those book than that zolum when tempt as he be should have cast literature aside to plunge into the abominable and degrading vortex of politics like all man of intellect he certainly have he view on important political question and again and again he have enunciate they in the face of fierce opposition in the dreyfus case however he have be no politician but simply the indignant champion of a innocent man and he task over truth and justice vindicate he ask no reward no office he simply desire to take up he pen once more and revert to he life work : -- the delineation and exposure of the crime folly and short-coming of society as now constitute in order that those who _ be _ in politics who control human affair may in full knowledge of exist evil do they utmost to remedy they and prepare the way for a better and a happier world xiv ` wait for the verdict ' i can still see before I the sitting-room on the second floor of the queen 's hotel in which m zolum spend so much of he time and write so many page of ` fecondite ' during the last six month or so of he exile a spacious room it be if a rather low one with three window overlook the road which pass the hotel a very large looking-glass in a gilt frame surmount the mantelpiece on which stand two or three little blue vase paper of a light color and a large flow arabesque pattern with a broad frieze cover the wall there be not a single picture of any kind in the room neither steel engraving nor lithograph nor chromo and remember what picture usually be even in the best of hotel it be perhaps just as well that there should have be none in that room at the queen 's yet during the many hour i spend there the bareness of the wall often worry I against the one that face the fireplace stand a small sideboard then on another side be a sofa and here and there be half a dozen chair the room be rich in table it count no fewer than five on a folding card-table in one corner m zolum 's stock of letter and ` copy ' paper he weigh scale for letter he envelope pen and pencil be duly set out then in front of the central window be the table at which he work every morning it be of mahogany little more than three foot long and barely two foot wide whenever he raise he eye from he write he could see the road below he and the house across the way on a similar table at another of the window he usually keep such book and review as reach he from france in the center of the room under the electric light -- which however be only fitted towards the end of m zolum 's sojourn at the hotel so that throughout the winter a paraffin lamp supply the necessary illumination -- stand the table at which one lunch and dine it be round and would just accommodate four person finally beside m zolum 's favorite arm-chair near the fireplace be a little gipsy table on which he usually keep the day 's newspaper and perchance the volume he be read at the time a doorway on the same side as the fireplace give ingress to the bedchamber which be smaller than the sitting-room and adequately but by no means luxuriously furnish on the little writing-table near the middle window be first a small inkstand belong to the hotel then a few paper-weight cover memorandum jot down on little square piece of paper about three inch long either way together with a old yellowish newspaper which do duty as a blotting pad and a pen with a ` j' nib and a very heavy ivory handle so heavy indeed that though the master often offer it to I i could never write with it with this pen however he himself do all he work that work he generally clear away before lunch and lock up in he bedroom wardrobe so that by the time a visitor arrive there be never any litter in the sitting-room the road view from the writing-table window be at time fairly lively nursemaid and child bicyclist and other pass constantly to and fro stylish carriage also roll by during the afternoon and at interval a little green omnibus go its way at a slow jog-trot the detach villa residence on the other side of the road be however singularly lifeless one day m zolum remark to I : ' i have never see a soul in those house during all the month i have be here they be occupy certainly for the window blind be pull up every morning and lower every evening but i can never detect who do this and i have never see anybody leave the house or enter they ' at last one afternoon he tell I that one of these villa have wake up for on the previous day he have espy a lady in the garden water some flower rather lower down the road there be a livelier house one which have a balconied window which be almost invariably open and here servant and child be often to be see ` that ' say m zolum ` be the one little corner of life and gaiety amidst all the other silence and lack of life whenever i feel dull or worried i look over there ' as a rule the queen 's hotel itself be as i have already mention a very quiet place but now and again a wedding breakfast be give there brougham and landau would then roll over the gravel sweep and m zolum and i would at time lean out of the window and exchange opinion with respect to the bridal pair and the guest what surprised and amuse he on one occasion when a wedding party come to the hotel be to notice that all the coachman of the carriage wear yellow flower and favor for in france yellow be not only associate with jealousy but also with conjugal faithlessness ` if those flower ware to be take as a omen ' say m zolum to I ` that happy pair will soon be in the divorce court ' during the latter part of he stay at norwood when the door between he bedroom and sitting-room remain open one could see on a chest of drawer in the former apartment a pair of life-size porcelain cat color a purplish maroon with sparkling yellow glass eye and a abundance of fantastic yellow spot these cat have be buy by he as a souvenir of england and english art for he be much strike by they oddity he have be offer other -- for instance white one with little colored landscape print all over they back and side -- surely as idiotic a embellishment as any insane potter could devise -- but although these have sorely tempt he he have finally decide in favor of the maroon and yellow abomination a little girl of mine who find herself face to face with these cat one day in he room be quite startle by they and have since express the opinion that sir john tenniel ought to have see they before he draw the cheshire cat for ` alice in wonderland ' for my own part i can imagine the laughter and the jeer of m zolum 's artistic friend when those choice specimen of british art be show to they in pari at interval during he long sojourn at the queen 's hotel m zolum receive a few brief visit from french friend chiefly literary man and politician whose name need not be mention but who have identify themselves with the cause of revision at time these gentleman find themselves in london on other matter and profit by the opportunity to run down to norwood on other occasion they make the journey from france for the especial purpose of quiet m zolum 's impatience and tell he that he must not yet think of return home again m fasquelle the french publisher come over four or five time now on business and now in a friendly way i think that during the seven or eight month that m zolum stay at the queen 's hotel he receive altogether some ten visit from compatriot which visit be often of only a hour or two 's duration thus mme zola have return to france he be frequently very much alone during the last month of he exile my wife fall seriously ill and i could not then go so often to norwood afterwards ague catch I in its grip and my visit cease for two or three successive week all i could do in a emergency be to place my eldest daughter or my son at m zolum 's disposal the foreign visitor he receive -- by foreign i mean non-french -- be -lrb- apart from the wareham myself and family -rrb- very few in number i think that a eminent russian _ publiciste _ who happen to be a personal friend -lrb- m zolum have long be popular in russium where even the emperor have read many of he book -rrb- see he on one occasion then when m yve guyot call he bring with he a english friend who be pledge to secrecy a well-known english novelist and art critic m zolum 's oldest english friend and he earliest champion in this country likewise see he further in a friendly capacity he receive a english journalist for whom he have much regard and who come to see he quite apart from any journalistic matter to this list i will add the name of mr andrew chatto and mr percy spalding of messr chatto and windus and mr george p brett of the macmillan company of new york such then be m zolum 's visitor and guest -- say apart from the wareham myself and family less than a score of person the total duration of whose visit add together amount perhaps to a hundred and twenty hour spread over many long and try month at time when we chat together m zolum and myself and mention be make of he friend -- of person occasionally whom we both know -- he refer to the many estrangement cause by the divergence of view on the dreyfus affair friend of twenty and thirty year ' standing man who have labor side by side often in pursuit of the same ideal have not only quarrel and part but have assail each other with the greatest virulence in the press and at public meeting many whom he himself have regard as close and sincere friend have trodden upon all the past and attack he abominably as though he be the veriest scum of the earth some in the earlier stage of the affair have hypocritically feign sympathy in order to provoke he confidence and have then turn round to hold he up to execration and ridicule one or two have behave so badly that he have refuse ever to receive they at he house again he speak to I of a eminent french _ litterateur _ who at the outset of the agitation on behalf of dreyfus have immediately promise he help and have even prepared article and appeal on behalf of the prisoner of devil 's island but this _ litterateur _ have of recent year be lapse into mysticism and at the behest of the reverend father he confessor he have abruptly destroy what he have write and go over to the other side to wage desperate warfare upon the cause he have promise to help the writer in question -lrb- one who will probably leave a name in french literature -rrb- be tortured by the everlasting fear that he might go to hell when he die and he be the more timorous the more easily influence by certain person as he suffer from a horrible incurable complaint and fear that he medical man -- a bigoted romanist -- might abandon he to all the pang of sudden death if he do not comply with the injunction of the church then there be a friend of many year ' stand a minister in successive cabinet who feign that by remain in office he would be able to favor the cause and who instead of that do he utmost against it a playwright write : ' i be heartily with you but for god 's sake do not say it for my play might be hiss ' \* another prominent man start on a long journey to avoid have to express any opinion nearly all the baser passion of humanity be make manifest in some degree -- treachery rancor jealousy and moral and physical cowardice \* apropo of the stage it be a curious circumstance that nine-tenth of ` the profession ' in france be ardent dreyfusard nearly every actor and actress and vocalist of note have be on the same side as m zolum from the outset but of course there be another and a brighter side to the picture there be man of high intellect and courage who have not hesitate to state they view and plead for truth and justice man who when in office have be arbitrarily suspend and remove there be many who have risk they future many too who after year of labor be well entitle to rest and retirement yet have come forward with all the ardor of youth to do battle for great principle and save they country from the shame of a cruel crime adversity make one acquaint with strange bedfellow and m zolum be more than once strike by the heterogeneous nature of the revisionist army he find man of such varied political and social view band together for the cause it all help to remove sundry old-time prejudice of he for instance he say to I one day : ' i never care much for the french protestant i regard they as people of narrow mind fanatic of a kind far less tolerant and human than the great mass of the catholic but they have behave splendidly in this battle of ours and show themselves to be real man ' all through the spring m zolum eagerly follow the inquiry which the cour de cassation be conduct and when m ballot-beaupre be appoint reporter to the court there come a fresh spell of anxiety m ballot-beaupre be a man of natural piety and the anti-revisionist newspaper base themselves on he religious view at first make certain that he would show no mercy to the jew dreyfus but would report strongly in favor of the prisoner 's guilt certain dreyfusite journal on the other hand bitterly attack the learn judge for he suppose clerical leaning and indeed so much be insinuate that m zolum for a short time half believe it possible that m ballot-beaupre might show himself hostile to revision when i see m zolum he repeatedly express to I he feeling of disquietude then everything suddenly change certain newspaper discover that m ballot-beaupre if pious be by no mean a fanatic and further that he be a very sound lawyer much respect by he colleague this clear the atmosphere for it seem impossible that any man of rectitude and judgment could pass over the damning revelation which the cour de cassation 's inquiry as publish in ` le figaro ' have produce time go on and at last the issue so frequently postpone so longingly await come in sight the week before the public proceedings of the cour de cassation open m zolum say to I : ' i shall have finish the last chapter of fecondite by Saturday or Sunday so i shall have my hand quite free and be able to give all my attention to what take place at the court i be hopeful yes very hopeful and yet at moment some horrid doubt will spring up to torture I but no you 'll see we cause will gain the day revision will be grant and justice will be do ' and at last come the fateful week which be to prove the accuracy of he surmise xv last day -- departure i spend the afternoon of Saturday may 27 with m zolum and we then speak of the proceedings impend before the cour de cassation all we information point to the conclusion that the court would give judgment on the Saturday following and it be decide that m zolum should return to france a few day afterwards the date ultimately agree upon be Tuesday June 6 and the train select be that leave chare cross for folkestone at 245 in the afternoon though accord to every probability the court 's judgment would be in favor of revision m zolum be resolve to return home whatever might be the issue and such be he feeling on the matter that nothing any friend might have urge would have prevent he from do so as a matter of fact one friend do regard the return as somewhat unwise and intimate it both by telegram and letter this compel I to see m zolum again on the follow Tuesday -lrb- may 30 -rrb- but the objection be overrule by he and the arrangement which have be plan be adhere to m zolum have now draft the declaration which he propose issue on the morrow of he return home and this he give I to read it be the article ` justice ' publish in ` l'aurore ' to which i have occasionally refer in the course of the present narrative i leave m zolum rather late that Tuesday night in the expectation that everything which have be arrange would follow in due course as the writing of ` fecondite ' be now finish he have time on he hand and a part of this he propose to devote to take a few final snapshot of norwood the crystal palace and surround scenery he need something to do for he could not sit hour by hour in he room at the queen 's hotel anxiously wait for news of the proceedings at the pari palais de justice for my part i have begin to prepare the present narrative and as he would not listen to my repeat offer to take he to the derby it be arrange that i should not see he again until the end of the week on Friday however report be already in circulation to the effect that m fasquelle -lrb- m zolum 's french publisher -rrb- have come to london for the purpose of escort he home this be true and i foresaw that the rumor might lead to some modification of we program for m zolum do not wish he return to have any public character he have forbid all the demonstration which he friend in pari be anxious to arrange in he honor declare that he desire to go back quietly and privately and then at once place himself at the disposal of the public prosecutor on Friday i send my daughter violette to norwood with a parcel of m zolum 's photograph receive by messr chatto and windus from miss loie fuller who be greatly interested in the clarence ward of st mary 's hospital particularly wish m zolum to sign these portrait in order that they might be sell at a bazaar which be to be hold for the benefit of the hospital refer to i tell my daughter that i should myself go down to the queen 's hotel on the morrow and she bring I back a message to the effect that i really must go as complication have arise and m zolum particularly desire to see I on the follow day Saturday i therefore betook myself to norwood with a parcel of m zolum 's book which i have receive from messr macmillan & co on behalf of the countess of bective who -lrb- prompt by the same spirit as miss loie fuller -rrb- wish to sell these volume at the ` bookland ' stall on the occasion of the chare cross hospital bazaar and when i arrive i find indeed that it be most desirable that the program of m zolum 's departure should be modify he have already see m and mme fasquelle the former of whom be much annoyed at the report of he presence in london and think it most advisable to precipitate the departure delay might indeed be harmful if it be desire to avoid demonstration besides why should he wait until the ensue Tuesday why not return the very next night -- that of Sunday June 4 -- by the dover and calai route mme fasquelle have declare that she in no way object to travel at night time and so far as the departure from london be concern there would be few people about on a Sunday evening which be another point to be consider i cordially assent for now that the imminence of m zolum 's return to paris have be report in the newspaper it be certain that delay mean a possibility of demonstration both for and against he in spite of he prohibition many of he friend still wish to greet he like a conquer hero on he arrival at the northern railway station in pari and the other side would unfailingly send out its recruit agent to assemble a contingent of loafer at two franc per demonstration who would be duly instruct to yell ` conspuez ' and ' a ba les juifs ' then a brawl would inevitably follow now m zolum -lrb- as i have already mention -rrb- do not wish for a homecoming of that kind there be no question of refuse to ` face the music ' of shun a hostile crowd and so forth it be purely and simply a matter of dignity and of do nothing that might lead to a disturbance of the public peace the triumph of justice be undoubtedly imminent and it must not be follow by disorder when i have express my concurrence in the view hold by m zolum and m fasquelle m zolum and i attend to business first come the question of lady bective 's book in each of which a suitable inscription be insert afterwards in a friend 's birthday book m zolum inscribe he famous epoch-making phrase ` truth be on the march and nothing will be able to stop it ' finally a few brief note be write and post and work be over for a little while we chat together some notable incident connect with the interminable affair have occur during the last few day colonel du paty de clam for whose arrest the revisionist journal have clamour so long and so pertinaciously have at last be cast into prison in m zolum 's estimation the colonel 's arrest have be merely a question of time ever since the day when one have learn that he have disguise himself with a false beard and blue glass when he go to meet the notorious esterhazy ' a man may be guilty of any misdeed and may yet find forgiveness and even favor ' m zolum have then say to I ` but he must not make himself he profession and he cause ridiculous in france as you know ridicule kill the false beard and the blue spectacles follow the veil lady be decisive one need scarcely trouble any further about m du paty de clam he fate be as good as seal ' and now that the colonel have at last be arrest the master remark ` the military party be throw he over to we as a kind of sop it would be delighted to make he the general scapegoat and thereby save all the other culprit but it will not do there be man higher place than du paty who must bear they share of censure and if need be punishment ' then we speak of esterhazy ` that fine type for a melodrama or a novel of the romantic school ' as m zolum often remark the commandant have just acknowledge to the ` time ' and the ` daily chronicle ' that the famous _ bordereau _ have be pen by he and we laugh at the remembrance of he squabble on this subject with the proprietress of another newspaper how indignantly he have then deny have ever acknowledge the authorship of the _ bordereau _ and how complacently he now admit it as for the circumstance under which he assert the document to have be write m zolum could make nothing of they ` so far the explanation explain nothing ' say he ` take they whichever way you will there be no sense no plausibility even in they hitherto i always think esterhazy a very shrewd and clever man but after read he statement in the time and the chronicle i no longer know what to think still one point be gain he admit have write the _ bordereau _ and other hereafter will tell we the exact circumstance under which he do so colonel sandherr at whose bidding he say he write it be dead but other who know a great deal about he be still alive ' while m zolum thus express himself we sit face to face he in he favorite arm chair on one side of the fireplace and i on the other in the familiar room with its three window overlook the lively road while all around curvett the scroll and arabesque of the light fawn-tinted wall paper and after chat about du paty and esterhazy we gradually lapse into silence it be a fateful hour there be ninety-nine probability out of a hundred that the decision of the cour de cassation would be give that same afternoon and whatever that decision might be we feel certain that before it be make public by any newspaper in london we should be apprise of it we know that five minute after judgment should have be pronounce a telegram would be speed through the wire to the queen 's hotel norwood m zolum do not tell I he thought yet i could guess they we can generally guess the thought of those we love but the hour go by and nothing come how long they be those judge whatever could be the cause of they delay surely -- trained practiced man that they be man who have spend they life in seek and proclaim the truth -- surely no element of doubt could have penetrate they mind at the final the supreme moment ah the waiter enter and there on he salver lay a buff envelope within which must surely be the ardently await message that would tell we of victory or defeat m zolum could scarcely tear that envelope open he hand tremble violently and then come a anti-climax the wire be from m fasquelle who announce that he and he wife be invite themselves to dinner at norwood that evening it be welcome news but not the news so impatiently expect and at last suspense become intolerable i resolve to go out and try to purchase some afternoon newspaper there have be rumor to the effect that as each individual judge might preface he decision by a declaration of the reason which prompt it the final judgment might after all be postpone until Monday both m zolum and i have think this improbable still there be a possibility of such delay and perhaps it be on account of a postponement of the kind that the telegram we await have not arrive i scour upper norwood for afternoon papers there be however nothing to the point at that hour -lrb- about five pm -rrb- in ` the evening news ' the ` globe ' the ` echo ' the ` star ' the ` sun ' the three ` gazette ' they like we be ` wait for the verdict ' i go as far as the lower level station in the hope of find some newspaper that might give a inkling of the position and i find nothing at all it be extremely warm and i be somewhat excited thus i be perspire terribly by the time i return to the hotel to learn that no telegram have come as yet that thing be still _ in statu quo _ then all at once the waiter come up again with another buff envelope lie on he plate salver and this time we anticipation be realize here at last be the expect news m zolum read the telegram then show it to I it be brief but sufficient ` cheque postpone ' it say and zolum know what those word mean ` cheque pay ' would have signify that not only have revision be grant but that all the proceedings against dreyfus be quash and that he would not even have to be re-try by another court-martial and in a like way ` cheque unpaid ' would have mean that revision have be refuse by the court ` cheque postpone ' imply the grant of revision and a new court-martial the phraseology of this telegram as of previous one have long since be arrange for month many seemingly innocent ` wire ' have be full of mean there have be no more enigmatical telegram as at the time of henry 's arrest and death but telegram draft in accordance with m zolum 's instruction and each word of which be perfectly intelligible to he it often happen that the newspaper correspondent ` be not in it ' thing be know to m zolum and at time to myself hour -- and even day -- before there be any mention of they in print the blunder anti-dreyfusite have often if not invariably overlook the fact that they adversary number man of acumen skill and energy far from it be true that money have play any role in the affair everything have virtually be achieve by brain and courage in fact from first to last the revisionist agitation whilst prove that the truth must always ultimately conquer have likewise show the supremacy of true intellect over every other force in the world whether wealth or influence or fanaticism but i must return to m zolum he now know all he wish to know as there have be no postponement of the court 's decision there need be none of he return a telegram to pari announce he departure from london be hastily draft and i hurry with it to the post-office meeting on my way m and mme fasquelle who be walk towards the queen 's hotel we have a right merry little dinner that evening we be all in the best of humor m zolum 's face be radiant a great victory have be win and then too he be go home he recall the more amusing incident of he exile it seem to he say he as if for month and month he have be live in a dream and m fasquelle break in with a reminder that m zolum must be very careful when he reach he house and must in no wise damage the historic table for which he fasquelle have give such a pile of money at the memorable auction in the rue de bruxelle ah that table we be in a mood to laugh about anything and we laugh at the thought of the table at the thought too of all the simple-minded folk who have imagine that they would be able to purchase ` souvenir ' at the auction so abruptly bring to a end then the fasquelle have be to the oak on the previous day begin to talk of epsom and the scene unique in the whole world which the famous racecourse present during derby week m zolum half regret that he have miss go ` but i will go everywhere and see everything ' he repeat ` the next time i come to england i shall then be able to do so openly without any playing at hide and seek oh it will not be till after the pari exhibition that be certain but i have write a oratorio for which bruneau have compose the music and if it be sing in london as i hope i shall come over and spend a month go about everywhere but of course ' he add with a twinkle in he eye ' i have about two year ' imprisonment to do as thing stand so i must make no positive promise ' the rest be soon tell final arrangement be make and we come away m and mme fasquelle and myself about ten o'clock ` it be you last night of exile ' i say to m zolum as i press he hand ` and it will soon be over you must try to sleep well ' ` sleep ' he reply ` oh there be no sleep for I to-night from this moment i shall be count the hour the very minute ' ` it will make a change for you vizetelly ' say m fasquelle as he mme fasquelle and myself walk towards the railway station ` you will be miss he now ' this be true all the routine all the _ alerte _ the meeting the mission of those eleven month be about to cease abruptly what have at first seem to I novel have with time become confirm habit and for the first few day after m zolum 's departure i feel my occupation go that departure take place as arrange on Sunday evening June 4 it be the day when president loubet be cowardly assail at a race-meeting by the friend and partisan of the foolish duke of orlean but of all that we remain -lrb- _ pro tem _ -rrb- in blissful ignorance the fasquelle go down to norwood and bring m zolum to victorium i be busy during the day prepare for the ` westminster gazette ' a english epitome of the declaration which ` l'aurore ' be to publish on the morrow that work accomplished i meet the other on they arrival in town wareham have be warn of the change in the program on the previous night and come up from wimbledon with my wife there be a hasty scramble of a dinner at a restaurant near victorium we be serve i remember by a very amusing and familiar waiter who address m zolum by preference -lrb- i wonder if he recognize he -rrb- keep on repeat that he be a ` citizen of the most noble helvetian confederation ' and assure we that potato for two would be ample and that chicken for three would be as much as we should care to eat ` take this ' say he ` it be to-day 's do not have that it be cook yesterday ' and all this make we extremely merry ` it seem to I more than ever that i be live in a dream ' say m zolum after a final laugh ` that waiter have give the finish touch to my illusion ' the train start at nine pm and we have a full quarter of a hour at we disposal for we leave-takings in the dimly-lighted station there be few passenger travel that night and few loiterer about we make m zolum take he seat in a compartment and stand on guard before it talk to he only one gentleman a short dapper individual with mutton-chop whisker -lrb- wareham suggest that he look like a barrister -rrb- pay any attention to the master and it may be recognize he for the rest all go well there be _ au revoir _ and handshake all round and message too for one and another and m zolum would have he little joke ` if you should come across esterhazy ' he say to I ` tell he that i have go back and ask he when he be come ' ` well ' i reply ` he will probably want another safe-conduct before answer that question ' ` do you think that a safe-conduct to take dreyfus 's place would suit he ' be m zolum 's retort but the clock be now on the stroke of the hour the carriage door be hastily close and the signal for departure be give ` au revoir au revoir ' a last handshake and the train start for another half-minute we could see we dear and illustrious friend at he carriage window wave he arm to we and then he be go the responsibility which have so long rest on wareham and myself be end emile zolum 's exit be virtually over : shortly after five o'clock on the follow morning he would once more be in paris ready to take he part in the final crowning act of one of the greatest drama that the world have ever witness truth be still march on and assuredly nothing would be able to stop it end of project gutenberg 's with zolum in england by ernest alfr
