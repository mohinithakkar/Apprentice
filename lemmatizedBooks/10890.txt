simple dinner he revel he drunkenness he amours be moderate afterward as no one reprove he for they and public business be carry forward none the worse for all of it he begin to believe that what he do be right and that he could carry he practice to even greater length -lrb- consequently he begin to indulge in each of these pursuit in a more open and precipitate fashion and in case he guardian

instead he ask how much the mass before he amount to and when he be inform he double it say : i be not aware that i have allow he so little it can clearly be see then that as a result of the magnitude of he expenditure he would quickly exhaust the treasure in the royal vault and quickly need new revenue hence unusual tax be impose and the property of the well-to-do be not leave intact some lose they possession to spite he and other destroy themselves with they livelihood similarly he hate and make away with some other who have no considerable wealth for if they possess any excellent trait or

the mass and as for he mother he be already openly at variance with she everything that they say to each other or that the imperial pair do each day be report outside the palace yet it do not all

she have attract she uncle claudius into love for she by she blandishments and uncontrolled look and kiss she undertake to enslave nero also in similar fashion however i be not sure whether this actually occur or whether it be invent to fit they character : but i state here what be admit by all that nero have a mistress resemble agrippina of whom he be especially fond because of this very

they shrink from do the deed openly and be not able to put she out of the way secretly by means of poison for she take extreme precaution against all such thing one day they see in the theater a ship that automatically separate in two let out some beast and come together again so as to be once more seaworthy and they at once have another one build like it by the time the ship be finish agrippina have be quite win over by nero 's attention for he exhibit devotion to she in every way to make sure that she should suspect nothing and be off she guard he dare however do nothing in rome for fear the crime should become widely known hence he go some distance into campanium accompany by he mother and take a sail on the fatal ship itself which be adorn in the most brilliant fashion to the end

prepare but the sea would not endure the tragedy about to be enact on it nor would it submit to assume responsibility for the deception work by the monstrous contrivance : therefore though the ship part asunder and agrippina fall into the water she do not perish in spite of the fact that it be dark and she be full of strong drink and that the sailor use they oar blade on she so much so that they kill acerronium pollum she fellow voyager she nevertheless save she life and reach home thereupon she affect not to realize that it be a plot and let not a word of it be know but send speedily to she

victim with he own eye so he lay bare she body look she all over and inspect she wound finally utter a remark far more abominable even than the crime what he say be : i do not know i have so beautiful a mother to the pretorian he give money evidently to secure they prayer for many such occurrence and he send to the senate a message in which he enumerate the offence of which he know she be guilty state also that she have plot against he and on be detect have commit suicide yet for all this calm explanation to the govern body he be frequently subject to agitation at night so that he would even leap suddenly from he bed and by day terror seize he at the sound of trumpet that seem to blare forth some horrid din of war from the spot where lay agrippina 's bone therefore he go elsewhere and when in he new abode he have again the same experience he distractedly transfer he residence to some other place nero not have a word of truth from any one and see that all approve what he have be do think that either he action have escape notice or that he have conduct himself correctly hence he become much worse also in other respects he come to think that all that it be in he power to do be right and give heed to those whose speech be prompt by fear or flattery as if they tell absolute truth for a time he be subject to fear and questioning but after the ambassador have make he a number of please speech he regain courage -lrb- sidenote : -- 15 -- -rrb- the population of rome on hear the report though horrify be nevertheless joyful because they think that now he would surely come to

come to the senate-house and listen to the letter when however the reading be do he at once rise without make any comment and go out thus what he would have say he could not and what he could have say he would not he behave in the same way under all other condition for he use to say : if it be a matter of nero 's put only I to death i could easily pardon the rest who load he with flattery but since among those even who praise he so excessively he have get rid of some and will yet destroy other why should one stoop to indecent behavior and perish like a slave when like a freeman one may pay the

they throw down in the forum a baby to which be fasten a board say : i will not take you up for fear you may slay you mother at nero 's entrance into rome they take down the statue of agrippina but

assail the roman with a rush of they chariot knock they helter-skelter but since they fight without breastplate would be themselves repulse by the arrow horseman would upset foot-soldier and foot-soldier strike down horseman some form in close order would go to meet the chariot and other would be scatter by they some would come to close quarter with the archer and rout they whereas other be content to dodge they shaft at a distance : and all these thing go on not at one spot but in the three division at once they contend for a long time both party be animated by the same zeal and daring finally though late in the day the roman prevail have slay number in the battle beside the wagon or in the wood : they also capture many alive still not a few make they escape and go on to

be deem secure after this experience of mine have not faith have not hope perish if the danger be mine alone i should give the matter no heed -- i be not bear to be immortal -- but since there have be a public secession -lrb- or rather obsession -rrb- and war be fasten its clutch upon all of we alike i should desire be it possible to invite cassius here and argue the case with he in you presence or in the presence of the senate and i would gladly without a contest withdraw from my office in he favor if this seem to be for the public advantage for it be on behalf of the public that i continue to toil and undergo danger and have spend so much time yonder outside of italy during mature manhood and now in old age and weakness though i can not take food without pain nor get sleep free from anxiety -lrb- sidenote : -- 25 -- -rrb- but since cassius would never be willing to agree to this -lrb- for how could he trust I after have show himself so untrustworthy towards I -rrb- you at least fellow-soldier ought to be of good cheer cilician syrian jew and egyptian have never prove you superior nor shall so prove even if they assemble in number ten time you own whereas they be now by the same proportion inferior nor yet would cassius himself now appear worthy of any particular consideration however much he may seem to possess the quality of generalship however many success he may seem to have gain a eagle be not formidable at the head of a army of daw nor a lion command fawn and it be not cassius but you that bring to a end the arabian or the famous parthian war again even though he be renown as a result of he achievement against the parthian yet you have verus who have win more victory than he and have acquire more territory in a not less but more distinguished manner -- but probably he have already change he mind on hearing that i be alive for surely he have do this on no other assumption than that i be dead and if he resist still further yet when he learn that we be approach he will surely hesitate both out of fear of you and out of respect for I -lrb- sidenote : -- 26 -- -rrb- there be only one thing i fear fellow-soldier -lrb- you shall be tell the whole truth

a great prize both of war and of victory and of a magnitude such as no human be ever yet obtain what be this why to forgive a man that have do you a injury to remain a friend to one who have transgress friendship to continue faithful to one who have break faith perhaps this seem strange to you but you ought not to disbelieve it for all goodness have not yet perish from among mankind but there be still in we a remnant of the ancient virtue and if any one do disbelieve it that render the more ardent my desire that man may see accomplished what no one would believe could come to pass that would be one profit i could derive from present ill if i could settle the affair well and show to all mankind that there be a right way to handle even civil war -lrb- sidenote : -- 27 -- -rrb-
