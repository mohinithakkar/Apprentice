see all we peril flash a light to show to we bewildered blinded sight by one swift clear and piercing ray the safe sure path -- what word could reach the height of we great thankfulness and yet at most the most he save be this poor paltry life of flesh which be so little worth its cost which eager sow but may not stay to reap and so soon breathless with the strain and strife its work half-done exhaust fall asleep _ ii _ but unto he who find man 's soul astray in night that they know not be night at all walk with reckless foot where they may fall each moment into deadlier death than slay the flesh -- to he whose truth can rend away from such lose soul they moral night 's black pall -- oh unto he what word can heart recall which they deep gratitude find fit to say no word but these -- and these to he be best : -- that henceforth like a quenchless vestal flame he word of truth shall burn on truth 's pure shrine he memory be truth worship and confess we gratitude and love the priestess line who serve before truth 's altar in he name _ mercy philbrick 's choice chapter i it be late in the afternoon of a November day the sky have wear all day that pale leaden gray color which be depress even to the least sensitive of soul now at sunset a dull red tint be slowly steal over the west but the gray cloud be too thick for the sun to pierce and the struggle of the crimson color with the unyielding sky only make the heaven look more stern and pitiless than before stephen white stand with he arm fold lean on the gate which shut off but seem in no wise to separate the front yard of the house in which he live from the public highway there be something always pathetic in the attempt to enforce the idea of seclusion and privacy by build a fence around house only ten or twelve foot away from the public road and only forty or fifty foot from each other row of picket paling and gate with latch and lock seem superfluous when the passer-by can look if he like into the very center of you sitting-room and you neighbor on the right hand and on the left can overhear every word you say on a summer night where window be open one can not walk through the street of a new england village without be impress by a sense of this futile semblance of barrier this touch effort at withdrawal and reticence often we see the tacit recognition of its uselessness in a old gate shove back to its farthest and leave standing so till the very grass root have embank themselves on each side of it and it can never again be close without digging away the sod in which it be wedge the gate on which stephen white be lean have stand open in that way for year before stephen rent the house have stand open in fact ever since old billy jacob the owner of the house have be carry out of it dead in a coffin so wide that at first the bearer have think it could not pass through the gate but by huddle close three at the head and three at the foot they manage to tug the heavy old man through without take down the paling this be so long ago that now there be nobody leave who remember billy jacobs distinctly except he widow who live in a poor little house on the outskirts of the town she only income be that derive from the renting of the large house in which she have once live in comfort with she husband and son the house be a double house and for a few year billy jacobs 's twin brother a sea captain have live in the other half of it but mr billy could not abide mr john and so with a big heart wrench the two brother who love each other as only twin child can love have separate captain john take he wife and go to sea again the ship be never hear of and to the day of billy jacobs 's death he never forgive he wife in he heart he look upon she as he brother 's murderer very much like the perpetual presence of a ghost under she roof it must have be to the woman also the unbroken silence of those untenanted room and that never open door on the left side of she hall which she must pass whenever she go in or out of she house there be those who say that she be never see to look towards that door and that whenever a noise as of a rat in the wall or a blind creak in the wind come from that side of the house mr billy turn white and shudder well she might it be a fearful thing to have lie on one 's heart in this life the consciousness that one have be ever so innocently the occasion if not the cause of a fellow-creature 's turn aside into the path which be destine to take he to he death the very next day after billy jacobs 's funeral he widow leave the house she sell all the furniture except what be absolutely necessary for a very meager outfitting of the little cottage into which she move the miserly habit of she husband seem to have suddenly fall on she like a mantle she life shrink and dwindle in every possible way she almost starve herself and she boy although the rent of she old homestead be quite enough to make they comfortable in a few year to complete the poor woman 's misery she son run away and go to sea the sea-farer 's story which he uncle john have tell he when he be a little child have never leave he mind and the drearier he mother make life for he on land the more longingly he dwell on he fancy of life at sea till at last when he be only fifteen he disappear one day leave a note not for he mother but for he sunday-school teacher -- the only human be he love this young woman carry the note to mr jacob she read it make no comment and hand it back she visitor be chill and terrify by she manner can i do any thing for you mr jacob she say i do assure you i sympathize with you most deeply i think the boy will soon come back he will find the sea life very different from what he have dream no you can do nothing for I reply mr jacob in a voice as unmoved as she face he will never come back he will be drown and from that day no one ever hear she mention she son it be believe however that she have news from he and that she send he money for although the rent of she house be pay to she regularly she grow if possible more and more penurious every year allow herself barely enough food to support life and wear such tattered and patched clothes that she be almost a object of terror to child when they meet she in lonely field and wood bend down to the ground and search for herb like a old witch at one time also she go in great haste to a lawyer in the village and with he assistance raise three thousand dollar on a mortgage on she house mortgage it very nearly to its full value in vain he represent to she that in case the house should chance to stand empty for a year she would have no money to pay the interest on she mortgage and would lose the property she either could not understand or do not care for what he say the house always have bring she in about so many dollar a year she believe it always would at any rate she want this money and so it come to pass that the mortgage on the old jacob house have come into stephen white 's hand and he be now live in one half of it he own tenant and landlord at once as he often laughingly say these old rumor and saying about the jacob 's family history be run in stephen 's head this evening as he stand listlessly lean on the gate and look down at the unsightly spot of bare earth still leave where the gate have so long stand press back against the fence i wonder how long it 'll take to get that old rut smooth and green like the rest of the yard he think stephen white absolutely hate ugliness it do not merely irritate and depress he as it do everybody of fine fastidiousness : he hate not only the sight of it he hate it with a sort of unreasoning vindictiveness if it be a picture he want to burn the picture cut it tear it trample it under foot get it off the face of the earth immediately at any cost or risk it have no business to exist : if nobody else would make way with it he must he often see place that he would have like to devastate to blot out of existence if he could just because they be barren and unsightly once when he be a very little child he suddenly seize a book of he father 's -- a old shabby worn dictionary -- and fling it into the fire with uncontrollable passion and on be ask why he do it have nothing to say in justification of he act except this extraordinary statement : it be a ugly book it hurt I ugly book ought to go in the fire what the child suffer and still more what the man suffer from this hatred of ugliness no word could portray ever since he could remember he have be unhappy from the lack of the beautiful in the surroundings of he daily life he father have be poor he mother have be a invalid and neither father nor mother have a trace of the artistic temperament from what long-forgotten ancestor in he plain hard-working family have come stephen 's passionate love of beauty nobody know it be the despair of he father the torment of he mother from childhood to boyhood from boyhood to manhood he have feel himself needlessly hurt and perversely misunderstand on this one point but it have not sour he : it have only saddened he and make he reticent in he own quiet way he go slowly on add each year some new touch of simple adornment to they home every dollar he could spare out of he earnings go into something for the eye to feast on and in spite of the old people 's perpetual grumbling and perpetual antagonism it come about that they grow to be in a surly fashion proud of stephen 's have make they home unlike the home of they neighbor that be stephen 's last notion he be never satisfy without he be stick up suthin ' new or different they would say as they call attention to some new picture or shelf or improvement in the house it be all tom-foolery thing be well enough before but in they heart they be secretly a little elate as in latter year they have come to know by book and papers which stephen force they to hear or to read that he be really in sympathy with well-known writer in this matter of the adornment of home the love of beautiful thing even in every-day life a little more than a year before the time at which we story begin stephen 's father have die on a investigation of he affair it be find that after the settling of the estate very little would remain for stephen and he mother the mortgage on the old jacob house be the greater part of they property very reluctantly stephen decide that they wisest -- in fact they only -- course be to move into this house to live many and many a time he have walk past the old house and think as he look at it what a bare stare hopeless joyless-looking old house it be it have originally be a small square house the addition which billy jacob have make to it be oblong run out to the south and project on the front a few foot beyond the other part this obtrusive jog be certainly very ugly and it be impossible to conceive of any reason for it very possibly it be only a carpenter 's blunder for billy jacobs be no doubt he own architect and leave all detail of the work to the builder be that as it may the little clumsy meaningless jog ruin the house -- give it a uncomfortably awry look like a dining-table awkwardly piece out for a emergency by another table a little too narrow the house have be for several year occupy by family of mill operative and have gradually acquire that indefinable but unmistakable tenement-house look which not even neatness and good repair can wholly banish from a house the orchard behind the house have so run down for want of care that it look more like a tangle of wild tree than like any thing which have ever be a orchard yet the roxbury russet and baldwin of that orchard have once be billy jacobs 's great pride the one point of hospitality which he miserliness never conquer long after it would have break he heart to set out a generous dinner for a neighbor he would feast he on choice apple and send he away with a big basket full in he hand now every pass school-boy help himself to the wan withered and scanty fruit and nobody have think it worth while to mend the dilapidated fence which might have help to shut they out even mr white with all she indifference to externals rebel at first at the idea of go to live in the old jacob house i 'll never go there stephen she say petulantly i be not go to live in half a house with the mill people and it be no better than a barn the hideous old fade yellow thing if it cross stephen 's mind that there be a touch of late retribution in he mother 's have come at last to a sense of suffer because she must live in a unsightly house he do not betray it he reply very gently he be never hear to speak other than gently to he mother though to every one else he manner be sometimes brusque and dictatorial but mother i think we must it be the only way that we can be sure of the rent and if we live ourselves in one half of it we shall find it much easier to get good tenant for the other part i promise you none of the mill people shall ever live there again please do not make it hard for I mother we must do it when stephen say must he mother never gainsay he he be only twenty-five but he will be stronger than hers -- as much stronger as he temper be better person judge hastily by she violent assertion and vehement statement of she determination as contrast with stephen 's gentle slow almost hesitate utterance of he opinion or intention might have assume that she would always conquer but it be not so in all little thing stephen be she slave because she be a suffering invalid and he mother but in all important decision he be the master and she recognize it and lean upon it in a way which be almost ludicrous in its alternation with she petulance and perpetual dictate to he in trifle and so they go to live in the old jacob house they take the northern half of it the part in which the sea captain and he wife have live this half of the house be not so pleasant as the other have less sun and have no door upon the street but it be smaller and better suit to they need and moreover stephen say to he mother -- we must live in the half we should find it hardest to rent to a desirable tenant for the first six month after they move in the wing as mr white persist in call it though it be larger by two room than the part she occupy herself stand empty there would have be plenty of applicant for it but it have be noise in the town that the whites have give out that none but people as good as they be themselves would be allow to rent the house this make a mighty stir among the mill operative and the trades-people and stephen get many a sour look and short answer whose real source he never suspect ahem there he go with he head in the cloud damn he mutter barker the grocer one day as stephen in a more than ordinarily absent-minded fit have pass mr barker 's door without observe that mr barker stand in it ready to bow and smile to the whole world mr barker 's sister have just marry a overseer in the mill and they have be very anxious to set up housekeeping in the jacob house but have be prevent from apply for it by hearing of mr white 's determination to have no mill people under the same roof with herself mill people indeed exclaim jane barker when she lover tell she in no very guard term the reason they could not have the house on which she have set she heart mill people indeed i would like to know if they be not every whit 's good 's a old shark of a lawyer like hugh white be i 'll be bind if poor old granny jacob have not lose what little wit she ever have it ` ud be very soon see whether madam white 's get the right to say who be to come and who be to go in that house it be a nasty old yaller shell anyhow not to say nothin ' o ' it be bein ' haunt 's like 's not but there be not no other place so handy to the mill for we a ' i guess we money 's good ez any lawyer 's money o ' the hull on 'em any day mill people indeed i 'll jest give steve white a piece o ' my mind the first time i see he on the street jane and she lover be sit on the top of two barrel just outside the grocery door when this conversation take place just as the last word have leave she lip she look up and see stephen approach at a very rapid pace the unusual sight of two people perch on barrel on the sidewalk rouse stephen from the deep reverie in which he habitually walk lift he hat as courteously as if he be address the most distinguish of woman he bow and say smile how do you do miss jane and good-morning mr lovejoy and pass on but not before jane barker have have time to say in she gentlest tone very well thank you mr stephen while a ugly sneer spread over the face of reuben lovejoy woman all over he mutter never see one on ye yet thet be not catch by a bow from a palaverin ' fool jane laugh nervously she herself feel ashamed of have so soon give the lie to she own word of bravado but she be woman enough not to admit she mortification i know he be a palaverin ' fool 's well 's you do but i reckon i have get some manners o ' my own 's well 's he when a man bid I a pleasant good-mornin ' i be not a-goin ' to take that time to fly out at he however much i have get agin he and reuben be silence the under-current of ill-feeling against stephen and he mother go steadily on increase there be a wonderful force in these slow under-current of feeling in small community for or against individual after they have once become a steady tide nothing can check they force or turn they direction sometimes they can be trace back to they spring as a stream can : one lucky or unlucky word or deed year ago make a friend or a enemy of one person and that person 's influence have divide itself again and again as brook part off and divide into countless rivulet and water whole district but generally one find it impossible to trace the like or dislike to its begin a stranger ask the reason of it be answer in a off-hand way -- oh everybody 'll tell you the same thing there be not a soul in the town but hate he or well he be just the most popular man in the town you 'll never hear a word say against he -- never not if you be to settle right down here and live it be month before stephen realize that there be slowly form in the town a dislike to he he be slow in discover it because he have always live alone have no intimate friend not even when he be a boy he love of book and he passionate love of beauty combine with he poverty to hedge he about more effectually than mile of desert could have do he father and mother have live upon fairly good term with all they neighbor but have form no very close bond with any in the ordinary new england town neighborhood never mean much : there be a dismal lack of cohesion to the relation between people the community be loosely hold together by a few accidental point of contact or common interest the individuality of individual be by a strange sort of paradox at once respect and ignore this be indifference rather than consideration selfishness rather than generosity it be a unsuspected root of much of we national failure be responsible for much of we national disgrace some day there will come a time when it will have crystallize into a national apathy which will perhaps cure itself or have to be cure as induration in the body be by sharp crisis or by surgical operation in the mean time we people be live on the whole the dullest life that be live in the world by the so-called civilized and the climax of this dulness of life be to be find in just such a small new england town as penfield the one of which we be now speak when it gradually become clear to stephen that he and he mother be unpopular people he first feeling be one of resentment he second of calm acquiescence : acquiescence first because he recognize in a measure the justice of it -- they really do not care for they neighbor why should they neighbor care for they secondly a diminish familiarity of intercourse would have to he great compensation there be few people in the town whose clothes whose speech whose behavior do not jar upon he nerve on the whole he would be better content alone and if he mother could only have a little more independence of nature more resource within herself the less we see of they the better say stephen proudly he have yet to learn the lesson which sooner or later the proudest most scornful most self-centred of human soul must learn or must die of loneliness for the want of learn that humanity be one and indivisible and the man who shut himself apart from he fellow above all the man who thus shut himself apart because he think of he fellow with pity condescension as he inferior be a fool and a blasphemer -- a fool because he rob himself of that good-fellowship which be the leaven of life a blasphemer because he virtually imply that god make man unfit for he to associate with stephen white have this lesson yet to learn the practical inconvenience of be unpopular however he begin to feel keenly as month after month pass by and nobody would rent the other half of the house in which he and he mother live small as the rent be it be a matter of great moment to they for he earnings as clerk and copyist be barely enough to give they food he be still retain by he father 's partner in the same position which he have hold during he father 's life but old mr william be not wholly free from the general prejudice against stephen as a aristocratic fellow give to dream and fancy and stephen know very well that he hold the position only as it be on a sort of sufferance because mr william have love he father moreover law business in penfield be grow duller and duller a younger firm in the county town only twelve mile away be rob they of client continually and there be many long day during which stephen sit idle at he desk look out in a vague dreamy way on the street below and wonder if the time be really come when mr william would need a clerk no longer and if it do come what he could possibly find to do in that town by which he could earn money enough to support he mother at such time he think uneasily of the possibility of foreclose the mortgage on the old jacob house sell the house and reinvest the money in a more advantageous way he always try to put the think away from he as a dishonorable one but it have a fatal persistency he could not banish it poor half-witted old woman she might a great deal better be in the poor-house there be no reason why we should lose we interest for the sake of keep she along the mortgage be for too large a sum i doubt if the old house could sell to-day for enough to clear it anyhow these be some of the suggestion which the devil keep whisper into stephen 's ear in these long hour of perplexity and misgive it be a question of casuistry which might perhaps have puzzle a finer moral sense than stephen 's why should he treat old mr jacob with any more consideration than he would show to a man under the same circumstance to be sure she be a helpless old woman but so be he own mother and surely he first duty be to make she as comfortable as possible luckily for old mr jacob a tenant appear for the south wing a friend of stephen 's a young clergyman living in a seaport town on cape cod have write to he ask about the house which he know stephen be anxious to rent he make these inquiry on behalf of two woman parishioner of he who be oblige to move to some inland town on account of the elder woman 's fail health they be mother and daughter but both widow the younger woman 's marriage have be a tragically sad one she husband have die suddenly only a few day after they marriage she have return at once to she mother 's house widow at eighteen heart-broken the young clergyman write but the most cheerful person in this town -- the most cheerful person i ever know she smile be the sunniest and most pathetic thing i ever see stephen welcome most gladly the prospect of such tenant as these the negotiation be soon conclude and at the time of the beginning of we story the two woman be daily expect a strange feverishness of desire to have they arrive possess stephen 's mind he long for it and yet he dread it he like the stillness of the house he feel a sense of ownership of the whole of it : both of these satisfaction be to be interfere with now but he have a singular consciousness that some new element be come into he life he do not define this he hardly recognize it in its full extent but if a bystander could have look into he mind follow the course of he reverie distinctly as a unbiassed outsider might he would have say stephen man what be this what be these two woman to you that you imagination be take these wild and superfluous leap into they history there be hardly a possible speculation as to they past history as to they look as to they future life under he roof that stephen do not indulge in as he stand lean with he fold arm on the gate in the gray November twilight where we first find he he thought as be natural centre most around the younger woman poor thing that be a mighty hard fate only nineteen year old now -- six year younger than i be and how much more she must know of life than i do i suppose she can not be a lady exactly -- be a sea captain 's wife i wonder if she be pretty i think harley might have tell I more about she he might know i would be very curious i wonder if mother 'll take to they if she do it will be a great comfort to she she be so alone and stephen 's face cloud as he reflect how very seldom the monotony of the invalid 's life be break now by a friendly visit from a neighbor if they should turn out really social neighborly people that we like we might move away the old side-board from before the hall door and go in and out that way as the jacobs use to it would be unlucky though i reckon to use that door i guess i 'll plaster it up some day like all people of deep sentiment stephen have in he nature a vein of something which border on superstition the twilight deepen into darkness and a cold mist begin to fall in slow drizzle drop still stephen stand absorb in he reverie and unmindful of the chill the hall door open and a old woman peer out she hold a lamp in one hand the blast of cold air make the flame flicker and flare and as she put up one hand to shade it the light be throw sharply across she feature make they stand out like the distorted feature of a hideous mask steve steve she call in a shrill voice supper 's be waitin ' more 'n half a hour lor 's sake what be the boy thinkin ' on now i wonder she mutter in a impatient lower tone as stephen turn he head slowly yes yes marty tell my mother i will be there in a moment reply stephen as he walk slowly toward the house even then note with the keen and relentless glance of a beauty-worshipper how grotesquely ugly the old woman 's wrinkled face become light up by the intense cross-light old marty 's face have never look other than lovingly into stephen 's since he first lay in she arm twenty-five year ago when she come a smooth-cheeked rosy country-woman of twenty-five to nurse he mother at the time of he birth she have never leave the home since with a faithfulness and devotion only to be account for by the existence of rare spring of each in she own nature surely not by any uncommon lovableness in either mr or mr white or by any especial comfort in she situation she have stay on a quarter of a century in the hard position of woman of all work in a poor family she worship stephen and as i say she face have never once look other than lovingly into he but he could not remember the time when he have not think she hideous she have a big brown mole on she chin out of which grow a few bristle hair it be a unsightly thing no doubt on a woman 's chin and sometimes when marty be very angry the hair do actually seem to bristle as a cat 's whisker do when stephen could not speak plain he use to point he little dimpled finger at this mole and say do doe away -- doe away and to this day it be a torment to he he eye seem morbidly draw toward it at time when he be ill and poor marty bent over he bed minister to he as no one but a loving old nurse can he see only the mole and have to make a effort not to shrink from she to-night as she linger on the threshold affectionately wait to light he path he be think only of she ugliness but when she exclaim with the privileged irritability of a old servant -- jest look at you foot steve they be wet through a ' you coat too a standin ' out in that drizzle anybody ` ud think you have not common sense he reply with perfect good nature and as heartily love a tone as if he have be feast on she beauty instead of writhe inwardly at she ugliness -- all right marty -- all right i be not so wet as i look i 'll change my coat and come in to supper in one minute do not you fidget about I so good marty never be stephen hear to speak discourteously or even ungently to a human be it would have offend he taste it be not a matter of principle with he -- not at all : he hardly ever think of thing in that light a rude or harsh word a loud angry tone jar on he every sense like a discord in music or a inharmonious color so he never use they but as he run upstairs three step at a time after he kind off-hand word to marty he say to himself good heaven i do believe marty get uglier every day what a picture rembrandt would have make of she old face peer out into the darkness there to-night she would have do for the witch of endor watch to see if samuel be come up and as he go down more slowly revolve in he mind what plausible excuse he could give to he mother for he tardiness he think well i do hope she 'll be at least tolerably good-looking already the younger of the two woman who be come to live under he roof be she in he thought chapter ii in the mean time the young widow mercy philbrick and she old and almost childish mother mercy carr be come by slow and tiring stage journey up the dreary length of cape cod for thirty year the elder woman have never go out of sight of the village graveyard in which she husband and four child be bury to transplant she be like transplant a old weather-beaten tree already dead at the top yet the physician have say that the only chance of prolong she life be to take she away from the fierce wind of the sea she herself while she love they shrink from they they seem to pierce she lung like arrow of ice-cold steel at once wound and benumb yet the habit and love of the seashore life be so strong upon she that she would never have be able to tear herself away from she old home have it not be for she daughter 's determine will mercy philbrick be a woman of slight frame gentle laughing brown eye a pale skin pale ash-brown hair a small nose a sweet and changeful mouth the upper lip too short the lower lip much too full little hand little foot little wrist not one indication of great physical or great mental strength could you point out in mercy philbrick but she be rarely ill and she have never be know to give up a point small or great on which she will have be fully set even the cheerfulness of which she minister harley allen have write to stephen be very largely a matter of will with mercy she confront grief as she would confront a antagonist force of any sort : it be something to be battle with to be conquer fate should not worst she : come what might she would be the stronger of the two when the doctor say to she -- mr philbrick i fear that you mother can not live through another winter in this climate mercy look at he for a moment with a expression of terror in a instant more the expression have give place to one of resolute and search inquiry you think then that she might be well in a different climate perhaps not well but she might live for year in a dryer milder air there be as yet no actual disease in she lung the doctor reply mercy interrupted he you think she might live in comparative comfort it would not be merely prolong she life as a suffering invalid she say add in a undertone as if to herself i would not subject she to that oh yes undoubtedly say the doctor she need never die of consumption at all if she could breathe only inland air she will never be strong again but she may live year without any especial liability to suffer then i will take she away immediately reply mercy in as confident and simple a manner as if she have be propose only to move she from one room into another it would not seem so easy a matter for two lonely woman in a little cape cod village without a male relative to help they and with only a few thousand dollar in the world to sell they house break up all they life-long association and go out into the world to find a new home association crystallize around people in lonely and out of the way spot where the day be all alike and year follow year in a undeviating monotony perhaps the process might be more aptly call one of petrifaction there be piece of exquisite agate which be once soft wood age ago the bit of wood fall into a stream where the water be largely impregnate with some chemical matter which have the power to eat out the fiber of the wood and in each spot thus leave empty to deposit itself in a exact image of the wood it have eat away molecule by molecule in a mystery too small for human eye to detect even have a watchful human eye be lie in wait to observe the marvellous process go on until after the lapse of nobody know how many century the wood be go and in its place lay its exact image in stone -- ring of growth individual peculiarity of structure knot break sliver and chip color shape all perfect man call it agatized wood by a feeble effort to translate the mystery of its existence but it be not wood except to the eye to the touch and in fact it be stone -- hard cold unalterable eternal stone the slow wear of monotonous life in a set groove do very much such a thing as this to human being to the eye they retain the semblance of other being but try they by touch that be by contact with people with event outside they groove and they be stone -- agatize man and woman carry they where you please after they have reach middle or old age and they will not change there be no magic water a drop of which will restore to they the vitality and pliability of they youth they last well such people -- as well almost as agatized wood on museum shelf and the most you can do for they be to keep they well dust old mr carr belong in a degree to this order of person only the come of mercy 's young life into the feeble current of she own have save it from entire stagnation but she be already past middle age when mercy be bear and the child with she wonderful joyousness and the maiden with she wondrous cheer come too late to undo what the year have do the most they could do be to interrupt the process to stay it at that point the consequence be that mr carr at sixty-five be a placid sort of middle-aged old lady very pleasant to talk with as you would talk with a child very easy to take care of as you would take care of a child but for all purpose of practical management or efficient force as helpless as a baby when mercy tell she what the doctor have say of she health and that they must sell the house and move away before the winter set in she literally open she mouth too wide to speak for a minute and then gasp out like a frightened child -- o mercy do not let 's do it as mercy go on explain to she the necessity of the change and the arrangement she propose to make the poor old woman 's face grow longer and longer but some time before mercy have come to the end of she explanation the childish soul have accept the whole thing as fix have begin already to project itself in childish imagination of detail and to mercy 's infinite relief and half-sad amusement when she cease speak she mother 's first word be eagerly -- well mercy if we go 'n the stage 'n' i s ` pose we shall hev to do not ye think my old brown merino 'll do to wear fortune favor mercy 's desire to sell the house stephen 's friend the young minister have say to himself many time as he walk up to its door between the quaint trim bed of old-fashioned pink and lady ' delight and sweet-william which border the little path this be the only house in this town i want to live in as soon as he hear that it be for sale he put on he hat and fairly run to buy it out of breath he take mercy 's hand in he and exclaim -- o mercy do you really want to sell this house very unworldly be this young man and this young woman in the matter of sale and purchase adept in traffic would have laugh have they overhear the conversation yes indeed mr allen i do i must sell it and i be afraid i shall have to sell it for a great deal less than it be worth reply mercy no you sha 'n' t mercy i 'll buy it myself i have always want it but why in the world do you want to sell it where will you live yourself there be not another house in the village you would like half so well be it too large for you continue mr allen hurriedly then mercy tell he all she plan and the sad necessity for she make the change the young minister do not speak for some moment he seem lose in think then he exclaim -- i do believe it be a kind of providence and draw a letter from he pocket which he have only two day before receive from stephen white mercy he go on i believe i have get the very thing you want right here and he read she the conclude paragraph of the letter in which stephen have say : meantime i be wait as patiently as i can for a tenant for the other half of this house it seem to be very hard to find just the right sort of person i can not take in any of the mill operative they be noisy and untidy and the bare thought of they be just the other side of the partition would drive my mother frantic i wish so much i could get some people in that would be real friend for she she be very lonely she never leave she bed and i have to be away all day mercy 's face light up she like the sound of each word that this unknown man write very eagerly she question mr allen about the town its situation its healthfulness and so forth as he give she detail after detail she nod she head with increase emphasis and finally exclaim : that be precisely such a spot as dr wheeler say we ought to go to i think you be right mr allen it be a providence and i would be so glad to be good to that poor old woman too what a companion she would be for mother that be if i could keep they from compare note for ever about they disease that be the worst of put invalid old woman together laugh mercy with a kindly merry little laugh mr allen have visit penfield only once when he and stephen be boy at school together he have pass one of the short vacation at stephen 's house he remember very little of stephen 's father and mother or of they way of life he be at the age when house and home mean little to boy except a spot where shelter and food be obtain in the enforced interval between they hour of out-door life but he have never forget the grand out-look and off-look from the town lie itself high up on the western slope of what must once have be a great river terrace it command a view of a wide and fertile meadow country near enough to be a most beautiful feature in the landscape but far enough away to prevent any danger from its moisture to the south and south-west rise a fine range of mountain bold and sharp-cut though they be not very high and be heavily wood to they summit the westernmost peak of this range be separate from the rest by a wide river which have cut its way through in some of those forget age when if we be to believe the geologist every thing be topsy-turvy on this now meek and well-regulated planet the town although as i say it lay on the western slope of a great river terrace hold in its site three distinctly marked plateau from the two highest of these the view be grand it be like live on a mountain and yet there be the rich beauty of coloring of the river interval nowhere in all new england be there a fairer country than this to look upon nor a goodlier one in which to live mr allen 's enthusiasm in describe the beauty of the place and mercy 's enthusiasm in listen be fast drive out of they mind the thought of the sale which have be mention in the beginning of they conversation mercy be the first to recall it she blush and hesitate as she say -- but mr allen we can not go you know until i have sell this house do you really want to buy it and how much do you think i ought to ask for it to be sure to be sure exclaim the young minister dear I what child we be mercy i do not honestly know what you ought to ask for the house i 'll find out deacon jone say he think take in the cranberry meadow it be worth three thousand dollar say mercy but that seem a great deal to I : though not in a good cranberry year perhaps add she ingenuously for last year the cranberry bring we in seventy-five dollar besides pay for the picking and the meadow ought to go with the house by all means say mr allen i want it for color in the background when i look at the house as i come down from the meeting-house hill i would not like to have anybody else own the canvas on which the picture of my home will be oftenest paint for my eye i 'll give you three thousand dollar for the house mercy i can only pay two thousand down and pay you interest on the other thousand for a year or two i 'll soon clear it off will that do oh thank you thank you mr allen it will more than do say poor mercy who could not believe in such sudden good fortune but do you think you ought to buy it so quick perhaps it would not bring so much money as that i have not ask anybody except deacon jone mr allen laugh if you do not look out for yourself sharper than this mercy he say in the new place ` where you be go to live you 'll fare badly perhaps it may be true as you say that nobody else would give you three thousand dollar for the house because nobody might happen to want to live in it but deacon jone know better than anybody else the value of property here and i be perfectly willing to give you the price he set on the place i have lay by this two thousand dollar towards my house and i could not build such a house as this to-day for three thousand dollar but really mercy you must look ` out for yourself better than this i do not know reply mercy look out of the window with a earnest gaze as if she be read a write a great way off -- i do not know about that i doubt very much if look out for one 's self as you call it be the best way to provide for one 's self that very night mr allen write to stephen in two week the whole matter be settle and mercy and she mother have set out on they journey they carry with they but one small valise the rest of they simple wardrobe have go in box with the furniture by sailing vessel to a city which be within three hour by rail of they new home this be the feature of the situation which poor mr carr could not accept in the bottom of she heart she fully believe that they would never again see one of those box the contents of some which she have herself pack be of a most motley description in the beginning of the break up while mercy be at she wit ' end with the unwonted perplexity of pack the whole belongings of a house she mother have torment she incessantly by bring to she every few minute some utterly incongruous and frequently worthless article and beg she to put it in at once whatever she might be pack any one who have ever pack for a long journey with a eager and excited child run up every minute with more and more cumbrous toy dog cat noah 's ark and so on to be put in among book and under-clothing can imagine mercy 's despair at she mother 's restless activity oh mother not in this box not in with the china would groan poor mercy as she mother appear with armful of ancient relic from the garret such as old umbrella bonnet bundle of old newspaper break spinning-wheel andiron and roll of remains of old wall-paper the last of which have disappear from the wall of the house long before mercy be bear no old magpie be ever a more indiscriminate hoarder than mr carr have be and among all she hoarding there be none more amusing than she hoarding of old wall-papers a scrap a foot square seem to she too precious to throw away it might be jest the right size to cover suthin ' with she would say and to do she justice she do use in the course of a year a most unexampled amount of such fragment she have a mania for papering and repapering and papering again every shelf every box every corner she could get hold of the paste and brush be like toy to she and she delight in gay combination stick on old bit of border in fantastic way in most inappropriate situation i do believe you 'll paper the pigsty next mother say mercy one day : there be nothing leave you can paper except that mr carr take the suggestion in perfect good faith and convulsed mercy a few day later by enter the kitchen with the follow extraordinary remark -- i do not believe it be worth while to paper the pigsty i have be look at it and the board they be so rough the paper would not lay smooth anyhow and i could not well get at the inside o ' the roof while the pig 's in it would look real neat though i would like to do it mercy endure she mother 's help in packing for one day then the desperateness of the trouble suggest a remedy select a large strong box she have it carry into the garret there mother she say now you can pack in this box all the old lumber of all sort which you want to carry and if this box be not large enough you shall have two more do not tire yourself out : there be plenty of time and if you do not get it all pack by the time i be do i can help you then mercy go downstairs feel half-guilty as one do when one have practice a subterfuge on a child how many time that poor old woman pack and unpack that box nobody could dream all day long she trot up and down up and down ransack closet chest barrel sort and resort and forget as fast as she sort now and then she would come across something which would rouse a electric chain of memory in the dim chamber of she old worn-out brain and she would sit motionless for a long time on the garret floor in a sort of trance once mercy find she lean back against a beam with she knee cover by a piece of fade blue canton crape on which she eye be fasten she do not speak till mercy touch she shoulder oh my how you scare I child she exclaim d'ye see this ere blue stuff i hed a gown o ' thet once : it be drefful kind o ' clingy stuff i never feel exzackly decent in it somehow : it hang a good deal like a night-gownd but you father he buy it for the color he trade off some shell for it in some o ' they furrin place you would not think it now but it use to be jest the color o ' a robin 's egg or a light-blue ` bachelor 's button ' and you father he use to stick one o ' they in my belt whenever they be in blossom when i hed the gownd on he hed a heap o ' notion about thing matchin ' he bring I that gownd the v ` yage he make jest afore caleb be bear and i never hed a chance to wear it much the child come so fast it war not re ` ly worn at all 'n' i hed it dye black for veil arterward it be from this father who use to stick pale-blue flower in he wife 's belt and whose love of delicate fabric and tint make he courageous enough to lead she drape in canton crape into the unpainted cape cod meeting-house where she fellow-women bristle in homespun that mercy inherit all the artistic side of she nature she know this instinctively and all she tenderest sentiment centre around the vague memory she retain of a tall dark-bearded man who when she be only three year old lift she in he arm call she he little mercy and kiss she over and over again she be most loyally affectionate to she mother but the sentiment be not a wholly filial one there be too much reversal of the natural order of the protector and the protect in it and she life be on too different a plane of thought feeling and interest from the life of the uncultured undeveloped childish old woman yet no one who see they together would have detect any trace of this shortcoming in mercy 's feeling towards she mother she have in she nature a fine and lofty fiber of loyalty which could never condescend even to parley with a thought derogatory to its object be lift above all consciousness of the possibility of any other course this be a sort of organic integrity of affection which be to those who receive it a tower of strength that be impregnable to all assault except that of death itself it be a rare type of love the best the world know but the man and the woman whose heart be capable of it be often think not to be of a loving nature the cheaper and less lasting type of love be so much louder of voice and readier of phrase as in cloth cheap fabric poor to wear be often find print in gay color and big pattern the day before they leave home mercy become alarm by a longer interval than usual without any sound from the garret where she mother be still at work over she fantastic collection of old odds and end run up to see what it mean mr carr be on she knee before a barrel which have hold rag and papers the rag and papers be spread around she on the floor she have lean she head on the barrel and be cry bitterly mother mother what be the matter exclaim mercy really alarm for she have very few time in she life see she mother cry without speak mr carr hold up a little piece of carve ivory it be of a creamy yellow and shone like satin : a long shred of fray pink ribbon hang from it as she hold it up to mercy a sunbeam flash in at the garret window and fall across it send long glint of light to right and leave what a lovely bit of carve what be it mother why do it make you cry ask mercy stretch out she hand to take the ivory it be caley 's whistle sob mr carr we allus think patience swift

yesterday and the old woman wipe she eye on she apron and struggle up on she foot take the whistle again from mercy 's hand how old would my brother caley be now if he have live mother say mercy anxious to bring she mother gently back to the present well let I see child why caley -- caley he would be -- how old be i mercy dear I hai not i lose my memory sure enough except about these ere old

let I see -- you reckon it mercy i wuz goin ' on nineteen when caley be bear why mother exclaim mercy be it really so long ago then my brother caleb would be forty-six year old now and mercy take again in she hand the yellow ivory whistle and run she finger over the fade and fray pink ribbon and look at it with a indefinable sense of its be a strange link between she and a distant past which though she have never share it belong to she by right hardly think what she do she raise the whistle to she lip and blow a loud shrill whistle on it she mother start o mercy do not do not she cry i can not bear to hear it now mother do not you be foolish say mercy cheerily a whistle 's a whistle old or young and make to be whistle with we 'll keep this to amuse child with : you carry it in you

a master-piece for thinkin ' o ' thing and easily divert as a child the old woman drop the whistle into she deep pocket and forget all she tear return to she packing not so mercy have attain she end of cheer she mother she own thought revert again and again all day long and many time in after year whenever she see the ivory whistle to the strange picture of the lonely old woman in the garret come upon she first-born child 's first toy lose for forty year the picture too of the history of the quaint piece of carve itself the day it be slowly cut and chisel by a patient and ill-paid toiler in some city of china its voyage in the keep of the ardent young husband hasten home to welcome he first child its forty year of silence and darkness in the old garret and then its return to life and light and sound in the hand and lip of new generation of child the journey which mercy have so much dread be unexpectedly pleasant mr carr prove a admirable traveller with the exception of she incessant and garrulous anxiety about the box which have be leave behind on the deck of the schooner marium jane and could not by any possibility overtake they for three week to come she be in fact so much of a child that she be in a state of eager delight at every new scene and person she childishness prove the best of claim upon every one 's courtesy everybody be ready to help that poor sweet old woman and she be so simply and touchingly grateful for the smallest kindness that everybody who have help she once want to help she again more than one of they fellow-traveller remember for a long time the bright-faced young woman with she childish mother and wonder where they could have be go and what be to be they life on the fourth day just as the sun be sink behind the hill they enter the beautiful river interval through which the road to they new home lay mercy sit with she face almost press against the pane of the car-windows eagerly scanning every feature of the landscape to she so new and wonderful to the dweller by the sea the first sight of mountain be like the sight of a new heaven and a new earth it be a revelation of a new life mercy feel strangely stir and overawe she look around in astonishment at she fellow-passenger not one of whom apparently observe that on either hand be stretch away to the east and the west field that be even in this late autumn like carpet of gold and green through these fertile meadow run a majestic river curving and double as if loath to leave such fair shore the wooded mountain change fast from green to purple from purple to dark gray and almost before mercy have comprehend the beauty of the region it be lose from she sight veil in the twilight 's pale indistinguishable tint she mother be fast asleep in she seat the train stop every few moment at some insignificant station of which mercy could see nothing but a narrow platform a dim lantern and a sleepy-looking station-master slowly one or two at a time the passenger disappear until she and she mother be leave alone in the car the conductor and the brakeman as they pass through look at they with renew interest : it be evident now that they be go through to the terminus of the road goin ' through be ye say the conductor it 'll be dark when we get in a ' it be beginnin ' to rain 's anybody comin ' to meet ye no say mercy uneasily will there not be carriage at the depot we be go to the hotel i believe there be but one well there may be a kerridge down to-night a ' there may not : there be no knowin ' ef it do not rain too hard i reckon seth 'll be down mercy 's sense of humor never fail she she laugh heartily as she say -- then seth stay away do he on the night when he would be sure of passenger the conductor laugh too as he reply -- well ` tis not quite so bad 's that ye see this here road 's only a piece of a road it be goin ' up through to connect with the northern road but they have come to a stand-still for want o ' fund a ' more 'n half the time i do not carry nobody over this last ten mile most o ' the people from we town go the other way on the river road it be shorter a ' some cheaper there be not much travellin ' do by we folk anyhow we be a mighty dead a ' alive set up here goin ' to stay a spell he continue with increase interest as he look longer into mercy 's face probably say mercy in a grave tone suddenly recollect that she ought not to talk with this man as if he be one of she own village people the conductor sensitive as be most new england people spite of they apparent familiarity of address to the least rebuff feel the change in mercy 's tone and walk away think half surlily she need not put on air a schoolma'am i reckon wonder if it can be she that be go to teach the academy when they reach the station it be as the conductor have say very dark and it be rain hard for the first time a sense of she unprotected loneliness fall upon mercy 's heart she mother but half-awake clung nervously to she ask purposeless and incoherent question the conductor still surly from he fancied rebuff at mercy 's hand walk away and take no notice of they the station-master be nowhere to be see the two woman stand huddle together under one umbrella gaze blankly about they be this mr philbrick come in clear firm tone out of the darkness behind they and in a second more mercy have turn and look up into stephen white 's face oh how good you be to come and meet we exclaimed mercy you be mr allen 's friend i suppose yes say stephen curtly but i do not come to meet you you must not thank I i have business here however i make the one carriage which the town boast wait in case you should be here here it be and before mercy have time to analyze or even to realize the vague sense of disappointment she feel at he word she find herself and she mother place in the carriage and the door shut you trunk can not go up until morning he say speak through the carriage window but if you will give I you check i will see that they be send we have only one small valise say mercy : that be under we seat the brakeman say he would take it out for we but he forget it and so do i the train be already back out of the station stephen smother some very unchivalrous word on he lip as he run out into the rain overtake the train and swing himself on the last car in search of the one small valise belong to he tenant it be a very shabby valise : it have make many a voyage with its first owner captain carr it be a very little valise : it could not have hold one gown of any of the modern fashion dear I think stephen as he put it into the carriage at mercy 's foot what sort of woman be these i have take under my roof i expect they 'll be very unpleasing sight to my eye i do hope she would be good-looking how many time in after year do stephen recall with laughter he first impression of mercy philbrick and wonder how he could have argue so unhesitatingly that a woman who travel with only one small valise could not be good-looking will you come to the house to-morrow he ask oh no reply mercy not for three or four week yet we furniture will not be here under that time ah say stephen i have not think of that i will call on you at the hotel then in a day or two he adieus be civil but only civil : that most depressing of all thing to a sensitive nature a kindly indifference be manifest in every word he say and in every tone of he voice mercy feel it to the quick but she be ashamed of herself for the feeling what business have i to expect that he be go to be we friend she say in she heart we be only tenant to he what a kind-spoken young man he be to be sure mercy say mr carr so all-sufficient be bare kindliness of tone and speech to the unsensitive nature yes mother he be very kind say mercy but i do not think we shall ever know he very well why mercy why not exclaim she mother i should say he be most uncommon friendly for a stranger run back after we valise in the rain and a goin ' to call on you to oncet mercy make no reply the carriage roll along over the rough and muddy road it be too dark to see any thing except the shadowy black shape of house outline on a still deeper blackness by the light streaming from they window there be no sight in the world so hard for lonely homeless people to see as the sight of the light window of house after nightfall why house should look so much more homelike so much more suggestive of shelter and cheer and companionship and love when the curtain be snug-drawn and the door shut and nobody can look in though the light of fire and lamp shine out than they do in broad daylight with open window and people come and go through open door and a general air of comradeship and busy live it be hard to see but there be not a lonely vagabond in the world who do not know that they do one may see on a dark night many a wistful face of lonely man or lonely woman hurry resolutely past and look away from the illumined house which mean nothing to they except the keen reminder of what they be without oh the homeless people there be in this world do anybody ever think to count up the thousand there be in every great city who live in lodgings and not in home from the luxurious lodger who lodge in the costliest room of the costliest hotel down to the most poverty-stricken lodger who lodge in a corner of the poorest tenement-house homeless all of they they common vagabondage be only a matter of degree of decency all honor to the bravery of those who be homeless because they must be and who make the best of it but only scorn and pity for those who be homeless because they choose to be and be foolish enough to like it mercy have never before feel the sensation of be a homeless wanderer she be utterly unprepared for it all through the break up of they home and the preparation for they journey she have be buoy up by excitement and anticipation much as she have grieve to part from some of the friend of she early life and to leave the old home in which she be bear there be still a certain sense of elation in the prospect of new scene and new people she have feel without realize it a most unreasonable confidence that it be to be at once a change from one home to another home in she native town she have have a position of importance they house be the best house in the town judge by the simple standard of a cape cod village they be well-to-do everybody know and everybody speak with respect and consideration of old mis ' carr or as she be perhaps more often call widder carr mercy have not think -- in she utter inexperience of change it could not have occur to she -- what a very different thing it be to be simply unknown and poor people in a strange place the sense of all this smote upon she suddenly and keenly as they jolt along in the noisy old carriage on this dark rainy night stephen white 's indifferent though kindly manner first bring to she the thought or rather the feeling of this each new glimmer of the home-light deepen she sense of desolation every gust of rain that beat on the carriage roof and window make she feel more and more like a outcast she never forget these moment she use to say that in they she have live the whole life of the loneliest outcast that be ever bear long year afterward she write a poem call the outcast which be so intense in its feeling one could have easily believe that it be write by ishmael when she be ask once how and when she write this poem she reply i do not write it : i live it one night in enter a strange town in vain she struggle against the strange and unexpected emotion a nervous terror of arrive at the hotel oppress she more and more although thanks to harley allen 's thoughtfulness she know that they room be already engage for they she feel as if she would rather drive on and on in all the darkness and rain no matter where all night long rather than enter the door of the strange and public house in which she must give she name and she mother 's name on the threshold when the carriage stop she move so slowly to alight that she mother exclaim petulantly -- dear I child what be the matter with you be not you goin ' to git out be not this the tavern yes mother this be we place say mercy in a low voice unlike she usual cheery ringing tone as she assist she mother down the clumsy step from the old-fashioned high vehicle they be expect we : it be all right but she voice and face belie she word she move all through the rest of the evening like one in a dream she say little but busy herself in make she mother as comfortable as it be possible to be in the dingy and unattractive little room and as soon as the tired old woman have fall asleep mercy sit down on the floor by the window and lean she head on the sill cry hard chapter iii the next morning the sun shone and mercy be herself again she depression of the evening before seem to she so causeless so inexplicable that she recall it almost with terror as one might a temporary insanity she blush to think of she unreasonable sensitiveness to the word and tone of stephen white as if it make any sort of difference to mother and to I whether he be we friend or not he can do as he like i hope i 'll be out when he call thought mercy as she stand on the hotel piazza after breakfast scanning with a keen and eager glance every feature of the scene to she eye accustom to the broad open leisurely street of the cape cod hamlet its isolate little house with they trim flower-bed in front and they punctiliously keep fence and gate this somewhat untidy and huddle town look unattractive the hotel stand on the top of one of the plateau of which i speak in the last chapter the ground fall away slowly to the east and to the south a poorly keep oblong-shaped common some few acre in extent lay just in front of the hotel : it have once be fence in but the fence be sadly out of repair and two cow be grazing there this morning as composedly as if there be no town ordinance forbid all run of cattle in the street a few shabby old farm-wagon stand here and there by these fence the sleepy horse which have draw they thither have be take out of the shaft and tethered in some mysterious way to the hinder part of the wagon a court be in session and these be the wagon of lawyer and client alike humble in they style of equipage on the left-hand side of the hotel down the eastern slope of the hill run a irregular block of brick building no two of a height or size the block have burn down in spot several time and each owner have rebuild as much or as little as he choose which have result in as incoherent a bit of architecture as be often see the general effect however be of a tendency to a certain parallelism with the ground line : so that the block itself seem to be slide down hill the roof of the building farthest east be not much above the level of the first story window in the building farthest west to add to the queerness of this brick row as it be call the ingenuity of all the sign-painter of the region have be call into requisition sign alphabetical allegorical and symbolic sign in black on white in red on black in rainbow color on tin sign high up and sign low down sign swing and sign post -- make the whole front of the row look at a little distance like a wall of advertisement of some travel menagerie there be a paint yellow horse with a fiery red mane which be the pride of the heart of seth nim the livery-stable keeper and a big black dog 's head with a gay collar of scarlet and white morocco which be suppose to draw the custom of all owner of dog to john locker harness-maker there be a barber 's pole and a apothecary 's shop with the conventional globe of mysterious crimson and blue liquid in the window and to complete the list of the decoration of this fantastic front there have be paint many year ago high up on the wall in large and irregular letter the sign stretch out over two-third of the row miss orra white 's seminary for young lady miss orra white have be dead for several year and the hall in which she have teach she school have pass through many successive stage of degradation in its use have come at last to be a lumber-room from which have arise many a waggish say as to the similarity between its first estate and its last on the other side of the common opposite the hotel be a row of dwelling-house which owe to the steep descent have a sunken look as if they be slip into they own cellar the grass be too green in they yard and the thick matted plantain-leaf grow on both edge of the sodden sidewalk oh dear think mercy to herself i be sure i hope we house be not there then she step down from the high piazza and stand for a moment on the open space look up toward the north she could only see for a short distance up the wind road a high wood-crowned summit rise beyond the house which seem to be build higher and higher on the slope and to be much surround by tree a street lead off to the west also : this be more thickly build up to the south there be again a slight depression and the house although of a better order than those on the eastern side of the common have somewhat of the same sunken air mercy 's heart turn to the north with a sudden and instinctive recognition i be sure that be the right part of the town for mother she say if mr white 's house be down in that hollow we 'll not live in it long she be so absorb in she study of the place and in she conjecture as to they home that she do not realize that she herself be no ordinary sight in that street : a slight almost girlish figure in a plain straight black gown like a nun 's with one narrow fold of transparent white at she throat tie carelessly by long float end of black ribbon she wavy brown hair blow about she eye by the wind she cheek flush with the keen air and she eye bright with excitement mercy could not be call even a pretty woman but she have time and season of look beautiful and this be one of they the hostler who be rub down he horse in the door of the barn come out wide-mouthed and exclaim under he breath -- gosh who be she with a emphasis on that feminine personal pronoun which be all the bitterer slur on the rest of womankind in that neighborhood that he be so unconscious of the reflection it convey the cook and the stable-boy also come run to the kitchen door on hear the hostler 's exclamation and they too stand gaze at the unconscious mercy and each in they own way pay tribute to she appearance that be the gal thet come last night with she mother darned sight better-lookin ' by daylight than she wuz then say the stable-boy hm boy a ' man ye be all alike -- all for look say the cook who be a lean and ill-favored spinster at least fifty year old the gal be not any thin ' so amazin ' for good look 's i can see but she be get mighty sarchin ' eye in she head i wonder if she be a lookin ' for somebody they be expectin ' steve white he be with 'em down to the depot reply the stable-boy seth sed he hand on 'em into the kerridge 's if they be regular topknot sure enough hm seth quin 's a fool 'n' always wuz reply the cook with a seemingly uncalled-for acerbity of tone i have allus observe that they that hez the most to say about topknot hez the least idea of what topknot really be there be not a touch o ' topknot about that ere girl : she be come o ' real humbly people anybody with half a eye can see that good gracious i believe she be goin ' to stand still and let old man wheeler run over she look out there look out gal scream the cook and pound vigorously with she rolling-pin on the side of the door to rouse mercy 's attention mercy turn just in time to confront a stout red-faced old gentleman with a big cane who be literally on the point of walk over she he be so near that as she turn he start back as if she have hit he in the breast god bless my soul god bless my soul miss he exclaim in he

or retreat striking he heavy cane on the ground at each step as if beat time to he jerky syllable he have twinkle blue eye which be half hide under heavy project eyebrow and shut up tight whenever he laugh he hair be long and thin and white as spin glass altogether except that he speak with a unmistakable yankee twang and wear unmistakable yankee clothes you might have fancy that he be a ancient

she story mr carr be knit a woollen stock she have be knit woollen stocking ever since mercy could remember she always keep several on hand in different stage of incompletion : some that she could knit on in the dark without any counting of stitch other that be in the process of heel or toe and require the closest attention she have be set a heel while mercy be speak and do not reply for a moment then push the stitch all into a compact bunch in the middle of one needle she let she work fall into she lap and roll the disengaged knitting-needle back and forth on she knee to brighten it look at mercy reflectively mercy say she queer people aller do take to each other i do not believe he be a bit queerer 'n you be child and mr carr laugh a little laugh half pride and half dissatisfaction you be jest like you father : he would make friend with a stranger any day on the street in two jiffey if he take a likin ' to he and there might be neighbor a livin ' right long `

like i do not feel nateral somehow when they be round ' o mother exclaim mercy i think i must be just like father that be exactly the way i feel so often when i get with some people i feel just as if i have be change into somebody else i can not bear to open my mouth it be like a bad dream when you dream you can not move hand nor foot all the time they be in the room with I well i thank the lord i do not never take such notion about people say mr carr settle herself back in she chair and begin to make she needle fly nobody do not never trouble I much one way or the other for my part i think folk be alike as pea we should not hardly know 'em apart if ' t wa 'n' t for they face mercy be about to reply why mother you just say that i be queer and this old man be queer and my father must have be queer too but she glance at the placid old face and forbore there be a truth as well as a untruth in the inconsistent saying and both lay too deep for the childish intellect to grasp mercy be impatient to go at once to see they new home but she could not induce she mother to leave the house o mercy she exclaim pathetically ef yer know what a comfort ' t be to I jest to set still in a chair once more it seem like heaven arter they pesky joltin ' car i be not in no hurry to see the house it can not run away i reckon and we be sure of it be not we there be not any thing that be get to be do be there she ask nervously oh no mother it be all sure we have lease the house for one year and we can not move in until we furniture come of course but i do long to see what the place be like do not you reply mercy pleadingly no no child time enough when we move in ' t be not go to make any odds what it be like we be goin ' to live in it anyhow you jest go by yourself ef you want to so much a ' let I set right here it do not seem to I 's i 'll ever want to git out o ' this chair at last very unwillingly late in the afternoon mercy go leave she mother alone in the hotel without ask a question of anybody she turn resolutely to the north even if we house be not on this street she say to herself i be go to see those lovely wood and she walk swiftly up the hill with she eye fix on the glowing dome of scarlet and yellow leaf which crown it the tree be in they full autumnal splendor : maple crimson scarlet and yellow chestnut pale green and yellow beech shine golden brown and sumac in fiery spike brighter than all the rest there be also tall pine here and there in the grove and they green furnish a fine dark background for the gay color mercy have often read of the glory of autumn in new england 's thickly wooded region but she have never dream that it could be so beautiful as this row of young maple line the street which lead up to this wooded hill each tree seem a full sheaf of glitter color and yet the path below be strew thick with fall leave no less bright mercy walk lingeringly each moment stop to pick up some new leaf which seem brighter than all the rest in a very short time she hand be too full and in despair like a over-laden child she begin to scatter they along the way she be so absorb in she delight in the leaf that she hardly look at the house on either hand except to note with a unconscious satisfaction that they be grow fewer and farther apart and that every thing look more like country and less like town than it have do in the neighborhood of the hotel presently she come to a stretch of stone wall partly break down in front of a old orchard whose tree be gnarl and moss-grown blackberry-vine have fling themselves over this wall in and out among the stone the leaf of these vine be almost as brilliant as the leaf of the maple-tree they be of all shades of red up to the deepest claret they be of light green shade into yellow and curiously mottle with tiny point of red all these shades and color sometimes be see upon one long runner the effect of these wreath and tangle of color upon the old gray stone be so fine that mercy stand still and involuntarily exclaim aloud then she pick a few of the most beautiful vine and climb up on the wall sit down to arrange they with the maple-leaves she have already gather she make a most picturesque picture as she sit there in she severe black gown and quaint little black bonnet on the stone wall surround by the bright vine and leave she lap full of they the ground at she foot strew with they she little black-gloved hand deftly arrange and rearrange they she look as if she might be a nun who have run away from she cloister and come for the first time in she life upon gay gaud of color in strange fabric have sit herself down instantly to weave and work with they unaware that she be on a highway this be the picture that stephen white saw as he come slowly up the road on he way home after a unusually wearying day he slacken he pace and perceive how entirely unconscious mercy be of he approach deliberately study she feature dress attitude -- all as scrutinizingly as if she have be paint on canvas and hang on a wall upon my word he say to himself she be not bad-looking after all i be not sure that she be not pretty if she have not that inconceivable bonnet on she head -- yes she be very pretty she mouth be bewitching i declare i believe she be beautiful be stephen 's successive verdict as he draw nearer and nearer to mercy mercy be think of he at that very moment -- be think of he with a return of the annoyance and mortification which have sting she at interval all day whenever she recall they interview of the previous evening mercy combine in a very singular manner some of the trait of a impulsive nature with those of a unimpulsive one she do thing say thing and feel thing with the instantaneous intensity of the poetic temperament but she be quite capable of look at they afterward and weigh they with the cool and unbiassed judgment of the most phlegmatic realist hence she often have most uncomfortable season in which one side of she nature take the other side to task scorn it and berate it severely hold up its action to its remorseful view as a elder sister might chide a younger one who be incorrigibly perverse and wayward it be about as silly a thing as you ever do in you life he must have think you a perfect fool to have suppose he have come down to meet you she be say to herself at the very moment when the sound of stephen 's footstep first reach she ear and cause she to look up the sight of he face at that particular moment be so startling and so unpleasant to she that it deprive she of all self-possession she give a low cry she face be flood with crimson and she spring from the wall so hastily that she leaf and vine fly in every direction i be very sorry i frightened you so mr philbrick say stephen quite unconscious of the true source of she confusion i be just on the point of speak when you hear I i ought to have speak before but you make so charming a picture sit there among the leaf and vine that i could not resist look at you a little longer mercy philbrick hate a compliment this be partly the result of the secluded life she have lead partly a instinctive antagonism in she straightforward nature to any thing which could be even suspect of not be true the few direct compliment she have receive have be from man whom she neither respect nor trust these word come from stephen white just at this moment be most offensive to she she face flush still deeper red and say curtly -- you frighten I very much mr white but it be not of the least consequence she turn to walk back to the village stephen unconsciously stretch out he hand to detain she but mr philbrick he say eagerly pray tell I what you think of the house do you think you can be contented in it i have not see it reply mercy in the same curt tone still move on not see it exclaim stephen in a tone which be of such intense astonishment that it effectually rouse mercy 's attention not see it why do you not know you be on you own stone wall there be the house and mercy follow the gesture of he hand see not more than twenty rod beyond the spot where she have be sit a shabby fade yellow wooden house standing in a yard which look almost as neglect as the orchard from which it be only in part separate by a tumble stone wall mercy do not speak stephen watch she face in silence for a moment then he laugh constrainedly and say -- do not be afraid mr philbrick to say outright that it be the dismallest old barn you ever see that be just what i have say about it hundred of time and wonder how anybody could possibly live in it but necessity drive we into it and i suppose necessity have bring you to it too add stephen sadly mercy do not speak very deliberately she eye scan the build a expression of scorn slowly gather on she face it be not so forlorn inside as it be out say stephen some of the room be quite pleasant the south room in you part of the house be very cheerful mercy do not speak stephen go on begin to be half-angry with this little unknown woman from cape cod who look with the contemptuous glance of a princess upon the house in which he and he mother dwelt -- you be quite at liberty to throw up you lease mr philbrick if you choose it be perhaps hardly fair to have let you hire the house without see it mercy start i beg you pardon mr white i should not think of such a thing as give up the lease i be very sorry you see how ugly i think the house i do think it be the very ugliest house i ever see she continue speak with emphatic deliberation but then i have not see many house in we village at home all the house be low and broad and comfortable-looking they look as if they have sit down and lean back to take they ease and they be all neat and clean-looking and have row of flower-bed from the gate to the front door i never see a house build with such a steep angle to its roof as this have say mercy look up with the instinctive dislike of a natural artist 's eye at the ridgepole of the old house we have to have we roof at a sharp pitch to let the snow slide off in winter say stephen apologetically we have such heavy snow here but that do not make the angle any less ugly to look at no say mercy and she eye still rove up and down and over the house with not a shadow of relent in they expression it be stephen 's turn to be silent now he watch she but do not speak mercy 's face be not merely a record of she thought : it be a photograph of they as plainly as on a write page hold in he hand stephen white read the successive phase of thought and struggle which pass through mercy 's mind for the next five minute and he be not in the least surprised when turn suddenly towards he with a very sweet smile she say in a resolute tone -- there that be do with i hope you will forgive my rudeness mr white but the truth be i be awfully shock at the first sight of the house it be not you house you know so it be not quite so bad for I to say so and i be so glad you hate it as much as i do now i be never go to think about it again -- never why can you help it mr philbrick ask stephen in a wonder tone i can not i hate it more and more i verily believe each time i come home and i think that if my mother be not in it i should burn it down some night mercy look at he with a certain shade of the same contempt with which she have look at the house and stephen wince as she say coolly -- why of course i can help it i should be very much ashamed of myself if i could not i never allow myself to be distressed by thing which i can not help -- at least that sort of thing add mercy she face clouding with the sudden recollection of a grief that she have not be able to rise above of course i do not mean real trouble like grief about any one you love one can not wholly conquer such trouble as that but one can do a great deal more even with these than people usually suppose i be not sure that it be right to let ourselves be unhappy about any thing even the worst of trouble but i must hurry home now it be grow late mr philbrick exclaim stephen earnestly : please come into the house and speak to my mother a moment you do not know how she have be look forward to you come oh no i can not possibly do that reply mercy there be no reason why i should call on you mother merely because we be go to live in the same house but i assure you persist stephen that it will give she the greatest pleasure she be a helpless cripple and never leave she bed she have probably be watch we from the window she always watch for I she will wonder if i do not bring you in to see she please come he say with a tone which it be impossible to resist and mercy go mr white have indeed be watch they from the window but stephen have reckon without he host or rather without he hostess when he assure mercy that he mother would be so glad to see she the wisest and the tenderest of man be continually make blunder in they relation with woman especially if they be so unfortunate as to occupy in any sense a position involve a relation to two woman at once the relation may be ever so rightful and honest to each woman the woman may be good woman and in they right place but the man will find himself perpetually get into most unexpected hot water as many a man could testify pathetically if he be call upon mr white have be watch she son through the whole of he conversation with mercy she could see only dimly at such a distance but she have discern that it be a woman with whom he stand talk so long it be nearly half a hour past supper-time and supper be mrs white 's one festivity in the course of the day they breakfast and they mid-day dinner be too hurry meal for enjoyment because stephen be oblige to make haste to the office but with supper there be nothing to interfere stephen 's work for the day be do : he take great pain to tell she at this time every thing which he have see or hear which could give she the least amusement she look forward all through she long lonely day to the evening as a child look forward to Saturday afternoon like all invalid whose life have be force into groove she be impatient and unreasonable when anybody or any thing interfere with she routine a five minute ' delay be to she a serious annoyance and demand a accurate explanation stephen so thoroughly understand this exactingness on she part that he adjust he life to it as a conscientious school-boy adjust he to bell and signal and never trespass knowingly if he have dream that it be past tea-time on this unlucky night he would never have think of ask mercy to go in and see he mother but he do not and it be with a bright and eager face that he throw open the door and say in the most cordial tone -- mother i have bring mr philbrick to see you how do you do mr philbrick be the rejoinder in a tone and with a look so chill that poor mercy 's heart sink within she she have all along have a ideal in she own mind of the invalid old lady mr white 's mother to whom she be to be very good and who be to be she mother 's companion she picture she as she own mother would be a good deal older and feebler in a gentle receptive patient old age of so repellent aggressive unlovely a old woman as this she have have no conception it would be hard to do justice in word to mr white 's capacity to be disagreeable when she choose she have gray eye which though they have a very deceptive trick of suffuse with tear as of great sensibility on occasion be capable of rest upon a person with a positively unhuman coldness she voice also have at these time a distinctly unhuman quality in its tone she have apparently no conception of any necessity of control she feeling or the expression of they if she be pleased if all thing go precisely as she like if all person minister to she pleasure well and good -- she would be graciously pleased to smile and be good-humored if she be displeased if she preference be not consult if she plan be interfere with woe betide the first person who enter she presence and still more woe betide the person who be responsible for she annoyance as soon as stephen 's eye fall on she face on this occasion he feel with a sense of almost terror that he have make a fatal mistake and he know instantly that it must be much later than he have suppose but he plunge bravely in like a man take a header into a pool he fear he may drown in and begin to give a voluble account of how he have find mr philbrick sit on they stone wall so absorb in look at the bright leaf that she have not even see the house he run on in this strain for some minute hope that he mother 's mood might soften but in vain she listen with the same stony unresponsive look on she face never take the stony unresponsive eye from he face and as soon as he stop speak she say in a equally stony voice -- mr philbrick will you be so good as to take off you bonnet and take tea with we it be already long past we tea-hour mercy spring to she foot and say impulsively oh no i thank you i do not dream that it be so late my mother will be anxious about I i must go i be very sorry i come in good-evening good-evening mr philbrick in the same slow and stony syllable come from mr white 's lip and she turn she head away immediately stephen with he face crimson with mortification follow mercy to the door in a low voice he say i hope you will be able to make allowance for my mother 's manner it be all my fault i know that she can never bear to have I late at meal and i ought never to allow myself to forget the hour it be all my fault mercy 's indignation at she reception be too great for she sense of courtesy i do not think it be you fault at all mr white she exclaim good-night and she be out of sight before stephen could think of a word to say very slowly he walk back into the sitting-room he have seldom be so angry with he mother but he countenance betray no sign of it and he take he seat opposite she in silence silence absolute unconquerable silence be the armor which stephen white wear it be like those invisible network of fine chain worn next the skin in which many man in the olden time pass unscathed through year of battle and win the reputation of have charm life no one suspect the secret to the ordinary beholder the man seem accoutr in the ordinary fashion of soldier but whenever a bullet strike he it glance off harmlessly as if turn back by a spell it be so with stephen white 's silence : in ordinary intercourse he be social genial he talk more than average man talk he take or seem to take more interest than man usually take in the common small talk of average people but the instant there be a manifestation of anger of discord of any thing unpleasant he entrench himself in silence this be especially the case when he be reproach or arouse by he mother it be often more provoke to she than any amount of retort or recrimination could have be she have in she nature a certain sort of slow ugliness which delighted in dwelling upon a small offence in ask irritating question about it in reiterate its detail all the while make it out a matter of personal unkindness or indifference to she that it should have happen when she be in these mood stephen 's silence sometimes provoke she past endurance can not you speak stephen she would exclaim what would be the use mother he would say sadly if you do not know that the great aim of my life be to make you happy it be of no use for I to keep on say it if it would make you any happier to keep on discuss and discuss this question indefinitely i would endure even that but it would not to do mr white justice she be generally ashamed of these ebullition of unreasonable ill-temper and endeavor to atone for they afterward by be more than ordinarily affectionate and loving in she manner towards stephen but she shame be short-lived and never make she any the less unreasonable or exacting when the next occasion occur so that although stephen receive she affectionate epithet and caress with filial responsiveness he be never in the slightest degree delude by they he take they for what they be worth and hold himself no whit freer from constraint no whit less ready for the next storm by the very fact of the greater fineness of he organization this tyrannical woman hold he chained he submission to she would have seem abject if it have not be base on a sentiment and ground in a loyalty which compel respect he have accept this burden as the one great duty of he life and whatever become of he whatever become of he life the burden should be carry this helpless woman who stand to he in the relation of mother should be make happy from the moment of he father 's death he have assume this obligation as a sacrament and if it last he life out he would never dream of evade or lessen it in this fine fiber of loyalty stephen white and mercy philbrick be alike : though it be in he more a exalted sentiment in she simply a organic necessity in he it would always have be in danger of take morbid shape and phase of be over-ridden and distorted at any time by selfishness or wickedness in its object as it have be by he selfish mother in mercy it be on a higher and healthier plane without be a shade less loyal she would be far clearer-sighted would render but not surrender would give a lifetime of service but not a moment of subjection there be a shade of something feminine in stephen 's loyalty of something perhaps masculine in mercy 's but mercy 's be the best the truest i would not allow my mother to treat a stranger like that she think indignantly as she walk away after mr white 's inhospitable invitation to tea i would not allow she i would make she see the shamefulness of it what a weak man mr white must be yet if mercy could have look into the room she have just leave and have see stephen listen with a face unmoved save for a certain compression of the mouth and a look of patient endurance in the eye to a torrent of ill-nature from he mother she would have recognize that he have strength however much she might have undervalue its type i should really think that you might have more consideration stephen than to be so late to tea when you know it be all i have to look forward to all day long you stand a good half hour talk with that woman do you not know how late it be no mother if i have i should have come in i suppose you have you watch on have not you yes mother well i would like to know what excuse there be for a man 's not know what time it be when he have a watch in he pocket and then you must need bring she in here of all thing -- when you know i hate to see people near my meal-time and you must have know it be near supper-time at any rate watch or no watch i suppose you do not think you would start to come home in the middle of the afternoon do you and what do you want she to come in for anyhow i would like to know that answer I will you simply because i think that it would give you pleasure to see some one mother you often complain of be so lonely of no one 's come in reply stephen in a tone which be pathetic almost shrill from its effort to be patient and calm i wish if you can not speak in you own voice you would not speak at all say the angry woman what make you change you voice so stephen make no reply he know very well this strange tone which sometimes come into he voice when he patience be try almost beyond endurance he would have like to avoid it he be instinctively conscious that it often betray to other people what he suffer but it be beyond he control : it seem as if all the organ of speech involuntarily clench themselves as the hand unconsciously clench itself when a man be enraged mr white persist you voice when you be angry 's enough to drive anybody wild i never hear any thing like it and i be sure i do not see what you have to be angry at now i should think i be the one to be angry you be all i have get in the world stephen and you know what a life i lead it be not as if i could go about like other woman then i should not care where you spend you time if you do not want to spend it with I and tear partly of ill-temper partly of real grief roll down the hard unlovely old face this be only one evening there be three hundred and sixty-five in a year be not the burden too heavy for mortal man to carry chapter iv mercy say nothing to she mother of mr white 's rudeness she merely mention the fact of she have meet mr white near the house and have go with he at he request to speak to he mother what be she like mercy ask mrs carr eagerly be she goin ' to be company for I i could not tell mother reply mercy indifferently for it be just they tea-hour and i do not stay a minute -- only just to say how d'ye do and good-evening but mr white say she be very lonely people do not go to see she much : so i should think she would be very glad of somebody she own age in the house to come and sit with she she look very ill poor soul she have not be out of she bed except when she be lift for eight year dear I dear I exclaim mr carr oh i hope i 'll never be that way what ` u would you ever do child if i would get to be like that no danger mother dear of you ever be like mr white say mercy with a incautious emphasis which however escape mr carr 's recognition why how can you be so sure i might not ever get into jest so bad a way child there be none of we can say what disease we be likely to hev or not to hev now there be never be a case o ' lung trouble in we family afore mine not be fur back 's anybody kin trace it out 'n' there be be two cancer to my own knowledge 'n' i allus hed a most awful dread o ' gettin ' a cancer there be not no death like thet there wuz my mother 's half-sister keziah -- she that marry elder swift for she second husband she die o ' cancer a ' she oldest boy by she first husband he hed it in he face awful but he hold on ter life 's ef he could not say die

too dreadful to talk about i can not bear to think that any human being have ever suffer so please do not ever speak of cancer again mr carr look puzzle and a little vexed as she answer well i reckon they have get to be talk about a good deal fust and last 's long 's there be so many die on 'em but i do not know 's you 'n' i have get any call to dwell on 'em much you have get dreadful quick feelin 's mercy be not you you allus be orful feelin ' for everybody when you wuz little 'n' i do not see 's you have outgrow it a bit but i expect it be thet make you sech friend with folk a ' make you such a good gal to you poor old mother kiss I child and mr carr lift up she face to be kiss as a child lift up its face to its mother she do this many time a day and whenever mercy bent down to kiss she she put she hand on the old woman 's shoulder and say dear little mother in a tone which make she mother 's heart warm with happiness it be a very beautiful thing to see just this sort of relation between a aged parent and a child the exact reversal of the bond and the bond so absolutely fulfil it seem to give a new and deeper sense to the word filial and a new and deeper significance to the joy of motherhood or fatherhood alas that so few son and daughter be capable of it so few helpless old people know the blessedness of it no little child six year old ever rest more entirely and confidingly in the love and kindness and shelter and direction of its mother than do mrs carr in the love and kindness and shelter and direction of she daughter mercy it have begin to be so while mercy be yet a little girl before she be fifteen year old she feel a responsibility for she mother 's happiness a watchfulness over she mother 's health and even a care of she mother 's clothes with each year the sense of these responsibility grow deeper and after she marriage as she be deny the blessing of child all the deep maternal instinct of she strong nature flow back and centre anew around this comparatively helpless aged child whom she call mother and treat with never-failing respect when mr carr first see the house they be to live in she exclaim -- o lor ' mercy be thet the house then step back a few step shove she spectacles high on she nose and with she head well throw back she take a survey of the building in silence then she turn slowly around and face mercy say in a droll dry way not uncommon with she -- ` bijah jenkin 's barn mercy laugh outright so it be mother i have not think of it it look just like that old barn of deacon jenkin 's yes say mr carr that be it exzackly

dismayed oh hev we well well i daresay it be comfortable enough so the sun shine in mornin 's thet 's the most i care for you 'll make any kind o ' house pooty to look at inside a ' i reckon we need not roost on the fence outside a-lookin ' at it any more 'n we choose to it do look for all the world though like ` bijah jenkin 's old yaller barn 'n' thet there jog 's jest the way he jine on he cow-shed i declare it be too redicklus and the old lady laugh till she have to wipe she spectacles it could be make very pretty i think say mercy for all it be so hideous now i know just what i would

round both the bay window i see a picture of a house in a book mr allen have which look very much as this would look then oh but i would like to do it mercy 's imagination be so fire with the picture she have make to herself of the house thus altered and improve that she could not easily relinquish it but mercy you do not know the lay o ' the room child you don ' ` no ' where that ere jog come you bay window might not come so 's ' t would be of any use yer would not build one jest to look at would you say she mother i be not so sure i would not if i have plenty of money reply mercy laughing but i have no idea of building bay window on other people 's house i be only amusing myself by plan it i would rather have that house old and horrid as it be than any house in the town i like the situation so much and the wood be so beautiful perhaps i 'll earn a lot of money some day and buy the place and make it just as we like it you earn money child say mr carr in a tone of unqualified wonder how could you earn money i would like to know oh make bonnet or gown dear little mother or teach school say mercy color mr allen say i be quite well enough fit to teach we school at home if i like but mercy child you would never go to do any such thing 's thet would yer now say she mother piteously do not ye hev all ye want mercy be not there money enough for we clothes i be sure i do not need much a ' i could do with a good deal less if there be any thing you want dear you father he have never rest in he grave ef he think he little mercy be a havin ' to arn money for she livin ' you do not mean it child do yer say yer do not mean it mercy and tear stand in the poor old woman 's eye it be strange what a tenacious pride there be in the heart of we old sea-faring man of a half century ago they have the same feeling that king and emperor might have in regard to they wife and daughter that it be a disgrace for they to be oblige to earn money it would be a interesting thing to analyze this sentiment to trace it to its root : it be so universal among successful sea-faring man that it must have have its origin in some trait distinctively peculiar to they profession all the other woman in the town or the village might eke out the family income by whatever device they please but the captain ' wife be to be lady they be to wear silk gown bring from many a land they be to have ornament of quaint fashion pick up here and there they be to have money enough in the bank to live on in quiet comfort during the interval when the husband sail away to make more so strong be this feeling that it crystallize into a traditionary custom of life which even poverty find it hard to overcome you shall find to-day in any one of the seaport city or town of new england widow and daughter of sea-captain live or rather seem to live upon the most beggarly income but still keep up a certain pathetic sham of appearance of be at ease if they be really face to face with probable starvation they may go to some charitable institution where fine needlework be give out and earn a few dollar in that way but they will fetch and carry they work by night and no neighbor will ever by any chance surprise they with it in they hand most beautifully be this surreptitious sewing do there be no work in this country like it the tiny stitch bear the very aroma of sad and lonely leisure in they a certain fine pride too as if the poverty-constrained lady would in no wise condescend to depart from she own standard in the matter of a single loop or stitch no matter to what plebeian use the garment might come after it should leave she hand mercy 's deep blush when she reply to she mother 's astonished inquiry how she could possibly earn any money spring from she consciousness of a secret -- a secret so harmless in itself that she be ashamed of have any feeling of guilt in keep it a secret and yet she fine and fastidious honesty so hate even the semblance of concealment that the mere withholding of a fact simply because she dislike to mention it seem to she akin to a denial of it if there be such a thing in a human be as organic honesty -- a honesty which make a lie not difficult but impossible just as it be impossible for man to walk on ceiling like fly or to breathe in water like fish -- mercy philbrick have it the least approach to a equivocation be abhorrent to she : not that she reason about it and submit it to she conscience find it wicked and therefore hateful but that she dislike it instinctively -- as instinctively as she dislike pain she moral nerve shrink from it just as nerve of the body shrink from suffer and she recoil from the suggestion of such a thing with the same involuntary quickness with which we put up the hand to ward off a fall blow or drop the eyelid to protect a endanger eye physician tell we that there be in man and woman such enormous difference in this matter of sensitiveness to physical pain that one person may die of a pain which would be comparatively slight to another and this be a fact which have to be take very carefully into account in all deal with disease in people of the greatest capacity for suffering may there not be equally great difference in soul in the matter of sensitiveness to moral hurt -- difference for which the soul be not responsible any more than the body be responsible for its skin 's have be make thin or thick will-power have nothing whatever to do with determine the latter condition let we be careful how far we take it to task for fail to control the other perhaps we shall learn in some other stage of existence that there be in this world a great deal of moral color blindness congenital incurable and that god have much more pity than we suppose for poor thing who have stumble a good many time while they be grope in darkness people who see clearly themselves be almost always intolerant of those who do not we often see this ludicrously exemplify even in the trivial matter of near-sightedness we be almost always a little vexed when we point out a distant object to a friend and hear he reply -- no i do not see it at all i be near-sighted what can not you see that far be the frequent retort and in the pity be a dash of impatience there be a great deal of intolerance in the world which be closely akin to this and not a whit more reasonable or righteous though it make great pretension to be both mercy philbrick be full of such intolerance on this one point of honesty she be intolerant not only to other she be intolerant to herself she have season of fierce and hopeless debate with herself on the most trivial matter or what would seem so to nine hundred and ninety-nine person out of a thousand during such season as these she treatment of she friend and acquaintance have odd alternation of frank friendliness and reticent coolness a sudden misgiving whether she might not be appear to like she friend more than she really do would seize she at most inopportune moment and make she absent-minded and irresponsive she would leave sentence abruptly unfinished -- invitation perhaps or the acceptance of invitation the mere word of which spring readily to one 's lip and be thoughtlessly speak but in mercy 's time of conflict with herself even these be exaggerate in she view to monstrous deceit she have again and again hold long conversation with mr allen on this subject but he fail to help she he be a good man of average conscientiousness and average perception : he literally could not see many of the point which mercy 's keener analysis ferret out and sharpen into weapon for she own pain he think she simply morbid now child he would say -- for although he be only a few year mercy 's senior he have teach she like a child for three year -- now child leave off worry yourself by these fancy there be not the least danger of you ever be any thing but truthful nature and grace be both too strong in you there be no lie in say to a person who have come to see you in you own house ' i be glad to see you ' for you be glad and if not you can make yourself glad when you think how much pleasure you can give the person by talk with he you be glad always to give pleasure to any human being be you not yes mercy would reply unhesitatingly very well to the person who come to see you you give pleasure : therefore you be glad to see he but mr allen would persist poor mercy that be not what the person think i mean very often some one come to see I who bore I so that i can hardly keep awake he would not be please if he know that all my cordial welcome really mean be -- ` i be glad to see you because i be a benevolent person and be willing to make my fellow-creature happy at any sacrifice even at the frightful one of entertaining such a bear as you be ' he would never come near I again if he know i think that and yet if i do think so and make he think i do not be not that the biggest sort of a lie why mr allen many a time when i have see tiresome or disagreeable people come to we house i have run away and hide myself so as not to be find not in the least because i could not bear the be bore by they but because i could not bear the thought of the lie i should speak or at least act if i see they the interpretation a visitor choose to put upon we kind cordiality of manner to he be he own affair not ours mercy it be a christian duty to be cordial and kindly of manner to every human being : any thing less give pain repel people from we and hinder we be able to do they good there be no more doubt of this than of any other first principle of christian conduct and i be very sorry that these morbid notion have take such hold of you if you yield to they you will make yourself soon dislike and fear and give a great deal of needless pain to you neighbor it be hard for mr allen to be severe with mercy for he love she as if she be he younger sister but he honestly think she to be in great danger of fall into a chronic morbidness on this subject and he believe that stern word be most likely to convince she of she mistake it be a sort of battle however -- this battle which mercy be force to fight -- in which no human being can help another unless he have first be through the same battle himself all that mr allen say seem to mercy specious and to a certain extent trivial : it fail to influence she simply because it do not so much as recognize the point where she difficulty lay if mr allen try till he die he will never convinc I that it be not deceive people to make they think you be glad to see they when you be not mercy say to herself often as with flush cheek and tear in she eye she walk home after these conversation he may make I think that it be right to deceive they rather than to make they unhappy it almost seem as if it must be yet if we once admit that where should we ever stop it seem to I that would be a very dangerous doctrine a lie 's a lie let whoever will call it fine name and pass it off as a christian duty the bible do not say ` thou shalt not lie except when it be necessary to lie to avoid hurt thy neighbor 's feeling ' it say ` thou shalt not lie ' oh what a horrible word ` lie ' be it sting like a short sharp stroke with a lash and mercy would turn away from the think with a shudder and resolutely force hersef to think of something else sometimes she would escape from the perplexity for week : chance would so favor she that no opportunity for what she feel to be deceit would occur but in these interval of relief she tortured conscience seem only to renew its voice and spring upon she all the more fiercely on the next occasion the effect of all these indecisive conflict upon mercy 's character have not be good they have leave she morally bruised and therefore abnormally sensitive to the least touch she be in danger of become either a fanatic for truth or indifferent to it paradoxcal as it may seem she be in almost as much danger of the one as of the other but always when we hurt be fast healing without help the help come it be probable that there be to-day on the earth a cure either in herb or stone or spring for every ill which man 's body can know ignorance and accident may hinder we long from they but sooner or later the race shall come to possess they all so with soul there be the ready truth the living voice the warm hand or the final experience wait for each soul 's need we do not die till we have find they there be yet to enter into mercy philbrick 's life a new light and a new force by the help of which she would see clearly and stand firm the secret which she have now for nearly a year keep from she mother be a very harmless one to people of the world it would appear so trivial a thing that the conscience which could feel itself wound by reticence on such a point would seem hardly worth a sneer mr allen who have be mercy 's teacher for three year have early see in she a strong poetic impulse and have foster and stimulate it by every means in he power he believe that in the exercise of this talent she would find the best possible help for she loneliness and comfort for she sorrow he recognize clearly that to so exceptional a nature as mercy 's a certain amount of isolation be inevitable all through she life however fortunate she might be in enter into new and wider relation the loneliness of intense individuality be the loneliest loneliness in the world -- a loneliness which crowd only aggravate and which even the closest and happiest companionship can only in part cure the creative faculty be the most inalienable and uncontrollable of individuality it be at once its own reward and its own penalty : until it have conquer the freedom of its own city in which it must for ever dwell more or less apart it be only a prisoner in the city of other all this mr allen feel for mercy recognize in mercy he feel and recognize it by the instinct of love rather than by any intellectual perception intellectually he be in spite of he superior culture far mercy 's inferior he have be brave enough and manly enough to recognize this and also to recognize what it take still more manliness to recognize -- that she could never love a man of he temperament it would have be very easy for he to love mercy he be not a man of a passionate nature but he feel himself strangely stir whenever he look into she sensitive orchid-like face he feel in every fiber of he that to have the whole love of such a woman would be bewildering joy yet never for one moment do he allow himself to think of seek it i might make she think she love I perhaps he say to himself she be so lonely and sad and have see so few man but it would be base she need a nature totally different from mine a life unlike the life i shall lead i will never try to make she love I and he never do he teach she and train she and develop she patiently exactingly and yet tenderly as if she have be he sister but he never betray to she even by a look or tone that he could have love she as he wife no doubt he influence be greater over she for this subtle unacknowledged bond it give to they intercourse a certain strange mixture of reticence and familiarity which grow more and more perilous and significant month by month probably a change must have come have they live thus closely together a year or two longer the change could have be in but one direction they love each other too much to ever love less : they might have love more and mercy 's life have be more peaceful she heart have know a truer content if she have never feel any stronger emotion than that which harley allen 's love would have rouse in she bosom but he resolution be inexorable he instinct be too keen he will too strong : he compel all he home-seeking wife-loving thought to turn away from mercy and six month after she departure he have loyally and lovingly promise to be the husband of another in mercy 's future he feel a intense interest he would never cease to watch over she if she would let he he would guide mould and direct she until the time come -- he know it would come -- when she have outgrow he help and ascend to a plane where he could no longer guide she he greatest fear be lest from she overflow vitality and keen sensuous delight in all the surface activity and pleasure of life the intellectual side of she nature should be keep in the background and not properly nourish he have compel she to study to think to write who would do this for she in the new home he know enough of stephen white 's nature to fear that he while he might be a appreciative friend would not be a stimulate one he be too dreamy and pleasure-loving himself to be a spur to other a vague wonder almost like a presentiment haunt he thought continually as to the nature of the relation which would exist between stephen and mercy one day he write a long letter to stephen tell he all about mercy -- she history she peculiarity mental and moral she great need of mental training she wonderful natural gift he close he letter in these word : -- there be the making of a glorious woman and i think a true poet in this girl but whether she ever make either will depend entirely upon the hand she fall into she have a capacity for involuntary adaptation of herself to any surroundings and for a unconscious and indomitable loyalty to the every-day need of every-day life which rarely go with the poetic temperament she would contentedly make bread and do nothing else till the day of she death if that seem to be the nearest and most demand duty she would be heartily faithful and joyous every day in intercourse with only common and uncultivated people if fate set she among they she seem to I sometimes to be more literally a child of god in the true and complete sense of the word ` child ' than any one i ever know she take every thing which come to she just as a happy and good little child take every thing that be give to he and be please with all yet she be not at all a religious person i be often distressed by she lack of impulse to worship i think she have no strong sense of a personal god yet she conscience be in many way morbidly sensitive she be a most interesting and absorb person -- one entirely unique in my experience live with she as you will it will be impossible for you not to influence she strongly one way or the other and i want to enlist you help to carry on the work i have begin she owe it to herself and to the world not to let she mind be inactive i be very much mistaken if she have not within she the power to write poem which shall take place among the work that last mr allen read this letter over several time and then with a gesture of impatience tear the sheet down the middle and throw they into the fire exclaim -- pshaw as if there be any use in send a man a portrait of a woman he be to see every day if stephen be the person to amount to any thing in she life he will recognize she if he be not all my description of she will be throw away it be best to let thing take they own course after some deliberation he decide to take a step which he would never have take have mercy not be go away from he influence -- a step which he have again and again say to himself he would hot risk lest the effect might be to hinder she intellectual growth he send two of she poem to a friend of he who be the editor of one of the lead magazine in the country the welcome they meet exceed even he anticipation by the very next mail he receive a note from he friend enclose a check which to harley allen 's inexperience of such matter seem disproportionately large you little cape cod girl be a wonder indeed write the editor if she can keep on write such verse as this she will make a name for herself send we some more : we 'll pay she well for it mr allen be perplexed he have not once think of the verse be pay for he have think that to see she poem in print might give mercy a new incentive to work might rouse in she a ambition which would in part take the place of the stimulus which he teaching have give she he very much dislike to tell she what he have do and to give to she the money she have unwittingly earn he fear that she would resent it he fear that she would be too elate by it he fear a dozen different thing in as many minute as he sit turn the check over and over in he hand but he fear be all unfounded mercy have too genuine a artistic nature to be elate too much simplicity to be offend she first emotion be one of incredulity she second of unaffected and humble wonder that any verse of hers should have be so well speak of and she next of childlike glee at the possibility of she earn any money she have not a trace of the false pride which have crystallize in she mother 's nature into such a barrier against the idea of a pay industry o mr allen she exclaim be it really possible do you think the verse be really worth it be you quite sure the editor do not send the money because the verse be write by a friend of yours harley allen laugh editor be not at all likely mercy he say to pay any more for thing than the thing be worth i think you will some day laugh heartily as you look back upon the misgiving with which you receive the first money earn by you pen if you will only work faithfully and painstakingly you can do work which will be much better pay than this mercy 's eye flash oh oh then i can have book and picture and take journey she say in a tone of such ecstasy that mr allen be surprised why mercy he reply i do not know you be such a discontented girl have you always long for all these thing i be not discontented mr allen answer mercy a little proudly i never have a discontented moment in my life i be not so silly i have never yet see the day which do not seem to I brimful and run over with joy and delight that be except when i be for a little while bow down by a grief nobody could bear up under she add with a sudden drooping of every feature in she expressive face as she recall the one sharp grief of she life i do not see why a distinct longing for all sort of beautiful thing need be in the least inconsistent with absolute content in fact i know it be not for i have both mr allen be not enough of a idealist to understand this he look puzzle and mercy go on -- why mr allen i should like to have we home perfectly beautiful just like the most beautiful house i have read about in book i should like to have the wall hang full of picture and the room fill full of book and i should like to have great greenhouse full of all the rare and exquisite flower of the whole world i would like one house like the house you tell I of full of all the orchid and another full of only palm and fern i should like to wear always the costliest of silk very plain and never of bright color but heavy and soft and shine and lace that be like fleecy cloud when they be just scatter i should like to be perfectly beautiful and to have perfectly beautiful people around I but all this do not make I one bit less contented i care just as much for my few little old book and my two or three picture and we bed of sweet-william and pink they all give I such pleasure that i be just glad i be alive every minute -- what be you think of mr allen exclaim mercy break off and color scarlet as she become suddenly aware that she pastor be gaze at she with a scrutinize look she have never see on he face before of you future life mercy -- of you future life i be wonder what it will be and if the dear lord will carry you safe through all the temptation which the world must offer to one so sensitive as you be to all its beauty reply mr allen sadly mercy be displeased she be always intolerant of this class of reference to the lord she sense of honesty take alarm at they in a curt and half-petulant tone she answer -- i suppose minister have to say such thing mr allen but i wish you would not say they to I i do not think that the lord make the beautiful thing in this world for temptation and i believe he expect we to keep ourselves out of mischief and not throw the responsibility on to he oh mercy mercy do not say such thing they sound irreverent : they shock I exclaimed mr allen deeply pained by mercy 's tone and word i be very sorry to shock you mr allen reply mercy in a gentler tone pray forgive I i do not think however there be half as much real irreverence in say that the lord expect we to look out for ourselves and keep out of mischief as there be in teaching that he make a whole world full of people so weak and miserable that they could not look after themselves and have to be lift along all the time mr allen shake he head and sigh when mercy be in this frame of mind it be of no use to argue with she he return to the subject of she poetry if you will keep on reading and study mercy and will compel yourself to write and rewrite carefully there be no reason why you should not have a genuine success as a writer and put yourself in a position to earn money enough to buy a great many comfort and pleasure for yourself and you mother also he say at the mention of she mother mercy start and exclaim irrelevantly -- dear I i never once think of mother mr allen look as well he might mystify never once think of she what do you mean mercy why i mean i never once think about tell she about the money she would not like it why not i should think she would not only like the money but be very proud of you be able to earn it in such a way perhaps that might make a difference say mercy reflectively : it would seem quite different to she from take in sewing i suppose well i should think so laugh mr allen very different indeed but it be earn money work for money all the same continued mercy and you have not the least idea how mother feel about that father must have be full of queer notion she get it all from he but i can not see that there be any difference between a woman 's take money for what she can do and a man 's take money for what he can do i can do sewing and you can preach and of the two if people must go without one or the other they could do without sermon better than without clothes -- eh mr allen and mercy laugh mischievously but once when i tell mother i believe i would turn dressmaker for the town i know i could earn ever so much money besides do a philanthropy in get some decent gown into the community she be so horrified and unhappy at the bare idea that i never have forget it it be just so with ever so many woman here they would rather half-starve than do any thing to earn money for my part i think it be nonsense certainly mercy -- certainly it be reply mr allen anxious lest this new barrier should come between mercy and she work it be only a prejudice and you need never let you mother know any thing about it she be so old and feeble it would not be worth while to worry she mercy 's eye grow dark and stern as she fix they on mr allen i wonder i believe any thing you say mr allen how many thing do you keep back from I or state differently from what they be to save my feeling or to adapt the truth to my feebleness which be not like the feebleness of old age to be sure but be feebleness in comparison with you knowledge and strength i hate hate hate you theory about deceive people i shall certainly tell my mother if i keep on write and be pay for it she say impetuously very well of course if you think it wrong to leave she in ignorance about it you must tell she i myself see no reason for you mention the fact unless you choose to you be a mature and independent woman : she be old and childish the relation between you be really reverse you be the mother and she the child suppose she have become a writer when you be a little girl : would it have be she duty to tell you of it reply mr allen i do not care i shall tell she i never have keep the least thing from she yet and i do not believe i ever will say mercy you 'll never make I think it be right mr allen what a good jesuit you would have make would not you mr allen color oh child how unjust you be he exclaim but it must be all my stupid way of put thing one of these day you 'll see it all differently and she do firm as be she resolution to tell she mother every thing she could not find courage to tell she about the verse and the price pay for they again and again she have approach the subject and have be frighten back -- sometimes by she own unconquerable dislike to speaking of she poetry sometimes as in the instance above by a outbreak on she mother 's part of indignation at the bare suggestion of she earn money after that conversation mercy resolve within herself to postpone the day of the revelation until there should be more to tell and more to show if ever i have a hundred dollar i 'll tell she then she think so much money as that would make it seem better to she and i will have a good many verse by that time to read to she and so the secret grow bigger and heavier and yet mercy grow more use to carry it until she herself begin to doubt whether mr allen be not right after all and if it would not be a pity to trouble the feeble old heart with a needless perplexity and pain chapter v when stephen white see he new tenant ' first preparation for move into he house he be conscious of a strangely mingled feeling half irritation and half delight four week have pass since the unlucky evening on which he have take mercy to he mother 's room and he have not see she face again he have call at the hotel twice but have find only mr carr at home mercy have send a messenger with only a verbal message when she wish the key of the house she have a undefined feeling that she would not come into any relation with stephen white if it could be avoid she be heartily glad that she have not be in the house when he call and yet have she be in the habit of watch she own mental state she would have discover that stephen white be very much in she thought that she have come to wonder why she never meet he in she walk and what be still more significant to mistake other man for he at a distance this be one of the oddest trick of a brain preoccupy with the image of one human be one would think that it would make the eye clearer-sighted well-nigh infallible in the recognition of the loved form not at all wait for she lover to appear a woman will stand wearily watch at a window and think fifty time in sixty minute that she see he come tall man short man dark man light man man with spanish cloak and man in surtout -- all wear at a little distance a tantalizing likeness to the one whom they in no wise resemble after such a watch as this the very eye become disorder as after look at a bright color it see a spectrum of a totally different tint and when the long looked-for person appear he himself look unnatural at first and strange how well many woman know this curious fact in love 's optics i doubt if man ever watch long enough and longingly enough for a woman 's come to be so familiar with the phenomenon stephen white however have more than once during these four week quicken he pace to overtake some slender figure clothe in black never doubt that it be mercy philbrick until he come so near that he eye be force to tell he the truth it be truly a strange thing that he and mercy do not once meet during all these week it be no doubt a important element in the growth of they relation this interval of unacknowledged and combated curiosity about each other nature have a myriad of way of bring about she result seed-time and harvest be constant and the season all keep they routine but no two field have the same method or measure in the summer 's or the winter 's dealings heart lie fallow sometimes and seed of love swell very big in the ground all undisturbed and unsuspected when mercy and she mother drive up to the house stephen be stand at he mother 's window it be just at dusk here they be mother he say i think i will go out and meet they mr white lift she eye very slowly towards she son and speak in the measure syllable and unvibrating tone which always mark she utterance when she be displeased do you think you be under any obligation to do that suppose they have hire a house of you in some other part of the town : would you have feel call upon to pay they that attention i do not know what the usual duty of a landlord be you know best stephen color this be the worst of he mother 's many bad trait -- a instinctive unreasoning and unreasonable jealousy of any mark of attention or consideration show to any other person than herself even if it do not in the smallest way interfere with she comfort and this cold sarcastic manner of speaking be of all the form of she ill-nature the one he find most unbearable he make no reply but stand still at the window watch mercy 's light and literally joyful movement as she help she mother out of and down from the antiquated old carriage and carry parcel after parcel and lay they on the doorstep mr white continue in the same sarcastic tone -- pray go and help move all they baggage in stephen if it would give you any pleasure it be nothing to I i be sure if you choose to be all the time do all sort of thing for everybody i do not see the least occasion for it that be all it seem to I only common neighborliness and friendly courtesy mother reply stephen gently but you know you and i never agree upon such point we view be radically different and it be best not to discuss they view ejaculate mr white in a voice more like the low growl of some animal than like any sound possible to human organ i do not want to hear any thing about ` view ' about such a trifle why do not you go if you want to and be do with it it be too late now answer stephen in the same unruffled tone they have go in and the carriage be drive off well perhaps they would like to have you put down they carpet for they or open they box sneer mr white still with the same intolerable sarcastic manner i do not doubt they could find some use for you service o mother do not plead stephen please do not i do not wish to go near they or ever see they if it will make you any less happy do let we talk of something else who ever say a word about you not go near they i would like to know have i ever try to shut you up or keep you from go anywhere you want to answer I that will you no mother answer stephen you never have but i wish i could make you happier you do make I very happy steve say mr white mollify by the gentle answer you be a good boy and always be but it do vex I to see you always so ready to be at everybody 's beck and call and where it be a woman it naturally vex I more you would not want to run any risk of be misunderstand or make a woman care about you more than she ought stephen stare this be a new field have he mother go already thus far in she thought about mercy philbrick and be she only thought of the possibility of the young woman 's caring for he and not in the least of he caring for she and what would ever become of the peace of they daily life if this kind of jealousy -- the most exacting most insatiable jealousy in the world -- be to grow up in she heart stephen be dumb with despair the apparent confidential friendliness and assumption of a tacit understanding and agreement between he and she on the matter with which he mother have say you would not want to be misunderstand or make a woman care more for you than she ought strike terror to he very soul the apparent amicableness of she remark at the present moment do not in the least blind he to the enormous possibility of future misery involve in such a train of feeling and think on she part he foresee himself involve in a perfect network of espionage and cross-questioning and suspicion in comparison with which all he have hitherto bear at he mother 's hand would seem trivial all this flash through he mind in the brief instant that he hesitate before he reply in a off-hand tone which for once really blind he mother -- goodness mother whatever put such idea into you head of course i should never run any such risk as that a man can not possibly be too careful remark mr white sententiously the world 's full of gossip people and woman be very impressionable especially such high-strung woman as that young widow a man can not possibly be too careful read I the paper now stephen stephen be only too thankful to take refuge in and behind the newspaper a newspaper have so often be to he a shelter from he mother 's eye a protection from he mother 's tongue that whenever he see a storm or a siege of embarrassing question about to begin he look around for a newspaper as involuntarily as a soldier feel in he belt for he pistol he have more than once smile bitterly to himself at the consciousness of the flimsy bulwark but he find it invaluable sometimes it be true she impatient instinct make a keen thrust at the truth and she would say angrily -- put down that paper i want to see you face when i speak to you but he reply why mother i be read i be just go to read something aloud to you would usually disarm and divert she it be one of she great pleasure to have he read aloud to she it matter little what he read : she be equally interested in the paragraph of small local news and in the telegraphic summary of foreign affair a revolt in a distant european province of which she have never hear even the name be neither more nor less exciting to she than the run away of a heifer from the premise of a unknown townsman all through the evening the sound of move of furniture and brisk go up and down stair come through the partition and interrupted stephen 's thought as much as they do he mother 's they have live so long alone in the house in absolute quiet save for the semi-occasional stir of marty 's desultory house-cleaning that these sound be disturbing and not pleasant to hear stephen do not like they much better than he mother do and he give she great pleasure by remark as he bid she good-night -- i suppose those people next door will get settle in a day or two and then we can have a quiet evening again i should hope so reply he mother i should think that a caravan of camel need not have make so much noise it be astonishing to I that folk can not do thing without make a racket but i think some people feel themselves of more consequence when they be make a great noise the next morning as stephen be bid he mother good-morning he accidentally glance out of the window and see mercy walk slowly away from the house with a little basket on she arm she 'll go to market every morning he think to himself i shall see she then not the slightest glance of stephen 's eye ever escape he mother 's notice ah there go the lady she say i wonder if she be always go down town at this hour you will have to manage to go either earlier or later or else people will begin to talk about you stephen white have one rule of conduct : when he be uncertain what to do not to do any thing he break it in this instance and have reason to regret it long he speak impulsively on the instant and reveal to mother he dawn interest in mercy and plant then and there a ineffaceable germ of distrust in she mind now mother he say what be the use of you begin to set up this new worry mr philbrick be a widow and very sad and lonely she be the friend of my friend harley allen and i be in duty bind to show she some attention and help she if i can she be also a bright interesting person and i do not know so many such that i should turn my back on one under my own roof i have not so many social pleasure that i should give up this one just on account of a possible gossip about it silence would have be wiser mr white do not speak for a moment or two then she say in a slow and deliberate manner as if reflect on a problem -- you enjoy mr philbrick 's society then do you stephen how much have you see of she still injudicious and unlike himself stephen answer yes i think i shall enjoy it very much and i think you will enjoy it more than i shall for you may see great deal of she i have only see she once you know

consciousness that he have be blunder frightfully and he mind stand still for a moment as a man halt suddenly when he find himself in a totally wrong road to turn short about be not always the best way of get off a wrong road though it may be the quickest way stephen turn short about and exclaim with a forced laugh well mother i do not suppose it will make any great difference to you if she do not it be not a matter of any moment anyhow whether we see any thing of either of they or not i think she seem a bright cheery sort of body that be all good-by and he run out of the house mr white lay

now break off to admonish or chastise the bearer of the clock the eccentric old fellow use he cane as freely as if it have be a hand there be few boy in town who have not feel its weight and he more familiar acquaintance know the touch of it far better than they know the grip of he finger it save step he use to say though of step the old man seem any thing but chary as he be in the habit of take they perpetually without advance or retreat change from one foot to the other as uneasily as a goose do stephen white happen to be look out of the window when this unique procession of the clock pass

explain the strange scene to she mother mr carr be as usual knit she rise up suddenly confuse at the strange apparition before she and let she knitting fall on the floor the ball roll swiftly towards mr wheeler and tangle the yarn around he foot he jump up and down all the while brandish he cane and mutter pshaw pshaw damn knit always do hate the sight o not but kick out to the right and the left vigorously he soon snap the yarn and stand free mother mother call mercy from behind this be the gentleman i tell you of -- mr wheeler he have very kindly give we this beautiful clock almost exactly

step nearer to she and peer curiously into she hand the money in the portemonnaie be neatly fold and assorted each kind by itself in a separate compartment the old man nod and mutter to himself fine young woman fine young woman business business -- who teach you child to sort you money that way he suddenly ask why no one teach I reply mercy i find that it save time not to have to fumble all through a portemonnaie for a ten-cent piece it look neater too than to have it all in a crumpled mass she add smile and look up in the old man 's face i do not like disorder such a place as you store-room would drive I crazy the old man be not listen he be look about the room with a dissatisfied expression of countenance in a few moment he say abruptly -- 's this all the furniture you have

bewilderedly ejaculate oh no sir -- no sir there be not any call for you to give we any thin ' while they be speak the old man be rapidly go out of the house with quick short step like a child and tap he cane on the floor at every step in the doorway he halt a moment and without look back say well well let I know if you do want any thing have it be well 's not and he be go oh mercy he be crazy sure

she have watch the procession from she window and have hear the confused sound of talk and move of furniture in the house afterward marty also have supply some detail she have be surreptitiously overlook the whole affair i must say remark mr white that it look very queer where do she pick up old man wheeler who ever hear of he be see walk with a woman before even as a young man he never would have any thing to do with they and it be always a marvel how he get married i use to know he very well but mother urge stephen for all we know they may be relation or old friend of he you forget that we know literally nothing about these people so far from be queer it may be the most natural thing in the world that he should be help she fit up she house but in he heart stephen think as he mother do that it be very queer chapter vi the beautiful white new england winter have set in as far as the eye could reach nothing but white could be see the boundary line of stone wall and fence be go or be indicate only by raise and round line of the same soft white on one side of these be faintly pencilled dark shadow in the morning and in the afternoon but at high noon the field be as unbroken a white as ever arctic explorer saw and the road shine in the sun like white satin ribbon fling out in all direction the grove of maple and hickory and beech be bare they delicate gray tint spread in mass over the hillside like a transparent gray veil through which every outline of the hill be clear but soften the massive pine and spruce look almost black against the white of the snow and the whole landscape be at once shine and sombre a effect which be peculiar to the new england winter in the hill country and be always either very depressing or very stimulate to the soul dreamy and inert and phlegmatic people shiver and huddle see only the sombreness and find the winter one long imprisonment in the dark but to a joyous brisk sanguine soul the clear crisp cold air be like wine and the whiteness and sparkle and shine of the snow be like martial music a constant excitement and spell mercy 's soul thrill within she with new delight and impulse each day the winter have always oppress she before on the seashore winter mean raw cold a pale gray angry ocean fierce wind and scanty wet snow this brilliant frosty air so still and dry that it never seem cold this luxuriance of snow pile soft and high as if it mean shelter and warmth -- as indeed it do -- be very wonderful to mercy she would have like to be out of door all day long : it seem to she a fairer than summer-time she follow the partially broken trail of the wood-cutter far into the depths of the forest and find there on sunny day in sheltered spot where the foot of the man and horse and the runner of the heavy sledge have worn away the snow green moss and glossy fern and shine clump of the hepatica it be a startling sight on a December day when the snow be lie many inch deep to come suddenly on mercy walking in the middle of the road she hand fill with green fern and moss and vine there be three different species of ground-pine in these wood and hepatica and pyrolum and wintergreen and thicket of laurel what wealth for a lover of wild out-door thing each day mercy bear home new treasure until the house be almost as green and fragrant as a summer wood day after day mr white from she point of observation at she window watch the lithe young figure come down the road bear she sheaf of bough and vine sometimes on she shoulder as lightly and gracefully as a peasant girl of italy might bear she poise basket of grape gradually a deep wonder take possession of the lonely old woman 's soul whatever can she do with all that green stuff she think she be carry in enough to trim the ` piscopal church twice over at last she share she perplexity with marty marty say she one day have you ever see mr philbrick come into the house without somethin' green in she hand what do you suppose she be goin ' to do with it all lord know answer marty i have be a speckkerlatin ' about that very thing myself they can not be a brewin ' beer this time o ' year but i see she yesterday with she hand full o ' pyroly i wish you would make a errand in there marty say mr white and see if you can any way find out what it be all for she be carry in pretty near a grove of pine-tree i should say the willing marty go and return with a most surprising tale every room be wreathe with green vine there be evergreen tree in box the window-seat be fill with pot of green thing grow wave mass of fern hang down from bracket on the wall i jest stand like a dumb critter the minnit i get in say marty i do not know whether i wuz in the house or out in the wood the whole place smell o ' hemlock so a ' look so kind o ' sunny and shady all ter oncet -- i jest wish steve could see it he would go wild add the unconsciously injudicious marty mr white 's face darken instantly it must be very unwholesome to have room make so dark and damp she say i should think people might have more sense oh it wa 'n' t dark a mite interrupted marty eagerly there wuz a blazin ' fire on the hearth in the settin ' - room a ' the sun a-streamin ' into both the south winder it make shadder on the floor jest as it do in the wood i would jest ha ' like to set down there a spell and not do nothin ' but watch 'em at this moment a low knock at the door interrupt the conversation marty open the door and there stand mercy herself hold in she hand some wreath of laurel and pine and a large earthen dish with fern grow in it it be the day before christmas and mercy have be busy all day put up the christmas decoration in she room as she hang cross after cross and wreath after wreath she think of the poor lonely and peevish old woman she have see there week before and wonder if she would have any christmas evergreen to brighten she room i do not suppose a man would ever think of such thing think mercy i have a great mind to carry she in some i 'll never muster courage to go in there unless i go to carry she something and i may as well do it first as last perhaps she do not care any thing about thing from the wood but i think they may do she good without she know it besides i promise to go it be now ten day since stephen meeting mercy in the town one day have stop and say to she in a half-sad tone which have touch she -- do you really never mean to come again to see my mother i do assure you it would be a great kindness he tone convey a great deal -- he tone and he eye they say as plainly as word could have say -- i know that my mother treat you abominably i know she be very disagreeable but after all she be helpless and alone and if you could only once get she to like you and would come and see she now and then it would be a kindness to she and a great help to I and i do yearn to know you better and i never can unless you will begin the acquaintance by be on good term with my mother all this stephen 's voice and eye have say to mercy 's eye and heart while he lip pronounce the few commonplace word which be address to she ear all this mercy be revolve in she thought as she deftly and with almost a magic touch lay the soft moss in the earthen dish and plant they thick with fern and hepatica and partridge-berry vine and wintergreen but all she be conscious of say to herself be mr white ask I to go and it really be not civil not to do it and i may as well have it over with when mr white 's eye first fall on mercy in the doorway they rest on she with the same cold gaze which have so repel she on they first interview but no sooner do she see the dish of moss than she face light up and exclaim oh where do you get those partridge-berry vine she involuntarily stretch out she hand the ice be break mercy feel at home at once and at once conceive a true sentiment of pity for mr white which never wholly die out of she heart kneel on the floor by she bed she say eagerly -- i be so glad you like they mr white let I hold they down low where you can look at they some subtle spell must have link itself in mr white 's brain with the dainty red partridge berry she eye fill with tear as she lift the vine gently in she finger and look at they mercy watch she with great surprise but with the quick instinct of a poet 's temperament she think she have not see they very likely since she be a little girl do you use to like they when you be a child mr white she ask i use to pick they when i be young reply mr white dreamily -- when i be young : not when i be a child though may i have one of they to keep she ask presently still hold a end of one of the vine in she finger oh i bring they in for you for christmas exclaim mercy they be all for you mr white be genuinely astonished no one have ever do this kind of thing for she before stephen always give she on she birthday and on christmas a dutiful and somewhat appropriate gift though very sorely he be often puzzle to select a thing which should not jar either on he own taste or he mother 's sense of utility but a gift of this kind a simple little tribute to she suppose womanly love of the beautiful a thoughtful arrangement to give she something pleasant to look upon for a time no one have ever before make it give she a emotion of real gratitude such as she have seldom feel you be very kind indeed -- very she say with emphasis and in a gentler tone than mercy have before hear from she lip i shall have a great deal of comfort out of it then mercy set the dish on a small table and hang up the wreath in the window as she move about the room lightly now and then speak in she gay light-hearted voice mr white think to herself -- steve be right she be a wonderful cheery body and long after mercy have go she continue to think happily of the pleasant incident of the fresh bright face and the sweet voice for the time be she jealous distrust of the possible effect of these upon she son slumber when stephen enter he mother 's room that night he heart give a sudden bind at the sight of the green wreath and the dish of fern he see they on fhe first instant after open the door he know in the same instant that the hand of mercy philbrick must have place they there but also in that same brief instant come to he a involuntary impulse to pretend that he do not observe they to wait till he mother should have speak of they first that he might know whether she be pleased or not by the gift so infinitely small be the first beginning of the course of deceit into which tyranny always drive its victim it could not be call a deceit the simple forbearing to speak of a new object which one observe in a room no but the motive make it a sure seed of a deceit : for when mr white say why stephen you have not notice the green look in the window he exclamation of apparent surprise why how lovely where do they come from be a lie it do not seem so however to stephen it seem to he simply a politic suppression of a truth to save he mother 's feeling to avoid a possibility of a war of word mercy philbrick under the same circumstance would have reply -- oh yes i see they as soon as i come in i be wait for you to tell I about they and even then would have be tortured by she conscience because she do not say why she be wait while he mother be tell he of mercy 's call and of the report marty have bring back of the decoration of the room stephen stand with he face bent over the fern apparently absorb in study each leaf minutely then he walk to the window and examine the wreath he feel himself so suddenly gladden by these token of mercy 's presence and by he mother 's evident change of feeling towards she that he fear he face would betray too much pleasure he fear to speak lest he voice should do the same thing he be force to make a great effort to speak in a judiciously indifferent tone as he say -- indeed they be very pretty i never see moss so beautifully arrange and it be so thoughtful of she to bring they in for you for christmas eve i wish we have something to send in to they do not you well i have be think say he mother that we might ask they to come in and take dinner with we to-morrow marty 's make some capital mince-pie and be go to roast a turkey i do not believe they 'll be goin ' to have any thing better do you stephen stephen walk very suddenly to the fire and make a feint of rearrange it that he might turn he face entirely away from he mother 's sight he be almost dumb with astonishment a certain fear mingle with it what mean this sudden change do it portend good or evil it seem too sudden too inexplicable to be genuine stephen have yet to learn the magic power which mercy philbrick have to compel the liking even of people who do not choose to like she why yes mother he say that would be very nice it be a long time since we have anybody to christmas dinner well suppose you run in after tea and ask they reply mr white in the friendliest of tone yes i 'll go answer stephen feeling as if he be a man talk in a dream i have be mean to go in ever since they come after tea stephen sit count the minute till he should go to all appearance he be bury in he newspaper occasionally read a paragraph aloud to he mother he think it better that she should remind he of he intention to go that the call should be purely at she suggestion the patience and silence with which he sit wait for she to remember and speak of it be the very essence of deceit again -- twice in this one hour a act lie of which he dull conscience take no note or heed fine and impalpable as the mesh of the spider 's - web be the band and bond of a habit of concealment swift-growing too and in ever-widening circle like the same glittering net weave for death at last mr white say steve i think it be get near nine o'clock you would better go in next door before it be any later stephen pull out he watch by he own sensation he would have say that it must be midnight yes it be half-past eight i suppose i have better go now he say and bid he mother good-night he go out into the night with a sense of ecstasy of relief and joy he be bewilder at himself how this strong sentiment towards mercy philbrick have take possession of he he could not tell he walk up and down in the snowy path in front of the house for some minute question himself sound with a delicious dread the depths of this strange sea in which he suddenly find himself drift he go back to the day when harley allen 's letter first tell he of the two woman who might become he tenant he feel then a presentiment that a new element be to be introduce into he life a vague prophetic sense of some change at hand then come the first interview and he sudden disappointment which he now blush to recollect it seem to he as if some magician must have lay a spell upon he eye that he do not see even in that darkness how lovely a face mercy have do not feel even through all the embarrassment and strangeness the fascination of she personal presence then he dwell lingeringly on the picture which have never fade from he brain of he next sight of she as she sit on the old stone wall with the gay maple-leaf and blackberry-vine in she lap from that day to the present he have see she only a half dozen time and only for a chance greet as they have pass each other in the street but it seem to he that she have never be really absent from he so conscious be he of she all the time so absorb be he in these thought that a half-hour be go before he realize it and the village bell be ring for nine o ' clock when he knock on the door of the wing mr carr have roll up she knitting and be just on the point of go upstairs they little maid of all work have already go to bed when stephen 's loud knock startle they all gracious alive mercy what be that exclaimed mr carr all sort of formless terror spring upon she at once mercy herself be astonished and run hastily to open the door when she see stephen standing there she astonishment be increase and she look it so undisguisedly that he say -- i beg you pardon mr philbrick i know it be late but my mother send I in with a message pray come in mr white interrupted mercy it be not really late only we keep such absurdly early hour and be so quiet as we know nobody here that a knock at the door in the evening make we all jump pray come in and she throw open the door into the sitting-room where the lamp have already be put out and the light of a blaze hickory log make long flickering shadow on the crimson carpet in this dancing light the room look still more like a grove than it have to marty at high noon stephen 's eye fasten hungrily on the sight you room be almost too much to resist he say but i will not come in now i do not know it be so late my mother wish to know if you and you mother will not come in and eat a christmas dinner with we to-morrow we live in the plainest way and can not entertain in the ordinary acceptation of the term we only ask you to we ordinary home-dinner he add with a sudden sense of the incongruity between the atmosphere of refined elegance which pervade mercy 's simple little room and the expression which all he effort have never be able to banish from he mother 's parlor oh thank you mr white you be very good i think we should like to come very much mother and i be just say that it would be the first christmas dinner we ever eat alone but you must come in mr white -- i insist upon it reply mercy stretch out one hand towards he as if to draw he in stephen go on the threshold of the sitting-room he pause and stand silent for some minute mercy be relight the lamp oh mrs philbrick he exclaim will not you please not light the lamp this firelight on these evergreen be the loveliest thing i ever see too unconventional to think of any reason why she should not sit with stephen white alone by firelight in she own house mercy blow out the lamp she have light and draw a chair close up to the hearth sit down and clasp she hand in she lap look eagerly into stephen 's face and say as simply as a child -- i like firelight too a great deal better than any other light some evening we do not light the lamp at all mother can knit just as well without much light and i can think better mercy be sit in a chair so low that to look at stephen she have to lift she face it be the position in which she face be sweetest some line which be a shade too strong and positive when she face fully confront you disappear entirely when it be throw back and she eye be lift it be then as ingenuous and tender and trustful a face as if she have be but eight instead of eighteen stephen forget himself forget the fact that mercy be comparatively a stranger forget every thing except the one intense consciousness of this sweet woman-face look up into he bend towards she he say suddenly -- mr philbrick you face be the very loveliest face i have ever see in my life do not be angry with I oh do not he continue see the color deepen in mercy 's cheek and a stern expression gathering in she eye as she look steadily at he with unutterable surprise do not be angry with I i could not help say it but i do not say it as man generally say such thing i be not like other man : i have live alone all my life with my mother you need not mind my say you face be lovely any more than my say that the fern on the wall be lovely if stephen have know mercy from she childhood he could not have frame he word more wisely every fiber of she artistic nature recognize the possibility of a subtle truth in what he say and he calm dreamy tone and look heighten this impression moreover as stephen 's soul have be during all the past four week slowly grow into the feeling which make it inevitable that he should say these word on first look closely and intimately into mercy 's face so have she soul be slowly grow into the feeling which make it seem not really foreign or unnatural to she that he should say they she answer he with hesitate syllable quite unlike she usual fluent speech i think you must mean what you say mr white and you do not say it as other man have say it but will you please to remember not to say it again we can not be friend if you do never again mr philbrick he say -- he could almost have say mercy -- and look at she with a gaze of whose intentness he be hardly aware mercy feel a strange terror of this man a few minute ago a stranger now already ask at she hand she hardly know what and compelling she in spite of herself but she reply very quietly with a slight smile -- never mr white now talk of something else please you mother seem very much pleased with the fern i carry she to-day do she love the wood when she be well i do not know i never hear she say answer stephen absently still gaze into mercy 's face but you would have know surely if she have care for they say mercy laughing for she perceive that stephen have speak at random oh yes certainly -- certainly i should have know say stephen still with a preoccupy air and rise to go i thank you for let I come into this beautiful room with you i shall always think of you face frame in evergreen and with flicker firelight on it you be not go away be you mr white ask mercy mischievously oh no certainly not i never go away how could i go away why do you ask oh laugh mercy because you speak as if you never expect to see my face after to-night that be all stephen smile i be afraid i seem a very absent-minded person he say i do not mean that at all i hope to see you very often if i may good-night good-night mr white we shall be very glad to see you as often as you like to come you may be sure of that but you must come earlier or you will find we all asleep good-night stephen spend another half-hour pacing up and down in the snowy path in front of the house he do not wish to go in until he mother be asleep very well he know that it would be better that she do not see he face that night when he go in the house be dark and still as he pass he mother 's door she call steve all right mother they 'll come he reply and run swiftly up to he own room during this half-hour mercy have be sit in she low chair by the fire look steadily into the leap blaze and commune very sternly with she own heart on the subject of stephen white she pitiless honesty of nature be just as inexorable in its deal with she own soul as with other she never palter with nor evade a accusation of she consciousness at this moment she be indignantly admit to herself that she conduct and she feeling towards stephen be both deserving of condemnation but when she ask herself for they reason no answer come frame in word no explanation suggest itself only stephen 's face rise up before she vivid plead as he have look when he say never again mr philbrick and as she look again into the dark blue eye and hear the low tone over again she sink into a deeper and deeper reverie from which gradually all self-accusation all perplexity fade away leave behind they only a vague happiness a dreamy sense of joy if lover could look back on the first quickening of love in they soul how precious would be the memory but the unawakened heart never know the precise instant of the quicken it be wrap in a half-conscious wonder and anticipation and by the time the full revelation come the impress of the first moment have be wipe out by intenser experience how many lover have long to trace the sweet stream back to its very source to the hidden spring which no man saw but have lose themselves presently in the broad greenness undisturbed and fertile through which like a hidden stream through a emerald meadow the love have be flow undiscovered month after when mercy 's thought revert to this evening all she could recollect be that on the night of stephen 's first call she have be much puzzle by he manner and he word have think it very strange that he should seem to care-so much for she and perhaps still more strange that she herself find it not unplease that he do so stephen 's reminiscence be at once more distinct and more indistinct -- more distinct of he emotion more indistinct of the incident he could not recollect one word which have be say : only he own vivid consciousness of mercy 's beauty she face frame in evergreen with the firelight flickering on it as he have tell she he should always think of it christma morning come clear cold shine bright a slight thaw the day before have leave every bough and twig and pine-needle cover with a moisture that have freeze in the night into glittering crystal sheath which flash like million of prism in the sun the beauty of the scene be almost solemn the air be so frosty cold that even the noon sun do not melt these ice-sheath and under the flood of the full mid-day light the whole landscape seem one blaze of jewel when mercy and she mother enter mr white 's room half a hour before the dinner-hour they find she sit with the curtain draw because the light have hurt she eye oh mr white exclaimed mercy it be cruel you should not see this glorious spectacle if you have the window open the light would not hurt you eye it be the glare of it come through the glass let we wrap you up and draw you close to the window and open it wide so that you can see the color for a few minute it be just like fairy-land mr white look bewildered such a plan as this of get out-door air she have never think of will not it make the room too cold she say oh no no cry mercy and no matter if it do we can soon warm it up again please let I ask marty to come and hardly wait for permission she run to call marty wrap up in blanket mr white be then draw in she bed close to the open window and lay there with a look of almost perplexed delight on she face when stephen come in mercy stand behind she a fleecy white cloud throw over she head point out eagerly every point of beauty in the view a high bush of sweet-brier with long slender curve branch grow just in front of the window many of the cup-like seed-vessel still hang on the bough : they be all finely encrust with frost as the wind faintly stir the branch every frost-globule flash its full rainbow of color the long spray look like wand string with tiny fairy beaker inlay with pearl and diamond mercy spring to the window take one of these spray in she finger and slowly wave it up and down in the sunlight oh look at it against the blue sky she cry be not it enough to make one cry just to see it oh how can mother help love she thought stephen she be the sweetest woman that ever draw breath mr white seem indeed to have lose all she former distrust and antagonism she follow mercy 's movement with eye not much less eager and pleased than stephen 's it be like a great burst of sunlight into a dark place the come of this earnest joyous outspoken nature into the old woman 's narrow and monotonous and comparatively uncheered life she have never see a person of mercy 's temperament the clear decide incisive manner command she respect while the sunny gayety win she liking stephen have gentle placid sweetness and much love of the beautiful but he love of the beautiful be a indolent and one might almost say a-haughty demand in he nature mercy 's be a bound and delighted acceptance she be cheery : he be only placid she be full of delight he only of satisfaction in she joy be of the spirit spiritual keen as be she sens it be she soul which marshal they all in he though the soul 's force be not feeble the sens forerun they -- compel they sometimes conquer they it would have be impossible to put mercy in any circumstance in any situation out of which or in spite of which she would not find joy but in stephen circumstance and place might as easily destroy as create happiness he enjoyment be as far inferior to mercy 's in genuineness and enduringness as be the shallow lake to the quenchless spring the water of each may leap and sparkle alike to the eye in the sunshine but when drought have fall on the lake and the place that know it know it no more the spring be full free and glad as ever mrs white 's pleasure in mercy 's presence be short-lived long before the simple dinner be over she have relapse into she old forbid manner and into a silence which be more chilly than any word could have be the reason be manifest she read in every glance of stephen 's eye in every tone of he voice the depth and the warmth of he feeling towards mercy the jealous distrust which she have feel at first and which have sleep for a brief time under the spell of mercy 's kindliness towards herself spring into fiercer life than ever stephen and mercy in utter unconsciousness of the change which be gradually take place talk and laugh together in a evident gay delight which make matter worse every moment a short and surly reply from mr white to a innocent question of mr carr 's fall suddenly on mercy 's ear keenly alive to the smallest slight to she mother she turn quickly towards mr white and to she consternation meet the same steady pitiless aggressive look which she have see on she face in they first interview mercy 's first emotion be one of great indignation : she second be a quick flash of comprehension of the whole thing a great wave of rosy color sweep over she face and without know what she be do she look appealingly at stephen already there be between they so subtle a bond that each understand the other without word stephen know all that mercy think in that instant and a answering flush mount to he forehead mr white see both these flush and compress she lip still more closely in a grimmer silence than before poor unsuspecting mr carr keep on and on with she meaningless and childish remark and inquiry and mercy and stephen be both very grateful for they the dinner come to a untimely end and almost immediately mercy with a nervous and embarrassed air totally foreign to she say to she mother -- we must go home now i have letter to write mr carr be disappointed she have anticipate a long afternoon of chatty gossip with she neighbor but she see that mercy have some strong reason for hurry home and she acquiesce unhesitatingly mrs white do not urge they to remain to all mr white 's fault it must be confess that she add the virtue of absolute sincerity good-afternoon mr carr and good-afternoon mr philbrick fall from she lip in the same measure syllable and the same cold unhuman voice which have so startled mercy once before what a perfectly horrid old woman exclaim mercy as soon as they have cross the threshold of they own door i 'll never go near she again as long as i live why mercy carr exclaim she mother what do you mean i do not think so she get very tired before dinner be over i could see that poor thing she be drefful weak a ' it stan 's to reason she would be kind o ' snappish sometimes mercy open she lip to reply but change she mind and say nothing it be just as well for mother to keep on good term with she if she can she think maybe it 'll help divert a little of mr white 's temper from he poor fellow stephen have follow they to the door say little but at the last moment when mercy say good-by he have suddenly hold out he hand and clasp hers tightly have look at she sadly with a world of regret and appeal and affection and almost despair in the look what a life he must lead of it think mercy dear I i should go wild or else get very wicked i believe i would get very wicked i wonder he shut himself up so with she it be all nonsense : it only make she more and more selfish how mean how base of she to be so jealous of he talk with I if she be he wife it would be another thing but he do not belong to she body and soul if she _ be _ he mother if ever i know he well enough i 'll tell he so it be not manly in he to let she tyrannize over he and everybody else that come into the house i never see any human be that make one so afraid somehow she tone and look be enough to freeze you blood while mercy be bury in these indignant thought stephen and he mother only a few foot away separate from she only by a wall be have a fierce and angry talk no sooner have the door close upon mercy than mr white have say to stephen -- have you the slightest idea how much excitement you show in converse with mr philbrick i have never see you look or speak in this way the flush have not yet die away on stephen 's face at this attack it grow deeper still he make no reply mr white continue -- i wish you could see you face it be almost purple now it be enough to make the blood mount to any man 's face mother to be accuse so reply stephen with a spirit unusual for he i do not accuse you of any thing she retort i be only speak of what i observe you need not think you can deceive I about the least thing ever you face be a perfect tell-tale of you thought always poor stephen groan inwardly too well he know he inability to control he unfortunate face mother he exclaim with almost vehemence of tone mother do not carry this thing too far i do not in the least understand what you be drive at about mr philbrick nor why you show these capricious change of feeling towards she i think you have treat she so to-day that she will never darken you door again i never should if i be in she place very well i hope she never will if she presence be to produce such a effect on you it be enough to turn she head to see that she have such power over a man like you she be a very vain woman anyway -- vain of she power over people i think stephen could bear no more with a half-smothered ejaculation of o mother he leave the room and thus the old year go out and the new year come in for mercy philbrick and stephen white -- the old year in which they have be nothing and the new year in which they be to be every thing to each other chapter vii the next morning while stephen be dress he slowly review the event of the previous day and take several resolution if mr white could have have the faintest conception of what be pass in she son 's mind while he sit opposite to she at breakfast so unusually cheerful and talkative she would have be very unhappy but she too have have a season of reflection this morning and be much absorb in she own plan she heartily regret have show so much ill-feeling in regard to mercy and she have resolve to atone for it in some way if she could above all she have resolve if possible to banish from stephen 's mind the idea that she be jealous of mercy or hostile towards she she have common sense enough to see that to allow he to recognize this feeling on she part be to drive he at once into a course of manoeuvring and concealment she flatter herself that it be with a wholly natural and easy air that she begin she plan of operation by remark -- mr philbrick seem to be very fond of she mother do she not stephen yes very answer stephen indifferently mr carr be quite a old woman she must have be old when mr philbrick be bear i do not think mr philbrick can be more than twenty do you i be sure i do not know i never think anything about she age reply stephen still more indifferently i be no judge of woman 's age well i be sure she be not more than twenty if she be that say mr white and she really be a very pretty woman steve i 'll grant you that grant I that mother laugh stephen lightly i never say she be pretty do i the first time i see she i think she be uncommonly plain but afterwards i see that i have do she injustice i do not think however she would usually be think pretty mrs white be much gratify by he careless tone and manner so much so that she go farther than she have intend and say in a off-hand way i be real sorry steve you think i do not treat she well yesterday i do not mean to be rude but you know it always do vex I to see a woman 's head turn by a man 's take a little notice of she and i know very well stephy that woman like you it would not take much to make mr philbrick fancy you be in love with she stephen also be gratify by he mother 's apparent softening of mood and instinctively meet she more than half way reply -- i do not mean to say that you be rude to she mother only you show so plainly that you do not want they to stay perhaps she do not notice it only think you be tire it be not any great matter any way we have better keep on good term with they if they be to live under the same roof with we that be all oh yes reply mr white much better to be on neighborly term the old mother be a childish old thing though she would bear I to death if she come in often yes indeed she be a bear sure enough say stephen but she be so simple and so much like a child you can not help pity she they fence very well these two with they respective secret to keep but the man fence best he secret be the most momentous to shield from discovery when he shut the door have bid he mother good by he fairly breathe hard with the sense of have come out of a conflict one of the resolution he have take be that he would wait for mercy this morning on a street he know she must pass on she way to market he do not define to himself any motive for this act except the simple longing to see she face he have not say to himself what he would do or what word he would speak or even that he would speak at all but one look at she face he must have and he have though to himself distinctly in make this plan here be one way in which i can see she every day and my mother never know any thing about it when mr white see mercy set off for she usual morning walk a half hour or more after stephen have leave the house she think as she have often though before on similar occasion well she will not overtake stephen this time i dare say she plan to light-hearted mercy meantime be walk on with she own swift elastic tread and think warmly and shyly of the look with which stephen have bid she good-by the day before she be walk as be she habit with she eye cast down and do not observe that any one approach she until she suddenly hear stephen 's voice say good-morning mr philbrick it be the second time that he have surprise she in a reverie of which he himself be the subject this time the surprise be a joyful one and the quick flush of rosy color which spread over she cheek be a flush of gladness -- undisguised and honest gladness why mr white she exclaim i never think of see you i think you be always in you office at this time i wait to see you this morning reply stephen in a tone as simply honest as she own i want to speak to you mercy look up inquiringly but do not speak stephen smile oh not for any particular thing he say : only for the pleasure of it then mercy smile and the two look into each other 's face with a joy which neither attempt to disguise stephen take mercy 's basket from she arm and they walk along in silence not know that it be silence so full be it of sweet meaning to they in the simple fact that they be walk by each other 's side the few word they do speak be of the purposeless and irrelevant sort in which unacknowledged lover do so universally express themselves in they earlier moment alone together -- a sort of speech more like bird chirp than like ordinary language when they part at the door of stephen 's office he say -- i think you always come to the village about this time in the morning do you not yes always reply mercy then if you be willing i would like sometimes to walk with you say stephen i like it very much mr white answer mercy eagerly i use to walk a great deal with mr allen and i miss it sadly a jealous pang shoot through stephen 's heart he have be blind this be the reason harley allen have take such interest in find a home for mr philbrick and she mother he remember now that he have think at the time some of the expression in he friend 's letter argue a unusual interest in the young widow of course no man could know mercy without love she stephen be wretched but no trace of it show on the serene and smile face with which he bid mercy good-by and run up he office-stairs three step at a time all day mercy go about she affair with a new sense of impulse and cheer it be not a conscious anticipation of the morrow : she do not say to herself to-morrow morning i shall see he for half a hour love know the secret of true joy better than that love throw open wider door -- lift a great veil from a measureless vista : all the rest of life be transform into one shine distance every present moment be but a round in a ladder whose top disappear in the sky from which angel be perpetually descend to the dreamer below the next morning mercy see stephen leave the house even earlier than usual she first thought be one of blank disappointment why i think he mean to walk down with I she say to herself she second thought be a perplexed instinct of the truth : i wonder if he can be afraid to have he mother see he with I at this thought mercy 's face burn and she try to banish it but it would not be banish and by the time she morning duty be do and she have set out on she walk the matter have become quite clear in she mind i shall see he at the corner where he be yesterday she say but no stephen be there spite of herself mercy linger and look back she be grieve and she be vex why do he say he want to walk with I and then the very first morning not come she say as she walk slowly into the village it be a cloudy day and the cloud seem to harmonize with mercy 's mood she do she errand in a half-listless way and more than one of the tradespeople who have come to know she voice and smile wonder what have go wrong with the cheery young lady all the way home she look vainly for stephen at every cross-street she fancy she hear he step behind she she fancy she see he tall figure in the distance after she reach home and the expectation be over for that day she take herself angrily to task for she folly she remind herself that stephen have say sometimes not always and that nothing could have be more unlikely than that he should have join she the very next day nevertheless she be full of uneasy wonder how soon he would come again and when the next morning dawn clear and bright she first thought as she spring up be -- this be such a lovely day for a walk he will surely come to-day again she be disappointed stephen leave the house at a very early hour and walk briskly away without look back mercy force herself to go through she usual routine of morning work she be systematic almost to a fault in the arrangement of she time and any interference with she hour be usually a severe trial of she patience but to-day it be only by a great effort of she will that she refrain from set out earlier than usual for the village she walk rapidly until she approach the street where stephen have join she before then she slacken she pace and fix she eye on the street no person be to be see in it she walk slower and slower : she could not believe that he be not there then she begin to fear that she have come a little too early she turn to retrace she step but a sudden sense of shame withhold she and she turn back again almost immediately and continue she course towards the village walk very slowly and now and then halt and look back still no stephen street after street she pass : no stephen a sort of indignant grief swell up in mercy 's bosom she be indignant with herself with he with circumstance with everybody she be unreasoning and unreasonable she long so to see stephen 's face that she could not think clearly of any thing else and yet she be ashamed of this longing all these struggle emotion together be too much for she tear come into she eye then vexation at the tear make they come all the faster and for the first time in she life mercy philbrick pull she veil over she face to hide that she be cry almost in the very moment that she have do this she hear a quick step behind she and stephen 's voice calling -- oh mrs philbrick mrs philbrick do not walk so fast i be try to overtake you feel as guilty as a child detect in some forbid spot mercy stand still vainly hope she black veil be thick enough to hide she red eye vainly try to regain she composure enough to speak in she natural voice and smile she usual smile vainly indeed what crape could blind a lover 's eye or what force tone deceive a lover 's ear at he first sight of she face stephen start at the first sound of she voice he stand still and exclaim -- mr philbrick you have be cry there be no gainsay it even if mercy have not be too honest to make the attempt she look up mischievously at he and try to say lightly -- what then mr white do not you know all woman cry the voice be too tremulous stephen could not bear it forget that they be on a public street forget every thing but that mercy be cry he exclaim -- mercy what be it do let I help you can not i she do not even observe that he call she mercy it seem only natural without realize the full meaning of she word she say -- oh you have help I now and throw up she veil show a face where smile be already triumphant instinct tell stephen in the same second what she have mean and yet have not mean to say he drop she hand and say in a low voice -- mercy do you really have tear in you eye because i do not come bless you darling i do not dare to speak to you here oh pray come down this little by-street with I it be a narrow little lane behind the brick row into which stephen and mercy turn although it be so near the center of the town it have never be properly grade but have be leave like a wild bit of uneven field one side of it be wall by the brick row on the other side be only a few poverty-stricken house in which colored people live the snow lay pile in drift here all winter and in spring it be a almost impassable slough of mud there be now no trodden path only the track make by sleigh in the middle of the lane into this stride stephen in he excitement walk so fast that mercy could hardly keep up with he they be too much absorb in they own sensation and in each other to realize the oddity of they appearance flounder in the deep snow look eagerly in each other 's face and talk in a breathless and disjointed way mercy say stephen i have be walk up and down wait for you ever since i come out but a man whom i could not get away from stop I and i have to stand still helpless and see you walk by the street and i be afraid i could not overtake you oh be that it say mercy look up timidly in he face i feel sure you would be there this morning because -- because what say stephen gently because you say you would come sometimes and i know very well that that need not have mean this particular morning nor any particular morning and that be what vex I so that i should have be silly and set my heart on it that be what make I cry mr white i be so vex with myself stoutly assert mercy begin to feel braver and more like herself stephen look she full in the face without speak for a moment then -- may i call you mercy he say yes she reply may i say to you exactly what i be think yes she reply again a little more hesitatingly then mercy this be what i want to say to you say stephen earnestly there be no reason why you and i should try to deceive each other or ourselves i care very very much for you and you care very much for I we have come very close to each other and neither of we life can ever be the same again what be in store for we in all this we can not now see but it be certain we be very much to each other he speak more and more slowly and earnestly he eye fix on the distant horizon instead of on mercy 's face a deep sadness gradually gather on he countenance and he last word be speak more in the tone of one who feel a new exaltation of suffering than of one who feel the new ecstasy of a lover look down into mercy 's face with a tenderness which make she very heart thrill he say -- tell I mercy be it not so be we not very much to each other the strange reticence of he tone even more reticent than he word have affect mercy inexplicably : it be as if a chill wind have suddenly blow at noonday and make she shiver in spite of full sunlight she tone be almost as reticent and sad as he as she say without raise she eye -- i think it be true please look up at I mercy say stephen i want to feel sure that you be not sorry i care so much for you how could i be sorry exclaimed mercy lift she eye suddenly and look into stephen 's face with all the fulness of affection of she glowing nature i shall never be sorry bless you for say that dear say stephen solemnly -- bless you you should never be sorry a moment in you life if i could help it and now dear i must leave you he say look uneasily about i ought not to have bring you into this lane if people be to see we walk here they would think it strange and as they reach the entrance of the lane he manner suddenly become most ceremonious and extend he hand to assist she over a drift of snow he say in tone unnecessarily loud and formal good-morning mr philbrick i be glad to have help you through these drift good-morning and be go mercy stand still and look after he for a moment with a blank sense of bewilderment he sudden change of tone and manner smite she like a blow she comprehend in a flash the subterfuge in it and she soul recoil from it with incredulous pain why should he be afraid to have people see we together what do it mean what reason can he possibly have score of question like these crowd on she mind and hurt she sorely she conjecture even run so wide as to suggest the possibility of he be engage to another woman -- some old and mistaken promise by which he be hamper she direct and honest nature could conceive of nothing less than this which could explain he conduct restlessly she imagination fasten on this solution of the problem and tortured she in vain effort to decide what would be right under such circumstance the day be a long hard one for mercy the more she think conjectured remembered and anticipate the deeper grow she perplexity all the joy which she have at first feel in the consciousness that stephen love she die away in the strain of these conflict uncertainty : and it be a grave and almost stern look with which she meet he that night when with a eager bearing almost radiant he enter she door he feel the change at once and stretch both he hand towards she exclaim -- mercy my dear new sweet friend be you not well to-night oh yes thank you i be very well reply mercy in a tone very gentle but with a shade of reserve in it stephen 's face fall the expression of patient endurance which be habitual to it and which mercy know so well and find always so irresistibly appealing settle again on all he feature without speak he draw he chair close to the hearth and look steadfastly into the fire some minute pass in silence mercy feel the tear come again into she eye what be this intangible but inexorable thing which stand between this man 's soul and hers she could not doubt that he love she she know that she whole soul go out towards he with a love of which she have never before have even a conception it seem to she that the word he have speak and she have receive have already work a bond between they which nothing could hinder or harm why should they sit thus silent by each other 's side to-night when so few hour ago they be full of joy and gladness be it the future or the past which lay this seal on stephen 's lip mercy be not wont to be helpless or inert she see clearly act quickly always but here she be powerless because she be in the dark she could not even grope she way in this mystery at last stephen speak mercy he say perhaps you be already sorry that i care so much for you you say yesterday you never would be oh no indeed i be not say mercy i be very glad you care so much for I perhaps you have discover that you do not care so much for I as you yesterday think you do oh no no reply poor mercy in a low tone again stephen be silent for a long time then he say -- ever since i can remember i have long for a perfect and absorb friendship the peculiar relation of my life have prevent my even hope for it my father 's and my mother 's friend never could be my friend i have live the loneliest life a mortal man ever live until i see you mercy i have never even look on the face of a woman whom it seem possible to I that any man could love perhaps when i tell you that you can imagine what it be to I to look on the face of a woman whom it seem to I no man could help loving i suppose many man have love you mercy and many more man will i do not think any man have ever feel for you or ever will feel for you as i feel my love for you include every love the heart can know -- the love of father brother friend lover young as i be you seem to I like my child to be take care of and you seem like my sister to be trust and love and like my friend to be lean upon you see what my life be you see the burden which i must carry and which none can share do you think that the friendship i can give you can be worth what it would ask i feel withhold and ashamed as i speak to you i know how little i can do how little i can offer to fetter you by a word would be base and selfish but oh mercy till life bring you something better than my love let I love you if it be only till to-morrow mercy listen to each syllable stephen speak as one in a wilderness fly for he life from pursuer would listen to every sound which could give the faintest indication which way safety might lie if she have listen dispassionately to such word speak to any other woman she native honesty of soul would have repel they as unfair but every instinct of she nature except the one tender instinct of loving be disarm and blind -- disarm by she affection for stephen and blind by she profound sympathy for he suffer she fix she eye on he as intently as if she would read the very thought of he heart do you understand I mercy he say i think i do she reply in a whisper if you do not now you will as time go on he continue i have not a thought i be unwilling for you to know but there be thought which it would be wrong for I to put into word i stand where i stand and no mortal can help I except you you can help I infinitely already the joy of see you hear you know that you be near make all my life seem change it be not very much for you to give I mercy after all out of the illimitable riches of you beauty you brightness you spirit you strength -- just a few word just a few smile just a little love -- for the few day or it may be year that fate set we by each other 's side and you too need a friend mercy you duty to another have bring you where you be singularly alone for the time be just as my duty to another have place I where i must be singularly alone be it not a strange chance which have thus bring we together i do not believe any thing be chance murmured mercy i must have be send here for something i believe you be dear say stephen send here for my salvation i be think last night that no matter if my life should end without my ever know what other man call happiness if i must live lonely and alone to the end i should still have the memory of you -- of you face of you hand and the voice in which you say you care for I o mercy mercy you have not the least conception of what you be to I and stephen stretch out both he arm to she with unspeakable love in the gesture so swiftly that he have not the least warning of she intention mercy throw herself into they and lay she head on he shoulder sob shame fill she soul and burn in she cheek when stephen lift she as he would a child and kiss she forehead gently place she again in she chair and say -- my darling i can not let you do that i will never ask from you any thing that you can by any possibility come to regret at some future time i ought perhaps to be unselfish enough not to ask from you any thing at all i do not mean to but i could not help it and it be too late now yes it be too late now say mercy -- too late now and she bury she face in she hand mercy exclaim stephen in a voice of anguish you will break my heart : you will make I wish myself dead if you show such suffering as this i think that you too could find joy and perhaps help in my love as i could in yours if it be to give you pain and not happiness it be better for you never to see I again i will never voluntarily look on you face after to-night if you wish it -- if you would be happier so oh no no cry mercy then overwhelm with the sudden realization of the pain she be give to a man whom she so love that at that moment she would have die to shield he from pain she lift she face shake back the hair from she forehead and look bravely into he eye repeat -- no no i be very selfish to feel like this i do understand you i understand it all and i will help you and comfort you all i can and i do love you very dearly she add in a lower voice with a tone of such incomparable sweetness that it take almost superhuman control on stephen 's part to refrain from clasp she to he heart but he do not betray the impulse even by a gesture look at she with a expression of great thankfulness he say -- i believe that peace will come to we mercy i believe i can do something to make you happy to know that i love you as i do will be a great deal to you i think he pause yes answer mercy a great deal he go on -- and to know that you be perpetually help and cheer I will be still more to you i think we shall know some joy mercy which joyous lover never know happy people do not need each other as sad people do o mercy do try and remember all the time that you be the one bright thing in my life -- in my whole life i will stephen i will say mercy resolutely she whole face glowing with the new purpose form in she heart it be marvellous how clear the relation between herself and stephen begin to seem to she it be rather by she magnetic consciousness of all that he be think and feel than by the literal acceptance of any thing or all thing which he say she seem to herself to be already one with he in all he trial burden perplexity in he renunciation in he self-sacrifice in he loyalty of reticence in he humility of uncomplainingness when she bid he good-night she face be not only serene : it be serene with a certain exaltation add as the face of one who have enter into a great steadfastness of joy stephen wonder greatly at this transition from the excitement and grief she have at first show he have yet to learn what wellspring of strength lie in the poetic temperament as he stand linger on the threshold find it almost impossible to turn away while the sweet face hold he by the honest gaze of the loving eye he say there will be many time dear when thing will have to be very hard when i shall not be able to do as you would like to have I when you may even be pained by my conduct shall you trust I through it all i shall trust you till the day of my death say mercy impetuously one can not take trust back it be not a gift : it be a necessity stephen smile -- a smile of sorrow rather than gladness but if you think I other than you have believe he say i could never think you other than you be reply mercy proudly it be not that i ` believe ' you i know you i shall trust you to the day of my death perhaps nothing could illustrate better the difference between mercy philbrick 's nature and stephen white 's between she love for he and he for she than the fact that after this conversation she lay awake far into the early hour of the morning living over every word that he have speak look resolutely and even joyously into the strange future which be open before she and scanning with loving intentness every chance that it could possibly hold for she ministration to he he on the other hand lay he head on he pillow with a sense of dreamy happiness and sink at once into sleep murmuring -- the darling how she do love I she shall never regret it -- never we can have a great deal of happiness together as it be and if the time ever should come here he thought halt and refuse to be clothe in explicit phrase never once have stephen white permit himself to think in word even in he most secret meditation when my mother die i shall be free he fine fastidiousness would shrink from it as from the particular kind of brutality and bad taste involve in a murder if the whole truth could have be know of stephen 's feeling about all crime and sin it would have be find to be far more a matter of taste than of principle of instinct than of conviction surely never in this world do love link together two soul more diametrically opposite than mercy philbrick 's and stephen white 's it need no long study or especial insight into character to know which of the two would receive the more and suffer the less in the abnormal and unfortunate relation on which they have enter but no presentiment warn mercy of what lay before she she be like a traveller go into a country whose language he have never hear and whose currency he do not understand however eloquent he may be in he own land he be dumb and helpless here and of the fortune with which he be rich at home he be rob at every turn by false exchange which impose on he ignorance poor mercy vaguely she feel that life be cruel to stephen and to she but she accept its cruelty to she as a inevitable part of she oneness with he whatever he have to bear she must bear too especially if he be help by she share the burden and she heart glow with happiness recall the expression with which he have say -- remember mercy you be the one bright thing in my life she understand or think she understand precisely the position in which he be place very possibly he have even promise he mother she say to herself even promise she he would never be marry it would be just like she to exact such a promise from he and never think any thing of it and even if he have not it be all the same he know very well no human being could live in the house with she to say nothing of he be so terribly poor poor dear stephen to think of we little rent be more than half he income oh if there be only some way in which i could contrive to give he money without he know it if any one have say to mercy at this time : it be not honorable in this man know or feel that he could not marry you to tell you of he love and to allow you to show he yours for he he be put you in a false position and may be blight you whole life mercy would have repel the accusation most indignantly she would have say : he have never ask I for any such love as that he tell I most honestly in the very begin just how it be he always say he would never fetter I by a word and once when i forget myself for a moment and throw myself into he very arm he only kiss my forehead as if i be he sister and put I away from he almost with a reproof no indeed he be the very soul of honor it be i who choose to love he with all my soul and all my strength why should not a woman devote she life to a man without be he wife if she choose and if he so need she it be just as sacred and just as holy a bond as the other and holier too for it be more unselfish if he can give up the happiness of be a husband and father for the sake of he duty to he mother can not i give up the happiness of be a wife and mother for the sake of my affection and duty towards he it look very plain to mercy in these first day it look right and it seem very full of joy she life seem now round and complete it have a ruling motive without which no life be satisfy and that motive be the highest motive know to the heart -- the desire to make another human be perfectly happy all hindrance and difficulty all drawback and sacrifice seem less than nothing to she when she see stephen she be happy because she see he and when she do not see he she be happy because she have see he and would soon see he again past present and future all melt into one great harmonious whole under the spell of love in a nature like mercy 's they be like so many room in one great house and in one or the other the loved be be always to be find always at home can never depart could one be lonely for a moment in such a house mercy 's perpetual and abide joy at time terrify stephen it be a thing so foreign to he own nature that it seem to he hardly natural calm acquiescence he could understand -- serene endurance : he himself never chafe at the barrier little or great which keep he from mercy but there be many day when he sense of deprivation make he sad subdue and quiet when in these mood he come into mercy 's presence and find she radiant buoyant mirthful even he wonder and sometimes he question he strive to find out the secret of she joy there seem to he no legitimate reason for it why to see that i make you glad stephen she would say be not that enough or even when i can not make you glad just to love you be enough mercy how do you ever come to love I he say once sting by a sense of he own unworthiness how do you know you love I after all how do i know i love you she exclaim can any one ever tell that i wonder i know it by this : that every thing in the whole world even down to the smallest grass-blade seem to I different because you be alive she say these word with a passionate vehemence and tear in she eye then change in a second to a mischievous laughing mood she say -- yes : you make all that odds to I but let we not talk about loving each other stephen that be the way child do with they flower-seed -- keep pull they up to see how they grow that night mercy give stephen this sonnet -- the first word she have write out of the great wellspring of she love : -- how be it why ask dear one i think i can not tell more than i know how cloud so sudden lift from mountain or how snowflake float and drift or spring leave hill one secret and one spell all true thing have no sunlight ever fall with sound to bid flower open still and swift come sweetest thing on earth so come true gift of love and so we know that it be well sure token also like the cloud the snow and silent flow of the mountain-spring the new gift of true loving always bring in clearer light in purer path we go : new current of deep joy in common thing we find these be the token dear we know chapter viii as the month go on mercy begin to make friend one person after another observe she bright face ask who she be and come to seek she out who be that girl with fair hair and blue eye who whenever you meet she in the street always look as if she have just hear some good news be ask one day it be a noteworthy thing that this description be so instantly recognize by the person inquire of that he have no hesitancy in reply -- oh that be a young widow from cape cod a mr philbrick she come last winter with she mother who be a invalid they live in the old jacob house with the whites among the friend whom mercy thus meet be a man who be destine to exercise almost as powerful a influence as stephen white over she life this be parson dorrance parson dorrance have in he youth be settle as a congregationalist minister but he love of literature and of science be even stronger than he love of preach the gospel and after a very few year he accept a position as professor in a small college in a town only four mile distant from the village in which mercy have come to live this be twenty-five year ago parson dorrance be now fifty-five year old for a quarter of a century he name have be the pride and he hand have be the stay of the college it have have president of renown and professor of brilliant attainment but parson dorrance hold a position more enviable than all few life of such simple and steadfast heroism have ever be live few life have ever so stamped the mark of they influence on a community in the second year of he ministry mr dorrance have marry a very beautiful and brilliant woman probably no two young people ever begin married life with a fairer future before they than these mr dorrance be as exceptionally clever and culture a person as she husband and she add to these rare endowment a personal beauty which be say by all who know she in she girlhood to have be marvellous but as be so often the case among new england woman of culture the body have pay the cost of the mind 's estate and after the birth of she first child she sink at once into a hopeless invalidism -- a invalidism all the more difficult to bear and to be bear with that it take the shape of distressing nervous malady which no medical skill could alleviate the brilliant mind become almost a wreck and yet retain a preternatural restlessness and activity many regard she condition as insanity and believe that mr dorrance err in not give she up to the care of those make mental disorder a specialty but he love and patience be untire when she mental depression and suffering reach such a stage that she could not safely see a human face but he he shut himself up with she in she darkened room till the crisis have pass there be time when she could not close she eye in sleep unless he sit by she side hold she hand in he and gently stroke it he spend week of night by she bedside in this way at any hour of the day a summons might come from she and whatever might be he engagement it be instantly lay aside -- lay aside too with cheerfulness and alacrity at time all he college duty would be suspend on she account and he own specialty of scientific research in which he be begin to win recognition even from the great master of science in europe be very early lay aside for ever it must have be a great pang to he -- this relinquishment of fame and of what be dearer to the true scientific man than all fame the joy of discovery but no man ever hear from he lip a allusion to the sacrifice the great telescope with which he have so many night sweep the heaven still stand in he garden observatory but it be little used except for recreation and for the pleasure and instruction of he boy yet no one would have dream from the hearty joy with which he use it for these purpose that it have ever be to he the token and the instrument of the great hope of he heart the resolute cheer of this man 's life pervade the whole atmosphere of he house spite of the perpetual shadow of the invalid 's darkened room spite of the inevitable circumscribing of narrow means parson dorrance 's cottage be the pleasantest house in the place be the house to which all the townspeople take stranger with pride and be the house which stranger never forget there be always a new book or a new print or a new flower or a new thought which the untiring mind have just be shape and there be always and ever the welcome and the sympathy of a man who love man because he love god and who love god with a affection as personal in its nature as the affection with which he love a man year after year class of young man go away from this college have for four year look on the light of this goodness say i not well that few life have ever be live which have leave such a stamp on a community no man could be so gross that he would utterly fail to feel its purity no man so stupid that he could not see its grandeur of self-sacrifice and to soul of a fiber fine enough to be touch to the quick by its exaltation it was-a kindling fire for ever in the twenty-seventh year of she married life and near the end of the twenty-fifth year of she confinement to she room mr dorrance die for a few month after she death she husband seem like a man suddenly strike blind in the midst of familiar object he seem to be grope he way to have lose all plan of daily life so tremendous be the change involve in the withdrawal of this perpetual burden just as he be begin to recover the natural tone of he mind and to resume he old habit of work he son sicken and die the young man have never be strong : he have inherit he mother 's delicacy of constitution and she nervous excitability as well but he have rare quality of mind and give great promise as a scholar the news of he death be a blow to every heart that love he father this will kill the parson be say by sorrowing voice far and near on the contrary it seem to be the very thing which clear the atmosphere of he whole life and renew he vigor and energy he rise up from the terrible grief more majestic than ever as some grand old tree whose young shoot and branch have be tear away by fierce storm seem to lift its head higher than before and to tower in its strip loneliness above all its fellow all the loving fatherhood of he nature be spend now on the young people of he town and by young people i mean all between the age of four and twenty there be hardly a baby that do not know parson dorrance and stretch out its arm to he there be hardly a young man or a young woman who do not go to he with trouble or perplexity you meet he one day draw a huge sledful of child on the snow another day walk in the center of a group of young man and maiden teach they as he walk they all love he as a comrade and reverence he as a teacher they want he at they picnic and whenever he preach they flock to hear he it be a significant thing that he title of professor be never hear from first to last he be always call parson dorrance and there be few sunday on which he do not preach at home or abroad it be one of the form of he active benevolence if a poor minister break down and need rest parson dorrance preach for he for one month or for three as the case require if a little church be without a pastor and could not find one or be in debt and could not afford to hire one it send to ask parson dorrance to supply the pulpit and he always go finally not content with these ordinary and established channel for preach the gospel he seek out for himself a new one about eight mile from the village there be a negro settlement know as the cedar it be a wild place great outcropping ledge of granite with big boulder topple over and pile upon each other and all knot together by the gnarled root of ancient cedar-tree make the place seem like ruin of old fortress there be cave of great depth some of they with two entrance in which in the time of the fugitive slave law many a poor hunt creature have have safe refuge besides the cedar-tree there be sugar-maple and white birch and the beautiful rock fern grow all over the ledge in high wave tuft almost as luxuriantly as if they be in the tropics so that the spot wild and fierce as it be have great beauty many of the fugitive slave have build themselves hut here : some live in the cave a few poor and vicious whites have join they intermarried with they and from these have gradually grow up a band of as mongrel miserable vagabond as be often see they be the terror of the neighborhood except for they supreme laziness they would have be as dangerous as brigand for they be utter outlaw no man care for they and they care for no man parson dorrance 's heart yearn over these poor ishmaelite and he determine to see if they be irreclaimable the first thing that he townsman know of he plan be he purchase of several acre of land near the cedar he buy it very cheap because land in that vicinity be hold to be worthless for purpose of cultivation unless the crop be guard night and day they be surreptitiously harvest by forager from the cedar then it be find out that parson dorrance be in the habit of drive over often to look at he new property gradually the child become use to he presence and would steal out and talk to he then he carry over a small microscope and let they look through it at insect and before long there might have be see on a Sunday afternoon a group of twenty or thirty of the outcast gather round the parson while he talk to they as he have talk to the child then he tell they that if they would help he would build a little house on he ground and put some picture and map in it for they and come over every Sunday and talk to they and they set to work with a will very many be the shrug and smile over parson dorrance 's chapel at ` the cedar ' but the chapel be build and the parson preach in it to sometimes seventy-five of the outlaw the next astonishment of the parson 's friend be on find he lay out part of he new land in a nursery of valuable young fruit-tree and flowering shrub then they say -- really the parson be mad do he think he have convert all those negro so that they will not steal fruit and when they meet the parson they laugh at he come come parson they say this be carry the thing a little too far to trust a fruit orchard over there by ` the cedar ' parson dorrance 's eye twinkle i know the boy better than you do he reply they will not steal a single pear i would like to wager you something on that say the friend well i could not exactly take such a wager answer the parson because you see i know the boy will not steal the fruit somewhat vex at the obstinacy of the parson 's faith he friend exclaim i would like to know how you can know that beforehand parson dorrance love a joke neighbor say he i wish i could in honor have let you wager I on that i have give the orchard to the boy the fruit 's all they own this be the man whom mercy philbrick meet early in she first summer at penfield she have hear he preach twice and have be so greatly impress by he word and by he face that she long very much to know he she have talk with stephen about he but have find that stephen do not sympathize at all in she enthusiasm the people over at danby be all crazy about he i think say stephen he be a very good man no doubt and do no end of thing for the college boy that none of the other professor do but i think he be quixotic and sentimental and all this stuff about those nigger at the cedar be moonshine they would pick he very pocket i daresay any day and he would never suspect they i know that lot too well the lord himself could not convert they oh stephen i think you be wrong reply mercy parson dorrance be not sentimental i be sure he sermon be clear and logical and terse -- not a waste word in they and he mouth and chin be as strong as a old roman 's stephen look earnestly at mercy mercy say he i wonder if you would love I better if i be a preacher and could preach clear logical and terse sermon mercy be impatient already the self-centring of stephen 's mind he instant revert from most train of think to they possible bearing on she love for he have begin to irritate she it be so foreign to she own unconscious free-souled acceptance and trust stephen she exclaim i wish you would not say such thing besides seem to imply a sort of distrust of my love for you they be illogical and you know there be nothing i hate like bad logic stephen make no reply the slightest approach to a disagreement between mercy and himself give he great pain and a sense of terror and he take refuge instantly behind he usual shield of silence this also be foreign to mercy 's habit and impulse when any thing go wrong it be mercy 's way to speak out honestly to have the matter set in all its light until it could reach its true one she hate mystery she hate reticence she hate every thing which fall short of full and frank understanding of each other oh stephen she use to say often it be bad enough for we to be force into keep thing back from the world do not let we keep any thing back from each other poor mercy the day be begin to be hard for she she face often wear a look of perplexed thought which be very new to it still she never waver for a moment in she devotion to stephen if she have stand acknowledge before all the world as he wife she could not have be any more single-hearted and unquestioning in she loyalty it be at a picnic in which the young people of both danby and penfield have join that mercy meet parson dorrance no such gathering be ever think complete without the parson 's presence again and again one might hear it say in the preliminary discussion : but we must find out first what day parson dorrance can go it will not be any fun without he until mercy come stephen white have rarely be ask to the pleasuring of the young people in penfield there be a general impression that he do not care for thing of that sort he manner be wrongly interpret however : it be really only the constraint bear of the feeling that he be out of he place or that nobody want he he watch in silent wonder the cordial way in which it seem to he that mercy talk with everybody and make everybody feel happy oh mercy how can you he would exclaim : i feel so dumb even while i be talk the fastest why so do i stephen say mercy i be often rack my brain to think what i shall say next half the people i meet be profoundly uninteresting to I and half of the other half paralyze I at first sight and i feel like such a hypocrite all the time but oh what a pleasure it be to talk with the other quarter yes sigh stephen you look so happy and absorb sometimes that it make I feel as if you have forget I altogether silly boy laugh mercy do you want I to prove to you by a long face that i be remember you -- darling she add at those very time when you see I seem so absorb and happy in company i be most likely think about the last time you look into my face or the next time you will and for once stephen be satisfy the picnic at which mercy meet parson dorrance have take place on a mountain some six mile south-west of penfield this mountain be the western extremity of the range of which i have before speak and at its base run the river which make the meadow-land of penfield and danby so beautiful nowhere in america be there a lovelier picture than these meadow-land see from the top of this mountain which overhang they the mountain be only about twenty-five hundred foot high : therefore one lose no smallest shade of color in the view even the difference between the green of broom-corn and clover record itself to the eye look down from the mountain-top as far as one can see to northward the valley stretch in band and belt and space of varied tint of green the river wind through it in double curve and look from the height like a line of silver lay in loop on a enamelled surface to the east and the west rise the river terrace higher and higher become at last lofty and abrupt hill at the horizon when parson dorrance be introduce to mercy she be alone on a spur of rock which jut out from the mountain-side and overhang the valley she have wander away from the gay and laughing company and be sit alone absorb and almost sadden by the unutterable beauty of the landscape below stephen have miss she but have not yet dare to go in search of she he impose on himself a very rigid law in public and never permit himself to do or say or even look any thing which could suggest to other the intimacy of they relation mercy sometimes feel this so keenly that she reproach he i can not see why you should think it necessary to avoid I so she would say you treat I exactly as if i be only a common acquaintance that be exactly what i wish to have every one believe you to be mercy stephen would reply with emphasis that be the only safe course once let people begin to associate we name together and there be no limit to the thing they would say we can not be too careful that be one thing you must let I be the judge of dear you can not understand it as i do so long as i be without the right or the power to protect you my first duty be to shield you from any or all gossip link we name together mercy feel the justice of this and yet to she there seem also a sort of injustice involve in it she feel sting often and wound in spite of all reasoning with herself that she have no cause to do so that stephen be but do right so inevitable and inextricable be pain and dilemma when once we enter on the path of concealment parson dorrance be introduce to mercy by mr hunter a young married woman who be fast become she most intimate friend mr hunter 's father have be settle as the minister of a church in penfield in the same year that parson dorrance have take he professorship in danby and the two man have be close friend from that day till the day of mr adam 's death little lizzy adam have be parson dorrance 's pet when she lay in she cradle he have baptize she and when she come to woman 's estate he have perform the ceremony which give she in marriage to luke hunter the most promising young lawyer in the county she have always call parson dorrance she uncle and she house in penfield be he second home it have be mr hunter 's wish for a long time that he should see and know she new friend mercy but mercy be very shy of see the man for whom she feel such reverence and have steadily refuse to meet he it be therefore with a certain air of triumphant satisfaction that mr hunter lead parson dorrance to the rock where mercy be sit and exclaim -- there uncle dorrance here she be parson dorrance do not wait for any farther introduction but hold out both he hand to mercy he say in a deep mellow voice and with a tone which have a benediction in it -- i be very glad to see you mr philbrick my child lizzy here have be tell I about you for a long time you know i be the same as a father to she so you can not escape I if you be go to be she friend mercy look up half-shamefacedly and half-archly and reply -- it be not that i want to escape you but i want you to escape I she perceive that the parson have be tell of she refusal to meet he then they all sit down again on the jut rock and mercy lean forward with she hand clasp on she knee fix she eye on parson dorrance 's face and drink in every word that he say he have a rare faculty of speak with the greatest simplicity both of language and manner it be impossible not to feel at ease in he presence it be impossible not to tell he all that he ask before you know it you be speak to he of you own feeling taste the incident of you life you plan and purpose as if he be a species of father confessor he question you so gently yet with such a air of right he listen so observantly and sympathetically he do not treat mercy philbrick as a stranger for mr hunter have tell he already all she know of she friend 's life and have show he several of mercy 's poem which have surprise he much by they beauty and still more by they condensation of thought they seem to he almost more masculine than feminine and he have unconsciously anticipate that in see mercy he would see a woman of masculine type he be greatly astonish he could not associate this slight fair girl with a child 's honesty and appeal in she eye with the forceful word he have read from she pen he pursue he conversation with she eagerly seek to discover the secret of she style to trace back the poetry from its flower to its root it be a astonishment to mercy to find herself talk about she own verse with this stranger whom she so reverenced but she feel at once as if she have sit at he foot all she life and have no right to withhold any thing from she master i suppose mr philbrick you have read the earlier english poet a great deal have you not he say i infer so from the style of some of you poem oh no exclaimed mercy in honest vehemence i have read hardly any thing mr dorrance i know herbert a little but most of the old english poet i have never even see i have never live where there be any book till now you love wordsworth i hope he say inquiringly mercy turn very red and answer in a tone of desperation i have try to mr allen say i must but i can not i do not care any thing about he and she look at the parson with the air of a culprit who have confess a terrible misdemeanor ah he reply you have not then reach the point in the journey at which one see he it be only a question of time : one come of a sudden into the presence of wordsworth as a traveller find some day upon a well-known road a grand cathedral into which he turn aside and worship and wonder how it happen that he never before saw it you will tell I some day that this have happen to you it be only a question of time just as parson dorrance pronounce the last word they be echo by a laugh party who have come in search of he yes yes only a question of time they say and it be we time now parson you must come with we no monopoly of the parson allow mr hunter and they carry he off join hand around he and sing the old college song gaudeamus igitur stephen who have join eagerly in the proposal to go in search of the parson remain behind and make a sign to mercy to stay with he sit down by she side he say gloomily -- what be you talk about when we come up you face look as if you be listen to music about wordsworth say mercy parson dorrance say such a beautiful thing about he it be like music like far off music and she repeat it to stephen i wonder if i shall ever reach that cathedral she add well i have never reach it say stephen and i be a good deal older than you i think two third of wordsworth 's poetry be imbecile absolutely imbecile mercy be too much under the spell of parson dorrance 's recent word to sympathize in this but she have already learn to avoid dissent from stephen 's opinion and she make no reply they be sit on the edge of a great fissure in the mountain some terrible convulsion must have shake the huge mass to its center to have make such a rift at the bottom run a stream look from this height like little more than a silver thread shrub and low flowering thing be wave all the way down the side of the abyss as if nature have do she best to fill up the ugly wound many foot below they on a project rock wave one little white blossom so fragile it seem as if each sway motion in the breeze must sever it from the stem oh see the dainty brave little thing exclaim mercy it look as if it be almost alone in space i will get it for you say stephen and before mercy could speak to restrain he he be far down the precipice with a low ejaculation of terror mercy close she eye she would not look on stephen in such peril she do not move nor open she eye until he stand by she side exclaim why mercy my darling do not look so there be no danger and he lay the little plant in she hand she look at it in silence for a moment and then say -- oh stephen to risk you life for such a thing as that the sight of it will always make I shudder then i will throw it away say stephen endeavor to take it from she hand but she hold it only the tighter and whisper -- no oh what a moment what a moment i shall keep this flower as long as i live and she do -- keep it wrap in a paper on which be write the follow line : -- a moment lightly as a insect float in the sunny summer air wave one tiny snow-white blossom from a hidden crevice grow dainty fragile-leaved and fair where great rock pile up like mountain well-nigh to the shine heaven rise precipitous and bare with a pent-up river rush foam as at boiling heat wildly madly at they foot hardly with a ripple stir the sweet silence by its tone fall a woman 's whisper lightly -- oh the dainty dauntless blossom what deep secret of its own keep it joyous and light-hearted o'er this dreadful chasm swing unsupported and alone with no help or cheer from kindred oh the dainty dauntless thing bravest creature of the spring then the woman see she lover for one instant see he face down the precipice slow sinking look up at she and send through the shimmering sunny space look of love and subtle triumph as he pluck the tiny blossom in its airy dizzy place -- pluck it smile as if danger be not danger to the hand of true lover in love 's land in she hand she face she bury at she heart the blood grow chill in that one brief moment crowd the whole anguish of a lifetime make she every pulse stand still like one dead she sit and wait listen to the stirless silence age in a second till lightly leap come she lover and still smile lay the sweet snow-white blossom at she foot o my love my love she shudder bloom that flower by death 's own spell be thy life so little moment life and love for that one blossom wert thou ready thus to sell o my precious love for ever i shall keep this fade token of the hour which come to tell in such voice i scarce dare listen how thy life to I have grow so much dearer than my own on they way home from the picnic late in the afternoon they come at the base of the mountain to a beautiful spot where two little stream meet the two stream be in sight for a long distance : one shine in a green meadow the other leap and foam down a gorge in the mountain-side a little inn which be famous for its beer stand on the meadow space bound by these two stream and the picnic party halt before its door while the white foamy glass be clink and toss mercy run down the narrow strip of land at the end of which the stream meet a little thicket of willow grow there stand on the very edge of the shore mercy break off a willow wand and dip it to right in the meadow stream to the leave in the stream from the gorge then she bring it back wet and drip it have drink of two water she cry hold it up oh you ought to see how wonderful it be to watch they come together at that point for a little while you can trace the mountain water by itself in the other : then it be all lose and they pour on together this picture also she set in a frame of verse one day and give it to stephen on a green point of sunny land hem in by mountain stern and high i stand alone as dreamer stand and watch two stream that hurry by one run to east and one to south they leap and sparkle in the sun they foam like racer at the mouth and laugh as if the race be win just on the point of sunny land a low bush stand like umpire fair wave green banner in its hand as if the victory to declare ah victory win but not by race ah victory by a sweeter name to blend for ever in embrace unconscious swift the two stream come one instant separate side by side the shine current seem to pour then sweep in one tumultuous tide swifter and stronger than before o stream to south o stream to east which bear the other who shall see which one be most which one be least in this surrender victory to that green point of sunny land hem in by mountain stern and high i call my love and hand in hand we watch the stream that hurry by chapter ix it be a turning-point in mercy 's life when she meet parson dorrance here at last be a man who have strength enough to influence she culture enough to teach she and the firm moral rectitude which she nature so inexorably demand during the first few week of they acquaintance mercy be conscious of a insatiable desire to be in he presence : it be a intellectual and a moral thirst nothing could be farther remove from the absorb consciousness which passionate love feel of its object than be this sentiment she feel toward parson dorrance if he have be a be from another planet it could not have be more so in fact it be very much as if another planet have be add to she world -- a planet which throw brilliant light into every dark corner of this one she question he eagerly she old doubt and perplexity which mr allen 's narrower mind have be unable to comprehend or to help be now set at rest and clear up by a spiritual vision far keener than she own she mind be feed and train by a intellect so much stronger than she own that it compel she assent and she allegiance she come to he almost as a maiden in the ancient day of greece would have go to the oracle of the holiest shrine parson dorrance in he turn be as much impress by mercy but he be never able to see in she simply the pupil the questioner to he she be also a warm and glowing personality a young and beautiful woman parson dorrance 's hair be white as snow but he eye be as keen and dark as in he youth he step as firm and he pulse as quick long before he dream of such a thing he might have know if he have take counsel of he heart that mercy be become to he the one woman in the world there be always this peculiarity in mercy 's influence upon all who come to love she she be so unique and incalculable a person that she make all other woman seem by comparison with she monotonous and wearying intimacy with she have a subtle flavor to it by which other flavor be dull the very impersonality of she enthusiasm and interest she capacity for look on a person for the time be merely as a representative or mouth-piece so to speak of thought of idea of narration be one of she strongest charm by reason of this the world be often unjust to she in its comment on she manner on she relation with man the world more than once accuse she uncharitably of flirt but the man with whom she have friendship know better and now and then a woman have the insight to be just to she to see that she be quite capable of regard a human be as objectively as she would a flower or a mountain or a star the blending of this trait in she with the strong capacity she have for loving individual be singular not more so perhaps than the blending of the poetic temperament with the active energetic and practical side of she nature it be not long before she name begin to be mention in connection with parson dorrance 's by the busy tongue which be always in motion in small village it be not long moreover before a thought and a hope in which both these name be ally creep into the heart of lizzy hunter oh she think if only uncle dorrance would marry mercy how happy i should be she would be every one would be no suspicion of the relation in which mercy stand to stephen white have ever cross mr hunter 's mind she have never know stephen until recently and he manner towards she have be from the outset so chill and constrain by he unconscious jealousy of every new friend mercy make that she have set he down in she own mind as a dull and surly man and rarely thought of he and as one of poor mercy 's many device for keep up with she conscience a semblance of honesty in the matter of stephen be the entire omission of all reference to he in she conversation nothing occur to remind she friend of he parson dorrance indeed have say to she one day -- you never speak of mr white mercy be he a agreeable and kind landlord mercy start look bewilderedly in the parson 's face and repeat he word mechanically -- landlord then recollect herself she exclaim oh yes we do pay rent to he but it be pay for the whole year in advance and i have forget all about it parson dorrance have have occasion to distrust stephen 's father and he distrust the son advance advance he exclaim why do you do that child that be all wrong oh no say mercy eagerly i have the money and it make no difference to I and mr allen tell I that mr white be in a great strait for money so i be very glad to give it to he such a mother be a terrible burden on a young man and mercy continue talk about mr white until she have effectually lead the conversation away from stephen when lizzy hunter first begin to recognize the possibility of she uncle dorrance 's loving she dear friend mercy she find it very hard to refrain in she talk with mercy from all allusion to such a possibility but she know instinctively that any such suggestion would terrify mercy and make she withdraw herself altogether so she contented herself with talk to she in what she think be safe generalization on the subject of marriage lizzy hunter be one of the clinging caressing caressable woman who nestle into man 's affection as kitten nestle into warm corner and from very much the same motive -- love of warmth and shelter and of be fondle to all these instinct in lizzy however be add a really beautiful motherliness and great loyalty of affection if the world hold more such woman there would be more happy child and contented husband mercy say she one afternoon earnestly mercy it make I perfectly wretched to have you say so confidently that you will never be marry you do not know what you be talk about : you do not realize in the least what it be for a woman to live alone and homeless to the end of she day i never need be homeless dear say mercy i shall always have a home even after mother be no longer with I and i be afraid that be very near she have fail so much this past summer but even if i be all alone i should still keep my home a house be not a home mercy exclaim lizzy of course you can always be comfortable so far as a roof and food go towards comfort and that be a great way my lizzy interrupted mercy laughing -- a great way no husband could possibly take the place of they could he now mercy do not talk so you know very well what i mean reply lizzy it be so forlorn for a woman not to have anybody need she not to have anybody to love she more than he love all the rest of the world and not to have anybody to love herself oh mercy i do not see how any woman live without it the tear come into mercy 's eye there be depths of lovingness in she soul of which a woman like lizzy could not even dream but she speak in a resolute tone and she speak very honestly too when she say -- well i do not see how any woman can help live very well without it if it do not come to she i do not see how any human being -- man or woman single or marry -- can help be glad to be alive under any condition it be such a glorious thing to have a soul and a body and to get the most out of they just from the purely selfish point of view it seem to I a delight to live and when you look at it from a higher point and think how much each human being can do for those around he why then it be sublime look at parson dorrance lizzy just think of the sum of the happiness that man have create in this world he be not lonely he could not think of such a thing yes he be too -- i know he be say lizzy impetuously the very way he take up my child and hug they and kiss they show that he long for a home and child of he own i think not reply mercy it be all part of the perpetual overflow of he benevolence he can not pass by a living creature if it be only a dog without a desire to give it a moment 's happiness of happiness for himself he never think because he be on a plane above happiness -- a plane of perpetual joy mercy hesitate pause and then go on i do not mean to be irreverent but i could never think of he need personal ministration to he own happiness any more than i could think of god 's need they i think he be on a plane as absolutely above such need as god be not so high above but as absolutely how be you so sure god be above it say lizzy timidly i can not conceive of god 's be happy if nobody love he mercy be startle by these word from lizzy who rarely question and never philosophize she open she lip to reply with a hasty reiteration of she first sentiment but the word die even before they be speak arrest by she sudden consciousness of the possibility of a grand truth underlie lizzy 's instinct if that be so do it not lie out far beyond every fact in life include and control they all as the great truth of gravitation outly and embrace the physical universe do god so need as well as so love the world that he give he only begotten son for it be this what it mean to be one with god then if the great illimitable heart of god thus yearn for the love of he creature the greater the heart of a human be the more must he yearn for a fulness of love a completion of the cycle of bond and joy for which he be make from these simple word of a loving woman 's heart have flash a great light into mercy 's comprehension of god she be silent for some moment then she say solemnly -- that be a great thought you have then lizzy i never see it in that light before i shall never forget it perhaps you be right about the parson too i wonder if there be any thing he do long for if there be i would die to give it to he -- i know that it be very near lizzy 's lip to say if you would live to give it to he it would be more to the purpose perhaps but she wisely forbore and they part in silence mercy absorb in thinking of this new view of god 's relation to man and lizzy hope that mercy be think of parson dorrance 's need of a greater happiness than he possess as mercy 's circle of friend widen and she interest enlarged and deepen she relation to stephen become at once easier and harder : easier because she no longer spend so many hour alone in perplexed meditation as to the possible wrong in it harder because he be frequently unreasonable jealous of the pleasure that he see she find in other jealous of the pleasure she give to other -- jealous in short of every thing in which he be not she center mercy be very patient with he she love he unutterably she never forget for a instant the quiet heroism with which he bear he hard life as the month have go on she have gradually establish a certain kindly familiarity with he mother go in often to see she take she little gift of flower or fruit and tell she of all little incident which might amuse she she seem to herself in this way to be do a little towards share stephen 's burden and she also feel a certain bond to the woman who be stephen 's mother ought to have be hers by adoption the more she see of mr white 's tyrannical exacting nature the more she yearn over stephen she first feeling of impatience with he of resentment at the seeming want of manliness in such subjection have long ago worn away she see that there be but two course for he -- either to leave the house or to buy a semblance of peace at any cost flesh and blood can not stand up agin mis ' white say marty one day in a irrepressible confidence to mercy a ' the queerest thing be that she 'll never let go on you there be not nothin ' to hender my goin ' away any day a ' there hai not be for twenty year but she sez i be to stay till she die a ' i do not make no doubt i shall it be mister stephen i stay for though after all more 'n ' t be she i do not believe the lord ever make such a man mercy 's cheek would burn after such a talk as this and she would lavish upon stephen every device of love and cheer which she could invent to atone to he by hour if possible for the misery of day but the hour be few and far between stephen 's day be fill with work and he evening be he mother 's only after she sleep do he have freedom just as soon as it be safe for he to leave the house he fly to mercy but oh how meager and pitiful do the few moment seem hardly long enough to realize that i be with you my darling he often say but then it be every day stephen -- think of that mercy would reply bent always on make all thing easier instead of harder for he even the concealment which be at time well-nigh insupportable to she she never complain of now she have accept it and after accept it i have no right to reproach he with it : it would be base she think nevertheless it be slowly wear away the very foundation of she peace the morning walk have long be give up mercy have be resolute about this when she find stephen insist upon go in by-way and lane lest some one should see they who might mention it to he mother when he tell she that she must not speak of it to she own mother she say firmly -- this must end stephen how hard it be to I to give it up you know very well it be like the sunrise to my day always these moment with you but i will not multiply concealment it make I guilty and ashamed all the time do not urge I to any such thing for i be not sure that too much of it would not kill my love for you let we be patient chance will do a good deal for we but i will not plan to meet clandestinely whenever you can come to we house that be different it distress I to have you do that and never tell of it but that be yours and not mine if any thing can be yours and not mine she add sadly stephen have not hear the last word kill you love for I mercy he exclaim be you really afraid of that no not kill my love for you reply mercy i think nothing could do that but kill all my joy in my love for you and that would be as terrible to you as if the love be kill you would not know the difference and i should not be able to make you see it it be a strange thing that with all stephen 's jealousy of mercy 's enlarged and enlarge life of she ever-widening circle of friend he have no especial jealousy of parson dorrance the parson be mercy 's only frequent visitor and stephen know very well that he have become she teacher and she guide that she refer every question to he decision and be guide implicitly by he taste and wish in she writing and in she study but when stephen be a boy in college parson dorranee have seem to he a old man and he now seem venerable stephen could not have be freer from a lover 's jealousy of he if he have be mercy 's own father perhaps if he instinct have be truer it might have quicken mercy 's she be equally unaware of the real nature of the parson 's regard for she he do for she the same thing he do for lizzy whom he call he child he come to see she no oftener speak to she no more affectionately : she believe that she and lizzy be sister together in he fatherly heart when she be undeceived the shock be very great : it be twofold -- a shock to she sense of loyalty to stephen a shock to she tender love for parson dorrance it be true as she have say to lizzy that she would have die to give he a pleasure and yet she be force to inflict on he the hardest of all pain every circumstance attend it make it harder make it seem to mercy always in after life as she look back upon it needlessly hard -- cruelly malignantly hard it be in the early autumn the bright color which have thrill mercy with such surprise and pleasure on she first arrival in penfield be glowing again on the tree it seem to she brighter than before purple aster and golden-rod wave on the roadside and in the field and blue gentian for which penfield be famous be bloom everywhere parson dorrance come one day to take lizzy and mercy over to he parish as he call the cedar they have often be with he there and mercy have be for a long time secretly hope that he would ask she to help he in teach the negro the day be one of those radiant and crystalline day peculiar to the new england autumn on such day joy become inevitable even to inert and lifeless nature : to enthusiastic and spontaneous one the exhilaration of the air and the sun be as intoxicate as wine mercy be in one of she most mirthful mood she frolic with the negro child and deck they little woolly head with wreath of golden-rod till they look as fantastic as dance monkey she gather great sheaf of fern and blue gentian and aster until the parson implore she to leave a few just for the poor sun to shine on the path wind among the cedar be in some place thick-set with white eupatorium which be now in full feathery flower some of they so old that as you brush past they a cloud of the fine thread-like petal fly in all direction mercy gather branch after branch of these but throw they away impatiently as the flower fall off leave the stem bare oh dear she exclaim nature want some seed i suppose but i want flower what become of the poor flower any way it live such a short while all its beauty and grace sacrifice to the making of a seed for next year that be the way with every thing in life dear child say parson dorrance the thing that shall be be the thing for which all the power of nature be at work we you and lizzy and i will drop off we stem presently -- i a good deal the first for you and lizzy have the blessing of youth but i be old you be not old you be the youngest person i know exclaimed mercy impetuously you will never be old mr dorrance not if you should live to be as old as -- as old as the wander jew mercy 's eye be fix intently on the parson 's face but she do not note the deep flush which rise to he very hair as she say these word she be think only of the glorious soul and see only its shine through the outer tabernacle lizzy hunter however see the flush and know what it mean and she heart give a leap of joy now he can see that mercy never think of he as a old man and never would she think to herself and while she hand be idly play with she flower and moss and she face look as innocent and care-free as a baby 's she brain be weave plot of the most complicated device for hasten on the future which begin to look to she so assure for these two they be sit on a mossy mound in the shadow of great cedar-tree the field around the cedar be fill with low mound like velvet cushion : some of they be merely a mat of moss over great rock some of they be soft yield mass of moss low cornel blueberry-bushes wintergreen blackberry-vine and sweet fern dainty fragrant crowded oval lovelier than any florist could ever make white and green in the spring when the cornel be in flower scarlet and green and blue in the autumn when the cornel and the blueberry be in fruit mercy be sit on a mound which be thick-grown with the shine wintergreen she pick a stem which have a cluster of red berry on it and below the berry one tiny pink blossom as she hold it up the blossom fall leave a tiny satin disk behind it on its stem she take the bell and try to fit it again on its place then she turn it over and over hold it up to the light and look through it it make I sad she say : i wish i know if the flower know any thing about the fruit if it be work to that end all the while and so be content to pass on and make room it would seem all right but i do not want to pass on and make room i do so like to be here parson dorrance look from one woman 's face to the other both young both lovely : lizzy 's so full of placid content unquestioning affection and acceptance mercy 's so full of mysterious earnestness far-seeing vision and interpretation what a lot lie before that gifted creature he say to himself if life should go wrong with she if only i might dare to take she fate into my hand i do not believe any one else can do for she what i could if i be only younger and the parson sigh that night he stay in penfield at lizzy 's house the next morning on he way to danby he stop to see mercy for a moment when he enter she door he have no knowledge of what lay before he he have not yet say to himself have not yet dare to say to himself that he would ask mercy to be he wife he know that the thought of it be more and more present with he grow sweeter and sweeter yet he have never cease resist it say that it be impossible that be he have never cease say so in word but he heart have cease resist long ago only that traitor which we call judgment have be keep up a false show of resolute opinion just to lure the beguiled heart farther and farther on in a mistaken security but love be like the plant it have its appointed day for flower and for the fall of the flower the vague sweetness of the early hour and day together the bright happiness of the first close intimacy and interchange -- these reach they destine moment to pass on and make room for the harvest bless be the life in which all these sweet early petal float off gently and in season for the perfect setting of the holy fruit on this morning when parson dorrance enter mercy 's room it be already decorate as if for a festival every bloom thing she have bring from the cedar the day before have take its own place in the room and look as at home as it have look in the field one of mercy 's great gift be the gift of create in room a certain look which it be hard to define the phrase vitalize individuality perhaps would come as near describe it as be possible for it be not merely that the room look unlike other room every article in they seem to stand in the place where it must need stand by virtue of its use and its quality every thing have a certain sort of dramatic fitness without in the least trenching on the theatrical she effect be always produce with simple thing in simple way but they result in a impression of abundance and luxury as parson dorrance glance around at all the wild-wood beauty and the wild-wood fragrance steal upon he sens a great master wave of love for the woman whose hand have plan it all sweep over he he recall mercy 's face the day before when she have say -- you be the youngest person i know and as she cross the threshold of the door at that instant he go swiftly towards she with outstretched hand and a look on he face which if she have see she could not have fail to interpret aright but she be use to the outstretched hand she always put both she own in they as simply as a child and she be bring to she teacher now a little poem of which she thought be full she do not look fully in he face therefore for it be still a hard thing for she to show he she verse hold out the paper she say shyly -- it have to get itself say or sing you know -- that thought that haunt I so yesterday at ` the cedar ' i daresay it be very bad poetry though parson dorrance unfold the paper and read the follow poem : -- where my snowy eupatorium have drop its silver thread of petal in the night no sound tell I its blossoming have stop its seed-film flutter silent ghostly white : no answer stir the shine air as i ask where beneath the glossy leaf of wintergreen dead lily-bell lie low and in they place a rounded disk of pearly pink be see which tell not of the lily 's fragrant grace : no answer stir the shine air as i ask where this morning 's sunrise do not show to I seed-film or fruit of my sweet yesterday like fall flower to realm i can not see its moment float silently away : no answer stir the shine air as i ask where as he read the last verse he face altered mercy be watch he i think you would not like the last verse she say eagerly but indeed it do not mean doubt i know very well no day die but we can not see the especial good of each single day by itself that be all i mean parson dorrance come closer to mercy : they be both standing he lay one hand on she ' head and say -- child it be a ` sweet yesterday ' be not it oh yes say mercy still absorb in the thought of the poem the day be as sweet as the flower but all day be heavenly sweet out of door with you and lizzy she continue lift one hand and lay it caressingly on the hand which be stroke she hair o mercy mercy could not i make all day sweet for you come to I darling and let I try come from parson dorrance 's lip in hurry and husky tone mercy look at he for one second in undisguised terror and bewilderment then she utter a sharp cry as of one who have suddenly get a wound and bury she face in she hand sink into a chair and begin to cry convulsively parson dorrance walk up and down the room he dare not speak he be not quite sure what mercy 's weep mean so hard be it for a single moment to wrench a great hope out of a man 's heart but as she continue sob he understand unselfish to the core he first thought be even now alas now she will never let I do any thing more for she oh how shall i win she back to trust I as a father again mercy he say mercy do not answer nor look up mercy he repeat in a firmer tone mercy my child look up at I docile from she long habit and from she great love mercy look up with the tear streaming as soon as she see parson dorrance 's face she burst again into more violent cry and sob out incoherently -- oh i never know it it would not be right hush dear hush say the parson in a voice of tender authority i have do wrong and you must forgive I and forget it you be not in the least to blame it be i who ought to have know that you could never think of I as any thing but a father oh it be not that sob mercy vehemently -- it be not that at all but it would not be right parson dorrance would not have be human if mercy 's vehement it be not that -- it be not that have not fall on he ear gratefully and make hope stir in he heart again but she evident grief be too great for the hope to last a moment you may not know why it seem so wrong to you dear child he continue but that be the real reason there could be no other he pause mercy shudder and open she lip to speak again but the word refuse to be utter this be the supreme moment of pain if she could but have say -- i love some one else long before i see you i be not my own if it have not be for that i should have love you i know i should even in she tumult of suffer she be distinctly conscious of all this the word i could have love he i know i could i can not bear to have he think it be because he be so old go clamoring in she heart plead to be say but she dare not say they tenderly and patiently parson dorrance endeavor to soothe she to convince she that he word spring from a hasty impulse which he would be able wholly to put aside and forget the one thing that he long now to do the only reparation that he feel be leave for he to make to she be to enable she if possible to look on he as she have do before but mercy herself make this more difficult suddenly wipe she tear she look very steadily into he face and say slowly -- it be not of the least use mr dorrance for you to say this sort of thing to I you can not deceive I i know exactly how you love I and how you always will love I and oh i wish i be dead it can never be any thing but pain to you to see I -- never and she weep more bitterly than before you do not know I mercy reply the parson speaking as slowly as she have do all my life have be one long sacrifice of my own chief preference it be not hard for I to do it mercy clasp she hand tighter and groan -- oh i know it i know it and i say you be on a plane above all thought of personal happiness the parson look bewildered but go on -- you do love I my child very dearly do you not oh you know i do cried mercy you know i do yes i know you do or i should not have say that you know i be all alone in the world do you not yes moan mercy very well now remember that you and lizzy be my two child and that the greatest happiness i can have the greatest help in my loneliness be the love of my two daughter you will not refuse I this help will you you will let I be just as i be before will you not mercy do not answer will you try mercy he say in a tone almost of the old affectionate authority and mercy again moan rather than say -- yes then parson dorrance kiss she hair where he hand have lie a few moment before and say -- now i must go good-by my child but mercy do not look up and he close the door gently leave she sit there bow and heart-stricken in the little room so gay with the bright flower she have gather on she sweet yesterday chapter x the winter set in before its time and with almost unprecedented severity early in the last week in November the whole country be white with snow the stream be freeze solid and the cold be intense week after week the mercury range from zero to ten fifteen and even twenty below and fierce wind howl night and day it be a terrible winter for old people they drop on all side like leaf sweep off of tree in autumn gale it be startling to read the death record in the newspaper so large a proportion of they be of man and woman past sixty mr carr have be steadily grow feebler all summer but the change have seem to mercy to be more mental than physical and she have be in a measure blind to she mother 's real condition with the increase of childishness and loss of memory have come a increase gentleness and love of quiet which partially disguise the loss of strength she would sit in she chair from morning till night look out of the window or watch the movement of those around she with a expression of perfect placidity on she face when she be speak to she smile but do not often speak the smile be meaningless and yet infinitely pathetic : it be a infant 's smile on a aged face the infant 's heart and infant 's brain have come back all the weariness all the perplexity all the sorrow have go from life have slip away from memory this state have come on so gradually that even mercy hardly realize the extent of it the silent smile or the gentle simple ejaculation with which she mother habitually reply mean more to she than they do to other she do not comprehend how little they really prove a full consciousness on she mother 's part and she be unutterably shock when on go to she bedside one morning she find she unable to move and evidently without clear recognition of any one 's face the end have begin the paralysis which have so slowly be put the mind to rest have prostrate the body also it be now only a question of length of siege of how much vital force the system have hoard up lie helpless in bed the poor old woman be as placid and gentle as before she never murmur nor even stir impatiently she seem unconscious of any weariness the only emotion she show be when mercy leave the room then she would cry silently till mercy return she eye follow mercy constantly as a little babe 's follow its mother and she would not take a mouthful of food from any other hand it be the very hardest form of illness for mercy to bear a violent and distressing disease tax she strength she ingenuity to they utmost every moment would have be comparatively nothing to she to sit day after day night after night gaze into the senseless yet appealing eye of this motionless be who have literally no need except a helpless animal 's need of food and drink who cling to she with the irrational clinging of a infant yet would never know even she name again -- it be worse than the chaining of life to death as the day wear on a species of terror take possession of mercy it seem to she that this silent watchful motionless creature never have be she mother -- never have be a human be like other human being as the old face grow more and more haggard and the old hand more and more skinny and claw-like and the trace of intellect and think more and more fade away from the feature the horror deepen until mercy fear that she own brain must be give way she revolt from the very think of herself for have such a feeling towards she mother every instinct of loyalty in she deeply loyal nature rise up indignantly against she she would reiterate to herself the word mother mother mother as she sit gaze with a species of horror-stricken fascination into the meaningless face but she could not shake off the feel she nerve be fast give way under the strain and no one could help she if she leave the room or the house the consciousness that the helpless creature be lie silently weep for lack of the sight of she pursued she like a presence she see the piteous old face on the pillow and the slow tear trickle down the cheek just as distinctly as if she be sit by the bed on the whole the torture of staying be less than the torture of be away and for week together she do not leave the house sometimes a dull sense of relief come to she in the thought that by this strange confinement she be escape many thing which would have be hard she rarely see stephen except for a few moment late in the evening he have venture into mr carr 's room once or twice but he presence seem to disturb she the only presence that have do so she look distressed make agonizing effort to speak and with the hand she could lift make a gesture to repel he when he draw near the bed in mercy 's overwrought state this seem to she like a omen she shudder and draw stephen away o stephen she say she know now that i have deceive she about you do not come near she again you never deceive she darling do not distress yourself so whisper stephen they be stand on the threshold of the room a slight rustling in the bed make they turn : mr carr have half-lift she head from the pillow she lower jaw have fall to its utmost extent in she effort to articulate and she be point the forefinger of she left hand at the door it be a frightful sight even stephen turn pale and spring hastily away you see say mercy in a ghastly whisper sometimes she certainly do know thing but she never look like that except at you you must never come in again no say stephen almost as horror-stricken as mercy it be very strange though for she always use to seem so fond of I she be very childish and patient say mercy and i think she think that you be slowly get to care about I but now wherever she soul be -- i think it have leave she body -- she know that we deceive she stephen make no answer but turn to go the expression of resolve endurance on he face pierce mercy to the quick as it always do she spring after he and clasp both she hand on he arm o stephen darling -- precious brave strong darling do forgive I i ought to be kill for even say one word to give you pain how i can i do not see when i long so to make you happy always you do give I great unutterable happiness mercy he reply i never think of the pain : i only think of the joy and he lay she hand on he lip all the pain that you could possibly give I in a lifetime could not outweigh the joy of one such moment as this when you say that you love I these day be unspeakably hard for stephen he have grow during the past year to so live on the sight and in the blessedness of mercy that to be shut away from they be simply a sort of die there be no go back for he to the calm routine of the old life before she come he be restless and wretched : he walk up and down in front of the house every night watch the shadow of she figure on the curtain of she mother 's room he make all manner of excuse true and false reasonable and unreasonable to speak to she for a moment at the door in the morning he carry the few verse in he pocket-book she have give he and although he know they nearly by heart he spend long hour in he office turn the little papers over and over some of they be so joyous that they stir in he almost a bitter incredulity as he read they in these day of loss and pain one be a sonnet which she have write during a two day ' absence of he -- he only absence from he mother 's house for six year mercy have be astonish at she sense of loneliness in these two day o stephen she have say when he come back i be honestly ashamed of have miss you so much just the know that you would not be here to come in in the evening make the day seem a thousand year long and this be what come of it and she give he this sonnet : -- to a absent lover that so much change should come when they dost go be mystery that i can not ravel quite the very house seem dark as when the light of lamp go out each wonted thing doth grow so altered that i wander to and fro bewilder by the most familiar sight and feel like one who rouse in the night from dream of ecstasy and can not know at first if he be sleep or awake my foolish heart so foolish for thy sake have grow dear one teach I to be more wise i blush for all my foolishness doth lack i fear to seem a coward in thine eye teach I dear one -- but first thou must come back another be a little poem which she laughingly call he and not hers one morning when they have bid each other good-by and she have kiss he -- a rare thing for mercy to do he have exclaim that kiss will go float before I all day in the air mercy i shall see every thing in a light as rosy as you lip at night she give he this little poem say -- this be you poem not mine darling i should never have think of any thing so absurd myself couleur de rise all thing to-day couleur de rise i see -- oh why i know and my dear love she know why oh why on both my eye she lip she set all red and warm and dewy wet as she pass by the kiss do not my eyelid close but like a rosy vapor go where'er i sit where'er i lie before my every glance and show all thing to-day couleur de rise would it last thus alas who know man ask and sigh : they say it fade couleur de rise why oh why without swift joy and sweet surprise surely those lip upon my eye could never lie though both we head be white as snow and though the bitterest storm that blow of trouble and adversity have bent we low : all life still show to eye that love couleur de rise this sonnet also she persist in call stephen 's and not she own because he have ask she the question which have suggest it : -- lover ' thought how feel the earth when break from the night the sweet and sudden dawn impatient spill she rosy color all along the hill how feel the sea as it turn sudden white and shine like molten silver in the light which pour from eastward when the full moon fill she time to rise i know not love what thrill the earth the sea may feel how should i know except i guess by this -- the joy i feel when sudden on my silence or my gloom thy presence burst and light the very room then on my face doth not glad color steal like shine wave or hill-top ' sunrise glow one of the other be the poem of which i speak once before the poem which have be suggest to she by she desolate sense of homelessness on the first night of she arrival in penfield this poem have be widely copy after its first appearance in one of the magazine and it have be more than once say of it surely no one but a genuine outcast could have write such a poem as this it be hard for mercy 's friend to associate the word with she when she be ask how it happen that she write they she exclaim i do not write that poem i live it one night -- the night when i come to penfield and drive through these street in the rain with mother no vagabond in the world ever feel more forlorn than i do then the outcast o sharp cold wind thou art my friend and thou fierce rain i need not dread thy wont touch upon my head on loving brother wreak and spend you force on all these dwelling rend these door so pitilessly lock to keep the friendless out strike dead the fire whose glow have only mock by muffle ray the night where i the lonely outcast freezing lie ha if upon those door to-night i knock how well i know the stare the question the mingled air of scorn and pity at the sight the wonder if it would be right to give I alms of meat and bread and if i reckless standing there for once the truth implore say that not for bread or meat i long that such a alms my real need wrong that i would fain come in and sit beside they fire and hear the voice of child yea and if my choice be free and i dare mention it and some sweet child should think I fit to hold a child upon my knee one moment would my soul rejoice more than to banquet royally and i the pulse of its wrist would kiss as man the cross have kiss ha well the haughty stare i know with which they would say the man be mad what a impostor 's face he have how insolent these beggar grow go to ye happy people go my yearning be as fierce as hate must my heart break that yours be glad will you turn come at last though late i will not knock i will pass by my comrade wait -- the wind the rain comrade we 'll run a race to-night the stake may not seem much to gain : the goal be not marked plain in sight but comrade understand -- if i drop dead ' t will be a victory these poem and many other stephen carry with he wherever he go to read they over be next to see mercy the poet be hardly less dear to he than the woman he feel at time so remove from she by the great gulf which she genius all unconsciously seem to create between herself and he that he doubt he own memory of she love and need to be reassure by gaze into she eye touch she hand and listen to she voice it seem to he that if this separation last much longer he should lose all faith in the fact of they relation very impatient thought of poor old mr carr fill stephen 's thought in these day heretofore she have be no barrier to he happiness she still and childlike presence be no restraint upon he he have come to disregard it as he would the presence of a infant in a cradle therefore he have or think he have the kindest of feeling towards she but now that she helpless paralyzed hand have the power to shut he away from mercy he hate she as he have always hate every thing which stand between he and delight yet have it be he duty to minister to she he would have do it as gently as faithfully as mercy herself he would have speak to she in the mildest and tenderest of tone while in he heart he wish she dead so far can a fine fastidiousness ally to a sentiment of compassion go towards make a man a consummate hypocrite parson dorrance come often to see mercy but always with lizzy hunter by the subtle instinct of love he know that to see he thus and see he often would soonest win back for he he old place in mercy 's life the one great desire he have leave now be to regain that -- to see she again look up in he face with the frank free loving look which she always have have until that sad morning a strange incident happen to mercy in these first week of she mother 's illness she be call to the door one morning by the message that a stranger wish to speak to she she find stand there a elderly woman with a sweet but care-worn face who say eagerly as soon as she appear -- be you mr philbrick yes say mercy do you wish to see I the woman hesitate a moment as if try to phrase she sentence and then burst out impetuously with a flood of tear -- will not you come and help I make my husband come home he be so sick and i believe he will die in that wretched old garret mercy look at she in blank astonishment and she first thought be that she must be insane but the woman continue -- i be mr wheeler you never see I before but my husband 's talk about you ever since he first see you on the street that day you be the only human be i have ever know he take a fancy to and i do believe if anybody could do any thing with he you could it seem that in addition to all he other eccentricity old man wheeler have the habit of disappear from he home at interval leave no clew behind he he have attack of a morbid unwillingness to see a human face : during tkese attack he would hide himself sometimes in one place sometimes in another he have old warehouse old desert mill and factory and uninhabited room and house in all the town in the vicinity there be hardly any article of merchandise which he have not at one time or another have a depot for or a manufactory of he have especially a hobby for attempt to make article which be not make in this country it be only necessary for some one to go to he and say mr wheeler do you know how much this country pay every year for import such or such a article to throw he into a rage damned nonsense damned nonsense sir just as well make it here i 'll make it myself and up would start a new manufacture just as soon as he could get man to work at it at one time it be ink at another time brush then chintz and then pocket-book in fact nobody pretend to remember all the scheme which the old man have fail in he would stop they as instantaneously as he begin they dismiss the workman shut up the shop or the mill turn the key on they just as they stand very possibly fill full of material in the rough he do not care the hobby be over : he have prove that the thing could be make in america and he be content it be usually in some one of these disused building that he set up he hermitage in these absence from home he would sally out once a day and buy bread just a pittance hardly enough to keep he alive and then bury himself again in darkness and solitude if the absence do not last more than three or four day he wife and son give themselves no concern about he he usually return a saner and healthier man than he go away when the absence be longer they go in search of he and could usually prevail on he to return home with they but this last absence have be much longer than usual before they find he he be as cunning and artful as a fugitive from justice in conceal he haunt at last he be discover in the old garret store-room over the brick row the marvel be that he have not die of cold there he be not far from it however for he be so ill that at time he be delirious he lay curl up in the old stack of comforter in the corner with only a jug of water and some crumb of bread by he side when they find he he have be so ill when he last crawl up the stair that he have forget to take the key out of the keyhole but leave it on the outside and by that they find he at the bare suggestion of he go home he become so furious that it seem unsafe to urge it he wife and eldest son have stay there with he now for two day but he have grow steadily worse and it be plain that he must die unless he could be properly care for at last i thought of you say the poor woman he be always say so much about you and once when i be ride with he he point you out to I on the street and say he ` that be the very nicest girl in america ' and he tell I about he give you the clock and i never know he give any thing away before in he whole life not but what he have always be very good to I in he way he have never give I a cent o ' money but he would always pay bill -- that be that be any way reasonable but i say to ` siah this morning ` if there be anybody on earth can coax you father to let we take he home it be that mr philbrick and i be go to find she ' ` siah do not want I to the boy be so ashamed about it but i do not see any shame in it it be just a kind of queer way mr wheeler 's always have and everybody be get something queer about 'em first or last and this way of mr wheeler 's of go off do not hurt anybody but himself i get use to ' t long ago now will not you come and try and see if you can not persuade he it will not do any harm to try why yes indeed mr wheeler i 'll come but i do not believe i can do any thing say mercy much touch by the appeal to she i have wonder very much what have become of mr wheeler i have not see he for a long time when they go into the garret the old man be half-lying half-sitting prop on he left elbow in he right hand he hold he cane with which he continually tap the floor as he pour out a volley of angry reproach to he son ` siah a young man of eighteen or twenty year old who sit on a roll of leather at a safe distance from he father 's lair as the door open and he see mercy enter with he wife the old man 's face undergo the most extraordinary change surprise shame perplexity bravado -- all struggle together there god bless my soul god bless my soul he exclaim try to draw the comforter more closely about he mercy go up to he and sit down by he side begin to talk to he in a perfectly natural tone as if she be make a ordinary call on a invalid in he own home she say nothing to suggest that he have do any thing unnatural in hide himself and speak of he severe cold as be merely what every one else have be suffer from for some time then she tell he how ill she mother be and succeed in really arouse he interest in that finally she say -- but i must go now i can not be away from my mother long i will come and see you again to-morrow shall i find you here or at you home well i be think i would better move home to-day say he he wife and son involuntarily exchange glance this be more than they have dare to hope yes i would if i be you reply mercy still in a perfectly natural tone it would be so much better for you to be in a room with a fire in it for a few day there be not any way of warm this room be there say she look all about as if to see if it might not be possible still to put up a stove there ` siah turn he head away to hide a smile so amuse be he by the tact of the remark no i see there be no stovepipe-hole here she go on so you would much better move home i be go by the stable let I send seth right up with the carriage will not you no no bless my soul think i be make of money do not she no no i can walk and the old half-crazy glare come into he eye mercy go nearer to he and lay she hand gently on he mr wheeler say she you do something very kind for I once : now will not you do something once more -- just once i want you to go home in the carriage it be a terribly cold day and the street be very icy i nearly fall several time myself come over here you will certainly take a terrible cold if you walk this morning please say i may get the carriage bless my soul bless my soul child go get it then if you care so much but tell he i 'll only pay a quarter -- only a quarter remember they would take every cent i have get they be all wolf wolf wolf yes i 'll tell he only a quarter i 'll have he here in a few minute exclaim mercy and run out of the room hastily before the old man could change he mind as good luck would have it seth and he kerridge be in sight when mercy reach the foot of the staircase so in less than five minute she return to the garret exclaim -- here be seth now mr wheeler it be so fortunate i meet he now i can see you off the old man be so weak that he son have to carry he down the stair and he face see in the broad daylight be ghastly as they place he in the carriage he call out to he wife and son sharply -- do not you get in you can walk you can walk mind he be to have but a quarter tell he and as seth whip up he horse and drive off the word wolf wolf wolf be hear come in muffle tone through the door he have never have go if you have not come back -- never say mr wheeler as she turn to mercy i never can thank you enough it 'll save he life get he out of that garret mercy do not say but she think that it be too late a mortal sickness have fasten upon the old man and so it prove when she go to he home the next day he be in a high fever and delirious and he live only a few day he have interval of partial consciousness and in those he seem to be much touch by the patient care which he two son be give to he he have always be a hard father have compel he son very early to earn they own living and have refuse to give they money which he could so easily have spare to establish themselves in business now that it be too late he repent good boy good boy good boy after all he would mutter to himself as they bent over he and nurse he tenderly in he helplessness might have leave they more money might have leave they more mistake mistake once he rouse and with great vehemence ask to have he lawyer send for immediately but when the lawyer come the delirium have return again : it be too late and the old man die without repair the injustice he have do the last intelligible word he speak be mistake mistake and he have indeed make a mistake when he will be open it be find that the whole bulk of he large estate have be leave to trustee to be hold as a fund for assist poor young man to a certain amount of capital to go into business with -- the very thing which he have never do for he own child the trust be burden with such preposterous condition however that it never could have amount to any thing even if the court have not come to the rescue and mercifully break the will divide the property where it rightfully belong between the wife and child early in February mrs carr die it be more like a go to sleep than like a death she lay for two day in a doze state smile whenever mercy speak to she and make great effort to swallow food whenever mercy offer it to she at last she close she eye turn she head on one side as if for a sounder sleep and never move again however we may think we be longing for the release from suffer to come to one we love when it do come it be a blow be a shock hundred of time mercy have say to herself in the course of the winter oh if god would only take my mother to heaven she death would be easier to bear than this but now she would have call she back if she could the silent house the empty room still more terrible the long empty hour in which nobody need she help all wrung mercy 's heart it be she first experience of be alone she have often picture to herself or rather she think she have what it would be but no human imagination can ever sound the depths of that word : only the heart can feel it it be a marvel that heart do not break under it oftener than they do the silence which be like that darkness which could be feel the sudden awakening in the night with a wonder what it mean that the loved one be not there the pitiless morning light which fill the empty house room after room and harder than all else to forget to rise above -- the perpetual sense of no future : even the little near future of the next hour the next day all cut off all close to the human be leave utterly alone the mockery of the instinct of hunger and need of rest seem cruel what a useless routine for one left alone to be feed to sleep and to rise up to eat and sleep again mercy bear all this in a sort of dumb bewilderment for a few day all stephen 's love and sympathy do not help she he be unutterably tender and sympathize now that poor old mr carr be fairly out of he way it surprise even himself to see what a sort of respectful affection he feel for she in she grave any misgiving that this new quiet and undisturbed possession of mercy might not continue do not cross he mind and when mercy say to he suddenly one evening about ten day after she mother 's death stephen i must go away i can not live in this house another week it be almost as sudden a shock to he as if he have go in and find she dead go away leave I he gasp rather than say mercy you can not mean it and the distress in he face smite mercy bitterly but she persist yes i do mean it she say you must not ask I to stay i should lose my sens or fall ill you can not think how terrible it be to I to be all alone in these room perhaps in new room i should not feel it so much i have always look forward to be leave alone at some time and have think i would still have my home but i do not think it could feel like this i simply can not bear it -- at any rate not till i be stronger and besides stephen and mercy 's face flush red there be another thing you have not think of : it would never do for I to live here alone in this house with you as we have be live you could not come to see I so much now mother be not here poor mr carr avenge at last by stephen 's own heart how gladly would he have call she to life now mercy 's word carry instantaneous conviction to he mind it be strange he have never think of this before but he have not he groan aloud o mercy o mercy he exclaim i never once think of that we have be live so so long you be right : you can not stay here oh what shall i do without you my darling my darling i do not think you can ever be so lonely as i say mercy for you have still you work leave you to do if i have any human be to need I i could bear be separate from you where will you go mercy ask stephen in a tone of dull hopeless misery i do not know i have not think yet back to my old home for a visit i think and then to some city to study and work that be the best life for I o mercy mercy i be go to lose you -- lose you utterly exclaim stephen mercy look at he with a pained and perplexed expression stephen she say earnestly i can not understand you you bear you hard life so uncomplainingly so bravely that it seem as if you could not have a vestige of selfishness in you and yet -- mercy halt she could not put she thought in word stephen finish it for she and yet he say i be selfish about you you think selfish good god do you call it selfishness in a man who be drown to try to swim in a man who be starve to clutch a morsel of bread what else have i that one could call life except you tell I mercy you be my life : that be the whole of it all that a man have he will give for he life be it selfishness stephen lock he hand tight together and look at mercy almost angrily she be writhe under he word she have always a unspeakable dread of be unjust to he love make she infinitely tender and pity make she yearn over he but neither she own love and pity nor he passionate word could wholly blind she now and there be a sadness in the tone in which she reply -- no stephen i do not mean to call you selfish but i can not understand why you be not as brave and patient about all hard thing as you be about the one hardest thing of all mercy would you marry I now if i ask you say stephen he do not realize the equivocal form of he question a indignant look sweep over mercy 's face for a moment but only for a moment she know stephen 's love too well no stephen she say i would not if you have ask I at first i should have do it i think then that it would be best she say with hot blush mount high on she cheek but i have see since that it would not stephen sigh i be glad you see that he say then in a lower tone you know you be free mercy -- utterly free i would never be so base as to hold you by a word mercy smile half-bitterly as she reply -- word never hold people and you know very well it be only a empty form of word to say that i be free i do not want to be free darling she add in a burst of tenderness toward he you could not set I free if you try when mercy tell parson dorrance she intention of go away he face change as if some fierce spasm wring he but it be over in a second and he say -- you be quite right my child -- quite right it will be a great deal better for you in every way this be no place for you now you must have at least a year or two of travel and entire change in she heart mercy contrast the reply of she two lover she could not banish the feeling that one be the voice of a truer love than the other she fight against the feeling as against a treason but the truth be strongest in she heart she know that the man she do not love be manlier than the man she love chapter xi for the first few month after mercy go away stephen seem to himself to be like a automaton which have be wind up to go through certain movement for a certain length of time and could by no possibility stop he do not suffer as he have expect sometimes it seem to he that he do not suffer at all and he be terrify at this very absence of suffer then again he have hour and day of a dull despair which be worse than any more active form of suffer now he understand he think how in the olden time man have often withdraw themselves from the world after some great grief and have live long stagnant life in desert and cave he have think it would kill he to lose mercy out of he life now he feel sure that he should live to be a hundred year old should live by very help of the apathy into which he have sink externally he seem very little change -- a trifle quieter perhaps and gentler he mother sometimes say to herself -- steve be really get old very fast for so young a man but she be content with the change it seem to bring they nearer together and make she feel more at ease as to the possibility of he fall in love she old suspicion and jealousy of mercy have die out root and branch within three month after she departure stephen 's unhesitating assurance to she that he do not expect to write to mercy have settle the question in she mind once for all if she have know that at the very moment when he utter these word he have one long letter from mercy and another to she lie in he pocket the shock might well-nigh have kill she for never once in mr white 's most jealous and ill-natured hour have the thought cross she mind that she son would tell she a deliberate lie he tell it however unflinchingly in as gentle and even a tone and with as unruffled a brow as he would have bid she good-morning he have think the whole matter over and deliberately resolve to do it he do it to save she from pain and he have no more compunction about it than he would have have about close a blind to shut out a sunlight too strong for she eye what a terrible thing be the power which human being have of deceive each other woe to any soul which trust itself to any thing less than a organic integrity of nature to which a lie be impossible mercy 's letter disappointed stephen they be loving but they be concise sensible sometimes merry and always cheerful she life be constantly broaden friend crowd around she and she art be become more and more to she every day she name be begin to be know and she influence feel she verse be simple and go to people 's heart they be also of a fine and subtle flavor and give pleasure to the intellect stranger begin to write word of encouragement to she -- sometimes a word of gratitude for help sometimes a word of hearty praise she begin to feel that she have she own circle of listener unknown friend who be always ready to hear she when she speak this consciousness be a most exquisite happiness to a true artist : it be a better stimulus than all the flattering criticism in the world can give she be often touch to tear by the tribute she receive from these unknown friend they have a wide range come sometimes from she fellow-artist in literature sometimes from lowly and uncultured people once there come to she by mail on a sheet of coarse paper two fade rose fragrant -- for they be cinnamon rose whose fragrance never die -- but yellow and crumpled for they have journey many day to reach she they be tie together by a bit of blue yarn and on the paper be write in ill-spelt word i want to send you something and these be all i have i be a old woman and very poor you have help I ever so much another gift be a moss basket fill with arbutus blossom hide away in the leaf be a tiny paper on which be write some graceful verse evidently by a not unpractised hand the signature be in initial unknown to mercy but she hazard a guess as to the authorship and send the follow verse in reply : -- to eb at night the stream come to the sea long league it cry this drop i bring o beauteous boundless sea what be the meager paltry thing in thine abundance unto thee no ripple in thy smallest wave of I will know no thirst its suffering shall better slake for my surrender my life o sea in vain my league of toil and pain at night wayfarer reach the sea long weary league we come they cry o beauteous boundless sea the swell wave of thy swift tide break on the shore where soul be free : through lonely wilderness unto thee one tiny stream have be we guide and in the desert we have die if its oasis sweet have not refresh we foot o tiny stream lose in the sea close symbol of a lifetime 's speech o beauteous boundless sea close fitting symbol of the reach of measureless eternity be glad o stream o sea blest equally and thou whose word have help to teach I this -- my unknown friend -- for each kind think warm thanks only the stream can know how at such word the long league lighter grow all these new interest and occupation while they do not in the least weaken she loyalty to stephen fill she thought healthfully and absorbingly and leave she no room for any such passionate longing and brooding as stephen pour out to she in he letter he look in vain for any response to these expression sometimes unable to bear the omission any longer he would ask she pathetically why she do not say that she long to see he she reply be characteristic : -- you ask I dear why i do not say that i long to see you i be not sure that i ever do long in the sense in which you use the word i know that i can not see you till next winter just as i use to know every morning that i could not see you until night and the month between now and then seem to I one solid interval of time to be fill up and make the most of just as the interval of the daytime between you go away in the morning and come home at night use to seem to I i do not think dear stephen there be a moment of any day when i have not a under current of consciousness of you but it be not a longing for the sight of you be you sure darling that the love which take perpetual shape in such longing be the strongest love little by little phrase like this sink into stephen 's mind and gradually crystallize into a firm conviction that mercy be be wean from he it be not so it be only that separation and its surer test be adjust to a truer level the relation between they she do not love he one whit less but she be take the position which belong to she stronger and finer organization if she have ever live by he side as he wife the same change would have come but she never-failing tenderness would have effectually cover it from he recognition and hide it from she own so long as he look into she eye with plead love and she answer with woman 's fondness no realization of inequality could ever have come it be after all the flesh and blood of the loved one which we idealize there be in love 's sacrament a real presence which handling can not make we doubt it be when we go apart and reflect that we reason ask question mercy do not in the least know that she be outgrow stephen white she do not in the least suspect that she affection and she loyalty be centre around a ideal personality to which she give he name but which have in reality never exist she believe honestly that she be live for and in stephen all this time that she be he as he be hers inalienably and for ever if it have be suggest to she that it be unnatural that she should be so content in a daily life which he do not share so busy and glad in occupation and plan and aspiration into which he do not enter she would have be astonish she would have say how foolish of I to do otherwise we have we life to lead we work to do it would be a sin to waste one 's life to leave one 's work undo because of the mere lack of see any one human be however dear stephen know love better than this : he know that life without the daily sight of mercy be a blank drudgery that day by day month by month he be grow duller and duller and more and more lifeless as if he very blood be be impoverish by lack of nourishment surely it be a hard fate which inflict on this man already so overburdened the perpetual pain of a love deny thwart unhappy surely it be a brave thing in he to bear the double load uncomplainingly to make no effort to throw it off and never by a word or a look to visit he own suffering on the head of the helpless creature who seem to be the cause of they all if there be any change in he manner toward he mother during these month it be that he grow tenderer and more demonstrative to she there be even time when he kiss she solely from the yearning need he feel to kiss something human he so long for one touch of mercy 's hand he would sometimes ask she wistfully do i make you happy mother and she would be win upon and soften by the word when in reality they be only the outcry of the famished heart which need some reassurance that its sacrifice have not be all in vain month after month go on and no tenant come for the wing stephen even humiliate himself so far as to offer it to jane barker 's husband at a lowered rent but he offer be surlily reject and he repent have make it very bitterly he meditate on the strange isolation into which he and he mother be force he sympathy be not broad and general enough to comprehend it he do not know how quickly all people feel a atmosphere of withdrawal a air of indifference if stephen have be rich and powerful the world would have forgive he these trait or have smother its dislike of they but in a poor man and a obscure one such air be not to be tolerate nobody would live in the wing and so it come to pass that one day stephen write to mercy the follow letter : -- you will be sorry to hear that i have have to foreclose the mortgage on this house it be impossible to get a tenant for the other half of it and there be nothing else to be do the house must be sell but i doubt if it bring the full amount of the loan i should have do this three month ago except for you strong feeling against it i be very sorry for old mr jacob but it be she misfortune not my fault i have my mother to provide for and my first duty be to she of course mr jacob will now have to go to the alms-house but i be not at all sure that she will not be more comfortable there than she have make herself in the cottage she have starve herself all these year some people say she must have a hoard of money there somewhere that she can not have spend even the little she have receive i shall move out of the house at once into the little cottage you like so much farther up on the hill that be for rent only fifty dollar a year i shall put this house into good repair run a piazza around it as you suggest and paint it and then i think i shall be sure of find a purchaser it can be make a very pretty house by expend a little money on it and i can sell it for enough more to repay I i be sure nobody would buy it as it be mercy reply very briefly to this part of stephen 's letter she have discuss the question with he often before and she know the strict justice of he claim but she heart ache for the poor friendless old woman who be thus to lose she last dollar if it have be possible for mercy to have continue to pay the rent of the wing herself she would gladly have do so but at she suggestion of such a thing stephen have be so angry that she have be almost frightened i be not so poor yet mercy he have exclaim as to take charity from you i think i should go to the alms-house myself first i do not see why old granny jacob be so much to you any way only because she be so absolutely friendless stephen mercy have reply gently i never before know of anybody who have not a relative or a friend in the world and i be afraid they be cruel to the poor people at the alms-house they all look so starve and wretched well it will be no more than she deserve say stephen for she be cruel to she husband 's brother 's wife i use to hear horrid story when i be a boy about how she drive they out of the house and she be cruel to she son too and drive he away from home of course i be sorry to be the instrument of punish she and i do have a certain pity for the old woman but it be really she own fault she might be live now in comfort with she son perhaps if she have treat he well we can not go by such ` if ' in this world steve say mercy earnestly we have to take thing as they be i do not want to be judge way back in my life only god know all the ` if ' such conversation as these have prepare mercy for the news which stephen now write she but they have in no wise change she feeling in regard to it she believe in the bottom of she heart that stephen might have secure a tenant if he have try he have once in speaking of the matter drop a sentence which have shock she so that she could never forget it it would be a great deal better for I he have say to have the money invest in some other way if the house do fall into my hand i shall sell it and even if i do not get the full amount of what father loan i shall make it bring we in a good deal more than it do this way this sentence ring in mercy 's ear as she read in stephen 's letter all he plan for improve the house but the thing be do and it be not mercy 's habit to waste effort or speech over thing which could not be alter i be very sorry she write that you have be oblige to take the house you know how i always feel for poor old granny jacob perhaps we can do something to make she more comfortable in the alms-house i think lizzy could manage that for we and in she own mind mercy resolve that the old woman should never lack for food and fire however unwilling the overseer might be to permit she to have unusual comfort stephen 's next letter open with these word : o mercy i have such a strange thing to tell you i be so excited i can hardly find word i have find a lot of money in you old fireplace just think of we have sit there so quietly night after night within hand ' reach of it all last winter and how lucky that i find it instead of any of the workman they would have pocket it and never say a word to be sure they would think mercy and poor old granny jacob would have be -- she be about to think cheat out of she rights again but with a pang she change the phrase into none the better off for it oh how glad i be for the poor old thing people always say she husband must have hide money away somewhere mercy read on i be in such a hurry to get the house do before the snow come that i take hold myself and work every night and morning before the workman come and after they have go i find this last night and i declare mercy i have not shut my eye all night long it seem to I too good to be true i think there must be as much as three thousand dollar all in solid gold some of the coin i do not know the value of but the greater proportion of they be english sovereign of course rich people would not think this such a very big sum but you and i know how far a little can go for poor people yes indeed think mercy why it will make the poor old woman perfectly comfortable all she life : it will give she more than she have from the house and mercy lay the letter in she lap and fall into a reverie think how strange it be that this good fortune should have come about by means of a act which have seem to she cruel on stephen 's part she take the letter up again it continue : o mercy my darling do you suppose you can realize what this sudden lift be to I all my life i have find we poverty so hard to bear and these latter year i have bitterly feel the hardship of be unable to go out into the world and make my fortune as other man do as i think i might if i be free but this sum small as it be will be a nucleus i feel sure it will of a competency at least i know of several opening where i can place it most advantageously o mercy dear dear mercy what hope spring up in my heart the time may yet come when we shall build up a lovely home together bless old jacob 's miserliness how little he know what he be hoard up he gold for at this point mercy drop the letter -- drop it as if it have be a viper that sting she she be conscious of but two thing : a strange creep cold which seem to be chill she to the very marrow of she bone and a vague but terrible sense of horror mentally the letter fall to the floor she do not observe it a half-hour pass and she do not know that it have be a moment gradually she brain begin to rouse into activity again and strive confusedly with the thought which crowd on it that would be steal he can not mean it stephen can not be a thief half-formed incoherent sentence like these float in she mind seem to be float in the air pronounce by hiss voice she press she hand to she temple and spring to she foot the letter rustle on the floor as she gown sweep over it she turn and look at it as if it be a living thing she would kill she stoop to pick it up and then recoil from it she shrink from the very paper all the vehemence of she nature be rouse as in the moment of drown people be say to review in one swift flash of consciousness they whole life so now in this moment do mercy look back over the month of she life with stephen she sense of the baseness of he action now be like a lightning illume every corner of the past : every equivocation every concealment every subterfuge he have practice stand out before she bare strip of every shred of apology or excuse he lie he have always lie why should he not steal she exclaim it be only another form of the same thing he steal I too and he make I steal he he be dishonest to the very core how do i ever love such a man what blind I to he real nature then a great revulsion of feeling of tenderness toward stephen would sweep over she and drown all these thought o my poor brave patient darling he never mean to do any thing wrong in he life he do not see thing as i do : no human soul could see clearly stand where he stand there be a moral warp in he nature for which he be no more responsible than a tree be responsible for have grow into a crooked shape when it be break down by heavy stone while it be a sapling oh how unjust i be to he i will never think such thought of he again my darling my darling he do not stop to think in he excitement that the money be not he i daresay he have already see it differently like wave break on a beach and roll back again to meet higher wave and be swallow up in they these oppose thought and emotion struggle with each other in mercy 's bosom she heart and she judgment be at variance and the antagonism be irreconcilable she could not believe that she lover be dishonest she could not but call he act a theft the night come and go and no lull have come to the storm by which she soul be toss she could not sleep as the morning dawn she rise with haggard and weary eye and prepare to write to stephen in some of she calmer interval she have read the remainder of he letter it be chiefly fill with the detail of the manner in which the gold have be hide a second fireplace have be build inside the first leave a space of several inch between the two brick wall on each side two brick have be so left that they could be easily take out and replace and the bag of gold hang upon iron stanchion in the outer wall what a strange picture it must have be in the silent night hour -- the old miser bend above the ember of the die fire on the hearth and reach down the crevice to he treasure the bag be of leather curiously emboss they be almost char by the heat and the gold be dull and brown i wonder which old fellow put it there say stephen at the end of he letter captain john would have be more likely to have foreign gold but why should he hide it in he brother 's fireplace at any rate to whichever of they i be indebted for it i be most profoundly grateful if ever i meet he in any world i 'll thank he suddenly the thought occur to mercy perhaps old mr jacob be dead then there would be nobody who have any right to the money but no : stephen would have tell I if she have be still she cling to this straw of a hope and when she sit down to write to stephen these word come first to she pen : -- be mrs jacobs dead stephen you do not say any thing about she but i can not imagine you think for a moment of keep that money for yourself unless she be dead if she be alive the money be hers nobody but she husband or he brother could have put it there nobody else have live in the house except very poor people forgive I dear but perhaps you have not think of this when you first write : it have very likely occur to you since then and i may be make a very superfluous suggestion so hard do she cling to the semblance of a trust that all would yet prove to be well with she love and she lover stephen 's reply come by the very next mail it be short : it run thus : -- dear darling -- i do not know what to make of you letter you sentence ' i can not imagine you think for a moment of keep that money for yourself ' be a most extraordinary one what do you mean by ` keep it for myself ' it be mine : the house be mine and all that be in it old mr jacob be alive still at least she be last week but she have no more claim on that money than any other old woman in town i can not suppose you would think I a thief mercy but you letter strike I as a very strange one suppose i be to discover that there be a gold mine in the orchard -- stranger thing than that have happen -- would you say that that also belong to mr jacob and not to I the case be precisely parallel you have allow you impulsive feeling to run away with you judgment and as i so often tell you whenever you do that you be wrong i never think however it would carry you so far as to make you suspect I of a dishonorable act stephen be deeply wounded mercy 's attempt reticence in she letter have not blind he he feel what have underlie the word and it be a hard blow to he he conscience be as free from any shadow of guilt in the matter of that money as if it have be he by direct inheritance from he own father feeling this he have naturally the keenest sense of outrage at mercy 's imply accusation before stephen 's second letter come mercy have grow calm the more she think the thing over the more she feel sure that mr jacob must be dead and that stephen in he great excitement have forget to mention the fact therefore the second letter be even a greater blow to she than the first : it be a second and a deeper thrust into a wound which have hardly begin to heal there be also a tone of confident almost arrogant assumption in the letter it seem to mercy which irritated she she do not perceive that it be the inevitable confidence of a person so sure he be right that he can not comprehend any doubt in another 's mind on the subject there be in mercy 's nature a vein of intolerance which be capable of the most terrible severity she be as blinded to stephen 's true position in the matter as he be to hers the final moment of divergence have come : its seed be plant in she nature and in stephen 's when they be bear nothing could have hinder they growth nothing could have forestall they ultimate result it be only a question of time and of occasion when the two force would be array against each other and would be find equally strong mercy take counsel with herself now and delay answering this second letter she be resolve to be just to stephen i will think this thing over and over she say to herself till i be sure past all doubt that i be right before i say another word but she long thinking do not help stephen each day she conviction grow deeper she perception clearer she sense of alienation from stephen profounder if a moral antagonism have grow up between they in any other shape it would have be less fatal to she love there be many species of wrong-doing which would have be less hateful in she sight it seem to she sometimes that there could be no crime in the world which would appear to she so odious as this she imagination dwelt on the picture of the lonely old woman in the alms-house she have be several time to see mr jacob and have be much move by a certain grim stoicism which give almost dignity to she squalor and wretchedness she always have the bearing of a person who know she be suffer wrongly but be too proud to complain thought mercy i wonder if she do not all along believe there be something wrong about the mortgage and mercy 's suspicious thought and conjecture run far back into the past fasten on the beginning of all this trouble she recollect old mr wheeler 's warning about stephen in the first week of she stay in penfield she recollect parson dorrance 's expression when he find out that she have pay she rent in advance she tortured herself by review minutely every little maneuver she have know of stephen 's practise to conceal he relation with she let mercy once distrust a person in one particular and she distrust he in all let one act of he life be wrong and she believe that he every act be wrong in motive or in relation to other however specious and fair it might be make to appear all the old excuse and apology she have be in the habit of make for stephen 's insincerity to he mother and to the world seem to she now less than nothing and she wonder how she ever could have hold they as sufficient in vain she heart plead in vain tender memory thrill she by they vivid recall of hour of moment of look and word it be with a certain sense of remorse that she dwell on they of shame that she be conscious of cling to they still i shall always love he i be afraid she say to herself but i shall never trust he again -- never and hour by hour stephen be wait and look for he letter chapter xii stephen take mercy 's letter from the post-office at night it be one week past the time at which it would have reach he if it have be write immediately on the receipt of he only too well he know what the delay mean he turn the letter over and over in he hand and note without surprise it be very light the superscription be write with unusual care mercy 's handwriting be free and bold but illegible unless she make a special effort to write with care and she never make that effort in write to stephen how many time he have say to she : never mind how you write to I dear i read you sentence by another sense than the sense of sight this formally and neatly write superscription smite he as a formal bow and a chill glance from mercy would if he have pass she on the street he carry the letter home unopen all through the evening it lay like a leaden weight in he bosom as he sit by he mother 's side he dare not read it until he be sure of be able to be alone for hour at last he be free as he go upstairs to he room he think to himself this be the hour at which i use to fly to she and find such welcome a year ago to-night how happy we be with a strange disposition to put off the opening of the letter he move about he room rearrange the book light a extra lamp and finally sit down in a arm-chair and lean both he arm on the table look at the letter lie there so white so still he feel a preternatural consciousness of what be in it and he shrink from look at the word as a condemn prisoner might shrink from read he own death-warrant the room be bitterly cold fire in bed-room be a luxury stephen have never know as he sit there he body and heart seem to be grow numb together at last he say i may as well read it and take the letter up as he open it and read the first word my darling stephen he heart give a great bind she love he still what a reprieve in that he have yet to learn that love can be crueller than any friendship than any indifference than any hate : nothing be so exacting so inexorable as love the letter be full of love but it be nevertheless hard and pitiless in its tone stephen read it again and again : then he hold it in the flame of the lamp and let it slowly burn until only a few scorched fragment remain these he fold in a small paper and put into he pocket-book why he do this he could not tell and wonder at himself for do it then he walk the room for a hour or two revolve in he mind what he should say to mercy he idea arrange themselves concisely and clearly he have be sting by mercy 's letter into a frame of feeling hardly less inexorable than she own he say to himself she never truly love I or nothing under heaven could make she believe I capable of a dishonesty and in midst of all he pain at this thought he have a indignant resentment as if mercy herself have be in some way actively responsible for all this misery he letter be shorter than mercy 's they be sad strange letter to have pass between lover mercy 's run as follow : -- my darling stephen -- you letter have shock I so deeply that i find myself at a loss for word in which to reply i can not understand you present position at all i have wait all these day hope that some new light would come to I that i could see the whole thing differently but i can not on the contrary each hour that i think of it -lrb- and i have think of nothing else since you second letter come -rrb- only make my conviction stronger darling that money be mrs jacobs 's money by every moral right you may be correct in you statement as to the legal rights of the case i take it for grant that you be at any rate i know nothing about that and i rest no argument upon it at all but it be clear as daylight to I that morally you be bind to give she the money suppose you have have permission from she to make those change in the house while you be still she tenant and have find the money then you would have hand it to she unhesitatingly why because you would have say ` this woman 's husband build this house no one except he brother who could possibly have deposit this money here have live in the house one of those two man be the owner of that gold in either case she be the only heir and it be hers i be sure you would have feel this have we chance to discover the money on one of those winter night you refer to now in what have the moral obligation be change by the fact that the house have come into you hand not by ordinary sale either but simply by foreclosure of a mortgage under condition which be certainly very hard for mr jacob inasmuch as one-half the interest have always be pay this money which you have find would have pay nearly the whole of the original loan it be hers only she do not know where it lay o stephen my darling i do implore you not to do this great wrong you will certainly come to see sooner or later that it be a dishonest act and then it will be too late to undo it if i think that by talk with you i could make you see it as i do i would come to you at once but i keep cling to the hope that you will see it of yourself that a sudden realization of it will burst upon you like a great light do not speak so angrily to I of call you a thief i never use the word i never could i know the act look to you right or you would not commit it but it be terrible to I that it should look so to you i feel darling as if you be color-blind and i see you about to pick a most deadly fruit whose color ought to warn every one from touch it but you not see the color do not know the danger and i must save you at all hazard at all cost oh what shall i say what shall i say how can i make you see the truth god help we if i do not for such a act as this on you part would put a impassable gulf between we soul for ever you loving mercy stephen 's letter be in curter phrase writing be not to he a natural form of expression even of joyous or loving word he be chary and much more so of they opposite he life-long habit of repression of all sign of annoyance all complaint all trace of suffer tell still more on he written word than on he daily speech and life he letter sound harder than it need for this reason seem to have be write in antagonism rather than in grief and so do injustice to he feeling my dear mercy -- it be always a mistake for people to try to impose they own standard of right and wrong on other it give I very great pain to wind you in any way you know that and to wind you in such a way as this give I the greatest possible pain but i can not make you conscience mine if this money have not seem to I to be justly my own i should never have think of take it as it do seem to I to be justly my own you believe it to be another 's ought not to change my action if i have only my own future to consider i might give it up for the sake of you peace of mind but it be not so i have a helpless invalid dependent on I and one of the hardest thing in my life to bear have always be the fear that i might lose my health and be unable to earn even the poor living we now have this sum small as it be will remove that fear will enable I to insure for my mother a reasonable amount of comfort as long as she live and i can not give it up i do not suppose either that it would make any difference in you feeling if i give it up solely to please you and not because i think it wrong to keep it how any act which i honestly believe to be right and which you know i honestly believe to be right can put ` a impassable gulf between we soul for ever ' i do not understand but if ' it seem so to you i can only submit and i will try to forget that you ever say to I ' i shall trust you till i die ' o mercy mercy ask yourself if you be just stephen mercy grasp eagerly at the intimation in this letter that stephen might possibly give the money up because she desire it oh if he will only not keep it i do not care on what grounds he give it up she exclaim i can bear he think it be he if only the money go where it belong he will see afterwards that i be right and she sit down instantly and write stephen a long letter implore he to do as he have suggest darling she say this last letter of yours have give I great comfort as stephen read this sentence he utter a ejaculation of surprise what possible comfort there could have be in the word he remember to have write he fail to see but it be soon make clear to he you say she continue that you might possibly give the money up for sake of my peace of mind if it be not for the fear that you mother might suffer o stephen then give it up give it up trust to the future 's be at least as kind as the past i will not say another word about the right or wrong of the thing think that my feeling be all morbid and overstrained about it if you will i do not care what you think of I so that i do not have to think of you as use money which be not you own and darling do not be anxious about the future : if any thing happen to you i will take care of you mother it be surely my right next to yours i only wish you would let I help you in it even now i be earn more and more money i have more than i need oh if you would only take some of it darling why should you not i would take it from you if you have it and i have not i could give you in a very few year as much as this you have find and never miss it do let I atone to you in this way for you give up what you think be you right in the matter of this ill-fated money o stephen i could be almost happy again if you would do this you say it would make no difference in my feeling about it if you give the money up only to please I and not because you think it wrong to keep it no indeed that be not so i would be happier if you see it as i do of course but if you can not then the next best thing the only thing leave for my happiness be to have you yield to my wish why stephen i have even feel so strongly about it as this : that sometimes in think it over i have have a wild impulse to tell you that if you do not give the money to mr jacob i would inform the authority that you have it and so test the question whether you have the right to keep it or not any thing even you humiliation have at time seem to I better than that you should go on living in the possession of steal money you can see from this how deeply i feel about the thing i suppose i really never could have do this at the last moment i should have find it impossible to array myself against you in any such public way but oh my darling i should always have feel as if i help steal the money if i keep quiet about it you see i use a past tense already i feel so certain that you will give it up now dear dear stephen you will never be sorry : as soon as it be do you will be glad i wish that gold have be all sink in the sea and never see light again the sight of it have cost we so dear darling i can not tell you what a load have roll off my heart oh if you could know what it have be to I to have this cloud over my thought of you i have always be so proud of you stephen -- you patience you bravery in my thought you have stand always for my ideal of the beautiful alliance of gentleness and strength darling we owe something to those who love we : we owe it to they not to disappoint they if i be to be tempt to do some dishonorable thing i should say to myself : ` no for i must be what stephen believe I it be not only that i will not grieve he : still more i will not disappoint he ' mercy write on and on the reaction from the pent-up grief the prolonged strain be great in she first joy at any even the least alleviation of the horror she have feel at the thought of stephen 's dishonesty she over-estimate the extent of the relief she would feel from he surrender the money at she request she write as buoyantly as confidently as if he do that would do away with the whole wrong from the beginning in she overflow impetuosity also she do not consider what severe and cut thing be imply as well as say in some of she sentence she close the letter without reread it hasten to send it by the first mail and then begin to count the day which must pass before stephen 's answer could reach she alas for mercy this be a sad preparation for the result which be to follow she hastily write word it seem sometimes as if fate delighted in lift we up only to cast we down in take we up into a high mountain to show we bright and goodly land only to make we speedy imprisonment in the dark valley the harder to bear stephen read this last letter of mercy 's with a ever-increasing sense of resentment to the very end for the time be it seem to actually obliterate every trace of he love for she he read the word as wrathfully as if they have be write by a mere acquaintance good heaven he exclaim ` steal money inform the authority ' let she do it if she like and see how she would come out at the end of that ' and stephen write mercy very much such a letter as he would have write to a man under the same circumstance luckily he keep it a day and reread it in a cooler moment be shock at its tone destroy it and write another but the second one be no less hard only more courteous than the first it run thus : -- mercy -- i be sorry that any thing in my last letter should have lead you to suppose that under the exist circumstance you could control my action all i say be that i might for the sake of you peace of mind give up this money if it be not for my obligation to my mother it be a foolish thing to say since those obligation could not be do away with i ought to have know that in you overwrought frame of mind you would snatch at the suggestion and make it the basis of a fresh appeal now let I say once for all that my mind be firmly make up on this subject and that it must be drop between we the money be mine and i shall keep it if you think it you duty to ` inform the authority ' as you say you must do so and i would not say one word to hinder you i would never as you do in this case attempt to make my own conscience the regulator of another 's conduct if you do regard I as the possessor of ` steal money ' it be undoubtedly you duty to inform against I i can only warn you that all you would gain by it would be a most disagreeable exposure of you own and my private affair and much mortification to both of we the money be mine beyond all question i shall not reply to any more letter from you on this subject there be nothing more to be say and all prolong of the discussion be a needless pain and be endanger the very foundation of we affection for each other i want to say one thing more however and i hope it will impress you as it ought never forget that the strongest proof that my conscience be perfectly clear in regard to that money be that i at once tell you of its discovery it would have be perfectly easy for I to have account to you in a dozen different way for my have come into possession of a little money or even to have conceal from you the fact that i have do so and if i have feel myself a thief i should certainly have take good care that you do not know it i must also thank you for you expression of willingness to take care of my mother in case of any thing 's happen to I until these last letter of yours i have often think with a sense of relief that if i die you would never see my mother suffer but now any such thought be inseparably associate with bitter memory and my mother will not in any event need you help for the money i shall have from the sale of the house together with this which i have find will give she all she will require you must forgive I if this letter sound hard mercy i have not you faculty of mingle endearing epithet with sharp accusation and reproach i can not be lover and culprit at once as you be able to be lover and accuser or judge i love you i think as deeply and tenderly as ever but you yourself have make all expression of it impossible stephen this letter rouse in mercy most conflicting emotion wound feeling at its coldness a certain admiration for its tone of immovable resolution anger at what seem to she stephen 's unjustifiable resentment of she effort to influence he action -- all these blended in one great pain which be well-nigh unbearable for the time be she distress in regard to the money seem cast into shadow and remove by all this suffering in she personal relation with stephen but the personal suffering have not so deep a foundation as the other gradually all sense of she own individual hurt in stephen 's word in he act in the weakening of the bond which hold they together die out and leave behind it only a sense of bereavement and loss while the first horror of stephen 's wrong-doing of the hopeless lack in he moral nature come back with twofold intensity this have its basis in conviction -- in conviction which be as strong as the foundation of the earth : the other have its basis in emotion in sensibility which might pass away or be dull spite of stephen 's have forbid all reference to the subject mercy write letter after letter upon it plead sometimes humbly sometimes vehemently it seem to she that she be fight for stephen 's very life and she could not give way to all these out-pouring stephen make no reply he answer the letter punctually but make no reference to the question of the money save by a few short word at the end of he letter or in a postscript : such as it grieve I to see that you still dwell on that matter of which i say we must speak no more or pray dear mercy do not prolong that painful discussion i have nothing more to say to you about it for the rest he letter be faithful transcript of the little event of he uneventful life warm comment on any of mercy 's writings which he read and gentle assurance of he continued affection the old longing brooding and passionate yearning which he use to pour out cease stephen be wound to the very quick and the wound do not heal yet he feel no withdrawal from mercy : probably nothing she could do would ever drive he from she he would die if worst come to worst lie by she side and look up in she eye like a dog at the foot of its master who have shoot he mercy be much move by this tone of patience in he letter : it touch she as the look of patient endurance on he face use to touch she it also irritated she it be so foreign to she own nature how can he help answer these thing i say she would exclaim he have no right to refuse to talk with I about such a vital matter if any one have say to mercy he have as much right to refuse to discuss the question as you have to force it upon he she could not have see the point fairly but all stephen 's patience gentleness and firmness do not abate one jot or tittle of mercy 's conviction that he be do a dishonest thing oh the contrary he quiet appear to she more and more like a callous satisfaction and he occasional cheerfulness like a exultation over he ill-gotten gain slowly there creep into she feeling towards he a certain something which be akin to scorn -- the most fatal of death to love the hateful word thief seem to be perpetually ring in she ear when she read account of robbery of defalcation of breach of trust she find herself always draw parallel between the conduct of these criminal and stephen 's the secrecy the unassailable safety of he crime seem to she to make it inexpressibly more odious i do believe she think to herself again and again that if he have be drive by he poverty to knock man down on the highway and rob they of they pocket-book i should not have so loathe it as the week go on mercy 's unhappiness increase rather than diminish there seem a irreconcilible conflict between she love and every other emotion in she soul she seem to herself to be as it be play the hypocrite to she own heart in think thus of a man and loving he still for that she still love stephen she do not once doubt at this time she print a little poem which set many of she friend to vondering from what experience of hers it could possibly have be draw mercy 's poem be so largely subjective in tone that it be hard for she reader to believe that they be not all draw from she own individual experience a woman 's battle dear foe i know thou ` lt win the fight i know thou hast the stronger bark and thou art sailing in the light while i be creep in the dark thou dost not dream that i be cry as i come up with color fly i clear away my wound slay with strength like frenzy strong and swift i do not feel the tug and strain though dead be heavy hard to lift if i look on they face die i could not keep my color fly dear foe it will be short -- we fight -- though lazily thou train ` st thy gun : fate steer we -- I to deeper night and thee to brighter sea and sun but thou ` lt not dream that i be die as i sail by with color fly there be great injustice to stephen in this poem when he read it he groan and exclaim aloud o mercy o mercy then as he read it over again he say surely she could not have mean herself in this : it be only dramatic she could never call I she foe mercy have often say to he of some of she most intense poem oh it be purely dramatic i just fancy how anybody would feel under such circumstance and he cling to the hope that it be true in this case but it be not already mercy have a sense of antagonism of warfare with stephen or rather with she love for he already she pride be begin to array itself in reticence in withdrawal in suppression more than once she have say to herself i can live without he i could bear that pain better than this more than once she have ask herself with a kind of terror do i really wish ever to see stephen again and have be force to own in she secret thought that she shrink from meet he she begin even to consider the possibility of defer the visit to lizzy hunter which she have promise to make in the spring as the time draw nearer she unwillingness to go increase and she would no doubt have discover some way of escape but one day early in march a telegram come to she which leave she no longer any room for choice it run : -- uncle dorrance be not expect to live he wish to see you he be at my house come immediately lizzy hunter chapter xiii within six hour after the receipt of this telegram mercy be on she way to penfield she journey would take a night and part of a day as the morning dawn and she draw near the old familiar scene she heart be wring with conflict memory and hope and fear the whole landscape be dreary : the field be dark and sodden with narrow bank of discolor snow lie under the fence and thin rim of ice along the edge of the stream and pool the sky be gray the bare tree be gray : all life look gray and hopeless to mercy she have have a over-mastering presentiment from the moment when she read the telegram that she should reach penfield too late to see parson dorrance alive a strange certainty that he have die in the night settle upon she mind as soon as she wake from she troubled sleep and when she reach lizzy 's door and see standing before it the undertaker 's wagon which she so well remembered there be no shock of surprise to she in the sight at the first sound of mercy 's voice lizzy come swiftly forward and fall upon she neck in a passion of cry o mercy mercy he -- yes dear i know it interrupted mercy in a calm tone i know he be dead why who tell you mercy exclaim lizzy he only die a few hour ago -- about daybreak oh i think he die in the night say mercy in a strange tone as if try to recollect something accurately about which she memory be not clear she look and she tone fill lizzy with terror and banish she grief for the time be mercy mercy do not look so she exclaim speak to I oh do cry can not you and lizzy 's tear flow afresh no lizzy i do not think i can cry say mercy in the same strange low voice i wish i could have speak to he once though do he leave any word for I perhaps there be something he want I to do mercy 's face be white and she lip tremble but she look be hardly the look of one in sorrow : it be a rapt look as of one walk on dizzy height breathless with some solemn purpose lizzy be convulse with grief sob like a child and pour out one incoherent sentence after another mercy soothe she and comfort she as a mother might have do and finally compel she to be more calm mercy 's magnetic power over those whom she love be almost unlimited she forestall they very will and make they desire what she desire o mercy do not make I glad he be dead you frighten I darling i do not want to stop cry but you have seal up all my tear cry lizzy later in the day when mercy have be talk like a seer who could look into the street of heaven and catch the sound of the song of angel mercy smile sadly i do not want to prevent you cry dear she say if it do you any good but i be very sure that mr dorrance see we at this moment and long to tell we how glad he be and that we must be glad for he and mercy 's eye shine as they look steadfastly across the room as if the empty space be to she vision people with spirit this mood of exalted communion do not leave she she face seem transfigure by it when she stand by the body of she loved teacher and friend she clasp she hand and bend over the face exclaim -- oh how good god be then turn suddenly to lizzy she exclaim -- lizzy do you know that he love I and ask I to be he wife this be why i be thank god for take he to heaven lizzy 's face pale astonishment incredulity anger grief all blended in the sudden look she turn upon mercy i think so i think so but i never believe you know it and you do not love he mercy i will never forgive you he forgive I say mercy gently and so you might but i shall never forgive myself mercy philbrick exclaim lizzy how could you help love that man and in she excitement lizzy stretch out she right hand towards the rigid motionless figure under the white pall he be the most glorious man god ever make the two woman stand side by side look into the face of the dead it be a strange place for these word to be speak it be as solemn as eternity i do not help love he say mercy in a lower tone she white face grow whiter as she speak but -- she pause no word come to she lip for the bitter consciousness which fill she heart lizzy 's voice sink to a husky whisper but what she say o mercy mercy be it stephen white you love and lizzy 's face even in that solemn hour take a look of scorn be you go to marry stephen white she continue never lizzy -- never say mercy in a tone as concentrated as if a lifetime end there and stoop low she kiss the rigid hand which lay fold on the heart of the man she ought to have love but have not then turn away she take lizzy 's hand in hers and kiss she forehead say earnestly -- we will never speak again of this lizzy remember lizzy be overawe by she tone and make no reply parson dorrance 's funeral be a scene which will never be forget by those who see it it be on one of the fiercest day which the fierce new england march can show a storm of rain and sleet with occasional softened interval of snow rage all day the road be gully of swift-running water and icy slough the cold be severe and the cut wind at time drive the sleet and rain in slanting scourge before which scarce man or beast could stand the funeral be hold in the village church which be larger than the college chapel long before the hour at which the service be to begin every pew be fill and the aisle be crowd with those who could not find seat from every parish within twenty mile the mourner have come there be not one there who have not hear word of help or comfort from parson dorrance 's lip the student of the college fill the body of the church the faculty and distinguish stranger sit in the front pew the pew under one of the gallery have be reserve for the negro from the cedar early in the morning the poor creature have begin to flock in not a seat be empty : old woman woman with baby old man boy and girl wet drip ragged friendless more than one hundred of they -- there they be they have walk all that distance in that terrible storm each one have bring in he hand a green bough or a bunch of rock-fern something of green beauty from the wood they teacher have teach they to love they sit huddle together with a expression of piteous grief on every face which be enough to touch the stoniest heart now and then sob would burst from the woman and some old figure would be see rock to and fro in uncontrollable sorrow the coffin stand on a table in front of the pulpit it seem to be rest on a altar of cedar and fern mercy have bring from she old haunt in the wood mass of the glossy evergreen fern and interwoven they with the bough of cedar at the end of the service it be announce that all who wish could pass by the coffin and take one last look at they friend slowly and silently the congregation pass up the right aisle look on the face and pass out at the left door it be a pathetic sight to see the poor outcast band wait patiently humbly till every one else have go : then like a flock of stricken sheep they rush confusedly towards the pulpit and gather round the coffin now burst out the grief which have be pen up : with cry and ejaculation they go totter and stumble down the aisle one old man with hair as white as snow -- one of the original fugitive slave who have found the settlement -- bent over the coffin at its head and clung with both hand to its edge sway back and forth above it cry aloud till the sexton be oblige to loosen he grasp and lead he away by force the college faculty still sit in the front pew there be some of they number younger man scholar and man of the world who have not be free from a disposition to make good-natured fun of parson dorrance 's philanthropy they shrug they shoulder sometimes at the mention of he parish at the cedar they regard he as old-fashioned and unpractical they sit conscience-stricken and abashed now the tear of these bereaved black people smite they philosophy and they worldliness and show they how shallow they be tear answer to tear and the college professor and the negro slave weep together they have nobody leave to love they now exclaim one of the youngest and hitherto most cynical of parson dorrance 's colleague as he stand watch the grief-stricken creature while the procession form to bear the body to the grave the black stand in a group on the church-step watch it after the last carriage have fall into line they hurry down and follow on in the storm in vain some kindly person try to dissuade they it be two mile to the cemetery two mile farther away from they home but they repel all suggestion of the exposure with indignant look and press on when the coffin be lower into the grave they push timidly forward and begin to throw in they green bough and bunch of fern every one else step back respectfully as soon as they intention be discover and in a moment they have form in solid rank close about the grave each one casting in he green palm of crown and remembrance -- a body-guard such as no emperor ever have to stand around he in he grave on the day after mercy 's arrival in town stephen have call to see she she have send down to he a note with these word : -- i can not see you dear stephen until after all be over the funeral will be to-morrow come the next morning as early as you like the hour have seem bitterly long to stephen he have watch mercy at the funeral and when he see she face bow in she hand and feel rather than see that she be sob he be sting by a new sense of loss and wrong that he have no right to be by she side and comfort she he forget for the time in the sight of she grief all the unhappiness of they relation for the past few month he have unconsciously feel all along that if he could but once look in she eye all would be well how could he help feeling so when he recall the expression of childlike trust and devotion which she sweet face always wear when she lift it to he and now as he eye dwell lingeringly and fondly on every line of she bow form he have but one thought but one consciousness -- he desire to throw he arm about she and exclaim o mercy be you not my own my very own with he heart full of this new fondness and warmth stephen go at a early hour to seek mercy as he enter the house he be sensibly affect by the expression still linger of the yesterday 's grief the decoration of evergreen and flower be still untouched mercy and lizzy have make the whole house gay as for a festival but the very blossom seem to-day to say that it have be a festival of sorrow a large sheaf of calla have stand on a small table at the head of the coffin the table have not yet be move from the place where it stand near the center of the room but it stand there now alone with a strange expression of be leave by accident stephen bent over it look into the deep creamy cup and think dreamily that mercy 's nature be as fair as white as royal as these most royal of graceful flower when the door open and mercy come towards he he spring to meet she with outstretch arm something in she look make the outstretched arm fall nerveless make he spring step pause suddenly make the very word die away on he lip o mercy be all he could say and he breathe it rather than say it mercy smile a very piteous smile and say yes stephen i be here o mercy it be not you you be not here what have do this to you do you so love that man exclaim stephen a sudden pang seize he of fiercest jealousy of the dead whom he have never fear while he be live mercy 's face contract as if a sharp pain have wrench every nerve no i do not love he that be not as you mean you know how very dearly i do love he though dear darling you be all wear out this shock have be too much for you you be not well say stephen tenderly come nearer to she and take she hand you must have rest and sleep at once the hand be not mercy 's hand any more than the voice have be mercy 's voice stephen drop it and look fixedly at mercy 's eye whisper mercy you do not love I as you use to mercy 's eye droop she lock she hand tightly together and say i can not stephen no possible form of word could have be so absolute i can not i do not would have be merciful would have hold a hope by the side of this helpless despairing i can not stephen sink into a chair and cover he eye with he hand mercy stand still near the white calla she hand clasp and she eye fix on stephen at last she speak in a voice of unutterable yearning and tenderness i do love you stephen at these word he press he hand tighter upon he eye for one second then shake they hastily free and look up at mercy say gently -- yes dear i know you do and i know you would have love I always if you could do not be unhappy i tell you a long time ago that to have have you once love I be enough for a lifetime and stephen smile -- a smile more pathetic than mercy 's have be he go on still in the same gentle voice -- a voice out of which the very life seem to have die -- i hope when we meet all would be right it use to be so much to you mercy to look into my eye i think you would trust I when you see I no reproach no antagonism no entreaty with the long-trained patience of a lifetime stephen accept this great grief and make no effort to gainsay it mercy try again and again to speak but no word come at last with a flood of tear she exclaim -- i can not help it stephen -- i can not help it no darling you can not help it and it be not you fault reply stephen touch to the heart by he sweetness and forbearance mercy go nearer he and take he hand and in she old way be about to lay it to she cheek stephen draw it hastily away and a shudder run over he body no mercy do not try to do that that be not right when you do not trust I you can not help love the touch of my hand mercy -- and a certain sad pride light stephen 's face at the thought of the clinging affection which even now stir this woman 's vein for he -- any more than you can help have cease to trust I if the trust ever come back then -- stephen turn he head away and do not finish the sentence a great silence fall upon they both how inexplicable it seem to they that there be nothing to say at last stephen rise and say gravely -- good-by mercy unless there be something i can do to help you i would rather not see you again no whisper mercy that be best and if the time ever come darling when you need I or trust I again will you write to I and say so yes sob mercy and stephen leave she on the threshold of the door he turn and fix he eye upon she with one long look of sorrow compassion and infinite love she heart thrill under it she make a eager step forward if he have return she would have throw herself into he arm and cry out o stephen i do love you i do trust you but stephen make a inexorable gesture of he hand which say more than any word no no do not deceive yourself and be go and thus they part for ever this man and this woman who have be for two year all in all to each other who have write on each other 's heart and live character which eternity itself could never efface hope live long in stephen 's heart he build too much on the memory of he magnetic power over mercy and he judge she nature too much by he own he would have love and follow she to the end in spite of she have become a very outcast of crime if she have continue to love he and it be simply impossible for he to conceive of she love 's be either less or different but when in a volume of poem which mercy publish one year after they parting he read the follow sonnet he know that all be indeed over : -- die not by the death that kill the body nay by that which even christ bid we to fear have die my dead ah I if on a bier i could but see he lifeless stretch to-day i would bathe he face with tear of joy and lay my cheek to he in anguish which be near to ecstasy if i could hold he dear in death as life mere separation weigh as dust in balance of love the death that kill come only by dishonor vain to chide I vain and weaker to implore o thou once love so well love now no more there be no resurrection for such slay no miracle of god could give thee breath \* \* \* \* \* mercy philbrick live thirty year after the event describe in these page it be a life rich to overflow yet uneventful as the world reckon : a life lonely yet full of companionship sady yet full of cheer hard and yet perpetually uplift by a inward joy which make she very presence like sunshine and make man often say of she oh she have never know sorrow this be largely the result of she unquenchable gift of song of the true poet 's temperament to which life be for ever new beautiful and glad it be also the result of she ever-increasing spirituality of nature this take no shape of creed worship or what the world 's common consent call religion most of the word speak by the teacher of church repel mercy by they monotonous iteration of the letter which killeth but she realization of the solemn significance of the great fact of be alive deepen every hour she tenderness she sense of brotherhood to every human being and she sense of the actual presence and near love of god she old intolerance be soften or rather it have change from antagonism on the surface to live principle at the core truth truth truth be still the war-cry of she soul and there be a intensity in every word of she write or speak pleading on this subject which might well have reveal to a careful analyzer of they that they have spring out of the depths of the profoundest experience she influence as a writer be very great as she grow older she write less and less for the delight of the ear more and more for the stir of the heart to do a little towards make people glad towards make they kind to one another towards open they eye to the omnipresent beauty -- these be she ambition oh the tender unutterable beauty of all create thing be the opening line of one of she sweetest song and it might have be say to be one of the watchword of she life it take many year for she to reach this plane to attain to the fulness of this close spiritual communion with thing see and unseen the double bereavement and strain of she two year of life in penfield leave she for a long time bruised and sore she relation with stephen as she look back upon it hurt she in every fiber of she nature sometimes she be fill with remorse for the grief she have cause he and sometimes with poignant distress of doubt whether she have not after all be unjust to he underlie all this remorse all this doubt be a steadily grow consciousness that she love for he be in the very outset a mistake a abnormal emotion bear of temporary and insufficient occasion and therefore sure to have sooner or later prove too weak for the test of life on the other hand she thought of parson dorrance grow constantly warmer tenderer more assure he character he love for she he beautiful life rise steadily higher and higher and brighter and brighter on she horizon as the lofty snow-clad peak of a mountain land reveal themselves in all they grandeur to we vision only when we have journey away from they base slowly the whole allegiance of she heart transfer itself to the dead man 's memory slowly she grief for he loss deepen and yet with the deepen grief come a certain new and holy joy it surely could not be impossible for he to know in heaven that she be he on earth as confidently as if she have be wed to he here she look forward to the reunion with he there and find in she secret consciousness of this eternal bond a hidden rapture such as have be the stay of many a widow heart through long lifetime of loneliness this secret bond be like a impalpable yet impenetrable veil between she soul and the soul of all man who come into relation with she man love she and seek she -- love she warmly and seek she with long year of devotion the world often judge she uncharitably by reason of these friendship which be only friendship and yet point to a warmer regard than the world consent that friend may feel but there be never a man of all the man who love mercy who do not feel himself spite of all she frank and loving intimacy withhold debar separate from she at a certain point as if there stand draw up there a cordon of viewless spirit the one grief above which she could not wholly rise which at time smite she and bow she down be she sense of she loss in be childless the heart of mother be larger in she even than the heart of wife she longing for child of she own be so great that it be often more than she could bear to watch little child at they play she stand sometimes at she window at dusk and watch the poor labor man and woman go home lead or carry they child and it seem as if she heart would break everywhere she eye note the swarm group of child poor uncared for so often unwelcome and she say sadly to herself so many so many and not one for I yet she never feel any desire to adopt child she distrust she own patience and justice too much and she fear too deeply the development of hereditary trait which she could not conquer i might find that i have take a liar she think and i should hate he as she reach middle age this unsatisfied desire cease to be so great a grief she become more and more like a motherly friend to the young people surround she she house be a home to they all and she reproduce in she own life very nearly the relation which parson dorrance have hold to the young people of danby she friend lizzy hunter be now the mother of four girl all in they first young womanhood they all strive eagerly for the privilege of live with aunt mercy and go in turn to spend whole season with she on stephen white 's thirty-sixth birthday he mother die the ten year which have pass since mercy leave he have grow harder and harder day by day but he bear the last as silently and patiently as he bear the first and mr white 's last word to the gray-haired man who bent over she bed be -- you have be a good boy steve -- a good boy you 'll have some rest now since the day he bid good-by to mercy in the room from which parson dorrance have just be bury stephen have never write to she never hear from she except as all the world hear from she in she publish writings these he read eagerly and keep they carefully in scrap-book he take great delight in collect all the copy of she verse sometimes a little verse of hers would go the round of the newspaper for month and each reappearance of it be a new pleasure to stephen he know most of they by heart and he feel that he know mercy still as well as he know she when she look up in he face on the night of he mother 's death he write to she these word : -- mercy -- it be ten year since we part i love you as i love you then i shall never love any other woman i be free now my mother have die this night may i come and see you i ask nothing of you except to be you friend can i not be that stephen if a ghost of one dead for ten year have enter she presence mercy have hardly be more startled stephen have cease to be a personality to she strive very earnestly with herself to be kind and to do for this stranger whom she know not what would be the very best and most healing thing for he soul mercy write to he as follow : -- dear stephen -- you note be a very great surprise to I i be most heartily thankful that you be at last free to live you life like other man i think that the future ought to hold some very great and good gift in store for you to reward you for you patience i have never know any human be so patient as you you must forgive I for say that i do not believe it be possible for we to be friend i could be yours and would be glad to be so but you could not be mine while you continue so to set I apart from all other woman as you say you do in you affection i be truly grieve that you do this and i hope that in you new free life you will very soon find other relation which will make you forget you old one with I i do you a great harm but we be both ignorant of we mistake i pray that it may yet be repair and that you may soon be at rest in a happy home with a wife and child then i should be glad to see you : until then it be not best yours most honestly mercy until he read this letter stephen have not know that secretly in the bottom of he heart he riad all these year cherish a hope that there might yet be a future in store for he and mercy now by the new sense of desolation which he feel he know that there must have be a little more life than he think leave in he to die as soon as he mother be bury he close the house and go abroad there he roam about listlessly from country to country for many year acquire a certain desultory culture and buy so far as he income would permit every thing he see which he think mercy would like then he go home buy the old jacob house back again and fit it up in every respect as mercy have once suggest this do he sit down to wait -- for he know not what he have a vague feeling that he would die soon and leave the house and he small fortune to mercy and she would come and spend she summer there and so he would recall to she they old life together he lead the life of a hermit -- rarely go out and still more rarely see any one at home he look like a man of sixty rather than like one of fifty he be fast become a invalid more however from the lack of purpose and joy than from any disease life have be very hard to stephen nothing seem more probable contrast he listless figure gray hair and jaded face with mercy 's full fresh countenance and bound elasticity than that he dream of go first and leave to she the gift of all he have would be realize but he be destine to outlive she by many a long year mercy 's death be a strange one she have go with two of lizzy hunter 's daughter to spend a few week in one of the small white mountain village which be a favorite haunt of hers the day after they arrival a two day ' excursion to some of the mountain be propose and mercy though not feel well enough to join it herself insist that the girl should go they be reluctant to leave she but with she usual vehemence she resist all they protestation and compel they to join the party she be thus leave alone in a house crowd with people all of whom be stranger to she some of they recollect afterward to have notice she sit on the piazza at sunset look at the mountain with a expression of great delight but no one speak with she and no one miss she the next morning when she do not come to breakfast late in the forenoon the landlady come run in great terror and excitement to one of the guest exclaim : that lady that come yesterday be die the chambermaid could not get into she room nor get any answer so we break open the door the doctor say she 'll never come to again helpless the village doctor and the servant and the landlady and as many of the guest as could crowd into the little room stand around mercy 's bed it seem a sad way to die surround by stranger who do not even know she name but mercy be unconscious it make no difference to she she heavy breathing tell only too well the nature of the trouble this can not be the first attack she have have say the doctor and it be find afterward that mercy have tell lizzy hunter of she have twice have threatening of a paralytic seizure if only i die at once she have say to lizzy i would rather go that way than in most other i dread the die part of death i do not want to know when i be go and she do not all day she breathing grow slower and more labor and at night it stop in a few hour there settle upon she feature a expression of such perfect peace that each one who come to look at she steal away reverent and subdue the two old crone who have come to lay out the body creep about on tiptoe they usual garrulity quench by the sad and beautiful spectacle it be a singular thing that no one know the name of the stranger who have die thus suddenly and alone in the confusion of they arrival mercy have omit to register they name in the smaller white mountain house this formality be not rigidly enforce and so it come to pass that this woman so well know so widely beloved lay a night and a day dead within a few hour ' journey of she home as unknown as if she have be cast up from a shipwrecked vessel on a strange shore the two old crone sit with the body all night and all the next day they sew on the quaint garment in which it be still the custom of rural new england to robe the dead they put a cap of stiff white muslin over mercy 's brown hair which even now in she fiftieth year show only here and there a silver thread they lay fine plait of the same stiff white muslin over she breast and cross she hand above they she must ha ' be a handsome woman in she time mis ' bunker i ` spect she be marry do not you say ann sweetser mr bunker 's spinster cousin who always help she on these occasion well this ere ring look like it reply mr bunker take up a bit of the muslin and rub the broad gold band on the third finger of mercy 's left hand but yer can not aller tell by that nowadays there be folk wear 'em that be not marry this be a real harndsome ring 's heavy 's ever i see how mercy 's heart must have be touch and also she fine and pathetic sense of humor if she free spirit hover still in that little low-roofed room this cast-off garment of hers so carefully honor so curiously consider and speculate upon by these simple-minded people there be something rarely dramatic in all the surroundings of these last hour among the guest in the house be one a woman herself a poet who toward the end of the second day come into the chamber bring long trail vine of the sweet linnea which be then in full bloom she poet 's heart be move to the depths by the thought of this unknown dead woman lie there tend by stranger ' hand she gaze with a inexplicable feeling of affection upon mercy 's placid brow she lift the lifeless hand and lay they down again in a less constrain position she too note the broad gold ring and say -- she have be love then i wonder if he be alive the door be close and no one be in the room with a strange impulse she could not account for to herself she say i will kiss she for he and bent and kiss the cold forehead then she lay the fragrant vine around the face and across the bosom and go away feel a inexplicable sense of nearness to the woman she have kiss when the next morning she know that it be mercy philbrick the poet in whose lifeless presence she have stand she exclaim with a burst of tear oh i might have know that there be some subtile bond which make I kiss she i have always love she verse so on the day after lizzy hunter return from mercy 's funeral stephen white call at she house and ask to speak to she she have almost forget he existence though she know that he be live in the jacob house they path never cross and lizzy have long ago forget she passing suspicion of mercy 's regard for he the haggard and bow man who meet she now be so unlike the stephen white she recollect that lizzy involuntarily exclaim stephen take no notice of she exclamation no thank you i will not sit down he say as with almost solicitude in she face she offer he a chair i merely wish to give you something of -- he hesitate -- mr philbrick 's he draw from he breast a small package of papers yellow crease old he unfold
