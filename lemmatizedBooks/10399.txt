wild flower in summer and sweep with fierce storm in the winter-time be write the life story of loui riel chance be not blind when she give as a field to this man 's ambition the plain whereon vengeful chippewa and ferocious sioux have wage they battle for so many century a country dye so often with blood that at last red river come to be its name but while we task be to present the career of this apostle of insurrection and unrest stir as we may be to feeling of horror for the misery the tumult the terror and the blood of which he have be the author we must not neglect to do he even he the justice which be he right he be not as so many suppose a half-breed move by the vengeful irresponsible savage blood in he vein mr edward jack -lrb- footnote : i can not make out what mr jack 's view be respect riel when i ask he he simply turn he face toward the sky and make some remark about the weather i know that he have strong french proclivity though the blood of a scottish bailie be in he vein -rrb- of new brunswick who be well inform on all canadian matter hand I some passage which he have translate from m tasse 's book on canadian in the north west and from these i learn that riel 's father whose name also be loui be bear at the island of la crosse in the north-west territory this parent be the son of jean baptiste riel who be a french canadian and a native of berthier -lrb- _ en haut _ -rrb- he mother that be the rebel 's grandmother be a franco-montagnaise meti from this it will be see that instead of be a half breed loui riel be only one-eighth indian or be if we might use the phrase employ in describe a mixture of ethiopian and caucasian blood a octoroon nay more than this we have it show that we rebel can lay claim to no small share of respectability as that word go during the summer of 1822 riel 's father then in he fifth year be bring to canada by he parent who cause the ceremony of baptism to be perform with much show at berthier in 1838 m riel _ pere _ enter the service of the hudson bay company and leave lower canada where he have be attend school for the north-west he be station at rainy lake but do not care for he occupation he return therefore to civilization and enter as a novice in the community of the oblat father where he remain for two year there be a strong yearning for the free wild life of the boundless prairie in this man and red river with its herd of roam buffalo its myriad of duck and goose and prairie hen begin to beckon he home again he follow he impulse and depart join the meti hunter in they great biennial campaign against the herd over the rolling prairie many a buffalo fall upon the plain with loui riel 's arrow quiver in he flank many a feast be hold around the giant pot at which no hunter receive honor so marked as stolid male and olive-skinned bright-eyed supple female accord he surfeit for the time of the luxury of the limitless plain riel take rest and then a girl with the lustrous eye of normandy begin to smile upon he and to besiege he heart with all she mysterious force of coquetry he be not proof and the hunter soon lay entangled in the mesh of the brown girl of the plain in the autumn of 1843 he marry she she name be julie de lagimodiere a daughter of jean baptiste de lagimodiere loui _ pere _ be now engage as a carder of wool and have much ability in contrivance he construct a little model of a card mill which with much enthusiasm he exhibit to some officer of the hudson bay company but the company though have a great body possess no soul and the disappointed inventor return to he wait wife with sorrow in he eye he next betook himself to the cultivation of a farm upon the bank of the little seine and he good patient wife when the autumn come toil with he all day with she sickle among the sheaf till the soil prove too laborious and he determine to erect a grist mill but the stream that run through the clayey channel of the _ seine petite _ be too feeble to turn the ponderous wheel so he be oblige to move twelve mile to the east where flow another small stream bear the aesthetic name grease river this be not large enough either for he purpose so with stupendous enterprise he cut a canal nine mile long and through it decoy the water of the little seine into the arm of the greasy paramour at this mill be ground the grain that grow for many a mile around and in a little while loui riel become know as the most enterprising and important settler in red river but he be not through all he career a man of peace the most deadly feud have grow up through many long year between the hudson bay company and the meti settle upon they territory and it be only bald justice to say that the reprisal of the half-breed the revolt the hatred of everything in official shape be not altogether undeserved loui riel be at the head of many a jarring discord how such a unfortunate condition grow we shall see later on and we may also be able to determine if there be any shoulder upon which we can lay blame for the murder and misery that since have blighted one of the fairest portion of canada loui riel the elder be in due time bless with a son the same about whom it be we painful duty to write this little book estimating at its fullest the value of education the father be keenly anxious for a opportunity to send _ loui fil _ to a school but fortune have not be liberal with he in later year though the sweat be constantly upon he brow and he good wife 's finger be never still this son have unusual precocity and stranger who look upon he use to say that a great fire slumber in he eye he be bright quick and piquant and it be say that it be impossible to know the lad and not be please with he person and manners one important eye have observe he many a time and this be the great ecclesiastical dignitary of red river monseigneur tache he conceive a strong affection for the lad and resolve to secure for he a sound education he own purse be limited but there be a lady whom he know upon whose bounty he could count i give the follow extract which i translate from m tasse 's book and i write it in italics that it may be the more clearly impressed upon the reader 's mind when he come to peruse the first story of blood which shall be relate : _ the father 's resource do not permit he to undertake the expense of this education but he grace archbishop tache have be strike with the intellectual precocity of loui find a generous protector of proverbial munificence for he in the person of madame masson of terrebonne _ in later year it be reserve to the same bishop to go out as a mediator between government and a band of rebel which have at its head a man whose hand be redden with the blood of a settler this rebel and murderer be the same lad upon whom the bishop have lavish he affection and he interest loui the elder be travel upon the plain when he meet he son bind for the civilized east to enter upon he study he have pride in the lad and say to he companion that one day he know he would have occasion to glory in he they say good-bye the father season the parting with wholesome word of advice the son with filial submission receive they and store they away in he heart this be they last parting and they last speaking before the son have be long at he study he learn that he father be dead he nature be deeply affectionate and the painful intelligence overwhelm he for many day at school he be not distinguish for brilliancy but he tutor observe that he have solid part and much intellectual subtlety he be not a great favorite among he class-mate generally because he manners be shy and reserved and he shrink from rather than court the popularity and leadership which be the darling aim of so many lad in they school-day yet he have many friend who be warmly attach to he and to these he return a equal affection one of he comrade be stricken down with a loathsome and fatal malady and all he comrade flee in fear away from he presence but loui riel the half-breed as the boy know he bravely go to the couch of he stricken friend nursing and bestow all he attention and affection upon he and offer console word it be related that when the last moment come the sufferer arise and fling he arm around loui ' neck pour out he thanks and besought heaven to reward he then he fall backwards and die frequently young riel 's school-mate would ask he what do you intend do when you leave school will you stay here or do you go out again into the wilderness among the savage he eye would lighten with indignation at hear the word savage apply to he people i will go out to the red river he would reply to follow in the footstep of my father he have be a benefactor of we people and i shall seek to be they benefactor too when i tire of work i can take my gun and go out for herd upon the plain with we people whom you call savage i know not what you mean when you say savage we speak french as you do we heart be as kind as noble and as true as yours when one of we people be in affliction the other give he sympathy and help we be bind together by strong tie of fraternity there be no jealousy among we no tyranny of caste but we all live in peace and love as the sister and brother in one great household my eye deceive I if like this live you you be divide into envious brawl faction each one of which try to injure and blight the reputation of the other if one of you fall upon evil time he be leave without the sympathy and succor of the other in politics and in social grade you be divide and in every respect you be such that i should mourn the day when we peaceable simple contented people on the bank of the red river should in any respect choose you civilization for they model he often speak of a burning desire which he have to be a political as well as a social leader in the colony of red river he frequently likewise mutter dark threat against the overbearing policy and dark injustice of the great monopoly as he use to characterize the hudson bay company occasionally he would burst out into passionate word like these : they treat we as they would blood thirsty savage upon the plain they spurn we with they foot as dog and then they spit upon we they mock at we custom they regard with contempt that which to we be sacred and above price they be not even deter by the virtue of we woman now witness you god who make all man the white man and the savage i will if the propitious day ever come strike in vengeance and my blow will be with a iron hand whose one smite shall wipe out all the injustice and the dishonor fill with these sentiment when he school day come to a end he pack he portmanteau and take he way by stage and boat for the region that not many year hence be to ring and shudder with he name chapter ii long before the vision of a confederation of the british province enter into the brain of any man lord selkirk come to the wild of north america find a tract of country fertile in soil and fair to look upon he arrive in this unknown wilderness when it be summer and all the prairie extend over illimitable stretch till it be lose in the tranquil horizon be burn with the bloom of a hundred variety of flower here the tiger rise like some savage queen of beauty rise to he knee and breathe she sultry balm in he face aloof stand the shy wild rise shed its scent with delicate reserve but the wild pea and the convolvulus and the augur flower and the insipid daisy run riot through all the grass land and surfeit he nostril with they sweet here and there upon the mellow level stand a clump of poplar or white oak prim like virgin without suitor with they robe draw close about they but when over the unmeasured plain the wind blow they bow they head : as if salute the stranger who come to find a colony in the wilderness of which they be sentinel here too in the hush for the first time the planter 's ear hear a far-off nigh indistinct sound of gallop thunder he know not what it mean and he follower surmise that it might be the tumult of some distant waterfall bear hither now because a storm be at hand and the denser air be a better carrier of the sound and while they remain wonder what it could be for the thunder be ever become louder and nearer clearer deadlier than before lo out of the west come what seem as a dim shadow move across the plain with bated breath they watch the dark mass move along like some destroy tempest with ten thousand devil at its core chained to the ground with a terrible awe they stand fast for many minute till at last in the dim light for the gloaming have come upon the plain they see eye-ball that blaze like fire head crest with rugged uncouth horn and shaggy mane and then snout thrust down flare nostril and rear tail my god a buffalo herd and we 'll be trample to death almost shriek one of the earl 's follower peace keep cool up up instantly into these tree and the word be obey as if each man be a instrument of the leader 's will beyond in the south-east a full moon luscious seem as some ripened mellow fruit be rise and the yellow light be all over the plain then the tremendous mass head by maddened bull with blaze eye and foam nostril drive onward toward the south like a unchained hurricane some of the terrify beast run against the tree crush horn and skull and fall prone upon the plain to be trample into jelly by the hundred of thousand in the rear the tree upon which the earl have take refuge receive many a shock from a crazed bull and it seem to the party from the tree-branch as if all the face of the plain be be hurl toward the south in a condition of the wildest turmoil hell itself let loose could present no such spectacle as this myriad mass of brute life sweep over the lonely plain under the wan elfin light of the new-risen moon cloud of steam wreathing itself into spectral shape of sullen aspect rise from the dusky writhe mass and the flaming of more than ten thousand eyeball in the gloom present a picture more terrible than ever come into the imagination of the writer of the inferno the spectacle as observe by those some twenty foot from the ground might be liken somewhat to a turbulent sea when a sturdy tide set against the storm and the mad wave tumble hither and thither foiled and impel yet for all the confusion and obstruction move in one direction with a sweep and a force that no power could chain circling among and around the strange dusk cloud of steam that go up from the herd be score of turkey buzzard they obscene head bent downward they sodden eye gleam with expectancy well they know that many a gorgeous feast await they wherever boulder tree or swamp lay in the path of the mighty herd at last the face of the prairie have cease its surge no lurid eyeball-light gleam out of the dusk and the tempest of cattle have pass the _ voyageur _ and go roll out into the unbounded stretch of the dim yellow plain the morrow 's sun reveal a strange spectacle the great amplitude of rich green grass warm and beautify by the petal of flower be as a ploughed field the herbage have be literally crush into mire and this the innumerable hoof have churn up with the soft rich dark soil of the prairie the leguminous odour from decay clover and rank mat mass of wild pea the feverish exhalation of the tiger-lily and of the rich blooded buffalo lilac together with the dank earthy smell from the broken sod be disagreeable and oppressive lord selkirk 's heart sink within he at see the ruin i fear I he say to plant a colony here a herd of these beast come upon a settlement would be worse than ten thousand spear but some of he guide have before see the impetuous rush of the herd and they assure he that this might not occur again in this portion of the prairie for a quarter of a century to come at any rate they persist the buffalo keep away from region that send up chimney-smoke the chief regret by-and-by will be that the herd will not come near enough to we and the earl be reassure and proceed with the step preliminary to found the colony it need not be say that the place we have be describe be the prairie on the bank of the red river in a little while ship bear number of sturdy scotchman begin to cross the sea bind for this famous colony where the land be ready for the plough and mighty herd of wild cattle graze knee-deep among gorgeous flower and sweet grass they bring few white woman with they the larger number be young man who have bid they heeland lassie good-bye with warm kiss promise to come back for they when they have build homestead for themselves in the far away wild of the west but when lord selkirk plant here he sturdy scotchman wild beast and game be not the only inhabitant of the plain the cree a well-built active war-loving race have from age long forget roam over these interminable meadow fishing in the stream and hunting buffalo here and there be to be find one of they town a straggle congregation of tent make of the skin of the buffalo beautiful dark-skinned girl in bare brown little foot sit through the cool of evening in the summer day sew bead upon the moccasin of they lover while the wrinkled dame limp about forever quarrel with the dog perform the household duty but the cree like not the encroachment upon they territory by these foreign man with pale face and they hold loud pow-wow and brandish spear and sweep they knife about they head till they sheen gleam many mile over the prairie then prepare they paint they set out to learn from the pale-faced chief what be he justification for the invasion you can not take land without war and conquest be the word of a young chief with a nose like a hawk 's beak and a eye like the eagle 's to lord selkirk you do not fight we therefore you do not conquer we how come it then that you have we land be you the owner of this territory calmly enquire the nobleman we be no one else be the owner but i shall shew you that from two standpoint first from my own and afterwards from yours it belong not to you firstly it belong to we common sovereign the king of england you belong to he so likewise do the buffalo that graze upon the plain and the fish that swim in the river therefore we great and good sovereign sayeth unto I he devoted subject ` go you forth into my territory in the north of america and select there a colony whereon to plant any of my faithful child who choose to go thither ' i have do so then since you hold possession of these plain only by the bounty and sufferance of we good father the king how can you object to you white brethren come when they be permit so to do ugh that be only the oily-tongued talk of the pale-face while seem to speak fair and smooth and wise they tongue be as crooked as the horn of the mountain-goat yet no chief could answer the earl 's contention and they look from one to another with some trace of confusion and defeat upon they face but continue lord selkirk in the same grave and firm voice from you own standpoint you be not the proprietor of this territory the saulteux with whom you wage you constant war have be upon these plain as long as you in time of peace you have intermarry with they and i now find in you wigwam many a squaw obtain from among the village of you rival ugh they could not deny this it be evident from they silence and the abject way in which they glance from one to another that the case have go against they but there be no reason for you jealousy or you hostility lord selkirk continue we people come among you not as conqueror but as brother they shall not molest you but quietly till the field and raise they crop instead of show unfriendliness i think you should take they by the hand and welcome they as brother these word at last prevail and the cree put by they war paint and come among the whites and offer they fish and buffalo steak thus be the colony found the grain grow well and there be abundance in the new settlement save that at interval a army of locust would come out of the west and destroy every green leaf then the settler ' need be sore and they be oblige to subsist upon root and what fall to they from the chase many year roll on and the sturdy scotch settler have drive they root fast into the ground one alone of all the number who have kiss good-bye to he scottish sweetheart return to redeem he pledge for the rest they soon forget the rosy cheek and bright blue eye that they have leave behind they in the pleasure of the chase upon the plain and the interest in they wide acre but these perhaps be not the only reason why they have forget they vow to the scottish girl among the cree be many beautiful maiden with large velvety eye black as the night when no moon be over the prairie and shy as a fawn 's when first the white man come amongst they the girl be bashful and when he go into the cree ' tent they would shrink away hide they face but it soon become apparent that the shyness be not indifference indeed many a time when the scotch hunter pass a red man 's tent he see a pair of eye look languishingly after he little by little the timidity begin to disappear and sometimes the brown-skinned girl come in number to the white man 's dwelling and submit themselves to be teach how to dance the cotillion and the eight-hand reel then follow the woo among the flowery prairie and the white man begin to pledge they troth to the dusky girl many a brave hunter who have a score of scalp to dangle from he belt seek but seek in vain a kind glance from some beautiful maiden of he tribe who before the pale face come would have deem great indeed the honor of become the spouse of a warrior so distinguished jealousy begin to fill the heart of the cree but the mother and wife and the daughter too be constant mediator and never cease to exert themselves for peace when say they the white-face first come among we we chief and we young man all cry out ' o they deem themselves to be a better race than we they think they white blood be better than we red blood they will not mingle with we although they will join with we in hunting we wild meat or eat it after it have fall to we arrow or spear they will not consider one of we daughter fit for marriage with one of they because it would blend they blood with we blood ' now o you chief and young man that which you at the first consider a hardship if it do not come to pass have come to pass and yet you complain ` the whites be above marry we daughter ' you first cry now you plan revenge because they want to marry and do marry they the argument use by the woman be too strong and the brawny eagle-eyed hunter be compel to mate themselves with the ugly girl of the tent it be assert by some writer on the north-west that the beauty observe in the meti woman in after year be in great part to be attribute to the fact that the english settler take to wife only the most beautiful of the indian girl now and again too the canny scotch lad with he gun on he shoulder and he retriever at he heel would walk through a saulteux settlement the girl here be still shyer than they cree cousin but they be not a whit less lovely they be not dumpy like so many indian girl but be slight of build and willowy of motion they hair be long and black but it be as fine as silk and shone like the plumage of a blackbird there be not that oily swarthiness in the complexion which make so many indian woman hideous in the eye of a connoisseur of beauty but the cheek of these girl be a pale olive and sometimes when they be excite a faint tinge of rise come out like the delicate pink flush that appear in the olive-grey of the morning and these maiden too begin to cast languish eye upon the pale-faced stranger and sigh all the day while they sew fringe upon they skirt and bead upon they moccasin they affection now be not for he who show the largest number of wolf ' tongue or enemy ' scalp but for the gracious stranger with he gentle manners and win way they soon begin to put themselves in he way when he come to shoot chicken or quail among the grass would point out to he pass lead around the swamp and inform he where he might find elk or wild turkey then with half shy yet half coquettish air and a lurk tenderness in they great dusk hazel eye they would twist a sprig off a crown of golden rod and with they dainty little brown finger pin it upon the hunter 's coat with shy curiosity they would smoothe the cloth weave in paisley form in they mind a contrast between its elegance and that of the coat of they own red gallant make of the rough skin of the wolf or the bison so it come to pass that in due season most of the pretty girl among the jump indian have go with triumph and great love in they heart from the wigwam of they tribe to be the wife of the whites in they stately dwelling in this way up-grew the settlement of red river by such intermarriage be the affection of the red man all over the plain from the cold gloomy region of the north to the mellow plain of the south win by they pale-faced neighbor the savage have not shut they ear to what they woman have so eloquently urge and they would say : the cause of these pale people be we cause they interest be we interest they have mingle they flesh and blood with ours we shall be they faithful brother to the death it be this fact not the wisdom of government indian agent nor the heaven-born insight of government itself into the management of tribe that so long preserved peace and good will throughout we north-west territory it be for this reason that enemy of government in the republic could say after they have reveal the corruption of red cloud and black rock agent : observe the canadian tribe mighty in number and warlike in they nature they fight not because they have be manage with wisdom and humanity there be no corruption among the accredit official there be no sinister deal towards they by the government we do not charge we official with corruption neither do we believe that they administration have be feeble -- on the whole we attitude towards the indian people have be fair we policy have reveal ordinary sense -- and not much brilliancy probably half a dozen level-headed wood-chopper endow with authority to deal with the tribe could have acquit themselves as well perhaps they might not have do so well and it be probable that they might have exhibit a better show it be in this settlement that in after year appear loui riel _ pere _ for some generation the hudson bay company have carry on a extensive trade in peltry and number of they _ employe _ be french peasant or _ coureur de bois _ thousand of these people be scatter here and there over the territory and they begin to turn loving eye toward the rich meadow along the bank of the red river some of these have for wife squaw whom they have woo and win during they engagement in the peltry trade these finding that other whites have take indian girl for bride feel draw towards the new settlement by sentiment stronger than those of mere interest number of unmarried french take up farm in the new colony and soon fall captive to the charm of the cree girl now and again the history of the simple-hearted scot be repeat and a _ coureur _ be presently see to bring a shy witching saulteux maiden from the tent of the jump indian but the french it must be say be not so _ dilettante _ in they taste for beauty as be they scottish brethren yet as a rule they wife be the prettiest girl in the tribe -- after of course braw john have be satisfy -- for a ugly maiden be content to have a indian for she lord and she try no art pluck no bouquet from the prairie flower bead no moccasin and perform no tender little office to catch the heart of the white man pale face get all the pretty squaw suppose we must take 'em ugly one ugh this be the speech and the true speech of many a chief or lion-hearted young man of the tribe under the new order at red river this may seem hard to the poor indian but perhaps it be just as well it would have indeed be worse have the handsome maiden give she hand to the dusky red and afterwards woo by blue eye give she heart where she hand could never go and the indian woman be no better and no worse than she kind no matter what the color be happier then be the lot of the indian with he homely affectionate wife than with a bride with rose in she cheek and sunlight in she eye who can not resist the plead eye and the outstretched arm of one whose woo be unlawful and the result of which can be nought but wrong and misery the population grow and comfort increase till eighteen or twenty thousand soul could be reckon in the colony the original whites have disappear and no face be to be see but that of a meti in any of the cosy dwelling in the settlement these people have not yet learn that amongst the whites whose blood know no alloy they be regard as a debased sort and unfit socially to mix with those who have keep they race free from taint the female fruitage of the mixture lose nothing by acquire some of the caucasian stock but the man in numerous case seem to be inferior for the blending in appearance they be inane in speech laconic they be shy in manners and reserve to boorishness while in intellectual alertness they be inferior to the boisterous savage or the shrewd dignified white but the woman perpetuate the shy win coyness of she red mother and the art and somewhat of the refinement of she white father the eye be not so dusk it gleam more : as if the ray from a star have be shoot through it there be the same olive cheek but it be not so tawny for the dawn of the white blood have appear in it she gain in symmetry too be taller than she red mother while she preserve the soft willowy motion of the prairie-elk but the woman be not good housekeeper and many a traveller have go into the house of a meti and see there a bride witchingly beautiful with she hair unkempt and disorder about she shoulder she boot unlaced and she stock down reveal she bare exquisitely-turned ankle a cinderellum he would exclaim but by heaven i swear a thousand time more lovely if she have a child it would likely be find sprawl among the coal and help itself to handful of ash the little creature would be sure to escape the suspicion of ever have be wash ask the luminous-eyed mother for anything for a knife to cut you tobacco for a cup to get a drink of water and the sweet sloven would be oblige to ransack two-third of the article of the house to find what you seek the dress worn by herself as well as by she husband or she brother would not be less astonishing to the unaccustomed eye the man wear a common blue capote a red belt and corduroy trousers this however soon become the costume of every male in red river whether meti or new-come canadian there be however a distinction in the manner of wear lest the canadian should be take for a meti he wear the red belt over the capote while the half-breed wear it beneath the woman be fond of show and like to attire themselves in dark skirt and crimson bodice frequently if the entire dress be dark they tie a crimson or a magenta sash around they handsomely shapen waist and they put a cap of some denomination of red upon they head such color it need not be say add to they beauty and it be by no means uncertain that this be the reason why they adopt these color some writer say that they love of glare color be derive from the savage side of they nature but the meti woman have a artistic instinct of they own and be for the greater part coquette it may very safely be say that accord to the fitness of thing be it that they attire themselves but they be not able to shake off the superstition of they race if the young woman soon to be a mother see a hawk while cross the field in the morning she come home and tell among she female friend that she offspring be to be a son and they all know that he be to be fleet and endure in the chase and that he will have the eye of a hunter chief but if a shy pigeon circle up from the croft and cross she path she sigh and return not back to relate the omen and it be only in undertone that she nearest friend learn a week afterwards that the promise addition to the household be to be a girl the appearance of other bird and beast under similar circumstance be likewise token and though boy would be bear and girl too if all the hawk and pigeon and fox and wild goose and every other presage bird and beast of the plain have fall to the gun of huntsman and sport they cling to the belief and the superstition will only die with the civilization that beget it many of the custom of they red mother they still reverently perpetuate but they be for all this deeply overlaid with canadianism of all the woman on the face of the earth they be the greatest gossip not in they whole nature be there any impulse so strong as the love to talk therefore when the morning 's meal be end the pretty mother lace the boot around she shapely little ankle put she blanket about she and sally out to one of she friend 's house for the morning 's gossip in speaking of she dress i neglect to state that although the meti woman have for gown the costliest fabric ever weave in cashmere she would not be content on the hottest summer day in walk twenty pace to she neighbor 's door unless she have this blanket upon she the hateful look garment be the chief relic of she barbaric origin and despite the desire which she always manifest to exhibit she personal charm at they best she have no qualm in convert herself into a hideous repulsive squaw with this cover if she be of a shy nature she will cover she head with this garment when a stranger enter she abode and many a curious visitor who have hear of the bright eye and olive cheek of the half-breed woman be sorely disappoint when draw near to she on the prairie path or in the village street to see she pull the hideous blanket over she face while he pass she by not always will she do this for the wild woman of the plain and the half breed beauty find a strong charm in strange face and after she have receive some little attention and a few trinket or trifle she will be ready enough to appoint a tryst upon the flowery prairie under the mellow moon we might forgive she for all this if she could but restrain she tongue from morn to noon from noon to dewy eve this unruly member go on prattle about every conceivable thing especially the affair of she neighbor we have see that she go out after she have eat she breakfast and she return not till she appetite begin to be oppressive she will then kiss she dusky little offspring who during she absence have likely enough try to stuff himself with coal and then play with the pig in the evening one be pretty certain to find at some house a fiddler and a dance party which end with a bountiful supper though frequently if the refreshment include whiskey the party terminate with a regulation irish row at nearly every such dance there be a white lad or two and they be certain to monopolize the attention and the kiss of the prettiest girl as the indian have to sit by and see the white man come and take away the most beautiful of the wild girl so too must the half-breed bear with meekness the preference of the meti belle for the caucasian stranger the moral of the woman be not over good nor can they be say to be very bad amongst each other they virtue reach a standard as high as that which prevail in we canadian community it be when the woman be bring into contact with the white man that this standard lower then come the temptation the sin the domestic heartburning and the hatred towards those who tempt to the fall the half-breed young man be fatally fond of show the highest aim of they social existence seem to be to possess a dashing horse or two and to drive a cariole it be state on excellent authority that a young man who wish to figure as a _ beau _ and to get the smile of the pretty girl will sometimes sell all he useful possession to purchase a horse and cariole but it must not be suppose that this sort of spirit pervade the entire community a large portion of the people be thrifty and frugal and maintain themselves by continuous well-directed toil the french half breed profess the roman catholic religion and they have a number of church at the head of the roman communion be archbishop tache of st boniface this be the gentleman who provide the munificence for loui riel 's education he be the same bishop whose name so many hundred of thousand of we people can not recall without bitterness and indignation chapter iii such then be the condition of red river before the person who be the subject of this book appear upon the scene but perhaps it be as well that i should relate one occurrence which fan into bright flame the smoulder ember of discord between the half-breed and they white neighbor a officer of the hudson bay company live at a isolate post have two daughter as they begin to arrive toward young-womanhood he be anxious that they should have a education in order that they might in proper season be able to take they position in society there be good school at red river and thither the officer send he daughter place they under the care of a guardian whom he know would exercise a authority as judicious as he own the two girl be remarkably handsome and whenever they walk through the settlement or drive abroad with they guardian they attract all the attention many a half-dusky heart be smitten of they white skin which he would compare in color to the pure snow that cover the plain now have the face of the red river beauty be parian white instead of dusky olive the young _ beau _ of the settlement would not have find they heart beat half so wildly about the two pale daughter of the hudson bay company 's officer they would indeed have languish for chestnut eye and complexion of spain and the southern vineyard of

and give and receive burn kiss during the sweet fast-fleeting hour on the calm plain in she lover 's arm with no witness but the yellow moon she take no heed of the barrier that lay between a union with she beloved nor have he any foreboding of obstacle but hear and declare vow of love supremely happy woman be a sort of pandora 's box the lid whereof be be forever raise reveal the secret within the plighted maiden be flush of cheek and unusually bright of eye when she return to she home that evening she could give she guardian no satisfactory account of she long absence and tell a very confused story about two path you know that be very much alike but that one lead away around a poplar wood and out upon a portion of the prairie which she do not know here the sweet pet have get astray and wander around although it be so silly till the sound of the bell of st boniface toll ten have apprise she of the hour and also let she know where she be she guardian take the explanation and contented himself with observe that he hope it would be she last evening upon the prairie stray around like a elk that have lose she mate jennie say she sister when they be alone you have not be

who in the first flush of passion be prepare to go through fire or die at the stake for the man she love withal -- but that the propriety forbid it -- whenever young woman make these dramatic declaration the most appropriate course would be to give they a sound spanking and put a end to the tragic business nellie think it she duty and i suppose it be to tell she bear-like guardian what have befall to she sister he be less disturb on hear the intelligence than nellie suppose and merely express some cold-blooded surprise at the presumption of the half-breed he sit at he desk and take a sheet of paper write this letter : to alexander saunder : dear sir -- would you be good enough to call at my house this evening at eight o'clock yours truly thomas brown have seal and dispatch this note he resume he work without show or feel any further concern about the matter when it be grow dark over the prairie that evening the love-lorn jennie see she pleading-eyed lover pass along in the shadow of the poplar toward she guardian 's house she hear he ring at the door and he step in the hall she heart be in a great flutter but she sister be at she side give she comfort the door be wide open but everything be so husht that the girl could plainly hear the follow word speak in the guardian 's library : i understand mr saunder that you have be take the astonishingly presumptuous course of solicit the hand of one of my ward i be not give to severity or i do not exactly know how i ought to resent a act which exhibit such a forgetfulness of what you attitude should be towards a person in the station of my ward you be merely a half-breed you be half-indian and for that matter might as well be indian altogether my ward 's position be such that the bare idea of such a union be revolting she be a lady by birth and by education and be destine for a social sphere into which you could never and ought never enter you may now go sir but you must remember that you ignorance be the only palliation of you presumption laurie show this young man the way out o my god what will become of I sob poor jennie i can not live o i will go after he i will fly with he i can not endure this

grief find word and we leave she alone with she sore heart while we follow the reject suitor he walk swiftly down the lawn turn not he eye or he might have see in the window he lover stretch implore arm toward he all he blood be run madly in he vein and it burn like fire he heart be hot and he temple throb so i be only a half-breed and might as well be all indian for that matter o god a despise half-breed they have show the fang at last we now see how they regard we and he go forth among he friend and tell the story of the insult and humiliation a thousand half-breed heart that night in red river burn with vengeance against the white man french meti and english meti alike have feel the sting of the indignity and these two body sunder before through petty cause now unite in a brotherhood of hate against the white population it need no further word to shew how ready these dusky people would be to rise and follow a crafty leader who cry out : we be despise by these white people we want no social or political alliance with they we shall live apart rather than in ignominy and union with they loui riel be not ready the next morning to rise and lead the people to revolt for this occur some year before he bloody star reach the zenith but the same hatred be there year later when he turn the governor send to the colony by the dominion out of the territory and set up a authority of he own well might the french historian cognisant of the fate of the luckless suitor and the consequence of the rejection cry out with the poet : _ amour tu perdis troie _ -lrb- footnote : love thou hast conquer even troy -rrb- as for poor jennie heroic jennie who would follow she lover to death itself she submit after a few sleepless night and day that for she be without a breakfast to the mandate of the guardian and to the philosophy of she sister a little later a tall ungainly young highlander come offer himself and take to he home the poetic and tragic daughter of the company 's officer despite the blizard that sometimes come sweeping across the prairie smother belated traveller and un-roofing dwelling notwithstanding the frequent incursion from region in the far west of myriad-host of locust and grasshopper red river settlement throve in wealth and population till when the period with which i shall now deal arrive it number no fewer than 15000 soul upon the completion of the great act of the confederation of the british north american province in 1867 the attention of canadian statesman be turn to this distant colony and negotiation be open for the transfer of the territory to the dominion the back of great monopoly have now be break in 1858 england have resume its great indian empire and extinguish john company and this act have pave the way for a similar resumption of the vast prairie domain grant by king charle to the governor and company of adventurer of england trading into hudson bay the transfer be to be effect as one writer put it by a triangular sort of arrangement all territorial rights claim by the hudson bay company -- and red river lay within the company 's dominion -- be to be annul on payment of 300000 pound by canada and the country would then be hand over by royal proclamation to the dominion government the company be allow to retain only certain parcel of land in the vicinity of its trading post i may as well go upon the authority of the same writer -lrb- footnote : captain g l huyshe -rrb- the transfer be date for the 1st of December 1869 but the dominion cabinet eager to secure the rich prize appoint its minister of public work the honorable william mcdougall cb to be lieutenant-governor of the north-west territory and send he off in the month of September with instruction to proceed to fort garry with all convenient speed there to assist in the formal transfer of the territory and to be ready to assume the government as soon as the transfer be complete so far so well but let we pause just here there be something to be say even on the side of revolt and murder and let we see what it be since the foundation of the colony the people have live under the government accord to the law propound by the hudson bay company the people have establish a civilization of they own and have custom and rule which be always observe with great reverence when tiding reach they that they be to be transfer to the dominion of canada they begin to have some misgiving as to how they should fare under the new order of late year too there have come into prominence among they a man whom early in these page we see bid good-bye to he father upon the plain on he way to school in the east the fire see in young riel at the school and when he turn he face again for the prairie that he love have now reach full flame he have never cease to impress upon the people that the hudson bay company be a heartless soulless corporation and that the treatment accord to the meti be no better than might have be give to the dog upon the plain there never be public peace after the tongue of this man have begin to make noise in the settlement when therefore it become know that the canadian government have determine upon take the colony to itself a ambitious scheme of the highest daring enter into the brain of loui riel he lose no time in begin to sow seed of discontent canada he say will absorb you colony and as a people you will virtually be blot out of existence white official will come here and lord it over you the tax-gatherer will plunder the land for fund to build mighty dock and canal and bridge and costly building and numerous railroad in the east the poor half-breed will be look upon with contempt and curiosity : no custom that he regard as sacred will be respect no right which be inherently he will be acknowledge they will send they own henchman who have no sympathy in common with the half-breed to rule over we no complaint that the people make to the central government will be regard yea this new rule will fasten itself upon we as some inexorable tyrant monster drive deep its fang into a soil that have be yours so long yes you will be of _ some _ interest to they you have some handsome wife and pretty daughter and those virtuous pale-face from the east have a strong admiration for lovely woman in this respect you shall receive they attention the effect of such argument among these credulous people who see not the wily traitor behind the rich eloquent voice quiver with indignation be similar to that which would follow be you to fling a flaming torch upon the prairie in midsummer after a month of drought then the cunning deceiver go secretly to several of the lead half-breed in red river and whisper certain proposal in they ear meanwhile event be transpire which furnish just the very fuel that riel want for he fire during the summer of 1869 a survey party under colonel denni have be engage survey the country and divide it into township etc for future allotment by government accord to good authority the proceedings of this party have give great offence to the meti the unsettled state of the half-breed ' land tenure not unnaturally excited apprehension in the mind of these poor ignorant people that they land would be take from they and give to canadian immigrant then they have the burning word of loui riel ring in they ear say that the thing _ would _ be do to lend color to the mistrust some member of the survey party put up claim here and there to tract of land to which they happen to take a fancy but this be not all some of these gentleman have the habit of give the indian drink till they become intoxicated and then induce they to make choice land over to they one could not pass through any superior tract of land without observe the stake of some person or other of colonel denni 's party i foretold it cry riel go out for yourselve and see the mark they have set up bound they plunder nor be this the only grievance present to the half-breed the very survey then be carry on they look upon as a act of contempt towards themselves for riel have put it in this light the territory have not yet pass into the hand of the canadian government -- and in say this the disturber be accurate -- what right have they therefore to come here and lay down line it be as i have already tell you : you be of as much importance in the eye of the canadian authority as would be so many dog nor be these the only grievance either a big man a white living at the settlement have make himself obnoxious to the whole of red river he well know how the people hate he and he retort by say : you scurvy race be almost run presently you will get into civilized hand and be put through you facing you disrespect I but my counsel prevail at ottawa only what i recommend will the government do so that you see the settlement be very completely in my hand this man be a valuable ally to riel for almost literally do he while portend to speak for the dominion authority corroborate the allegation of the arch agitator then two official messr snow and mair send out by mr mcdougall while he be yet minister of public work have establish a intimacy with the obnoxious white man receive he hospitality and give acquiescent ear to he advice these two gentleman look upon the half-breed as savage they send letter to the newspaper describe red river and its people in term grossly unjust and inaccurate m riel get the communication and read they to the people this he say be the manner in which they describe we custom we social life and the virtue of we woman the woman toss they head haughtily we do what be right they say and they can slander we if they will we shall not prove perhaps so easy a prey to those white gallant as they seem to suppose one high-spirited girl and very beautiful vow that during the run of she life she never would speak to a white man for this insult or let he see she face yet if the gossip be to be trust before the flower bloom thrice after that upon the prairie she be sigh she sweet soul away through she great gazelle eye for love of a sturdy young englishman who have take up he abode upon the plain and better than all the young fellow married she and she be now one of the happiest not to say one of the prettiest woman in manitoba strong word of determination by a young woman be the most conclusive evidence that i know of the weakening of she resolve but messr snow and mair go on with they creditable work and to they other good deed it be allege they add that of grab choice plot of land these two man be of course know to be the accredited agent of the minister of public work and riel succeed in convince the credulous people that the minister indeed the whole government be cognizant of they act and approve of the same while public indignation be at its height it be announce that a lieutenant-governor have be appoint for red river and that the man choose be the very person through whom the chief indignity have be put upon the settlement it be also show with burn force by riel that in a matter so important as the transfer of fifteen thousand people from one particular jurisdiction to another they the people transfer have not be consult they have not he also point out be even formally apprise of the transfer this canadian government take red river and its half-breed over just as they would take over red river and fifteen thousand sheep and some of the man swear terrible oath that this change should not be without resistance and resistance to the death riel say that the determination be good chapter iv have work the unreasoning settler to this pitch riel be satisfied public feeling need but the fuse of some bold step of he to burst into instant flame as the lieutenant-governor draw near the territory the agitator be almost beside himself with excitement he neither eat nor sleep but on foot or sleigh be for ever move from one to another perfect plan or incite to tumult at the house of a prominent half-breed while the woman sit about stitch riel meet a number of the lead agitator and thus address they : there be two course open to we now one be to continue as a unorganized band of noisy disturber the other to league ourselves into a organize body for the defense and government of we country this proposal thrill the vein of he listener and pout coral-coloured female lip say softly brava a sort of fitful reflection follow the first wild burst of enthusiasm and one _ boi brule _ arise and say : far be it from I to utter one word that might dampen you ardor but let we try to take some account of the cost would not such a step be a act of rebellion and be not rebellion a treasonable offence at this point riel foam with rage arise and stop he we want no poltroonery no alarmist sentiment here he shout even though such a act be as you describe it we duty as man determine to guard they sacred rights be to take the risk but it would not be treason the transfer of a people from one government to another be not constitutional without the people 's consent the hudson 's bay company have certain rights in the unsold land of these region but no man no corporation no power can sell cede or transfer that which be not he or its own property therefore the hudson bay company have not the right to transfer we land to the dominion of canada and since we the people of red river be not the chattel of the company they can not transfer we they have sell we to the canadian government but upon the ground between the two authority will we stand and create a province of we own it may be that the dominion government will have justice enough to agree to this if they oppose we rights then i trust that there be man on red river who be not afraid to stand up for yea to die for they country this speech be receive with deafening acclamation at once a provisional government be form and at the instigation of riel john bruce who be a mere cat 's - paw be declare president riel himself take the secretaryship and very promptly the secretary raise he voice mcdougall who send he scourge here to plunder we land and to ridicule we people near we border there be no time to lose _ he must not enter _ i therefore move that the follow letter be dispatch to he by a regularly constitute member of we government : st nobert red river October 21st 1869 sir -- the national parliament of the meti of red river hereby forbid you to enter the north-west territory without a special permit from the national government this motion be carry with enthusiasm the letter be sign by the president and secretary and dispatch to pembina which be situate on the border to await the arrival at that point of the governor designate the pomp and daring of these proceedings have such a effect upon the colonist that little by little they begin to grow blind to the fact that they action be in the face of canadian authority and a invitation to a collision of arm if anyone express any fear he be either savagely silence by riel or inform that there be man enough in red river to hold the country in the face of any force that could be send against they and the military enthusiasm of the meti give some color to this latter assertion a armed force sufficient for present necessity be establish on scratch river a place about fifteen mile from fort garry here a barrier be put across the road by which mcdougall must travel to reach fort garry and beyond this the half-breed swear the pale face governor should never pass on the 30th day of October mr mcdougall arrive at pembina he be already aware that the country be seethe with tumult that colonel denni have be turn out of the territory that messr snow & mair have become hateful in the eye of the half-breed : yet he feel disposed to do little more than laugh at the whole affair he have the assurance of he mischievous envoy that the matter be a mere temporary ebullition of feeling and that he presence in the country would very soon calm the turbulent water so he say : i shall take no notice of this impertinent letter in fact it be impossible for I to recognize such a piece of presumption and deal with a communication which would be the rankest insolence but that it be so extremely ludicrous so the gallant lieutenant-governor with he official boldly cross the line and proceed towards fort garry but they be meet on they triumphant march by a detachment of fourteen armed half-breed whose spokesman say : you receive a order from the provisional government not to enter these territory when that order be pass it be the government 's intention to take care that it should be carry out yet you have force yourself in here i give you till to-morrow morning to be clear of these territory mr mcdougall 's lip begin to hang a little low the calm even polite tone of the spokesman of the party have impressed he more than bluster or rage with the next morning come the same party they make no noise but quietly take the horse of the governor 's party by the head turn they around and pack the whole of they back in this way and without so much as a loud word be the governor designate turn out of the territory every success however trivial be fuel to the courage and enthusiasm of riel 's party i have begin this matter the leader say to one of he follower and i do not mean to deal in half measure without store we can do nothing fort garry be worth we have just now but we must move circumspectly in get possession of it so it be order that he follower should proceed in two and three as if on no special mission to the desire point presently governor mctavish saw in the shadow of the fort the rebel leader and a number of follower we be desirous of enter riel say wherefore enquire the governor we can not tell you now be the reply it be enough for I to say that a great danger threaten the fort without further explanation the feeble-willed hudson bay officer permit the rebel and he follower to enter huzza they all shout when they find themselves inside the stockade and glance at tier upon tier of barrel of flour and pork and beef and molasses and upon the sack of corn and the warm clothing and better than all upon the arm and ammunition i be at last master in red river riel say to one of he follower my man can fight now for here we have at once a fortification and a base of supplies just a few word with reference to mr mcdougall and i shall dismiss he from these page he live quietly at pembina between the date of he expulsion from red river and the first day of December the latter date be fix for the transfer of the new territory to the dominion of canada so towards midnight on the 30th of November the governor-designate and he party sally forth from the line and take formal possession of the territory in the name of the government of canada there be no one stir about the prairie on the night in question for the glass shew the thermometer to be 20 degree below zero : so the gallant governor be enable to take possession without obstruction riel be now fairly intoxicate with success some of he follower would sometimes ask he if he have no fear that the canadian government would send out a large force of soldier against he he invariable reply be : they never will do this the way be too long and the march too difficult they will eventually make up they mind to let we rule this province ourselves and do you propose to stand aloof as a independent colony perhaps and perhaps we may by and by discuss the subject of annexation for all the man 's cunning and courage he be almost as short-sighted as any savage upon the plain and the small measure of indian blood in he would assert itself in many way the people begin to look upon he as another napoleon triumphant and to give he honor in every way that suggest itself he make a great display of he importance and would boast among he friend that he be as diplomatic and as able as any statesman in canada and that even he enemy admit this in he earlier day he seek persistently the smile of the fair girl of the plain but somehow or another he be never a very great favorite with the olive-skinned beauty now however the case be different with he the red river belle see in he a hero and a statesman of the highest order the ruler of a colony and the defiant and triumphant enemy of the whole dominion of canada so the poor shallow pet begin to ply they needle and make for he present of delicate thing one sew gorgeous bead upon he hunting coat and another set he jacket spangle with quill of the porcupine the good priest of red river and they pious vicar _ pere _ lestanc whom monseigneur have leave in charge of the diocese while he be attend the ecumenical council in rome come forward with they homage these worthy gentleman have be in the habit of reading from the catechism ever since the time they be first able to tell they bead or to make mud pie these word : he that resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that -lrb- so -rrb- resist shall purchase to themselves damnation here be a madly ambitious adventurer resist the power and therefore resist the ordinance of god but these precious divine see no harm whatever in the act indeed they be the most persistent abettor in the uprising counsel they flock to be zealous and firm and to follow the advice of they patriotic and able leader m riel the great swaggering windy _ pere _ richot take he coarse person from house to house denounce the canadian government and incite the people no harm can come to you he would say you have in the canadian government a good friend in mr george e cartier he will see that no hair of one of you head be touch and riel go abroad give the same assurance moreover it be know to every think one of the fifteen thousand meti that riel be a _ protege _ of monseigneur tache that through this pious bishop it be he have receive he education and that he lordship would not alone seek to minimize what he favorite have do but would say that the uprising be a justifiable one this be how the catholic church in red river stimulate the diseased vanity and the lawless spirit of this thrice-dangerous guiteau of the plain i have already say that bruce be put up by riel as a mere figure-head when the end of the pretence have be accomplish this poor scare-crow be throw down and loui riel assume the presidency of the provisional government now he begin to draw to himself all those man whom he know would be faithful tool in carry out any scheme of villainy or even of blood that he propose to they the coarse and loud-mouthed o'donoghue be duly install as a confidential attendant with wide power and lepine be make head of the military part of the insurrectionary body it certainly be strange if the treasonable undertaking should not be successful with the acquisition of all the fearless and lawless personage that the half-breed community could produce and the vicar-general and the swaggering father richot offer up mass that it should prevail it must not be suppose that there be no white people in this red river region there be very many indeed and some of they hold prominent place in the community through high character or through affluence most of these person be loyal to the heart 's core and be of opinion that the rise have nothing justifiable in it and regard it as a criminal and treasonable rebellion at meeting hold in the town of winnipeg some of these gentleman be at no pain to give expression to they sentiment but riel 's murderous eye be upon they and he be revolve over diver plan of vengeance there be no reason why he should hesitate in take any step that promise help to the cause for holy church be pray for its success and work for it too the shed of the blood of a few heretic be a matter of small consequence : indeed the act would only hallow a cause that have patriotism under and religion behind it we shall leave riel glare with wolfish eye upon the good man who raise they voice against lawlessness and relate a story which will shed a new light upon the darkest deed of the dark career of the miscreant rebel chapter v some time before the outbreak riel in company with a half-breed have go in the autumn shooting chicken along the prairie the hunting-ground be many mile distant from riel 's home so that the intention of the sportsman be to trust themselves to the hospitality of some farm-house in the neighborhood the settler be all with two or three exception meti and the door of the half-breed be never shut against traveller or stranger one late afternoon as the two man be pass along the prairie footpath towards a little settlement they hear at some distance over the plain a girl singing the song be exquisitely word and touching and the singer 's voice be sweet and limpid as the note of a bobolink m riel like mohammed el mahdus and other great patron of race and religion be strong of will but he be weaker than a shear samson when a lovely woman choose to essay a conquest so he marvel much to he companion as to who the singer might be and propose that both should leave the path and join the unknown fair one a few minute walk bring the two beyond a small poplar grove and there upon a fall tree-bole in the delicious cool of the autumn evening they see the songstress sit she be a maiden of about eighteen year and she soft silky-fine dark hair be over she shoulder in girlish fancy she have weave for herself a crown of flower out of marigold and daisy and put it upon she head she do not hear the footstep of the man upon the soft prairie and they do not at once reveal themselves but stand a little way back listen to she she have cease she song and be gaze beyond intently on the naked limb of a desolate thunder-riven tree that stand apart from its lush green-boughed neighbor sit a lonely thrush in seem melancholy every few seconds he would utter a note of song sometimes it be low and sorrowful then it be louder with the same sad quality in it as if the lonely bird be call for some responsive voice from far away over the prairie dear bird you have lose you mate and be cry out for she the girl say stretch out she little brown hand compassionately toward the low-crouching songster you companion have go to the south and you wait here trust that you mate will come back and not journey to summer land without you be not that so my poor bird ah would that i could go with you where there be always flower and ever can be hear the ripple of little brook here the leaf will soon fall ah I and the daisy wither and instead of the delight of summer we shall have only the cry of hungry wolf and the bellowing of bitter wind above the ghastly plain but could i go to the south there be no one who would sing over my absence one lament note as you sing my bird for the mate with whom you have so many hour of sweet lovemaking in these prairie thicket nobody love I woo I care for I or sing about I i be not even as the wild rose here though it seem to be alone and be forbid to take its walk : for it hold up its bright face and can see its lover and he breathe back upon the kind willing breeze-puff through all the summer sweet-scented love message tiding of a matrimony as delicious as that of the angel she stand up and raise she arm above she head yearningly the autumn wind be coo in she hair and softly sway its silken mesh fare well my desolate one : may you poor little heart be gladder soon could i but be a bird arid you would have I for a companion you lamenting should not be for long we should journey loitering and love-making all the long sweet way from here to the south and have no repining turn around she perceive two man stand close beside she she become very confused and clutch for the blanket to cover she face but she have stray away among the flower without it very deeply she blush that the stranger should have hear she and she speak not bon jour ma belle fille it be m riel who have address she he draw closer and she in a very low voice she olive face stain with a faint flush of crimson answer bon jour monsieur be not abashed we hear what you be say to the bird and i think the sentiment be very pretty this but confuse the little prairie beauty all the more but the gallant stranger take no heed of she embarrassment with part of you declaration i can not agree a maiden with such charm as yours be not leave long to sigh for a lover believe I i should like to be that bird to whom you say you would if you could offer love and companionship m riel make no disguise of he admiration for the beautiful girl of the plain he step up by she side and be about to take she hand after deliver himself of this gallant speech but she quickly draw it away pass through a covert as they near the little settlement riel 's sportsman companion walk ahead leave the other two some distance in the rear the ravishing

enquire the _ pere _ or will you do so o i know that you will not leave anything out that can show the bravery of mr scott so i shall leave you to tell it reply the girl well last spring marie be spend some day with she aunt a few mile up red river it be the flood time and as you remember the river be swollen to a point higher than it have ever reach within the memory of any body in the settlement marie be venturesome and since a child have show a keen delight in go upon boat or paddle a canoe so one day during the visit which i have mention she get into a birch that swing in a little pond form behind she uncle 's premise by the over-flowing of the stream 's channel untie the canoe she seize the blade and begin to paddle about in the lazy water presently she reach the eddy which since a child she have always call the ` ring of the water-witch ' wherever she learn that term she cousin violette be stand in the doorway as she see marie move off and she cry out to she to beware of the eddy but my daughter wayward and reckless as it be she habit to be in such matter merely reply with a laugh and then as the canoe begin to turn round and round in the gurgle circle she cry out ' i be in the ring of the water-witch c'est bon bon c'est magnifique o i wish you be with I violette ma chere it be so delightful to go round and round ' a little way beyond not more than twice the canoe 's length rush by roar the full tide of the river ` beware marie beware for the love of heaven of the river if you get a little further out and these eddy will drag you out you will be in the mad current and no arm can paddle the canoe to land out of the flood then dear there be the fall below and the fan of the mill come back will not you ' but my daughter heed not the word she only laugh and begin dip water up from the eddy with the paddle-blade as if it be a spoon that she hold in she hand ' i be dip water from the witch ring ' she cry ` how the drop sparkle every one be a glittering jewel of priceless value i wish you be here with I violette ' suddenly and in a altered tone she cry ` mon dieu my paddle be go ' the paddle have no sooner glide out into the rush turbulent water than the canoe follow it and marie see herself drift on to she doom half a mile below be the fall and at the side of the fall go ever and ever around with tremendous violence the rend fan of the water-mill marie know full well that any drift boat or log or raft carry down the river at freshet-flow be always sweep into the toil of the inexorable wheel yet if she be reckless and without heed a few minute before i be tell that now she be calm as she be present i must refrain from too much eulogy of she behavior violette give the alarm that marie be adrift in the river without a paddle and in a few seconds every body living near have turn out and be run down the shore several bring paddle but it take hard run to keep up with the canoe for the flood be race at a speed of eight mile a hour when they do get up in line each one fling out a paddle but one fall too far out and another not far enough about fifteen man be about the bank in violent excitement and every one of they see nothing but doom for marie as the canoe near a point about two hundred yard above the fall a young white man -- all the rest be bois-brule -- rush out upon the bank with a paddle in he hand and without a word leap into the mad water with a few stroke he be at the side of the canoe and put the paddle into marie 's hand ` here ' he say ` keep away from the mill that be you only danger and steer sheer over the fall get as close as possible to the left bank ' the height of the fall as you be aware be not more than fifteen or eighteen foot and there be plenty of water below and not very much danger from rock ` go you on shore now and i will meet my doom or achieve my safety ' marie say but the young man answer ` nay i will go over the fall too : i can then be of some service to you ' so he swim along by the canoe 's side direct my daughter and shape the course of the prow on the very brink of the fall then all shoot over together the canoe and marie and the young man be bury far under the terrible mass of water but they soon come to the surface again when the heroic stranger save my daughter and through the fury of the mad churn water land she safe and unhurt upon the bank the young man be thomas scott whom you see here this morning be it any wonder think you that when marie see wild turkey upon the prairie she keep the knowledge of it to herself till she get the ear of she deliverer think you now that it be strange he should be look upon by we as a benefactor a very brave act indeed on the part of this young man reply the swarthy m riel he have excellent judgment i perceive or he would not so readily have calculate that no harm could come to any one who could swim well by be carry over the fall marie 's eye flash indignantly at this cold blooded discounting of the generous uncalculate bravery of she young preserver i doubt monsieur she say whether if you have be on the bank where monsieur scott jump in you would have look upon the go over of the fall as a exploit so free of danger as you describe it now as a matter of fact there _ be _ many half-breed there many of whom no doubt be as brave as yourself but i should have perish in the fan of the mill if i have to depend upon the succor of any one of they mademoiselle he retort with a fierce light in he eye i be not a half-breed o pardonnez mois i think from you feature and the straightness of you coal-black hair that you be riel 's blood be nigh unto boil in he vein but he have craft enough to preserve a tolerably unruffled exterior and in return for this great bravery ma petite demoiselle have i suppose give she heart to she deliverer i think monsieur be impertinent and i shall ask my father to forbid he to continue to address I in such a manner a thousand pardon i do not mean to pain but only to chaff you brave daughter i think that monsieur scott be most fortunate in have a friend a beautiful friend so loyal to he and so jealous of he fair fame but to pass to other matter have you have visit from any emissary of the canadian government during the autumn yes monsieur mair come here one day in company with monsieur scott they be both quail shooting they stay only for a little and i be quite favourably impressed with the agreeableness and politeness of m mair 's manners o indeed monsieur mair be here and with mr scott i be glad that you conceive a opinion so favourable of monsieur mair but i regret that i be unable to share in the regard i think i have better open you eye somewhat to the character of this agreeable gentleman since come to red river he chief occupation have be write correspondence respect we colony and the civilization and moral of we people i have be preserve carefully some of the communication for future use and if you will permit I i shall read a extract from a late contribution of he to a newspaper print in ontario you will i think be able to gather from it something of he opinion respect the meti woman indeed i be surprise that mademoiselle 's great friend and preserver he look sneeringly at marie should have for so close a companion a person who entertain these view about we people i do not know that monsieur scott be so close a companion of monsieur mair put in marie i think monsieur be now as he have be do all along assume quite too much i sincerely trust that i be do so but i shall read the extract and he take from he pocket-book a newspaper slip smooth the crease out of the same he read with the most malignant glee the follow paragraph dwelling with emphasis upon every disparage epithet : -- here i be in red river settlement what a paradise of a place it be the mud which be a beautiful dusky red like the complexion of the red river belle do not rise much beyond my knee and resemble the brown-skinned beauty in more than complexion it affectionately cling to I and do what i will i can not get rid of it that be a very flattering description of we red river young woman i be sure and from the pen of you great friend 's friend too now be it not but there be more than this and he proceed to read further the other evening they have a pow-wow in the settlement which they call a dance i be invite and be consider such a great man here of course -- i do not speak it boastingly -- the heart of all the tallow-complexioned girl throb at a great rate when i enter tallow complexioned girl reiterate the reader very complimentary indeed on the part of the friend of you greatest friend monsieur will either please finish read he slip since he wish to do so although for my part i be not at all interested in it or put it by in any case i must ask that he will cease address I in this insolent tone then since mademoiselle will it so i shall finish the very truthful and complimentary paragraph without further comment such a bear garden as that dance be yet i somewhat enjoy the languish glance of the bright-eyed damsel but ugh the savage never can be make to wash themselves when the dance have continue for three or four hour the dancer begin to pair off like pigeon and in each nook you could observe a half-breed and he girl sometimes the demoiselle nursing she beau with arm about he neck or _ vice versa _ the woman be all slattern and as a rule they exhibit about as much morality as be find among the female elk of the prairie a white man here who be at all successful in win female attention need but to whistle or to raise he finger to have half a dozen of the dusky beauty run after he while i write this letter i see two maiden pass under my window i no longer take pride or fun in the matter to I they have become a nuisance chapter vi now monsieur say m riel folding he newspaper slip and put it back again into he greasy pocket-book you well perceive that this monsieur mair be not exactly the sort of gentleman who ought to be the recipient of you hospitality i do not say that monsieur scott who go over the little waterfall with you daughter hold the same opinion respect we as as do he friend monsieur mair i only know that upon matter of this kind bosom friend be very apt to be of the same mind who let I ask again have inform the gallant and generous monsieur that these two young white man be bosom friend monsieur mair be at this house once and monsieur scott be with he i understand that they have only meet the day before and it be only a week ago since monsieur tell I that he have not since see he new friend monsieur have be sarcastic in he reference to monsieur scott i think without much excuse be not this monsieur scott a employe of the vampire snow who be make survey through we territory in we despite and in the face of law and justice marie 's father reply : il est monsieur so i have be inform now monsieur i have some serious business to talk to you about as you be no doubt aware the authority at the canadian capital be at this moment discuss the project of buy the north-west territory from the hudson bay company convert red river into a dominion colony of the confederation and set to rule it a governor and official choose from among canadian who hold opinion respect we as a people quite similar to those entertain by monsieur mair and those who have the honor of be he friend this with a malignant glance toward marie who merely retort with a scornful flash in she fine proud eye well monsieur i have decide that red river shall not pass over to the hand of alien official i shall call upon every true colonist to rise and aid I in assert we rights as free man and as the proprietor of the soil we have till for so many year as for you friend mr scott mademoiselle -- turn with a hideous look toward marie -- i be very sorry to interfere with he good fortune but before the set of to-morrow 's sun i intend packing mr snow and he follower out of we territory nay more i shall keep a very sharp look out for this young man who go with you over the chute petite indeed it may be interesting for you to hear that i know something of he antecedent already he delight to call himself a ` loyalist ' and have declare that the people of red river have no right to protest against the transfer to the canadian government i do not know what monsieur scott 's view be upon this question reply the girl whatever they be i presume that he be as much entitle to hold they as you be to maintain yours i be not so certain on this point as ma belle mademoiselle seem to be he retort with a sneer like the hiss of a cobra this be we country and any man who oppose its welfare be a traitor and a common enemy but now monsieur -- turn to marie 's father -- you must permit I to say that i view with strong disapproval the intimacy of any of we people with alien and enemy therefore i find it necessary to forbid for the future any further visit of this young man scott to you house nay more i shall not permit any communication between you family and he as i have good reason to believe that he be a pay spy of mr snow and the government of canada monsieur quietly retort marie with a curl of infinite contempt upon she soft red-ripe moist lip you be a coward and a snake hush marie monsieur must not take heed of the ready tongue of my daughter the poor terrify and over-credulous father put in with much trepidation mon pere need not apologize to monsieur riel for sa fille the girl say give she father a glance of mild reproach i think that i be not unaware of the reason why monsieur riel 's patriotism and vigilance have take they present generous honorable and manly form and as i have now to go out and attend to my work i would desire to say before leave that monsieur have address he last word to I i do not wish to see he ever again at we house should he insist on come -- and i know he have high spirit and honorable feeling enough to even so insist and force himself where he be not welcome -- it shall be to my greatest repugnance i have be to you mon pere a faithful and loving child i do not think that i have ever before this day make any important request of you but i make one now : it be that you request this monsieur riel to never enter we door again pray mon pere she say go to he and look into he face with the intensest plead in she great eye do not refuse I this request monsieur have hear my daughter 's request i can not deny it to she the only reply from m riel be a sneer that sound like a envenom hiss about the matter of visit monsieur i shall consult my own taste and convenience marie go out from the house as regal in she bearing and as beautiful as any princess that have ever tread the court of caliph riel follow the retreat form of the lovely girl with eye that show the rage and desire of a wild beast when she be out of sight he calm himself and assume a change mood turn to she father monsieur there be no reason why you and i should quarrel be there no monsieur no reason on the contrary it would be well if in these troublous time when duty so momentous await every loyal heart in the colony that we should be friend be this not so oui monsieur then we can if you will be friend i be prepare to forgive the indignity put upon I by you daughter i will not hesitate to take you hand and forgive you for the insult which you have just offer I and now hear what i have to say come yonder through the prairie yesterday i hear you daughter singing the very sound of she voice thrill I as i have never be delight in all my life before but when i see she sit alone a d hear she holding converse with a solitary bird which have lose its mate i be ravish by she beauty and make a vow that i would win she heart i presently perceive that the impression i make upon she be not favourable i take she hand in mine but she snatch it away as if a aspek 's tongue have touch it a moment later in the madness of my passion for she i suddenly strain she in my arm after this i know that she detest I this knowledge i could have bear trust to time and to the aid of fortune to make she look less indifferently upon I great achievement lie almost ready at my hand and my end attain she would have see in I one who stand above all other in red river in brilliancy of attainment and strength of character and while in this way i be endeavor to cool the fire that be burn I i perceive that she heart be give to another to one who so far as i can judge do not return she affection and who pray monsieur may this rival be the young man who rescue you daughter -- thoma scott mon dieu i hope that it be not as you say for i do not want my daughter much as i be indebted to this young man to give to he she affection if he be as you say a spy of government and a enemy of we people a marriage with he would be out of the question bon bon monsieur and m riel in the exuberance of he loyalty have succeed in the vital point grasp the hand of marie 's father and shake and wring it several time now monsieur we agree on the main point i shall name the other condition upon which we may be friend i have swear to overcome you daughter 's repugnance to I will you assist I in the direction of accomplish this object ouus monsieur by every _ fair _ mean c'est bien by every fair means only fair means will i ask you to employ i shall now tell you what i desire you to do you must keep mademoiselle under you strictest surveillance she must not see monsieur scott or communicate with he when he name be introduce into conversation you must show that the subject be displease to you you will be ask why it be so and you shall answer that you have indisputable proof and such proof you may take my _ word _ to be that the young man be not in sympathy with the cause of the meti and that he be actually a secret and pay agent of the canadian government that you course may seem more reasonable and appear to be the outcome of you own inclination you will on such occasion be able to say that you be under obligation to he for he readiness and gallantry -- always use these word -- when you daughter be in the brimming river but that you gratitude can be only a memory since he have league himself against a cause so near to the heart and so supremely in the interest of every man and woman and child in the colony of red river you must at the very first convenient moment and without let marie perceive that i have prompt you to this step inform she that she must banish from she mind at once any tender fancy regard the young man which she may possess point out to she that in any case it would be unwise in she to cherish feeling which very evidently be not reciprocate lastly you will have to teach she cautiously and without the semblance of coercion but constantly to think of I you must show she how great be the promise which lie before I how i be the leader of the people and ruler-predestined of all the land nor must you forget to show she that if i have seem rude in she presence and give way to anger or bitterness it be because of my all-consuming love for she and that henceforth the great aim of my life through all the turbulent deed that this tumultous time may have in store for I shall be to win she approbation to hear at the close of the din and when achievement shall have crown I master a ` brava monsieur ' from she sweet lip ' most faithfully monsieur i swear to you answer the old man take the rebel 's hand in he will you wish be carry out more than this i can almost promise you that i shall succeed and then he go to fetch a bottle in which he have some choice old rye while he be away m riel who be alone -- for all be absent in the field and he comrade have be abroad since the gray dawn -- begin to muse in this wise : so he believe that he can triumph -- that marie will yield then he grind he tooth like a wild beast and swear a terrible oath if she yield -- ah but it be a feast for I to contemplate my revenge raise she to the dignity of wife to share my social honor and triumph no elle serum ma maitresse and i shall cast she off among the worthless and degraded one of she sex then marie 's father enter with the liquor and pledge he fealty to monsieur with many salute and bonne sante after m riel have take sufficient liquor to make he thoroughly daring he say with a sinister tone : although it may not be you honor ever to call I you son-in-law you duty in persuade you daughter remain the same we have form a compact of friendship and mutual understanding yet i must say to you that you own personal safety depend upon you compliance depend he repeat raise he voice till it sound like the bellowing of a infuriate bull _ upon you success _ you intimacy with this man scott together with the visit pay to you house by the man mair place you entirely at my mercy before many day i shall call again to see how far you have succeed i shall expect a report of some progress when i call after that i shall be satisfy with nothing short of _ triumph _ i now go leave my warning to ring in you ear till you see I again and with a air of insolent mastery and a gross light in he eye he seize he fowling-piece and stride out the door follow by he dog mon dieu gasp the terrify half-breed i think that we have become friend but he go from my door like a enemy fill my ear with threat of vengeance may the virgin protect my marie and I from he power have that terrible man go mon pere enquire marie who now enter with sorrow and agitation in she face yes but you must not speak against he o how i fear he that be to say ma petite fille he be a very powerful man a great man and will one day rule all the people and be in eminence like unto one of the canadian governor : therefore it be that it be unfortunate the young man scott should ever have be at we house ah mon pere wherefore do you regret have extend a trifling hospitality not better than you would accord to a wander savage to a brave honest honorable young man who at the risk of he own life save the life of you child o surely you have not receive into you ear the poison of this man 's cunning and malice and she throw she arm about she father 's neck and sob and sob there as if she heart would burst old jean be move to deep grief at the affliction of he daughter yet he could offer she no word of comfort monsieur have pour no poison into my ear ma chere he be a powerful man and a great patriot the people all love he and although he speak rudely and bitterly to you we must forgive he this we shall not find difficult to do when we remember that he display of ill-feeling be because of he all-consuming love for you all-consuming _ love _ and she eye blaze with indignation all-consuming all debase low passion not love no no love be a sacred thing whose divine name be polluted when utter by such lip as he be reasonable ma marie do not suffer hastily form dislike to sway you judgment and good sense there be not a girl on all the prairie who would not be proud to be woo by monsieur riel wherefore should you not be if you have any other affection in you heart banish it it may be that you have cherish a tender regard for the young man scott who be let I see what he be who be ready and gallant -- no that be not it -- who be quick and brave yes i think that be it -- mon dieu cease mon pere have this tempter go so far as to actually put in you mouth the word to be employ in win I to he hateful loathsome arm mon dieu mon dieu and she press she little brown finger over she throbbing temple have my own father league himself against my happiness and and -- my _ honor _ and with a loud heart-rending cry she fall to the floor pale and motionless be she dead mon dieu ma chere fille speak to I and then raise she death-pale head a little he pour some of the spirit into she mouth this restore she but there be a almost vacant look in she eye for many minute which wring he heart sit up my pet and we will talk together i will no longer play the inhuman monster by disguise and deceit then you will be frank she say she eye brighten i swear it now this man have conceive a violent passion for you and i be to press he suit to alienate you affection from monsieur scott if you entertain such feeling and to win you over to monsieur riel he be to visit we within a brief period and when he come he will expect I to be able to report marked progress he will make a second visit and he have swear that triumph alone will satisfy he then if thing fall not out in this wise i be promise he vengeance he declare that we intimacy with young scott and the visit pay we by the homme mauvai mair who be a unscrupulous agent of the canadian government would justify extreme measure against we and if i mistake not the man he intention be to arm hundred of we people proclaim a martial law and establish himself as head and judge i be certain that he would not hesitate to take the most lawless step indeed i should not regard as safe either my own life or you honor such then be the fact what be we to do god be good let we first of all put we trust in he then let we examine the means which he have give we to meet the evil now my plan be that i shall in the first instance affect to yield with grief to such proposal as you at first make to I let there be a surrender of monsieur scott -- here she blush so deeply that all she sweet-rounded cheek and she neck and she delicious little shell-like ear become a crimson deep as she bodice -- and a consent to entertain as favourably as i can the suit of m riel meanwhile we can see what be the next best step i do not think that we have much to dread by leave red river we can go to you brother who live across the border and i be certain that he will be delighted to harbor we till the tempest blow over i believe that this rise will rage for a brief season only when it must yield to the arm of the canadian authority m riel be a fanatic and count not the perilousness of he undertaking he will succeed at the first i doubt not you will hear of slaughter whites and other who have incur he private vengeance he will lord it over all like a tyrant till he see the bayonet from canada when he will take good care to get out of the way she father see that she view be sound and consent to take she advice but who be to acquaint he brother with they need and to learn if he could afford a harbourage paul can go he can take the pony and ride the distance in twelve hour so it be agree and marie busy herself with the linen of she brother and sew miss button upon he clothes in the evening when all be seat at supper a young half-breed who have long be a intimate friend at the house of marie 's father and who cast many a languish eye upon the piquant violette come in there be much concern in he face and it be some time before he know how to begin to break the news which he possess monsieur riel be at my father 's house to-day and he talk long there he be not you friend look at jean he declare that you be in league with the enemy of we colony and have ask my father to keep a strict watch

young man have declare they willingness to follow he in any exploit they meet upon a field this afternoon and drill for a couple of hour one of they tell I -- the speaker now turn he gaze half toward marie -- not a hour ago that they first business would be to settle affair with monsieur mair and scott whom they declare be enemy of red river and spy of the canadian government i should not wonder if these two man be secure to-night and if this be so and i be any judge of human malevolence riel will have they shoot the color have go out of marie 's cheek and there be a terrify gleam in she eye can nothing be do she ask to apprise they of the miscreant 's design i regret that i can do nothing you know how gladly i would be it in my power every man between twenty-one and sixty year in we settlement have be call out to attend a meeting to be hold during the evening in the school-house to discuss the situation one lepine a bosom friend of monsieur riel be to tell we what we be to do i therefore will have to be present i shall go say young paul i can reach willow grove long before the moon be up and give warn to monsieur scott but monsieur mair have to take care of himself i would very gladly assist in he capture or for that matter be well pleased to be one of a firing party to dispatch he insolent insulting life the young lad 's cheek be burn with indignation i think monsieur riel be a impostor although the cause which he have espouse be a holy one but this mair after receive we hospitality turn and hold we up to the ridicule contempt and pity of the world under obligation must we ever remain to monsieur scott but beyond this he be a true gentleman and incapable of the remotest sympathy with the mean unmanliness of this monsieur mair paul be a tall handsome lad with large spirited brown eye he be in he eighteenth year but have the manly address of twenty-one he sister 's gratitude gleam in she eye when he be ready to go out to saddle he pony she put she arm about he and kiss he que dieu benisse mon bon frere bon voyage and she watch he i doubt not pray though she ruby lip move not for he and for she lover till the flit figure of himself and he fleet-limbed pony be lose in the dusk that have already gather over the plain that evening when paul return he come not alone another steed and rider be there and beyond in the shadow of a grove of cottonwood stand a party of a dozen horseman marie hear the double tramp and with some terror draw to the window to see who be approach but she apprehension suddenly vanish and a flush come over she face chapter vii mon pere it be paul and there be with he monsieur scott why i wonder have he come while the question yet remain unanswered paul enter the room accompany by young scott monsieur will explain the

you malignant persecutor will very speedily learn from you neighbor all information respect the existence of relative and where they reside you would be no safer from the vengeance of this monster in adjacent thinly settle american territory than you would be in red river will you therefore come with I to my uncle 's in a town not far beyond the line -- only too happy will he be to serve you in you need the proposal be very gladly accept tear stand in old jean 's eye and i doubt not that they come there when he begin to reflect that but for marie he should now have be act in league with he miscreant persecutor against this noble generous-hearted young fellow within a hour most of the little valuable in the dear old homestead which neither jean nor marie ever again expect to see be make up into small pack each one to be carry by one of the escort with a deep sigh marie look at the home of she happy youth drowse in the deep shadow of the oak and then mount she horse all that night she ride by she lover 's side and steal many a glance of admire pride at he handsome manly figure when they be a couple of hour out a dusky yellow appear in the south-east and then the bright greenish-yellow rim of the autumn moon appear and begin to flood the illimitable prairie with a thick wizard light so this miscreant have be hunting you marie say the young man for both have unconsciously drop in rear i do not like he glance this morning and have resolve to keep my eye upon he i suppose ma petite if i have the right to keep you from the fan of water-mill that i also hold the right of endeavor to preserve you from a man whose arm would be worse than the rend wheel she say nothing but there be gratitude enough in she eye to reward for the most daring risk that man ever run you do not love this sooty persecutor do you ma chere -- and then see that such a question pained and confuse she he say hush now ma petite fille i shall not tease you any more the confusion pass away and she little olive face brighten as do the moon when the cloud drift off its disc i be very glad o if you only know how i shudder at the sound of he name there now let we forget about he i can protect you from he can i not and he rein he horse closer to hers and lean tenderly over towards the girl she say nothing for she be very much confused but the confusion be less embarrassment than a bewildered feeling of delight but for the dull thud thud of the hoof upon the sod she escort might plainly enough have hear the riotous beating of the little maiden 's heart and now about that flower which i give you this morning what do you do with it ah monsieur where be you eye i have wear it in my hair all day it be there now it be there when you come to we cottage this evening ah i see i be concern with you head -- not with you heart be that it ma petite bright eye you know we white girl wear the flower we give they under they throat or upon they bosom this they do as a sign that the donor occupy a place in they heart he do not perceive in the dusky moonlight that he be cover she with confusion upon no point be this little maiden so sensitive as when it be reveal to she that a particular habit or act of hers differ from that of the civilized white girl she dear little heart be almost burst with shame and this thought be run through she mind oh what a savage i must seem in he eye she own unspoken word seem to burn through she whole body but how could i know where to wear my rise i have read in english book that gentle lady wear they there and these line of tennyson come run through she head she go by dale and she go by down with a single rose in she hair and they give she some relief for she think after all that he might be only joke when the blood have go back from she forehead she turn towards she lover who have be look at she since speak with somewhat of a tender expression in he mischievous eye do white girl never wear rose in they hair i think they do can it be wrong for I to wear mine in the same place ah my little barbarian you do not understand I if a old bachelor whose head shone like the moon there in the sky be to give to some blithe young belle a rose or a lily she would most likely twist it in she hair but if some other hand have present the flower one whose eye be brighter whose step be quicker whose laugh be cheerier whose year be fewer in short ma chere marie if some one for whom she care just a little bit more than for any other man that walk over the face of creation have present it to she she would not put it in she hair no my little unsophisticated one she would feel about with she unerring finger for the spot nearest she heart and there she would fasten the gift now ma marie suppose you have possess all this information this morning when i give you the flower where would you have pin it nobody have ever do so much for I as have monsieur he leap into the flood risk he life to save mine i would be a ungrateful girl then if i do not think more of he than of any other man therefore i would have pin you flower on the spot nearest my heart then deftly and before he could determine what she supple arm and nimble little brown finger be about she have disengage the lily from she hair and pin it upon she bosom there now monsieur be it in the right place and she look at he with a glance exhibit the most curious commingling of innocence and coquetry i can not answer i do not think that you understand I yet if the act of save you from drown be to determine the place you should wear the rose then the head as you first choose be the proper spot do you know what the word love mean o i could guess perhaps if i do not know i have hear a good deal about it and violette who be desperately fond of a handsome young frenchman have explain it so fully to I that i think i know yes monsieur i _ do _ know well you little rogue it take one a long time to find out whether you do or not in fact i be not yet quite satisfied on the point however let I suppose that you do know what love be the all-consuming sort the kind that sigh like the very furnace well that part of the statement be clear then suppose that a flower be wear over the heart only to express love of the sort i mention for the donor where would you with full knowledge of this fact have pin the flower that i pluck for you this morning since i do not understand the meaning of the word love with very great clearness -- i think monsieur have express the doubt that i do understand it -- i would not have know where to pin the flower i would not have wear it at all i would monsieur have set it in a goblet and take my stitching would have gaze upon it all the day and pray my guardian angel to give I some hint as to where i ought to put it on you little savage you have elude I again do you remember I tell you that some day if you find out for I a couple of good flock of turkey i would bring you some copper i do well if you discover a hundred flock now i would not give you one and then he lean towards she again as if he lip yearn for hers but he love of mischief be too strong for every other desire for she part she take he exactly as she should have do she never pout -- if she have do so i fancy that there would have be soon a end of the wild boyish sunny raillery hallo little one we be away away in the rear set you pony go for we must keep up with we escort away they go over the level plain through flower of every name and dye the fresh exquisite autumn breeze bear the scent of the myriad petal upon they face after a sharp gallop over about three mile of plain they overtake the main body of the escort they now reach the border and the pavement of the little town of pembina ring with the hoof of they horse away still to the south they ride through the glorious autumn night under the calm bountiful moon now monsieur riel i think we be some distance from you foul talon scott say as turn in he saddle he see the steeple of pembina gloom-wrapped almost sink in the horizon i fancy i can hear the curse of he willing tool in the air after they swoop down upon you cottage marie and find the inmate fly what be you uncle 's cottage like monsieur scott it be not unlike you own it be in a grove of pine and a happy brook go chatter by it all the summer will you come fishing in it with I ma petite ouus avec le plus grand plaisir monsieur and she look so happy there be so much sun in she eye so many divine little dimple in she cheek in contemplation of all the promise happiness that it would not require much keenness to discover the secret of the dear little maiden of course you shall fish with a pin-hook i be not go to see you catch yourself with one of the barb hook like those which i shall use o monsieur scott why will you always treat I as a baby and there be the most delicate yet a utterly indescribable sort of reproach in she voice and attitude as she speak these word then it be not a baby by any means and he look with undisguised admiration upon the maiden with all the mystic grace and perfect development of she young womanhood it be a woman a perfect little woman a fairer a sweeter my own mignonette than any girl ever see in this part of the plain since first appear here human footprint o monsieur be now go to the other extreme he be talk dangerously for he will make I vain do the ceaseless woo of the sweet wild rose by soft wind make that blossom vain or be the moon spoilt because all the summer night ten thousand stream run under it sing to it unnumbered praise as easy ma marie to make vain the rose or the moon as to turn you head by tell you perfection monsieur cover I with confusion and the little sweet tell the truth but it be a confusion very exquisite to she it sing like entrancing music through she vein and give she a delightful delirium about the temple flow fair all the glorious great round of the night and the broad earth light by the moon seem to she now with the music of he word course through she be everything be transfigure by a holy beauty for love have sanctify it and clothe it with he own mystic wonderful garment it be with poor marie then as it have some time or other be with we all : when every bird that sing every leaf that whisper have in its tone a cadence catch from the one loved voice i have see the steeple strain and rock and hear the bell peal out in all they clangourous melody and i have fancy that this delirious ecstasy of sound that bath the earth and go up to heaven be the voice of one slim girl with dimple and sea-green eye the mischievous young scotchman have grow more serious than marie have ever see he before i hope my child that you will be happy here the custom of the people differ from yours but you nature be receptive to everything good and elevated so that i be certain you will soon grow to cherish we civilization i must say here for the benefit of the drivelling cantankerous critic with a squint in he eye who never look for anything good in a piece of write but be always on the search for a flaw that i send passage from tennyson float through my marie 's brain with good justification she have receive a very fair education at a convent in red river she could speak and write both french and english with tolerable accuracy and she could with she supple tawny little finger produce a nice sketch of a prairie tree-clump upon a sheet of cartridge paper or a piece of birch rind young scott be all the while grow more serious and even become pathetic which be a sign of something very delicious and not uncommon when you be travel under a bewitching moon in company with a more bewitching maiden i wish i could be with you during the early part of you stay here for i could do much toward reconcile you to you new life and be you not go to stay with we she voice sound somewhat like a restrained cry of pain no marie my child i have to return to the territory but that wicked man will work he vengeance upon you it be just to meet that wicked man upon he own ground that i go back it be to thwart he to cast in my strength on the side of peace in the interest of those fertile plain that i return you do not suppose that this licentious fanatic can ultimately prevail against the will of the people of canada against the military force of the empire of great britain the sovereign of we mighty realm tolerate in no land any dispute of she authority and this mad uprising will be crush as i might stamp put the feeble splutter of a bed-room taper there be without the intervention of outside force at all enough of brave and loyal whiteman to overthrow this scurvy miscreant and my immediate task be to do the little that lie in my power to incite they to they duty when my work be do when the plain be clear of the mutinous blind unreasoning horde whom this cunning vainglorious upstart have call away from they peaceful homestead i will return my darling little girl with the tiding and i shall bring you back to the spot where you grow up pure and artless as the lily that brighten the pond upon which we have so often paddle we birch together what the day after that may have in store for we i know not ah i shall be very dreary in you absence monsieur scott and i my dear girl shall be not less dreary without you i believe you have regard yourself as a mere plaything in my eye why ma chere all of my heart you have wholly and irrevocably one of you dear hand be more precious more sacred to I than any other girl whom mine eye have ever see do you remember the definition of love that i try to give you well i give it from my own experience with such a love my prairie flower do i love you it be fit now that we be so soon to part that i should tell you this : and you will know that every blow i strike every noble deed i do shall be for the approbation of the dear heart distant from I in american territory i have say that the hour of absence will be dreary but there will be beyond the the darkest of they one hope which shall blaze like a star through the night and that be that i shall soon be able to call my marie my sweet sweet bride now my beloved if that wish for time have come and i be to say ` will you be mine marie ' what would you answer i do not think that it would be necessary for monsieur to ask I that question she answer shyly she beautiful eye cast down i think he know my own little hunt pet he check he horse and seize the bridle of marie 's pony till the two animal stand close together then he kiss the girl upon she sweet virgin lip murmur low my love the next morning he be away and marie sit sad by the strange brook that ho have tell she about old jean be very contented but now that he have nought to do ha babble all day about the war and thank the virgin that himself and he child have escape the clutch of the rebel leader paul speedily obtain employment harvest on a large farm near by and after a little old jean begin to be extremely useful to he kind host but tie sheaf be not the occupation at this tumultuous time that young paul 's heart would have choose for how he long to be in the fray to stand side by side with he young comrade luc fight for the honor and independence of riviere rouge it be only after the most tedious argument that he could be prevail upon to stay and it be thomas scott who have so overcome he you know the design that this monster harbor that young man have say to paul you be foolish enough to count now on he patriotism and to imagine that he would welcome you to he rank he would act far differently : he would probably spare you provide that you lend yourself to he evil design if you refuse to do this he would very probably shoot you as a traitor to you country as for riel it may seem that he conduct in decide in one hour to use marie 's father as a tool and during the next project a plan which defeat the very end which he have in view be absolutely illogical and unreasonable and that it be the narrator whose skill be at fault but i have be at pain to give this occurrence at length for the very purpose of reveal the unstaid unreasoning character of riel and how far passion and impulse will carry he away from sound understanding as for the arch-agitator the spirit take at the house of old jean have raise the savage part of he blood to the highest pitch of unreasoning and confident passion all obstacle seem to disappear and he see with the same glance the gratification of he passion and of he revenge take the horse he have say to he confidant before the moon rise approach the house softly and carefully surround it the girl must be treat with respect you know where to leave she ouus monsieur and the slavish fanatic go to do the vile bidding for some hour m riel go among the meti perfect he plan but towards midnight he order he horse and with a lurid light in he eye set off for the hut of the half-breed hag where he expect he ruffianly emissary would have place marie before he arrival but the cabin be desolate save for the figure of a ill-featured old woman who when she hear hoof-beat approach come to the door peer out into the night have the expect yet arrive he ask a half-puzzled expression in he face no monsieur curse what can have happen they should have be here two hour ago it be now three o'clock then he alight and stride about for half a hour over the dim-lit sward thrust out he head every few seconds in the direction from which the party should come but still no sound no sight of any horseman he now begin to storm and blaspheme and would remind anybody who see he of some wild beast foiled of he prey presently he observe a long distance off upon the plain a figure which he believe be move be this only a poplar or a cotton-wood tree he get upon he knee and put he ear to the ground the soft thud of a horse 's hoof vibrate under he ear and he be satisfied but there be only one horseman what can it mean he could not bear the suspense and fling himself upon he horse he gallop out to meet the advance stranger it be soon tell the inmate have escape evidently long before the party get to the dwelling the ember be very low on the hearth every article of value have be remove and there be the print of many hoof near the cottage scott have foiled I and the outwit tyrant-libertine swear the most terrible oath that he would be revenge off he say to he confidant you must scour red river over to find these fugitive wherever you see the girl seize she and bring she hither the people must all know that she be a spy and league with we most deadly enemy to thwart we cause as for the father catch he too though i should not fret if in the capture a stray bullet or two go singing through he head above all scott must be capture and this be to himself let I lay hand upon he the horseman be ride off stop this old jean have relative in the territory and with one of these he may be take refuge i do not think that this be likely monsieur but i learn and it be the prosecution of these enquiry among jean 's nearest neighbor that keep I late in reach you that he have a brother in pembina now in that direction do the hoof-mark of the party lead i see he have go there count on safety beyond the line but he lean upon a hollow reed let I see : to-morrow at the convention next day at the grand parade of arm yes on Tuesday evening take with you forty man to pembina of course you go there with all speed and locate the residence then on Tuesday night when you enter the city surround the house by a sortie you will have nothing to fear from the citizen they have no force there to oppose yours and if they have you could accomplish you mission so suddenly that you might be on the prairie with you prize before they have they arm in they hand the horseman ride off and the rebel be alone we have see that mr mcdougall have appoint he deputy colonel denni as conservator of the peace and authorize he to organize a force and put down the rebellion the english and scotch settler almost to a man sympathize with the interdict governor yet they do not care to bring themselves into conflict with man with whom for year past they have live in the most friendly relationship unless some great necessity arise as for riel they regard he as a ambitious short-sighted demagogue who palm off he low cunning for brilliant leadership upon the credulous half-breed nevertheless a large number of these settler declare they readiness to march under colonel denni and disperse the nest of rebel at fort garry i need hardly say that most of the irish settler be heart and soul with riel it be not that they have any particular grievance to resent or any grievance at all for that matter it be as natural to they to rise in revolt since the rise mean resistance to the lawful authority as it be for the little duck first cast into the pond to swim a red haired pug-nosed irishman come to new york leap ashore and ask be there a guvernment in this counthry there be thin i be oppose to it much the same be it in the north-west and the violent blustering ruffian o'donoghue be the mouthpiece the leader the type of that class of the people a number of loyal scotch and english therefore do arise and they be know as the portage party this be some month after the night that we last see riel thwart upon the prairie in that connection it only remain to be say that the mission of the confidant to pembina be fruitless and the rebel gnash he tooth that he desire and he revenge have all be baulk he have hear however that thoma scott be abroad through he territory and that he have enlist under the banner of colonel denni -- which be the truth what gall he most be that in case he should succeed in get scott into he hand he have no proof that would be regard as sufficient evidence upon which to proceed with the extreme of vengeance toward he yet he order stand unchanged : wherever you find thomas scott seize he and convey he to fort garry on the sixth of December the confidant come into the tyrant 's presence and say : we have catch scott -lrb- footnote : i take the follow from begg 's history of the north-west rebellion p 161 : about this time -lrb- 6th December -rrb- the french arrest and imprison mr thoma scott mr a mcarthur and mr wm hallet mr scott it appear have be one of the party assemble in schultz 's house but have afterwards leave and no other reason for he arrest be know except he have enrol under colonel denni mr mcarthur be it be say confine on suspicion of act secretly on behalf of mr mcdougall and mr hallet for he activity in assist and advise colonel denni -rrb- the rebel leader 's eye gleam with a wolfish light be he in the fort yes bon i shall be there presently so without any delay he proceed to the fort and enter the apartment where young scott be confine ah monsieur this be where you be yes you tyrannical ruffian but i shall not be here for long riel curb the mad blood which have leap to he temple monsieur shall not be here long if he choose to accept condition upon which he may be free come for curiosity sake let we hear the proposal i be certain that they be foul yet as i say i be anxious to hear they monsieur must be reasonable there be no good purpose to be serve by railing at I that be true you be too infamous a miscreant to be shame or make better by reproach nevertheless i shall proceed to business monsieur do you know where old jean and he daughter have take up they abode i do so i suspect if you will let I know they place of abode that i may give they my guarantee for they personal safety if they return to they home -- as i understand that through some unfounded fear of I they flee and i be anxious to stand well in the affection of all my people -- i shall permit you forthwith to leave this fort contemptible villain liar and tyrant i will _ not _ reveal to you begone by heaven if you stand there i shall bury my hand in you foul craven throat take care monsieur be all m riel say as he leave scott 's presence but he eye burn like a fiend 's the agitator with a spirit of the most devilish rage consume he nevertheless go on to forward the general movement he first great step be against the follower of colonel denni who have band together and post themselves in the house of dr schultz a very prominent settler they have gather here with arm in they hand but they seem like a lot of little child without any purpose there be no moral cohesion among they and there be no force either to lead or to drive they they be not long thus ridiculously impound when they begin to look at one another as if to ask : _ quis furores o cive _ they be not alone unprepared and undetermined to go up to fort garry and fight the greasy rebel and he follower but they be by no means certain as to what they should do be the enemy to come against they and this be just the very thing that the enterprising monsieur riel propose to do it be say that about this time he be often find reading book describe the sudden and unexpected military movement of napoleon and i have not the remotest doubt that the diseased vanity of the presumptuous crank enable he to see a likeness in himself to the scourge of nation so he say to he man : we shall go down and capture this denni ' geese-pound better turn out in good force with you arm though i be quite certain that you can capture the whole caboose with broom-stick so the meti throng after he heel and surround the schultz mansion with its congregation of war spirit of course there be something to be say for the gathering together of these loyal people here as there be for the issue of the proclamation by the citizen of london per the mouth of the three tailor beyond be fort garry unlawfully seize by riel and now unlawfully invest by he troops this be therefore a menace to the unlawful combination at the fort at once the agitator begin to dictate term if they would come out of they ridiculous hive and surrender they arm he would suffer no harm whatever to befall they but content himself with merely take they all in a lump and lock they up prisoner in the fort he would however insist upon other formality and therefore exhibit a declaration which he would ask they to sign by this document each man would bind himself to rise no more but to submit to the authority of the provisional government there be very little parley each brave loyalist take the paper and put he name to it -lrb- footnote \* -rrb- dr o'donnell be the first to sign he name and after he have do the rest follow and with much credit to the celerity of they penmanship then they all move out and be escort up to fort garry where they be hold for a considerable period despite the prayer of prominent person who have take no active part on either side for they liberation -lrb- \* footnote : i take the follow from mr begg 's history of the rebellion : in the meantime there be from two to three hundred armed french half-breed as well as a number of lookers-on around and outside the building and it be say that a couple of mount cannon -lrb- six pounder -rrb- be draw outside the wall of fort garry ready to be use in case of a assault upon the besiege premise when all those in the house have sign and the surrender hand to riel he say that there be two signature not on the list which ought to be there -- and which he insist upon have these be the name of jame mulligan and charle garrett a guard from the french party be therefore send to hunt up those two man and in a short time they return with the individual they have be in search of as soon as this have be do the prisoner be take out and march to fort garry and the follow lady who during the siege have nobly resolve upon remain by the side of they husband also insist upon accompany they to fort garry the follow be the name of the lady : mr schultz mr mair mr o'donnell and as the first name lady be ill probably from the excitement of the past few day a sleigh be procure and dr schultz himself draw she along in it behind the rest of the prisoner when they reach fort garry mr j h mctavish accountant in the hudson bay company service kindly offer to give up he private quarter for the use of the married man and they family and thus make thing more comfortable for the lady -rrb- chapter viii in the meantime the government at ottawa have convince itself that affair be in a pretty bad mess in the north-west therefore they dispatch with olive branch two commissioner to treat with the malcontent it be hardly worth while to mention the name of these two gentleman though i may as well do so they be vicar-general thibeault this prelate i understand be a relative of the gentleman who produce the life of sir charle tupper and colonel desalaberry mr donald a smith the chief officer of the hudson bay company be also dispatch he be instruct to inquire into and report upon the cause of the disturbance and also to assist governor mctavish or to relieve he altogether of duty should ill health have incapacitate he mr smith arrive in due season at the settlement and seek a interview with the rebel leader in fort garry m riel very readily admit he and then turn the key upon he it be a very great pity that it be not upon some member of the beautiful government at ottawa that he have the opportunity of fasten the lock there be now about sixty prisoner in the fort the british ensign have be haul down and the flag of the provisional government a combination of fleur de-ly and shamrock hoist in its stead when the news get abroad that a agent have come from canada to treat with the people on behalf of the canadian government that mr mcdougall be in disfavor with the dominion ministry and have return to ottawa m riel 's influence begin to diminish sensibly let we hear what donald smith have to say to we they begin to cry and the arch rebel be fain to consent a monster meeting of 1100 people be hold in the open air with the thermometer twenty degree below zero riel and he follower be not satisfy with the term of the dominion agent and the arch disturber have make up he mind not to be satisfied yet he be not secure in he position for there be much writhe among host of he follower under he tyrannical caprice sometimes he break loose from all civilized restraint and act like a mad savage governor mctavish who be reach the last stage of consumption for some reason incur the ill-will of the autocrat one might have suppose that a man totter on the grave 's brink would have be secure from violence and insult but the heartless rebel ruffian be insensible to every human impulse burst into the chamber of the sick man he rage like a wild bull stamp upon the floor and declare that he would have he shoot before midnight then tell off a guard he send they to invest the house he rage cool down after a little and the murderous threat be not carry into execution i have say that the loyalty and obedience of he entire follower be so far by no means assure hundred who sympathize with the uprising and in the begin express admiration for he courage and daring begin to be shock at he tyranny and to hold aloof this be the reason we may be sure that some of the revengeful threat which he about this time make be not carry into effect he hold long counsel with he military leader lepine how do the sentiment of the settlement go now do they disapprove of my severe measure they do monsieur and i be incline to think that you will be oblige to show some generosity even toward you worst enemy to maintain the confidence and sympathy of you follower suppose i release these prisoner i know of nothing more popular that you could do but scott he be my deadliest enemy it be to give a color of justification to my attitude towards he that i have incarcerate the rest even he monsieur i think it would be advisable now to let he depart with the rest i be quite certain that he will before long move by he hatred of yourself commit some act that will justify you in accord to he very stern sort of punishment be it so i shall let they all go but remember : you never must allow this man to pass from under you eye meanwhile poor marie be far away sigh all the day for some word from she lover she have hear that they have capture he and lock he in a dungeon a terrible fever seize she and she cry out in she delirium to take she to she lover for many day after the fire of she illness have cool she lay between life and death like some fitful shadow but when a letter come to she in the dear write that she so well know announce that he be once more free the enfeebled blood begin to stir in she vein and a faint tint of rise begin to appear on the waste cheek i will run over and see my little love during the first breathing time that offer he write i hope ma amie you be not sorrowing at my absence no hour pass over I whether wake or dream that i do not sigh for my darling marie but i be console with the thought that when the turmoil be end when this land of tumult and tyranny have become a region of peace and fruitful industry i will be able to bring my darling back to she dear old home and in a little wed she there and then take she to my arm for ever this be very sweet tiding to the desolate girl she read the letter over and over till she could repeat every word of the eight large page which it contain when she begin to grow stronger she would keep it in she lap all day and touch it tenderly as a young mother would she sleeping babe before blow out she lamp in the night she would kiss the letter and put it under she pillow when she open she large bright eye in the morning she would take it kiss it and read it once again during all this time the fire of riel 's two-fold passion be not burn lower : -- nay it be grow stronger he aim now be to make himself such a ruler and master in the settlement that every word of he should be as law and that no man not all the people might disobey he command or censure he action so thomas scott be to marry she when the strife end he would speculate ah monsieur scott if to that time you defer you nuptials they shall take place in heaven -- or in hell for the furtherance of he diabolical personal aim he now begin to assume a benignant fatherly tone and when he issue he famous proclamation to the people of the north-west everybody be strike by the calmness the restraint and even the dignity of its language -lrb- footnote \* 1 -rrb- he likewise endeavor to show that he be not a disturber whose only mission be to pull down through he instrumentality and at he suggestion in every one of its detail a bill of rights -lrb- footnote \* 2 -rrb- be draw up and publish to the people this document set forth little more than what would be regard as legitimate request -lrb- \* 1 footnote : this document be as follow : -- let the assembly of twenty-eight representative which meet on the 9th march be dear to the people of red river that assembly have show itself worthy of great confidence it have work in union the member devote themselves to the public interest and yield only to sentiment of good will duty and generosity thanks to that noble conduct public authority be now strong that strength will be employ to sustain and protect the people of the country to-day the government pardon all those whom political difference lead astray only for a time amnesty will be generously accord to all those who will submit to the government who will discountenance or inform

and the wisdom of he declaration yet the rebel leader for many reason one of which be very well know to the reader be one of the unhappiest of man besides the matter at he heart he live hourly in mortal dread of bodily harm in the dead of night he would waken start suddenly from he bed and clutch at some garment hang upon the wall deem the thing to be a assassin mr begg say that one day he go

the settler call upon major boulton a gentleman who have at one time be a captain in the 10th regiment and speak to he in this wise : we can muster here 400 good fight man and if i you will lead we we shall march against this scoundrel i liberate the people whom he have shut up in the fort and put a end to the rebellion you hold out a very fair prospect major boulton answer but i have very grave doubt that the thing can be accomplish as easily as you imagine we have the arm and we be determine to move against that presumptuous nest of domineering bandit if you do not lead we then the command will have to fall upon one of ourselves and there be no man amongst we who have have any experience in leadership how be you number make up we have nearly a hundred immigrant and about double that number of english-speaking half-breed i consent to you request but you must distinctly know that i do so altogether against my own judgment against my _ judgment _ only however not against my inclination very speedily the force be marshal together and organise in rough shape winter now reign in all its severity upon the plain recently snow have fall and without snow shoe it be next to impossible to march the arm of this crudely-disciplined band as may be imagine be not of the most approved pattern some of the half-breed have flint-lock and they highest average of going-off capacity

criticise by those who always show they wisdom _ after _ the event to young scott he detail he program my ambition be he say to delude the rebel as to my movement by affect a desire to treat with they therefore i shall halt with my force a short march from fort garry and when i have lull suspicion i will make a dash in the night trust to the suddenness and vigor of the onset for success such a proceeding scott strongly approve and major boulton find that the young man 's knowledge of the rebel ' condition would be of the greatest value to the enterprise so with considerable enthusiasm the force march on now however the sky become a sullen indigo and flake of spit snow begin to drive out of the east i have some fear of that sky the commander say to he follower if more snow come there be a end of the march all day and through the night and during the next day the storm rage cover the prairie with four foot of soft snow riel 's scout have give warning of the approach of the loyalist

the follow description of this ridiculous episode in the history of the rebellion be give by mr begg in he history of the trouble : -- on the morning of the 17th word be receive that the english settler have disband and be return to they home soon after this a small party of man -- some in sleigh and other on foot be see to verge off across the prairie from st john 's school-house appear as if they wish to avoid the town as soon as this party be discover a body of horseman emerge from fort garry and start out for the purpose of intercept they people in the town crowd every available spot overlook the prairie face throng the window wood pile and fence be crowd with sightseer all expect to behold a miniature battle when the portage party discover the french come out of the fort they halt and appear to hold a consultation after which they move slowly on -- the depth of snow impede they progress the french at the head of whom be o'donoghue continue to gallop over the snow drift halt now and again for straggler at last the two party meet but instead of a fight they mix together for some minute and then they all start in the direction of fort garry they have be take prisoner be the conclusion by the lookers-on and so indeed it turn out to be several of the portage party refuse at first to give up they arm but ultimately they consent to do so and be all take to fort garry where they be imprison in the same room which have only recently be vacate by the first lot of prisoner it be say that the portage party give themselves up on the understanding that riel merely wish to speak to they and explain matter if this be the case they be not justly deal by for immediately upon they arrival at fort garry they be put in prison and major boulton they leader place in iron what a singular change in affair this occasion -- twenty-four prisoner liberate on the 15th -- forty-eight prisoner take on the 17th -rrb- let we now return to the vengeful riel never steady of purpose or rest he faith upon logic he have begin to curse himself for take lepine 's advice and suffer scott to depart after all he may elude I go out of the territory and marry the girl curse a thousand curse upon my own head for follow the advice malediction upon lepine 's head for have give it to I just at this moment the door open and lepine enter i bring monsieur good news ah what be it any tiding of scott he be at this very moment in the fort have be catch among major boulton 's party he be most insolent to myself and o'donoghue and use very abusive language respect yourself i think monsieur you have cause sufficient against he now bon bon yes -- he shall not escape I this time and rise he begin to stride up and down the floor he eye flame with hate and vengeance now monsieur lepine give I you attention at once go and put boulton in iron i shall attend presently and declare that he be to be shoot to-morrow suppliant will come beseech I to spare he life but at first i will refuse to do so and say that i be determine to carry out my threat at the last i will yield so far so good i do not know now whether you understand my method or not -lrb- footnote : the follow be mr begg 's version of this part of the affair : -- riel grant the life of three but major boulton he say would have to die that night it now begin to look very serious archdeacon mclean be call upon to attend the condemn man during he last moment and a feeling of oppression be feel by all at the thought of a human be to be thus send to he last account on such short notice at midnight too -lrb- the hour appoint for the execution -rrb- -- midnight -- the very think of a man be bring out in the stillness of the night to be shoot like a dog be horrible in the extreme still there be no lack of interceder although little hope be now entertain of major boulton be spare people retire to they home that evening with mingled feeling of hope and uncertainty mixed with horror at the deed about to be commit and how be the prisoner during all this time calm and resign to he fate after write a few line to he friend in canada he call for a basin of water and a towel with which to wash he face and hand and a glass of wine to prevent he if possible from shiver when pass into the cold night air in case people might attribute it to fear he speak quietly and calmly of the fate before he and act altogether as a soldier should do in the face of death in the meantime the french councillor be sit in deliberation on boulton 's sentence the result be that he life be spare this be communicate at once to the prisoner who receive the information as calmly as he have do the sentence of death -rrb- i think i do monsieur and there be a know twinkle in the eye of the wily scoundrel well this scott have a unbridled tongue and be pretty certain to use it if he do not a little judicious goading will soon set he in he most abusive mood if possible it would be well for one of the guard to provoke he to commit a assault could you rely upon any one of you man for such a bit of business ouus monsieur i have such a man bon let he be so provoke and after he violence have be thoroughly trumpet through the fort make a declaration of the same formally to I i will then direct you to try he by court martial you be aware of how i desire he to be dispose of when the news get abroad that he be to be shoot some will be incredulous and other will come to sue for he life i shall reply to they : ` this be a matter of discipline the man have deserve death or the court martial would not have sentence he i spare boulton 's life and already i have as fruit of my leniency increase turbulence and disrespect the government of this colony must be respect and the only way to teach its enemy that it must be be to make a example of one of the greatest offender ' lose no time in complete the work we know not what chance may work and rob we hand of the scoundrel you understand i be least of all mix up in the matter be more concerned with weightier affair oui monsieur and make a obeisance the murderous tool depart exactly as it have be plan it all fall out major boulton be put in iron and riel declare that for the sake of peace and the prosperity of the colony he must be shoot dozen of people come and implore he to spare the condemn man 's life but he be inexorable at last however at the eleventh hour as the newspaper put it yield to mr donald a smith he say : he be spare lepine present himself before he leader monsieur i think that it will not be at all necessary to employ any stratagem to work we man into violence he have be shower reproach upon the guard and load you name with every sort of ignominious reproach the guard know my feeling respect the man so during the night they decide to put chain upon he as the foremost one advance with the manacle the prisoner raise he arm and deal he a blow on the head which fell he to the ground bon bon riel cry while he rub he hand with satisfaction without apply the little goad at all he fulfil we will well not in the strictest sense monsieur luc have certain private instruction from I and he carry they out in a very skilful manner n'importe monsieur n'importe how the thing come about we have the cause against he and that suffice what do you now propose to do for you be aware monsieur -- there be now a tone of diabolical raillery in he word -- that this be a matter in which i can not concern myself you be the best judge of what be due rebellious military prisoner mercus monsieur i shall endeavor to merit you further regard my intention be to proceed forthwith to try he already i have summon the witness of he guilt and he and you shall know we decision before another hour have pass then the faithful monsieur lepine be go no ma marie you shall never deck you nuptial chamber with daisy for monsieur thoma scott you will find occupation for you sweet little finger in put fresh rose upon the mound that cover he for a _ feu-de-joie _ and the peal of glad marriage bell i will give you ma petite chere the sullen toll that call he to he open coffin and the rattle of musketry that still the tongue which utter to you the last love pledge for a hour do he pace up and down the floor gloat over he revenge meanwhile i shall leave he and follow the adjutant-general as m lepine be know under the provisional government he proceed to the private room of the military quarter and enter find he subordinate officer assemble there messieur he say we know what we business be we must lose no time in dispatch it but before commence let I say a few word monsieur riel be so overweight with other affair that the matter of deal with the man scott rest entirely in we hand i have just leave he after endeavor in vain to induce he to be present at the trial but he could not spare the time to come by skilfully sound he however i discover that he sentiment respect the prisoner be exactly the same as those entertain by myself what these be i need hardly say it be now a struggle between the authority of the provisional government and a horde of rebellious person of which the defendant be the most dangerous the eye of we follower be upon we and if we permit the authority of government to be defy its officer revile and insult heap upon we depend upon it we shall speedily lose the hold which we have gain after so many bitter struggle and become ridiculous and a prey to the conspiracy which we enemy be so actively engage in promote against we the very fact of this man scott have league himself with we enemy within a few hour after he release from confinement be in itself a offence worthy of death but i shall ask these person who be here as witness to show you that since he capture he have merit death ten time over at we hand with you permission gentleman i will proceed : thoma scott of red river settlement stand charge before this court-martial with treasonable revolt against the peace and welfare of the colony with have league himself with a armed party whose object be the overthrow of authority as vest in we provisional government he be likewise charge with have attempt criminal violence upon lawfully delegate guard appoint over he during he incarceration and likewise with incite he fellow-prisoner to insubordination and tumult contrary to the order and well be of authority as establish in red river luc lestang this person come forward relate all you know in the conduct of the prisoner scott that may be regard as treasonable and criminal within the past fourteen day on the 17th ultimo i be present at he capture a short distance from fort garry he be arm and be in company with a number of other armed person who have league themselves under one major boulton with the object of capture fort garry and overthrow the provisional government as establish in this colony have you see he since he imprisonment in the fort i have see he every day since will you please state what have be he demeanor and conduct as a prisoner he have be insulting and disorderly in the last degree will you specify a few particular example i have frequently hear he describe the provisional government and its supporter as a band of mongrel rough-scruff a greasy insolent nest of traitor and a lot of looting riotous unwashed savage he have use language of this sort ever since he entry into the fort likewise i have hear he say that he would have the pleasure of assist in hang monsieur riel to a prairie poplar and in put tar and feather upon he unwashed hungry follower have he be guilty of any act of violence he have be guilty of act of violence when he become unbearably insubordinate i find it to be my duty to put iron upon he as i approach he with the handcuffs he smite I twice in the face and i yet carry the mark that he give I -lrb- here the precious half-breed pointed to he right eye which be a dusky purple -rrb- this black eye i receive from one of he blow that will do luc another witness with the movement of a snake and eye as black as sloe be call and he give evidence which tally exactly with that swear to by luc lestang this of course be not a very extraordinary coincidence for he have be present while the first miscreant be give he evidence but poor scott whose life be the issue of all the swearing be not permit to be present but be keep without in a distant room chained there like a wild beast the court say the adjutant-general have hear the accusation against this man and its duty now be to consider whether or not the safety the peace the well-being of the government and the state demand that the extreme penalty should be visit upon this common disturber and enemy both the question be whether he be worthy of death or not you will retire gentleman -- there be four of they exclusive of witness and the clerk -- and find you verdict they be absent about two minute the foreman then advance say : monsieur adjutant we find the prisoner scott guilty then draw upon he head a black cap the adjutant say : after due and deliberate trial by this court it have be find that the prisoner thoma scott be ` guilty ' _ i do therefore declare the sentence of this court martial to be that the prisoner be take forth this day at one o'clock and shoot _ and may god in he infinite mercy have mercy upon he soul monsieur riel have be all this while pacing up and down he room a tap come upon he door entrez ah it be you mon adjutant ouus mon president what tiding c'est accompli the court-martial have find the prisoner guilty and he be condemn to be shoot at one o'clock this day monsieur be expeditious monsieur be zealous c'est bon c'est bon merci monsieur and the miscreant walk about delirious with the exuberance of he gratification then he come over to where he adjutant stand and shake he hand then he thrust he finger through he hair and half bellow he voice resemble that of some foul beast la patrie have reason to be proud of she zealous son and he again shake the hand of he infamous lieutenant then with a very low bow m lepine leave the room say as he depart i shall endeavor to merit to the fullest the kindly eulogy which monsieur president bestow upon I the news of scott 's sentence spread like fire around the settlement some believe that the penalty would not be carry out while other declare that they think otherwise if this prisoner be pardon people will begin to treat the sentence of the provisional authority as good joke riel must be aware of this therefore scott be likely to suffer the full penalty several person call upon the tyrant and besought he to extend mercy to the condemn man but he merely shrug he shoulder this prisoner have be twice rebellious he have set bad example among the prisoner assault he keeper and load the provisional government with opprobrium i may say to you messieur however that i have really nothing to do with the man 's case in this time of tumult when the operation of all law be suspend the court-martial be the only tribunal to which serious offender can be refer this young man scott have have fair trial as fair as a british court-martial would have give he and he have be sentence to death i assume that he would not have receive such a sentence if he have not deserve it therefore i shall not interfere there be no use messieur in press I upon the matter at heart i shall grieve as much as you to see the young man cut off but he death i believe necessary now as a example to the hundred who be desirous of overthrow the authority which we have establish in the colony the petitioner leave the tyrant with sorrowful face my god one of they exclaim it be frightful to murder this young man whose only offence be resistance to probable insult from he debased half-breed keeper be there nothing to be do no there be nothing to be do the greasy vindictive tyrant be lord and master of the situation when riel be alone he begin once more to walk up and down the room and thus muse aloud : i shall go down to he cell perhaps if i pretend that i will spare he life he may tell I where reside marie yes he be sure that he would succeed i shall get he secret by promising pardon then i will spit upon he face and say ` die dog i 'll not spare you ' so forth he sally and make he way to the cell where the young man sit in chain well malignant tyrant what do you here whatever you business be let it be dispatch quickly for you presence stifle I what dishonourable proposal have you now to make monsieur scott it seem to be a positive pleasure to you to revile I yet have i seek to serve you -- yea i would have be would now be you friend peace let I hear what it be that you now propose you be aware that it be order by court-martial of which i be not a member that you be to be shoot at one o'clock this day it be now just forty-five minute of one i can spare you life and i will do it upon one condition pray let I hear what dishonor it be that you propose i ask the question now for the same reason that i make a similar query during my first incarceration out of a curiosity to learn if possible a little more of you meanness and infamy and i reply to you as i answer before that i shall take no notice of you reviling but make my proposal i simply ask you to state to I where jean and he daughter marie have take up they abode where you will never find they that be my answer villain and tyrant and now begone perhaps you imagine that the sentence will not be carry out i ask you to choose between life and liberty and a almost immediate ignominious death i care not for you revenge or you mercy once more i say get you go then the ruffian turn round rush at the chained prisoner and deal he a terrific kick in the side after which he spit upon he face she shall be mine he hiss when you corpse lie moulder in a dishonoured traitor 's grave the young man be chained to a heavy table but with a sudden wrench he free himself raise both arm and be about bring down he manacled hand upon the tyrant miscreant -- and that blow would have end the rebellion at red river -- when luc burst into the room seize the prisoner and throw he while he brute knee be on the young man 's breast and he greasy hand hold the victim 's throat riel make he escape and turn back to he own quarter as for poor scott when the tyrant and the brutal guard have leave the cell he begin to pace up and down sorely disturb all along he have cherish the hope that the tyrant would be induce to commute the sentence to lengthy imprisonment but the diabolical vengeance which he have see in the tyrant 's eye now begin to undermine he hope of life some friend be admit to he cell and they inform he that they have plead for he but in vain and do you think that he will really perpetrate this murderous deed he ask most assuredly he will and now nothing remain for you but to prepare to meet you doom like a true man you be not the first who have suffer in like manner in a cause which history will ever associate with you name the tyrant who prevail over you will not triumph for long ignominious will be the atonement that he must pay but you have to show that for the sacred cause of loyalty you know _ how _ to die you have make you peace with god and there be nought then that you have to fear you sorrow at go alone leave all the world after you but we go hence too in a little and every hour the clock tell yield a thousand soul to eternity ah my friend this be all true but i be young and i have cherish one very sweet hope this have be the fate of ten of thousand i should not have shrink from death six month ago have he set I up as a target for he half-breed murderer i should have utter no word of repine but it be different now : o god it be very different all hang down they head they be vainly try to hide they tear and even for myself under the new condition which have arise i would not care it be because of _ she _ -- because of my pure beautiful love my marie whom this

she in my letter -- but repeat it to she with my heart full o so full of love for she there be now a rude bustling at the door the rusty key be ply and with a harsh scream the bolt fly back then the evil-looking luc enter follow by five or six other all of whom be partially intoxicate you hour have come young man he say in a brutal voice let we be go my god this be a cold-blooded murder poor scott say turn to mr donald a smith and the rev mr young then he bid good-bye to the visitor and to he fellow prisoner and walk forth with the guard closely accompany by mr young before they get

of he word or even to hear they the blow have be too overwhelming for mortal tongue to fashion word that could convey aught of comfort she sit there she face like a stone she eye tearless yes she read he letter and kiss he present she would fold the letter sometimes and lay it away near to she heart then she would open it again spread it upon she lap and sit half the day alternately look at and tenderly handle it a few day and night be spend during which she speak no word eat no food nor take any sleep at the end of the fourth day they find she on a little seat beside the door where _ he _ have say good-bye to she she have he letter in she hand and he ring upon she finger but she be dead chapter ix after the return of mr mcdougall to ottawa and while the government press busy itself in lay upon that gentleman 's shoulder the blame which should have be debit to the blundering of the administration step be be take to have a armed force send at once to the scene of tumult to restore the authority of the queen sir garnet wolseley who have since earn distinction in bush and desert fighting be the officer put in charge of the expedition before this step have be take however the government have set the wheel of a totally different sort of force in motion monseigneur tache to whom i have already refer be absent in rome attend the ecumenical council when the disturbance break out sir john go to m george e cartier then and say : my idea be that the man who can do more to settle this matter than all the wisdom of the government combine be monseigneur tache what think you -- would it not be well to represent the case to he by cable and ask he to return ouus sir john -- the suggestion be good so the bishop be cable for and he come home well messieur he say what function be it with which you would endow I with what have i to deal the people be in open armed rebellion they do not want to come into the confederation and there be a extensive desire for annexation the head of the movement be loui riel and he be president of the provisional government he have seize and invest fort garry set up law for himself and be feed and supply he troops with the property of the hudson 's bay company -lrb- let it be bear in mind that at this time the murder of scott have not be commit and riel and he follower be only know to be guilty of have rise in armed revolt and consume much of the store of the hudson 's bay company -rrb- well messieur the case be make plain now with what authority do you endow I we authorize you to say to the rebel on behalf of the government that if they will peaceably depart to they home and submit to the authority of the queen as represent by the government of canada no harm will come to they we authorize you further to assure they that the government will stand between they and the hudson 's bay company should the latter seek recompense for store consume or property appropriate finally for the offence commit -- and which we have specify -- you shall on we behalf extend pardon to each and all arm with this authority the bishop set out before he reach winnipeg the blood-thirsty president have murder scott i hope the reader have not forget that monseigneur be the same divine who use to look with delight upon loui riel when a child and stroke he glossy black hair that he be the same gentleman who find for the lad a benefactress in the person of madame masson the star be fight for the murderer and he know it when he hear that he personal friend and warm admirer be come he lordship be not nearly as badly shock as most humane people might suppose when he hear that thoma scott have be butcher like a dog upon the snow indeed there be some authority to say that he be not shock at all he good priest pere richot who get the bishop 's ear take a highly moral and humane view of the matter shooting serve the fellow right monseigneur -lrb- footnote : captain huyshe and several other writer of high repute be my authority for this statement -rrb- he say he be a disturber and it be good to make a example of he in a little we may be sure the monseigneur 's opinion do not differ very widely from that of the crocmitaine priest let the people all assemble the bishop proclaim : i have important declaration to make to they they obey he mandate and he say : i be authorize by the government of canada to inform you that if you forthwith depart to you lawful habitation in peace you will have nothing to fear you rebellious deed will be forgive to you the other unfortunate event will likewise be overlook and the hudson bay company whose provision you have eat and whose property you have appropriate will be indemnify by government if they take step to obtain restitution for the same one month later year afterwards this precious divine maintain that the authority with which he have be clothe by the government -- and i have give that authority _ substantially _ -- endowed he with the power to grant pardon for the murder of scott without tire the reader let I say that it be by means of the discussion and the perplexity which subsequently arise upon this point that the miscreant-fiend escape the vengeance of the law _ monseigneur have not lose he interest or affection yet for the lad for whom he have procure a education _ the bloody guiteau however do not consider the pardon a very great act of liberality on the contrary he be incline to regard the discussion of he guilt the guilt of the president of a independent colony who be law-maker and law-dispenser in himself as somewhat of a impertinence he still continue to administer the government and to live sumptuously in the house of governor mctavish about he here he have gather some of he most powerful follower one of which be the big fenian o'donoghue these eat and drink to they heart 's content but from they wallow and disgust habit the residence soon resemble a filthy lair where pig lie down yet the rebel chief have spare no pain to make it luxurious convey thither with other plunder the effect of the house of dr schultz when it be at first tell riel that sir garnet wolseley at the head of a large force be march against he he refuse to believe it it be not till he actually with he own eye see the troops that he be convinced then with hysterical precipitation the greasy murderer scurry out of the fort mount a horse and ride away in mortal terror later he be reduce to the necessity of walk and when he boot be wear off he foot there be blood in he foot-print in this plight he meet a follower who use to tremble before he in the day of he power and to be like unto caius marius he say to this man : go back and tell you friend that you have meet loui riel a fugitive barefoot without a roof above he head and no where to go this beastly murderous tyrant do actually imagine himself to be a hero later on he be supply with money by sir john macdonald to keep out of the country the amount be not pay to he in a lump but he good friend the whilome bishop and now archbishop pay it out whenever the worthless vagabond rascal come and represent himself as be very needy he often in he fallen day would go about sigh for marie and declare that with all he vengeful feeling towards she she be the only maiden whom he have ever really love old jean come back and settle with a sad heart in the little cottage where have grow up he sweet marie it be very desolate for he old heart now the ivy wreathe itself about the little wicker house as be its wont but marie be not there the cow come as usual to the bar to be milk but there be a lament in they low call they miss the small soft hand that use to milk they and never more hear the blithe glad voice singing from _ la claire fontaine _ paul work bravely and strive to cheer he father and violette with she bright quick eye just a little like marie 's would come down and sing to he and bring he cool pink dew-bathed rose he thank they all but they love be not sufficient he heart be across the prairie by a grave upon which the violet be grow before the leaf fall he be lie by she side a cypress mark the grave and the little brook go by all the summer chapter x we leave the murderer upon the plain make speech like marius on the ruin of carthage the self-imposed banishment do not endure for long and the swarthy face of loui riel be once more see in riviere rouge when tiding of the murder get abroad english-speaking canada cry out that the felon should be hand over to justice i say english-speaking canada for the french people almost to a man give they sympathy to the man whose hand be red with the blood of he fellow creature they could not be induce to look upon the slaying as a act of inhuman bloody ferocity with which the question of race or religion have not the remotest connection it be because riel a frenchman and a roman catholic shot thoma scott a englishman and a protestant that all this cry for vengeance be hear over the land now have the case be reverse we would hear no english lamenting over a murder riel this be in effect what they say impossible almost as it might seem for one to be able to credit it for illiterate person who could see no treason in the uprising to condone the tumult and havoc and regard even the murder justifiable be what might have be expect but what shall be say for m george e cartier the enlighten statesman for pere richot the crocmitaine for pere lastanc the vicar-general and finally for monseigneur himself nothing can be say we can only as canadian all hang down we head in shame that any section of we common country should make such a exhibition of itself in the sight of humanity the protege of the hierarchy be not long to mope about the plain like another dumb and fall saturn no less proportion than that of un dieu hors de combat a very god overthrow would the deluded follower accord to the overwhelmed chief the clergy never suffer any aspersion to be throw upon le grand homme for by no less appellation be he know he have be you benefactor the coarse crocmitaine richot would say have he not rise and compel government to grant you you rights you would forever have be down-trodden by canadian tyrant when the rage of the heretic in ontario shall have cool down we must send le bienfaiteur to parliament and the time do actually come when the murderer appear upon the hustings in the west solicit the vote of the people nor do he appeal in vain _ he be elect _ nay more than this he set out for ottawa enter that city and in the open light of day walk up to the parliament building and in the eye of official and of the public subscribe he name to the member ' roll thousand have be in the habit of denounce sir john for permit a unhung felon to go about as a free man but when he come red-handed and presume to ottawa and enrol he name the reformer be in power before this date however the criminal have secure some official eulogy in the west and it happen in this wise some time after the appointment of mr archibald to the lieutenant-governorship of manitoba several band of fenian threaten to invade the territory and set up above the plain a green flag with a harp and a shamrock upon it mr archibald have at hand no force to resist the threaten attack and he become almost delirious with alarm so he send a messenger to m riel the untried felon whose crime be at the time the subject of voluminous correspondence between canada and the colonial office accept a proposal make by the ex-rebel to call out the half-breed in defense of the new province the fenian do not carry out they threat but it be much the same for the murderer of poor scott as if they have when the danger be blow over the lieutenant-governor walk in front of the ex-rebel line express he gratitude to the man and warmly shake hand with riel and lepine the presence of riel be yet a standing menace to peace among the half-breed beyond the limit of the new province the canadian government begin to devise means of get he out of the country they try persuasion but this be not a effective mode it be at this juncture that a sum be put into the hand of archbishop tache to pay the felon in consideration of he withdrawal all this time ontario be cry out for the capture of the man and it be while the amount be be place to the murderer 's credit with the archbishop that sir john raise he eye toward heaven and say : i wish to god i could catch he so riel take himself out of canada and traverse american territory till he find a district it montana thickly inhabit by half-breed here he establish himself in a sort of a fashion sometimes till the soil frequently hunting but all the while talk about red river he soon begin to forget marie and to cast languish eye upon some of the half-breed girl live upon the airy upland -lrb- footnote : it be state upon certain authority how good i do not know that the brave m riel rejoice in the possession of three wife one be say to be a french meti the other a scotch half-breed and the third a beautiful cree squaw with large dusky eye -rrb- he be regard as a great hero by these maiden for long before he come the daring brilliancy and great achievement of monsieur riel have be tell with enthusiasm at the fireside of every half-breed in montana we shall leave m riel in montana sometimes work sometimes hunting always woo and take a very brief glance at the cause which lead up to the present outbreak under the new legislation for the territory only those half-breed within the bound of the new province be guarantee secure possession of they land under the principle that all territory not grant in specific form to individual by the minister of the crown be the property of the crown each half-breed who occupy a lot of land under the hudson bay company 's rule be regard as a squatter under the new regime to make such hold valid therefore the government issue patent to _ bona fide _ squatter who then find themselves on the same footing as the white immigrant but beyond manitoba and chiefly in prince albert there be large number of half-breed settle over the prairie so long as no immigrant come prying about for choice land the half-breed have naught to complain about but the rapid influx of population soon alter the whole face of the matter several squatter who have toil for many a long year upon holding be oblige to make way for stranger who have friend at court -- for even in the north west wilderness there be in this sense a court -- and who take a fancy to the particular piece of land upon which these lazy half-breed be squat newspaper whose business it be to keep the skirt of government clean in the matter deny this altogether but unfortunately there be no use in deny it it be but too true and it be with a feeling of very great regret that i myself a conservative and a warm well-wisher of the administration affirm it it be true that in many and many a case in a greater number of instance than even opponent of the administration suppose a half-breed who have toil for a number of year upon a lot effect improvement and take pride in he property have be dispossess by a incomer because he could not show a patent from the interior department but almost as fruitful a source of dissatisfaction as these heartless and dishonest displacement have be the difficulty which the unfortunate squatter have experience in obtain he patent the mill of the god in the interior department grind very slowly the obtain of a patent by a deserving squatter as a general rule be about as difficult and as worthy of applause when achieve as be the task which lie before a farmer 's boy who have decide to become a member of parliament by first earn money enough to go to school to prepare for a third class teachership by then teach school till he have a sufficient competency to study medicine and by then practise he profession till he find himself able to capture the ride of course there be some excuse and we must not forget to produce it for the department of the interior it would be undignified if it be to move with any degree of rapidity accord to etiquette and the rule be very proper when the application of the half-breed come to the office it must remain for at least four week in the drawer set apart for correspondence to be read after it have be read it receive one or two mark with a red-lead pencil after which it be deposit in pigeon-hole no 1 now no document ever lodge for a shorter time than a month in pigeon-hole no 1 and if at the end of that period it should happen to be remove the clerk lay by he novel or tooth-pick as the case may be and put one or two blue mark upon the back of it when we consider that there be all the way from six to twenty pigeon-hole by a simple process of arithmetic we can get approximately near the period which it take the poor half-breed 's prayer to get from pigeon-hole alpha to pigeon-hole omega but during the process the back of the squatter 's application have become a work of art it be simply delightful to look upon it not alone contain memorandum and hieroglyphic make in red and blue pen-pencil but it be also beautify by mark make upon it in carmine ink in ink la brillanza a azure blue ink in myrtle green ink in violette noire but never it must be say to the credit of the department in common black but all these color be worthless indeed view from any point of view compare with its other acquisition solomon himself in all he glory be never deck out more gorgeously than this poor half-breed 's greasy sheet of foolscap be at the end of its journey through the pigeon-hole the prime minister of the crown in all he pomp of imperial order have not so many ribbon as this poor vagabond 's claim sometimes it be swathe in crimson tying sometimes in scarlet now and again in magenta and i be very happy to be able to say that pink and two very exquisite shades of blue know as birds-egg and cobalt have lately be introduce of course the half-breed complain when the week have swell into month and the month have get out of they teens that he have hear no answer to he prayer but the rascal should try to consider that he document have to make its voyage through the pigeon hole in this way there have be much heartburning and many curse against officialdom and red-tape while the back of the application be be turn out a christmas card a stray immigrant come along and the squatter half-breed have once more to go back for a new camping-ground but there be something to be say -- this time i be serious -- for the department in the matter though not a very great deal a number of the half-breed though a small a very very small proportion of the whole be restless vagabond who squat upon land with no intention of remain permanently but only with the object of speculation by sell they scrip leave the neighborhood take up another lot and receive in like manner disposable scrip again but the officer of the north-west must know that the half-breed people _ in general _ be constant-working and be desirous of achieve comfort and of affluence yet because of the act of a few unprincipled lazy wanderer some will seek to convey the impression that the conduct of the small few be a type of the method of all there be still among the many irritating cause all of which my limit will not permit I to dwell upon one which must not go unnoticed mr dewdney be not the gentleman who ought to have the immediate administration of north-west affair in he hand he have neither the understanding nor the inclination to make he a suitable administrator before all thing he be there for himself and he have even figure in the respectable role of land-grabbing i be sure that if the gentleman be to be provide for by the public no objection would be raise if sir john be to propose that he be recall and receive he salary all the same in consideration of the position he hold in the regard of the prime-minister and of those who be not exactly prime-ministers or minister mr dewdney have not alone get it into he head that a indian have no understanding but he must also endow himself with the conviction that he have no nostril a friend of mr dewdney get some meat but the article stank and the importer know not how to dispose of it o sell it to the indian the governor say and lo to the poor indian it be sell and sell at tenderloin price we can not eat em meat he stink the poor savage say em charge too much meat very bad let indian eat they meat the just mr dewdney retort or starve and be damned what right have a indian to complain of foul meat and to say that he have be charge too high a price for it he be only a savage let sir john take care well this be the state of affair when loui riel about a year ago leave off he woo for a little while and return to the old theater of he crime he find the people chafe under official injustice and delay that be almost equivalent to a denial of justice he do not care a fig for the condition of he people but like the long-winged petrel he be a bad weather bird and here be he opportunity he go abroad among the people foment the discord and assure they that if all other means fail they would obtain they rights by rise against the authority but the plain object of this plausible disturber be cash the lazy rascal have fail to earn a livelihood among the half-breed of montana and now be resolve to get some help from the dominion treasury presently intimation begin to reach the canadian government that if they make it worth m riel 's while he would leave the disaffected people and return to american territory the sum of $ 5000 it be learn a little later would make it worth he while to go back this if sir john 's statement in the house of common be to be trust the administration refuse to pay and now some good priest make up they valise and travel out of the north-west and all the way to ottawa to present the grievance of they people to the ministry archbishop tache likewise show himself at the capital on the same mission for god 's sake these man say give earnest careful prompt attention to affair in the north-west the people have sore grievance and they do not get the redress which be they due if you would prevent mischief and misery lose no time and as in duty bind the politician say : the government will give the matter its most serious consideration m royal and the priest return to the north-west down-spirited enough and mr macpherson sail for england while the half-breed be make up they mind to obtain by force the rights which they have fail to obtain through peaceable means and persistent prayer chapter xi the region know as prince albert be the chief seat of the disturbance it have be already point out in these page that the connect link between the indian and the whiteman be the half-breed it be not to be wonder at then that as soon as the meti begin to mutter vengeance against the authority the indian begin to hunt up they war paint the writer be not seek to put blame upon the government or upon the department delegate especially to attend to indian affair with respect to its management of the tribe any one who have study the question at all must know that there be nothing to be lay at the door of the government in this regard a very clear statement of the whole question of indian management and of the assumption of the north-west territory may be find in mr henry j morgan 's annual register for 1878 while the same admirable work give from year to year a capital _ resume _ of the condition of the tribe some divine recently in the north-west have be discuss the indian question in some of the religious newspaper of toronto but they have treat the question in the spirit of inexperienced spinster the government have be most criminally remiss in they treatment of the half-breed but let it be repeat they indian policy give no ground for condemnation yet when the half-breed of prince albert incite by riel begin to collect fire-arm and to drill in each other barn the indian begin to sing and dance and to brandish they tomahawk they way of live during late year have be altogether too slow too dead-and-alive too unlike the way of they ancestor when once at least in each year every warrior return to he lodge with scalp lock dangle at he belt les gros-ventre for the time forget they corporosity and begin to dance and howl and declare that they would fight till all they blood be spill with m riel or he adjutant m dumont the blackfeet begin to hold pow-wow and tell they squaw that there would soon be good feast for many a day they have be cast covetous eye upon the fat cattle of they white neighbor along too come the feeble remnant of the once agile salteaux inquire if it be to be war and if so would there be big feast o big feast big feast be the reply plenty fat cattle in the coral and heap of mange in the store so the salteaux be happy and somewhat in they old fashion go vault homewards tiding of fight and feast and turmoil reach the cree and they sally out from the tent while the large-eyed squaw sit silently recline marvel what be to come of it all high into the air the nez perce thrust he nostril for he have get the scent of the battle from afar and last but not least come the remnant of that tribe whose chief have shoot custer in the black hill the sioux only require to be show where the enemy lay but in he enthusiasm he do not lose sight of the fat cattle grazing upon the prairie these however be only the first impulse of the tribe many of they now begin to remember that the government have show they many kindness give they tea and tobacco and blanket and provide they with implement to plough the land and ox to draw the plough and some of the chief come forward and say you must not fight against the great mother she love the indian the red man be well treat here better than away south ask the sioux who live down there they tell you maybe such advice serve to set the indian reflect but many hundred of they prefer to hear loui riel 's word which be : -- indian have be badly treat the canadian government have take away they land the buffalo be nearly all go and government see the red man die of starvation without any concern if you fight now you will make they dread you and then they will be more liberal with you besides during the war you can have plenty of feast among the fat cattle a hellish war-whoop of approval always greet such word at length the rise come gabriel dumont riel 's lieutenant a courageous skilful half-breed possess of a sound set of brain have drill several hundred of the indian and half-breed arm with all sort of gun they collect and station themselves near duck lake my man dumont say you may not have to fight for the officer may agree to the demand which i shall make of they on behalf of the indian and the half-breed people but if they refuse and insist on pass you know for what purpose you have take arm into you hand let every shot be fire only after deliberate aim look to it that you fire low after you have strew the plain with they dead they will go away with some respect for we then they will send out commissioner to make term with we in the meantime the success of we attack will bring hundred of timid person to we standard this harangue be receive with deafening cheer so the rebel post themselves in the wood and fill a sturdily build house near by wait for the approach of major crosier and he force at last they be see out upon the cold snow-covered prairie a wild shout go up from the inmate of the house and it be answer from tree to tree through all the wintry wood in the exuberance of he delight one indian would yelp like a hungry wolf who sight he prey and another would hoot like a owl in the middle of the night at last the police and civilian be close at hand the meeting take place in a hollow beyond be the dim illimitable prairie on either hand be clump of naked dismal poplar and cluster of white oak snow be everywhere and when a man move the crunching of the crust could be hear far upon the chill air signal be make for a parley when some of the man from each side approach the line of demarcation joe mckay be the interpreter and while he be speak a indian name little chief grab at he revolver and try to wrest it from he a struggle ensue in which the indian be worst then raise he weapon mckay fire at the red skin who drop dead this be the signal for battle the voice of dumont could be hear ring through the hollow and over the hill with perfect regularity he force spread out over a commanding bluff each man throw himself flat upon the ground either shield he body in the deep snow or get behind a tree or boulder major crozier 's force then draw they sled across the trail and the police throw themselves down behind it then come the word begin my man from the commander -- and immediately the crackle of rifle startle the hush of the wilderness the police be lie down yet they be not completely sheltered but the civilian be stand my god i be shot say one and he fall upon the snow not move again then with a cry another fall and another from the wood on every hand come the whistle shot and the rush slug of the rebel every tree have behind it a rebel with deadly aim but the murderous bullet seem to come out of the inanimate wilderness for not no much as the hand that pull the deadly trigger could be see the police have a mountain gun which major crozier now order they to bring to bear on the rebel but the policeman who load it be so confused that he put the lead in before the powder in forty minute the bloody fray be end seven of the loyalist be dead in they blood upon the snow two lay die eleven other be wound and bleed profusely then come the word to retire when the major 's force draw off from the bluff and out of all the wood now come diabolical yell and jeer shout the day belong to the rebel when the police have move away the indian and half-breed come out from they ambush and begin to hold rejoicing over the dead they kick the body and then begin to plunder they get among other booty two gold watch two of the fall loyalist they observe still breathe and these they shoot through the head so closely do they hold the muzzle of they murderous gun that the victim ' face be afterwards find discolor with powder then return to camp they secure seven prisoner whom they have capture and lead they to the battle-field make they look at the stark body of the loyalist at the same time heap all manner of savage insult upon the dead a couple of day later the body of the victim be bury upon the plain by the order of riel a little later the snow fall and give the poor fellow ' grave a white cold coverlet when tiding of the battle and of the defeat of we man reach the east the wildest excitement prevail at once the minister of militia begin to take stock of he force and some regiment be order out the volunteer need no urge but promptly offer they service for the front they loyalty be cheer to the echo and thousand assemble at every railway station to see they depart and say god speed chapter xii while general middleton colonel otter and other of we military officer be hasten to the scene of tumult tiding of the most startling kind be receive from frog lake frog lake be a small settlement about forty mile north of fort pitt and here a number of thrifty settler have establish themselves till the soil latterly however some enterprising person come there to erect a saw and grist mill for much lumber fringe the lake and a considerable quantity of grain be produce upon the prairie round about there be only a few white settler here all the rest be half-breed not far away live detachment of various tribe of indian who frequently come into the little settlement and smoke they pipe among the inhabitant here as elsewhere the most bitter feeling be entertain by the half-breed and indian against the government and chief of all against governor dewdney every one with white skin and all those who in any way be in the service of the government soon come to be regard as enemy to the common cause therefore when night come down upon the settlement indian smear in hideous raw earthy-smelling paint would creep about among dwelling and peer with eye gleam with hate through the window-frame at the innocent and unsuspecting inmate at last one chief with a diabolical face say brother we must be avenge upon every white man and woman here we will shoot they like dog no harm can come to we for the great man have say so -lrb- allude to riel -rrb- when they be all shoot the government will get a big fright and give the indian and half-breed what they ask for the answer to this harangue be the clanking of barbaric instrument of music the brandishing of tomahawk and the gleam of hunting-knife secretly the indian go among the half-breed squat about and reveal they plan but some of these people shrink with fear from the proposal other however say we shall join you let we with one blow wipe out the injustice do to we and teach the government that if they deny we we rights we will fight for they and murder those who be the agent of its will so the plan be arrange and it be not very long before it be carry out and now runner be everywhere on the plain tell that dumont have a mighty army make up of most of the brave indian of the prairie and comprise all the dead shot among the half-breed that he have encounter heavy force of police and armed civilian and overthrow they without lose a single man they likewise declare that he have host of prisoner and that the whole of canada be tremble with fear at the mention of the name of riel and dumont now be we time to strike say the indian with the fiendish face and the wolf-like eye therefore the 2nd day of April be fix for the holding of the conference between the indian and the white settlers the malignant chief have settle the plan when the white face come to we lodge they will expect no harm ugh then the red man will have he vengeance so every indian be instruct to have he rifle at hand in the lodge the white folk wonder why the indian have arrange for a conference we can do nothing to help they case they say we ourselves find it difficult enough to get the ear of government it will only waste time to go many of they therefore remain at home occupy themselves with they various duty while the rest merely for the sake of agreeableness and of shew the indian that they be interested in they affair proceed to the place appoint for the pow-wow we hope to smoke we pipe before we white brother go away from we be what the treacherous chief with wolfish eye have say in order to put the settler off they guard the morning of the 2nd open gloomily as if it could not look cheerily down upon the bloody event plan in this distant wilderness low indigo cloud look down over the hill but there be not a stir in all the air nor be any living thing to be see stir save that troops of blue-jays go scolding from tree to tree before the settler as they proceed to the conference and they perceive a few half-famished yellow and black and yellow dog with small head and long scraggy hair sculk about the field and among the wigwam of the indian in search for food the lodge where the parley be to be hold stand in a hollow behind be a tall bluff crown with timber round about it green poplar white oak and some fir while in front roll by a swift stream which have just burst its winter fetter unsuspecting aught of harm two priest of the settlement oblat father name fafard and la marchand be the first at the spot what a gloomy day pere fafard say and this lodge set here in this desolate spot seem to make it more gloomy still what i wonder be the nature of the business then they knock and the voice of the chief be hear to say entrez open the door the two good priest walk in and turn to look for seat ah what be the sight present to they eye like those of wild beast aflame with hate and ferocity gleam at they from the gloom of the back portion of the room the priest be amaze they know not what all this mean then a wild shriek be give and the chief cry enemy to the red man you have come to you doom then raise he rifle he fire at father marchand the levelling of he rifle be the general signal a dozen other muzzle be pointed and in a far briefer space of time than it take to relate it the two priest lay weltering in they blood pierce each by half a dozen bullet clear away these corpse shout the chief and be ready for the next there be soon another knock at the door and the same wolfish voice reply as before say entrez this time a full manly-looking young fellow name charle gowan open the door and enter always on the alert for indian treachery he have he suspicion now before enter he suspect strongly that all be not right he have only reach the settlement that morning and have he return sooner he would have counsel the settler to pay no heed to the invitation he be assure that several have already go up to the pow-wow so be brave and unselfish he say if there be any danger afoot and my friend be at the meeting-lodge that be the place for I not here he have no sooner enter than he worst conviction be realize with one quick glance he see the bloodpool the wolfish eye the row of ready rifle hell hound he cry what bloody work have you on hand what mean this point to the floor it mean reply the chief that some of you pale-face brethren have be lose they heart 's blood there it also mean that the same fate await you resolve to sell he life as dearly as lay in he power he spring forward with a colt 's revolver and discharge it twice one indian fall and another set up a cry like the bellowing of a bull but poor gowan do not fire a third shot a tall savage approach he from behind and striking he upon the head with he rifle-stock fell he to the earth then the savage

under the great journalistic enterprise of mr j t hawke have keep the people at the capital well inform from day to day on affair at the scene of tumult -rrb- two other person be surprise in the same way and shoot down like dog make a total of eleven slaughter the first official confirmation of the dreadful tragedy be give in a despatch send from fort pitt to sir john macdonald by police inspector dickens a son of the immortal novelist chapter xiii perhaps of all the act of bravery record during this late rebellion not one stand out more prominently than that of inspector dickens in resist with he little force a large band of blood-thirsty cree till he would with advantage and honor retire from he ground fort pitt stand in the center of the cree country and be the scene of the treaty between the government and the cree chippewayan assinniboine and the chippewa there be great difficulty at the time in conclude the term of the treaty big bear who reign supreme in the district and who be spokesman at the treaty maintain that hang ought to be abolish and the buffalo protect on the whole he accept the condition of the treaty but as he people be not present he would not sign it although he do sign it in the following year big bear be a noisy meddlesome savage who be never in he glory save when he be the center of some disturbance he have always show much delight in talk about war and he would go without he meal to listen to a good story about fight he have the habit to when the reciter of the story have finish of try to discount what he have hear and to make he auditor believe that some exploit of he own have be far more thrilling when everything be peaceable even when there be plenty of buffalo and peltry to be have this savage be not satisfied but still go around ask if there be any news about trouble be about to take place anywhere if he be tell : no everything be quiet the indian be all satisfied because they be do well big bear will reply while knowingly close one eye : I know better than that there will soon be bloody work government break em treaty with injun lot of injun now ready to go out and scalp servant of the government and white man when therefore tiding reach the land of the stoney indian that the half-breed with loui riel at they head have break into revolt big bear pull off he feathered cap and throw it several time into the air he go to he wife a goodly number of which he be in the habit of keep and inform they that he would soon bring they home some scalp he be so elated that he order several of the young man to go and fetch he several white dog to make a feast so a large fire be build upon the prairie a short distance from the chief 's lodge and the huge festival pot be suspend from a crane over the roar flame first about fifteen gallon of water be put into this pot then big bear 's wife some of whom be old and wrinkled and other of which be lithe as fawn plump and bright-eyed busy themselves gather herb some dig deep into the marsh for root of the dog-bane other search among the knotted root for the little nut-like tuber that cling to the root of the flag while other bring to the pot wild parsnip and the dry stalk of the prairie pusley a coy little maiden whom many a hunter have woo but fail to win have in she sweet little brown hand a tangle of winter-green and maiden-hair then come stride along the young hunter with the dog each dog select for the feast be white as the drive snow if a black hair or a blue hair or a brown hair be discover anywhere upon he body he be take away but if he be _ san reproche _ he be put just as he be head and hide and paw and tail on -- he throat simply have be cut -- into the pot six dog be throw in and the root and stalk of the prairie plant together with salt and bunch of the wild pepper-plant and of swamp mustard be throw in for season through the reserve round about for many mile swarth herald proclaim that the great chief big bear be give a white dog feast to he brave before summon they to follow he upon the war-path the feast be in indian experience a magnificent one and before the young man depart they swear to big bear that they return only for they war-paint and arm and that before the set of the next sun they would be back at he side true to they word the indians come hideous in they yellow paint if you stand to leeward of they upon the plain a mile away you could clearly get the raw earthy smell of the ochre upon they hand and face some have black bar streak across they cheek and hideous crimson circle about they eye some likewise have star in pipe-clay paint upon the forehead now the immediate object of the warlike enthusiasm of all these young man be the capture of fort pitt a undertaking which they hardly consider worth shoulder they rifle for but when it come to the actual take it be a somewhat different matter there be twenty-one policeman in the fort and they have at they head a intrepid chief mr inspector dickens already refer to in this chapter it be useless to fire bullet at the solid stockade massacre be out of the question for keen eye peer ever from the fort big bear now have grow very ambitious fort pitt hardly worth bother about he say to he brave plenty of big fighting everywhere we 'll go with monsieur riel but we must have gun good gun and plenty of powder and shot and ball so take a number of he brave he approach the fort and begin to bellow that he want to have a talk inspector dickens appear call out well what do big bear want we want gun and powder and shot and ball pray what do big bear want with they he young man be suffer of hunger and they want to go shoot some elk and bear big bear be talk with a crooked tongue he must not have any rifle or powder or shot or ball i advise he to return peaceably to he reserve and if there be anything that the government can do for himself or he people i be sure they will do it he will only make matter worse by create a disturbance ugh the great police chief also talk with a crooked tongue and if he do not give what the indian ask for they will burn down the fort and murder himself and he follower not spare either the woman or the child if this be you intention you shall not find we unprepared just at this moment two mount police who have be out upon the plain as scout come in sight at once inspector dickens perceive that the savage mean mischief a number of rifle be raise at the unsuspecting policeman then several shot be hear constable cowan fall from he horse dead pierce by several bullet constable lousby be hit by a couple of bullet but get into the fort before the savage could prevail now my man shout inspector dickens show these insolent savage that you can defy they at once a rake fire be pour into the rebel four of the rebel fall dead and some score of other be wound the conduct of some of the savage who receive slight wound be exceedingly ludicrous one who have be shoot _ in run away _ begin to yell in the most pitiable way and he run about the plain kick up he heel and grab at the wound spot which it be to be infer must have be sting he very badly i must not omit to speak that before the _ recontre _ chief factor maclean who have always be hold in high regard among the indian go out of the fort to have a parley with big bear arrive at the door of the chief 's lodge he knock big bear admit he with the greatest pleasure and after he have do so say : guess I keep you since I 's get you so the chief factor find himself a prisoner then big bear inform he captive that if he would write a letter to the rest of the civilian in the fort ask they to withdraw and enter into the indian lodge he would treat they civilly but that if they refuse he would set fire to the fort and they would perish in the flame this maclean consent to do and in a little while there go out from the fort to the indian prison mr maclean 's family consist of eight jame simpson stanley simpson w b cameron one dufresne rev c quinn and he wife and mr and mr mann with they three child since that date these people have be prisoner in big bear 's camp and every now and again the tiding come that they be receive barbarous and even brutal treatment after big bear have get possession of all these he say to he chief young man : ` spose we take em in too mount police no harm get they gun keep they here for a spell and then let 'em go when he coolly present himself before the stockade and propose to inspector dickens to come right over to he lodge assure he that he would not allow the hair of one of he man 's head to be harm inspector dickens laugh : you be a very presumptuous savage after the fight which i have describe inspector dickens study the situation regard it in this light : the civilian have go to the indian so there be now no object to be attain by keep my force here in the battle with the savage i be successful therefore may retreat with honor fitting up a york boat he have it provision for the journey and then destroy everything in the shape of supplies arm and ammunition which he could not take away they start down the river and after a tedious journey arrive at battleford wear with anxious watch exposure and fatigue but otherwise safe and well save for the wound constable the brave inspector be receive at battleford with ring acclamation here in a little he be appoint to the command of the police supersede lt-colonel morri altogether there be not in the whole campaign a instance in which good judgment and bravery stand out so prominently as in this record of the conduct of the son of we great english novelist chapter xiv no accident in the whole history of the present rebellion so ill bear to be write about as do this of the sack of battleford this be a town of considerable importance and it have a strongly-built fort garrison by mount police it stand close to a large cree reserve and the prairie around it be very fertile the population latterly have be grow rapidly when first the disturbance break out it be fear that there would be trouble with the stoney cree in this region for poundmaker a great brawling indian chief be always ready like he boastful brother big bear to join in any revolt against authority poundmaker for many a year have do little save to smoke drink tea among the squaw and tell lie as long as the saskatchewan river about all the battle he fight when he be a young man and how terrible be he name over all the plain poundmaker have always be successful as a boaster and there be hardly a squaw on the whole reserve who do not think he to be one of the most illustrious and mighty man alive therefore he have never sue in vain for the hand of a pretty maiden without success and he have now no fewer than a score of wife whom he be not able to support and who be therefore compel to go on they bare brown foot among the marsh in the summer killing frog and muskrat the lazy rascal never work but sit at home drinking strong tea smoking and tell lie while he wife young one and old one and he brawling papoose go abroad look for something to eat now besides poundmaker there be among those stoney cree two other mischief-loving half-and-half chief one delighted in the name of lucky man and the other of little pine these two vagabond league themselves with poundmaker when the first tiding of the the outbreak reach they and paint they face go abroad among the young man incite they to revolt they remind they that if they arise they would have plenty of big feast for the prairie be full of the white man 's cattle and little pine glance with snaky eye toward the town of battleford may be by-em-by get fine thing out of store go in and frighten away 'em people then take heap o ' nice thing get squaw may be to help 'em to carry 'em away this be just the sort of incentive that the young man want and the indian girl scream with delight at the prospect of red shawl and heap of ribbon and box of brass ring and pretty red and white stocking and boot with button on they presently big bear and little pine and lucky man begin to get they force in motion arm with bow and arrow spear and tomahawk shot-gun and flint-musket and follow by gew-gaw-loving girl squalling pappoose and half starve yellow dog the cree with the three beauty just mention at they head march toward the town the people apprise of the intended attack have flee to the police barracks so that when the savage enter the town the street be desert then commence the work of pillage accord to a correspondent of the _ montreal star _ house after house be visit in quick succession the squaw loudly acclaim and shout as the buck smash in the door with axis firearm be the first thing seek for by the brave while the female ransack each dwelling from top to bottom in search of such article as delighted the feminine eye soon the hitherto quiet and peaceful town of battleford be transform into a veritable place of destruction tear carpet chair bedstead and empty trunk be throw into the street which be throng by at least 500 indian who make hideous with war paint shout and discharge they rifle simultaneously create a perfect pandemonium when the pillager have accomplish they work they commence the attack on the barracks but be repulse with a trifling loss some young buck get roll of carpet which they extend along the street and then mount they pony ride up and down over the aesthetic pattern the squaw get finery enough to deck themselves in for the next year and the amount of brass ring that they carry away be enough to make glad the heart of all indian-dom after have surfeit themselves with destruction they return each one laden to he and she utmost capacity with booty several place be gut and demolish in other case property be destroy and some establishment be set on fire all this while major morri and he police and nearly two hundred able body man with 200 rifle and plenty of ammunition be coop up in the fort peep out at the squaw pillage the town it seem a little illogical that we should call out we young man from halifax from quebec from montreal from kingston from ottawa and from the other city that put force into the field to go out into the far wilderness to protect property when able-bodied man with arm in they hand stand by and watch unmoved a body of savage and squaw pillage they town and give they property to the flame it be to relieve this town that colonel otter make the brilliant march upon which writer and orator have not be able to bestow enough of eulogy chapter xv after the defeat of the police and civilian at duck lake riel and dumont feel thoroughly confident of be able to deal with the force which they be apprise the canadian government would send into the field against they they hold many long consultation together and in every case it be dumont who lay down the detail of the military campaign these canadian soldier he would say can not fight we here we will entrench ourselves in position against which they may fire cannon or gatle gun in vain they be not use to bush-fighting and will all the time expose themselves to we bullet besides distance here be deceptive and in they confusion they will make the wildest sort of shoot it be decide that the rebel force should make they main stand at a advantageous position which dumont have accidentally observe one day when he be out elk-stalking three year ago this place he assure he chief seem to be intend by nature for a post of defense it lay a short distance from batoche 's cross but my idea be to engage they several time with portion of my force gradually to fall back and then fight at my final ground the battle which shall decide who be master in these territory the half-breed or the canadian volunteer all this while general middleton with he brave fellow have be make one of the most laborious march record in modern war perhaps the worst portion of the march be around the dismal reach of lake superior i take a extract from correspondence to the toronto _ mail _ but the most severe trial be last night 's in a march from red rock to nepigon a distance of only seven mile across the ice yet it take nearly five hour to do it after leave the car the battalion parade in line a couple of camp fire serve to make the darkness visible all the man be anxious to start and when the word be give to march it be greet with cheer it be impossible to march in fours therefore a order be give for left turn quick march we turn obedient to the order but the march be anything but quick then into the solemn darkness of the pine and hemlock the column slowly move each side be snow four foot deep it be almost impossible to keep the track and a misstep bury the unfortunate individual up to he neck then it begin rain and for three mortal hour there be a continuous down pour the lake be reach at last to the extreme pleasure of the corps the wildness of the afternoon and the rain turn the snow into slush at every step the man sink half a foot all attempt to preserve distance be soon abandon by the man who clasp hand to prevent fall the officer struggle on arm link for the same purpose now and then man would drop in the rank the fact only be discover by those in the rear stumble over they some actually fall asleep as they march one brave fellow have plod on without a murmur for three day he have be suffer but through the fear of be leave behind in the hospital refrain from make he case know he tramp half-way across last night 's march reel like a drunken man but nature give out at last and with a groan he fall on the snow there he lay the pitiless rain beating on a boyish upturned face until a pass sleigh stop behind he the driver flash he lantern in the upturned face say he be dead ` not yet old man ' be the reply of the youth as he open he eye ` i be not even a candidate for the hospital yet ' the follow description of the great salt plain as give by a _ globe _ correspondent be also worth reproduce : the great salt plain open out like broad dreary marsh or arm of the sea from which the tide have go out for about thirty-five mile the trail stretch in a north-westerly course across this dismal expanse and away to the south-west as far as the eye can reach nothing save marsh grass flag bullrush and occasionally clump of marsh willow can be see north-east of the trail scatter bluff of stunt gray willow cluster along the horizon and at one point along the trail about midway of the plain be find a small solitary clump of stoneberry bush not more than thirty yard long five or six foot in width and only three or four foot high the objective point of major-general middleton 's march be batoche 's cross where riel have several large pit sink and fortification throw up for a grand and final encounter with we troops the line of march lay sometimes along the saskatchewan 's bank but more frequently through the open prairie the position of the rebel prior to the battle be this : dumont with 250 half-breed and indian have be retreat slowly before general middleton 's right column on the east bank of the river they scout keep they inform of the general 's movement dumont appear to have think of wait for the troops to attack he on Thursday night at least that be the belief of the scout who see some of he mount man signalling to he all afternoon on Thursday however that may be he lay wait for we man at the edge of a big _ coulee _ near fish creek early on Friday morning he force be snugly stow away behind boulder or conceal in the dense everglade of hazel birch and poplar from day to day almost from hour to hour this veteran buffalo hunter have learn every tiding of the general 's troops that keen observation make from clump of bush along the prairie could give he so when he learn that the general himself with he officer be near at hand he eye fairly gleam with enthusiasm my man he say as he go from covert to covert from bluff to bluff you know the work that lie before you i need not repeat it to you do not expose yourself and do not fire unless you have a tolerable target then he arrange a system of signal chiefly low whistle and call by which the man would be able to know when to advance retire lie close make a dash or move from one part of the ground to another they will at first fall into a ambush he say then my man be nimble in the panic there will be a rich harvest for you bring down the general if you can wherever a officer be in range let he have a taste of you lead in preference to the private then he lay close and watch and listen many time put he ear to the ground at last he give a exclamation it be in a whisper but the silent rebel who lay there mute as the husht tree around they could well hear the word they come let I now briefly describe the position which the rebel have choose for himself about five mile from mcintosh 's stand two bluff about five hundred yard apart thickly wood on the top between these bluff be a level open prairie that extend backward about a thousand yard across which there run a deep ravine thickly timber at the bottom now on the morning of Friday the twenty-fourth of April general middleton who be still on the march to batoche 's be ride with he staff well in front with he be major boulton 's horse who act as scout as they be pass the two bluff name suddenly the crack of musketry ring out upon the prairie major boulton now perceive that he have fall into a ambush at the same time that deadly ball and buck-shot come whistle and cut spitefully through the air there arise from both bluff the most diabolical yell for mile over the silent prairie could these murderous yell be hear nor be the rebel ball fire without effect captain gardner fall bleed upon the ground and several of the man have also fall general middleton who have be some little distance in the rear be speedily apprise of the surprise and dash on toward the rebel ' hold he meet boulton 's horse retire for reinforcement then a battery the 90th regiment and c company toronto with enthusiastic cheer begin to cry out : show we the rebel in a little while the firing become general and we man strike out extend they formation as they near the edge of the _ coulee _ from which puff of smoke be already curl up twenty of dumont 's man with winchester fire over a natural shelf or parapet protect by big boulder the column be divide into two wing the left consist of b and f company of the 90th with boulton 's mount corps and the right of the rest of the 90th a battery and c school of infantry the left wing f company lead come under fire first as the man be pass by he gen middleton shout out : man of the 90th do not bend you head you will soon be there go in and i know you 'll do you duty the man be bend down partly to avoid the shot and partly because they be run over the uneven scrubby ground colour-sergeant mitchell of f company -lrb- one of the famous wimbledon mitchell -rrb- display great coolness and afterwards do good execution with a rifle when the troops have enter the bush a c and d company of the 90th with a battery and the school of infantry be on the right the whole force form a huge half-moon around the mouth of the _ coulee _ the brush be densely thick and as rain be fall the smoke hang in cloud a few foot off the muzzle of the rifle here the 90th lose heavily ferguson be the first to fall the bandsman come up and carry off the injure to the rear where dr whiteford and other surgeon have extemporize a small camp the man be lay some on camp-stretcher and some on rude bed of branch and blanket e company of the 90th under capt whitlum guard the wound and the ammunition general middleton appear to be highly please with the bearing of the 90th as they push on and repeatedly express he admiration he seem to think however that the man expose themselves unnecessarily when they get near the _ coulee _ in skirmish order they fire while lie prostrate but some of they either through nervousness or a desire to get nearer the unseen enemy keep rise to they foot and the moment they do so dumont 's man drop they with bullet or buckshot the rebel on the other hand keep low they load most of they have powder and shot bag below the edge of the ravine or behind the thicket and then pop up for a instant and fire they have not time to take aim except at the outset when the troops be advance meanwhile the right wing have go into action also two gun of a battery under capt peter dash up at 10:40 o'clock and at once open on the _ coulee _ a couple of old barn far back to the right be knock into splinter at the outset it be suppose that rebel be conceal there and three haystack be bowl over and subsequently set on fire by the shell or fuse attention be then centre on the ravine at first however the battery 's fire have no effect as from the elevation on which the gun stand the shot go whiz over it dumont have send thirty man to a small bluff cover with boulder and scrub within 450 yard of the battery and these open a sharp fire the battery could not fire into this bluff without run the risk of kill some of the 90th who have work they way up towards the right of it several man of a be strike here the rebel see that they sharpshooter be cause confusion in this quarter and about twenty of they run clear from the back of the ravine past the fire of c and d company to the bluff and join they comrade in a rattle fusillade on a fortunately only a few of they have winchester a move forward a little and soon get the measure of the ravine the shrapnel screech in the air and burst right in among the brush and boulder smash the scraggy tree and tear up the moss that cover the ground in patch the rebel at once see that the game be up in this quarter though they keep up a bold front and seldom stop firing except when they be dodge back into new cover in do this they rarely expose themselves either creep on all fours or else run a few yard in the shelter of the thicket and then throw themselves flat on the ground again bob up only when they raise they head and elbow to fire the shrapnel be too much for they and they begin to bolt towards the other side of the ravine where we left wing be pepper they this move be the first symptom of weakness they have exhibit and gen middleton at once take advantage of it and order the whole force to close in upon they he object apparently be to surround they the rebel commander however be not to be catch in that way instead of bunch all he force on the leave away from the fire of the artillery he send only a portion of it there to keep we man busy while the rest fill off to the north retire slowly as we two wing close on they dumont be evidently on the look-out for the appearance of col montizambert 's force from the other side of the river the general advance begin at 1145 be major buchan of the 90th lead the right wing and major boswell of the same corps the leave when the rebel see this a number of they rush forward on the left of the ravine and the fight for a time be carry on at close quarter the enemy not be over sixty yard away a old log hut and a number of barricade form by place old tree and brushwood between the boulder enable they to make it exceedingly warm for we man for a time at this point several of the 90th be wound and general middleton himself have a narrow escape a bullet go through he fur hat captain wise and doucet of montreal the general 's aide-de-camp be wound about this time c infantry behave remarkably well all through and bear the brunt of the general advance for some time the buckshot from the rebel do much damage the rebel front be soon drive back but neither here nor at any other time could the rebel ' loss be ascertain the indian among they who be arm with gun appear to devote themselves mainly to shoot the horse a good many indian be hit and every time one of they be strike the other near he raise a loud shout as if cheer the troops press on gallantly and the rebel fire slacken and after a time die away though now and then they front rifleman make a splurge while the other make they way back captain forrest of the 90th head the advance at this point lieutenant hugh j macdonald -lrb- son of sir john macdonald -rrb- of this company who have do excellent service all day keep well up with forrest the two be ahead of they man and come in for a fair share of attention from the retreat rebel macdonald be first report as kill and then as wounded but he be not injure though strike on the shoulder by spend buckshot forrest 's hat be shoot off at 1250 the rebel be far out of range go towards batoche 's and the battle of fish creek be practically over -lrb- footnote : i be chiefly indebted to the toronto _ mail _ for the foregoing account of the battle -rrb- during the battle many instance of the greatest bravery be record private ainsworth of the 90th be see to leap upon the shoulder of a savage who in company with another have endeavor to cross the flat land and get shelter wrest he gun and fell he to the earth with the butt of it then secure the rifle firing at and kill the other indian while do this he be expose to the fire of a score of gun get riddled with buck-shot and be strike with bullet but the greatest daring and bravery be exhibit by watson of the toronto school of infantry finding it impossible to dislodge the enemy he rush headlong for the ambuscaded half-breed follow by a score of he comrade whom it be impossible to control the war-cry of the indian the huzza of the troops and the rattle of musketry fairly echo for mile as evidence by the statement of the west side contingent upon arrive on the scene watson pay the penalty of he daring by death while the narrow escape of many other be remarkable the utmost bravery all the while be display by we troops when a man fall he comrade would pause for a moment and say : i hope you be not badly hurt and then again look out for the enemy some of the man who receive only slight wound be anxious to remain in the fight but they officer insist that they should be take to the rear and attend to by the surgeon upon couch make of bough and cover with blanket the brave young fellow be place and many of they submit to probing and painful management of wound without make a murmur they seem not to be concern for themselves but go on all the while enquire as to how it be go with the boy general middleton himself a veteran soldier express as i have already state he admiration for the bravery of all the man who be engage there be no bolt even in the face of heavy fire no shrink although _ one man in every eight _ have be strike by the enemy 's shot or bullet major boulton have many narrow escape while he be stand for a moment a hail of buckshot come whistle by he ear bury itself into he horse which be kill instantly the scout know as boulton 's horse under this brave officer bear very gallantly they portion of the battle 's brunt half-bread and indian have order from they leader to shoot down horse as well as man and dumont frequently say that the mount man be the only one of the force of the enemy for which he care anything several of the horse be shoot and many of the man be riddled with buck-shot but they bravely stand they ground in the night when the weary be sleep after the hard day 's work dusky form could be see by the light of the moon creep stealthily towards where sleep the gallant scout the guard hear a crackle and turn perceive three pair of eye gleam with ferocity in the shadow of a clump of poplar qui vive he cry and raise he rifle but before he could take aim three shot ring out through the still night and he fall dead pierce by as many bullet there be a general alarm through the camp but no eye could detect the form of a rebel they be safe among the shadow in the ravine in the few moment of silent horror that ensue after the commission of the murder three diabolical yell sound from the ravine and far over the moon-lit prairie then diver voice be hear in the bluff and down in the gorge these come from dumont 's man who jeer and cry that they hope the soldier enjoy the pastime of watch they dead on the follow day the body of the brave young fellow who have fall after be decently and decorously dispose in death be bring to the grave hollow out in this far-away wilderness by the hand of old comrade it be a very sad spectacle indeed the death of brave soldier be always mournful to contemplate but war be the _ trade _ of regular and they expect death and burial in distant sod but war be not the trade of we volunteer soldier they be mere young fellow of various pursuit of life and death and burial away from home lose nothing of they sorrowful

there be no use now in have long discussion as to whose shoulder should bear the responsibility of all the devastation terror misery and blood the duty of the hour be to put a end to the rebellion riel must be capture at any cost so too must dumont man so strongly a menace to public peace as riel and he bad and fearless ally dumont must not be give the opportunity again of cover the land with blood there must be a pretty wholesome hanging in the north-west and the gentleman whom the authority must give first attention to be the two villain just name poundmaker big bear little pine lucky man and those bloody wolf who perpetrate the butchery at frog lake i have say that this be not the place to discuss at length the question of the government 's responsibility for this blood and sorrow and misery neither be it yet one and all believe though thousand will belie they conviction that there have be a criminal mismanagement of these half-breed people by the authority at ottawa i have be oblige to show that in the past many of we french co-patriot bestow a most astonishing and unjustifiable sympathy for riel i be glad to be able to say that in the present case while censure the government for its indifference to the grievance of the half-breed they have no word of justification for the murderous apostle of tumult bishop langevin brother of the hon the minister of public work issue a pastoral in which there be no uncertain sound he call upon the faithful son of the country within he diocese to come forward and join hand against a cause of tumult destruction and murder the trial and execution of loui riel on the 20th of July the court meet when riel be formally arraign the clerk read the long indictment in reply to the interrogation whether the prisoner plead guilty to the charge of treason he counsel rise and take exception to the jurisdiction of the court the plea enter by the defense be to the affect that the preside stipendiary magistrate be incompetent to try a case involve the death penalty and urge that riel should be try by one of the duly constitute court in ontario or in british columbium mr christopher robinson qc for the crown ask for a adjournment for eight day to prepare a reply to the plea which be grant the court then adjourn to the 28th instant on the re-opening of the court counsel express themselves ready to proceed only a few minute be take up in select a jury twelve person be call five of whom be peremptorily challenge by the defense and one by the crown the remain six be swear in to try the prisoner at the bar they name be as follow : -- h j painter e everett e j brooks j w merryfield h dean and f crosgrove during the selection of the jury it be observe by a correspondent of _ the mail _ to whom we shall be indebted for the report of the trial in make the present abstract that riel anxiously watch the face of every man as he be select and swear as though he could read they inmost thought as they take the oath after read the indictment to the jury mr b b osler qc open the case for the crown in which he explain the nature of the charge against the prisoner whose career he trace through the successive step of the rebellion and indicate the weight and character of the evidence to be bring against its wicked instigator and chief leader the plea of the defense of the incompetence of the court to try the case be first answer by the learn counsel who remark that the character and composition of the court as well as the provision for the trial of capital offence by a jury of six man instead of twelve be in harmony with the dominion law enact for the government of the territory and that the dominion parliament have the right under the british north america act to make that law the absence of the grand jury be explain on the ground that such jury be essentially county organization and be impossible in large district with small and scattered population the same reason explain the limit of the jury to half the usual number it be also state that the crown deem it unwise if indeed it be not impossible to issue a special commission for the trial of the prisoner mr osler proceeding say that riel not only aid and abet the illegal act of the rebel but direct these act the testimony he claim say a writer in _ the illustrated war news _ be abundantly sufficient to bring home to the prisoner he guilt in the charge against he he -lrb- mr osler -rrb- read the document in riel 's handwriting to crozier in which riel threaten a war of extermination against the whites and trace the prisoner 's conduct afterwards to show that he have try to carry out that threat it be no constructive treason that be seek to be prove but treason involve the shed of brave man 's blood the accuse have be lead on not by the desire to aid he friend in a lawful agitation for redress of a grievance but by he inordinate vanity and desire for power and wealth the first overt act of treason be commit continued mr osler when the french half-breed be request by riel to bring they arm with they to a meeting to be hold at batoche on march 3rd this indicate that the prisoner intend to resort to violence on the 18th instant they find he -lrb- riel -rrb- send out armed man and take prisoner include mr lash the indian agent of the st lament region and other also looting the store at and near batoche stop freighter and appropriate they freight a few day later the french half-breed be under arm and be join by the indian of the neighborhood who be incite to rise by the prisoner on the 21st inst major crozier do all he could to get the armed man to disperse but direct by riel they refuse to do so and take they order from he they continue in rebellion he hold a document in he hand in the prisoner 's handwriting add mr osler which contain the term on which fort carlton would be spare attack by the surrender and march out of major crozier and the mount police this document be never deliver but be find with other papers in the rebel council chamber after the taking of batoche it be say in this notification to crozier that the rebel would attack the police if they do not vacate carlton and would commence a war of extermination of the white race this document be direct evidence of the treasonable intention of the prisoner ten day previously riel declare himself determine to rule or perish and the declaration be follow by this demand it would be say that at last when a clash of arm be imminent riel object to forcible measure but this document be a refutation of that assertion at duck lake the prisoner have take upon himself the responsibility of order he man to fire on the police at fish creek if riel be not there he direct the movement and be therefore responsible on the day of the fight he go back to batoche to finish the rifle-pit in the contest at batoche the prisoner be see bear arm and give such direction as would show that he be the main mover he treatment of the prisoner he letter to middleton and other document would show riel 's leadership a letter find in poundmaker 's camp would show he deliberate intention of bring on this country the calamity of a indian war all this would be prove and it would be show that the prisoner have not come here to aid he friend in the redress of grievance but in order to use the half-breed for he own selfish end mr osler close with a reference to the death and suffering which have be cause by the ambition of one man and impressed upon the jury the grave responsibility they be charge with in bring he crime home to the prisoner

prisoner 's counsel he counsel object and urge that such a proceeding would prejudice they client 's case but riel persist and the rest of the day be waste in fruitless altercation which neither the court nor the counsel for the crown could allay the chief cause of riel 's excitement seem to be the determination of he counsel to press the plea of insanity a plea which throughout the trial riel strongly object to be urge on he behalf the court in the midst of the altercation adjourn third day of the trial -lrb- footnote : in prepare this abstract of the day 's proceedings the writer acknowledge to have draw from the report publish in the toronto _ globe _ and _ mail _ and the montreal _ gazette _ and _ star _ -rrb- the riel trial be resume at regina on the morning of July 30th by mr green shield ' address the jury for the defense the court-room be again fill to its utmost capacity after refer to the difficulty counsel have meet in the prisoner 's endeavor to obstruct they conduct of the case mr greenshield dwell upon the history of the indian and half-breed in the north-west territory point out they rights to the soil in this court they have a different procedure from that in other part of the dominion and while not desire to be understand that the prisoner would not receive as fair a trial as the machinery provide make possible he question whether a jury of six man nominate by the preside magistrate be sufficient to satisfy the demand of magna charta -- the great bulwark of the rights and liberty of all british subject he believe any of the older province would rebel against such a encroachment on they rights and he do not see why such a condition of thing should obtain here for year the half-breed have be make futile effort to obtain they rights all these effort have be meet by rebuff or have receive no attention whatever from the federal government and those very rights for which the half-breed be supplicate and petition be be hand over to railway corporation colonization company and like concern he would not say that the action of the government justified armed rebellion -- the shed of blood -- but it leave in these poor people those smoulder fire of discontent that be so easily fan into rebellion by a madman such as riel the prisoner have be invite by the half-breed to come among they from a foreign country to assist they in make a proper representation of they grievance to the government they be unlettered and require a active sympathizer with education sufficient to properly conduct the agitation riel be the man they choose and there be no evidence to show that when riel come to this country he come with any intention of incite the people to armed rebellion he work be begin and carry on up till January in a perfectly constitutional manner after that time as the jury have see in the cross-examination of the witness for the prosecution no effort be make by the defense to deny that overt act of treason have be commit in the presence of the prisoner but evidence would be bring to show that at the time these act be countenance by the prisoner he be of unsound mind and not responsible for what he do the peculiar disease of the prisoner be call by man learn in disease of the mind megalomania this species of mental disease develop two delusion -- one the desire for and belief that the patient could obtain great power in political matter to rule or govern another he desire to find a great church that the prisoner be possess of these delusion the evidence abundantly prove the jury might consider with some grounds for the belief that the evidence of charle nolin who swear that the prisoner be willing to leave the country if he obtain from the government a gratuity of $ 35000 be inconsistent with the real existence of such a monomania as the prisoner be afflict with but not one isolate portion but the whole of nolin 's evidence should be consider other portion of he testimony for instance prisoner 's opinion on religious matter and he intention to divide up the country between various foreign nationality be conclusive proof of the prisoner 's insanity this be a great state trial the speaker say and he warn the jury to throw aside the influence of heated public opinion as it be express at present there be many people execute for have take part in the rebellion of 1837 and it be questionable if there could be find anyone now who would justify those execution the beat of private feeling have die away and the jury should be careful that no hasty conclusion in this case should leave posterity a chance to say that they verdict have be a wrong one they should if possible look at the case with the calmness of the historian throw aside all preconceived notion of the case that interfere with the evidence give in the court and build up they verdict on the testimony bring out here in the course of he remark mr greenshield say that he accuse no government in particular for neglect the claim of the breed but if the authority have pay attention to the petition which have be address to they the rebellion would never have occur he pay a glowing tribute to the volunteer who leave they private occupation and come from all part of the dominion to suppress the outbreak at the conclusion of mr greenshield 's address father andre superior of the oblat father in the district of carlton be call for the defense he say he have be intimately associate with the breed for a quarter of a century riel have be induce to come to this country by the settler to assist they the witness have a thorough knowledge of what be go on amongst the settler he have no knowledge of petition have be send to the government during the agitation but he have himself indirectly communicate with the government last December with the object of get the prisoner out of the country the pretension or claim of the breed change frequently after riel 's arrival the government have be notify three or four time of what be transpire the government have promise to take the matter into consideration the government have reply to one petition by telegram concede the old survey this be a important concession at batoche three scrip have be issue and at duck lake forty be give the witness never like talk with the prisoner on religion or politics on these subject riel 's language frighten the witness who consider he undoubtedly crazy on these subject while on all other point he be sane enough once at a meeting of priest the advisability of allow such a man to perform religious duty be discuss and it be unanimously agree that the man be insane the discussion of religious or political subject with he be like dangle a red flag in front of a bull philip garneau of batoche but at present a prisoner in regina gaol be now swear and depose as follow : -- i see riel at batoche last fall have see he several time before January during the trouble i talk with he at my house on

examine by mr lemieux in french -- i be a priest of st laurent go there in 1875 have have conversation with riel since the time of the rebellion often converse with he on political and religious subject i be present at the meeting of priest at which riel 's sanity be question i know the fact upon which the question arise before the rebellion riel be a polite and pleasant man to I when he be not contradict about political affair he be quiet but when oppose he be violent as soon as the rebellion commence he lose all control of himself and threaten to burn all the church he believe there be only one god that christ the son be not god neither be the holy ghost and in consequence the virgin mary be not the mother of god but of the son of god he change the song begin hail mary mother of god to hail mary mother of the son of god he deny the real presence of god in the host it be a man of six foot riel say he be go to quebec france and italy and would overthrow the pope and choose a pope

not know if my dignity would permit I to mention what you term my foreign policy but if i be allow to explain or question certain witness those thing would have look different my lawyer be good but they do not understand the circumstance be it understand that i appreciate they service be i to go into detail i could safely say what captain young have tell you regard my mission to bring about practical result i have writings my career be perhaps nearly run but after dissolution my spirit will still bring about practical result strike he breast he add : no one need say that the north-west be not suffer the saskatchewan be especially afflict but what have i do to bring about practical result for ten year i have be aware that i have a mission to perform now what encourage I be the fact

reputation my life my liberty be in you hand and be at you discretion i be so confident in you high sense of duty that i have no anxiety as to the verdict my calmness do not arise from the presumption that you will acquit I although you be only half a jury only a shred of that proud old british constitution i respect you i can only trust judge and gentleman that good and practical result will arise from you judgment conscientiously render i would call you attention to one or two point the first be that the house of common senate and ministry which make the law do not respect the interest of the north-west my second point be that the north-west council have the defect of its parent there be practically no election and it be a sham legislature then as if wander from he subject riel break forth and say : i be ready at batoche i fire and wound you soldier bear in mind be my crime commit in self-defence so enormous oh jesus christ help I for they be try to tear I into piece juror if you support the plea of insanity otherwise acquit I all the same console yourselve with the reflection that you will be do justice to one who have suffer for fifteen year to my family and to the north-west riel conclude as follow he language contain a strange admixture of the word apply to he by the medical expert which he ingeniously turn against the government : you honor and gentleman of the jury : -- i be take the circumstance of my trial as they be the only thing to which i would respectfully call you attention before you retire to deliberate be the irresponsibility of the government it be a fact that the government possess a absolute lack of responsibility a insanity complicate with analysis a monster of irresponsible insane government and its little north-west council have make up they mind to answer my petition by surround I and by suddenly attempt to jump at I and my people in the fertile valley of the saskatchewan you be perfectly justified in declare that have my reason and sound mind i act reasonably and in self-defence while the government my aggressor be irresponsible and consequently insane can not but have act madly and wrong and if high treason there be it must be on its side not on my part at the conclusion of riel 's lengthy address mr christopher robinson qc close the case for the crown in a powerful speech which go far to counteract the sympathetic effect produce by riel 's disconnect but eloquent oration mr robinson point out that no evidence be produce to show that the prisoner have not commit the act he be charge with from the evidence it be quite clear the prisoner be neither a patriot nor a lunatic if prisoner be not responsible for the rebellion who be the speaker go over the evidence and show that riel 's act be not those of a lunatic but well consider in all they bearing and the deliberate act of a particularly sound mind the evidence as to riel 's confinement in a asylum nine year ago be not satisfactory why be he send there under a assumed name why be the record of he case not produce along with the other papers and a statement of he condition when leave the asylum medical man be not always the best judge of insanity take up the evidence against the prisoner mr robinson go over it in detail and say no mercy should be show one who have commit such act he picture the terrible result if riel have succeed in he effort to rouse the indian the reason the prisoner poundmaker and big bear have not be put in the witness box be that they could not be ask to give evidence that would incriminate themselves mr justice richardson then read over the evidence to the jury after which the court adjourn third day 's proceedings -lrb- footnote : this abstract of the final day 's proceedings we take from the

be the prisoner guilty or not guilty everyone but the prisoner seem anxious he alone of all those present eager to hear the message of fate be calm the foreman reply : guilty with a recommendation to mercy riel smile as if the sentence in no way affect he and bow gracefully to the jury the prisoner 's speech col richardson ask the prisoner if he have anything to say why the sentence of the court should not be pass upon he riel reply : yes you honor then he begin in a low calm voice to detail the story of the half-breed in manitoba and speak at length of the rebellion of '69 he say that if he have to die for what have take place it would be a consolation to he wife and to he friend to know that he have not die in vain in year to come people will look at manitoba and say that riel help the dweller of those fertile plain to obtain the benefit they now enjoy he say it would be a easy thing for he to make a incendiary speech but he would refrain he say that god have give he a mission to perform and if suffering be part of that mission he bow respectfully to the divine will and he be ready to accept the task even if the end should be death like david he have suffer but he lack two year of the time that david suffer the prisoner then go into the history of the red river rebellion at great length he claim that he have rule the country for two month for the government and he only

precedent and he trust that the same result would follow he then speak at great length of the part play by sir john macdonald sir george cartier and bishop tache in the red river rebellion the money that have be give to he and to lepine on leave the country have be accept he say as part of what be justly they due the whites be gradually crowd out the indian and the meti and what be more natural and just than for they to take up arm in defense of they rights he justify he claim to $ 35000 by say that it be offer to he to keep out of the country for three year the english constitution he say have be perfect for the happiness of the world and he wish to have the representative of the different nation here be to give people from the country of the old world a opportunity of enjoy the blessing god have give england god have give england great glory but she must work for that glory or it would surely pass away the roman empire be four hundred year in decline from its proud pre-eminence and england would be in the same position but before england fade away a grander england would be build up in this immense country he heart while it beat would not abandon the idea of have a new ireland a new germany a new france here and the people of those country would enjoy liberty under the british constitution which they do not obtain at home if he must die for he principle if the brave man who be with he must die he hope the french-canadian would come and help the people to get back what be be unjustly wrench from they peace have always be uppermost in he thought and it be to save the country from be deluge with blood later on that they strive for they rights now he conclude by object to the jury and the decision of the court and ask that he be not try for the alleged offence of this season but that he whole career be put on trial and the jury ask to give a decision as to whether he life and act have in any way benefit the country or not the sentence mr christopher robinson move for the sentence of the court judge richardson then say : loui riel you be charge with treason you let loose the flood gate of rapine and bloodshed and bring ruin and death
