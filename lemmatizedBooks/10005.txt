march 1828 -rrb- appeal to the public have by a train of fortunate circumstance accomplish a voyage of which the history of mankind afford no example have moreover exert every faculty of body and mind to make my adventure useful to my countryman and even to mankind by impart to they the acquisition of secret in physics and moral of which they have not form the faintest conception -- i flattered myself that both in the character of traveller and public benefactor i have earn for myself a immortal name but how these fond these justifiable hope have be answer the follow narrative will show on my return to this my native state as soon as it be noised abroad that i have meet with extraordinary adventure and make a most wonderful voyage crowd of people press eagerly to see I i at first meet they inquiry with a cautious silence which however but sharpen they curiosity at length i be visit by a near relation with whom i feel less disposed to reserve with friendly solicitude he inquire how much i have make by my voyage and when he be inform that although i have add to my knowledge i have not improve my fortune he stare at I a while and remark that he have business at the bank as well as a appointment on ` change suddenly take he leave after this i be not much interrupt by the tribe of inquisitive idler but be visit principally by a few man of science who wish to learn what i could add to they knowledge of nature to this class i be more communicative and when i severally inform they that i have actually be to the moon some of they shrug they shoulder other laugh in my face and some be angry at my suppose attempt to deceive they but all with a single exception be incredulous it be to no purpose that i appeal to my former character for veracity i be answer that travel have change my moral as it have change other people 's i ask what motive i could have for attempt to deceive they they reply the love of distinction -- the vanity of be think to have see what have be see by no other mortal and they triumphantly ask I in turn what motive raleigh and riley and hunter and a hundred other traveller have for they misrepresentation find argument thus unavailing i produce visible and tangible proof of the truth of my narrative i show they a specimen of moonstone they assert that it be of the same character as those meteoric stone which have be find in every part of the world and that i have merely procure a piece of one of these for the purpose of deception i then exhibit some of what i consider my most curious lunar plant : but this make the matter worse for it so happen that similar one be then cultivate in mr prince 's garden at flushing i next produce some rare insect and feather of singular bird : but person be find who have either see or read or hear of similar insect and bird in hoo-choo or paraguay or prince of wale 's island in short have make up they mind that what i say be not true they have a answer ready for all that i could urge in support of my character and those who judge most christianly defend my veracity at the expense of my understanding and ascribe my conduct to partial insanity there be indeed a short suspension to this cruel distrust a old friend come to see I one day and admire a beautiful crystal which i have bring from the moon insist on show it to a jeweller who say that it be a unusually hard stone and that if it be a diamond it would be worth upward of 150000 dollar i know not whether the mistake that ensue proceed from my friend who be something of a wag or from one of the lad in the jeweller 's shop who hear a part of what he master have say misapprehend the rest but so it be that the next day i have more visiter than ever and among they my kinsman who be kind enough to stay with I as if he enjoy my good fortune until both the exchange and the bank be close on the same day the follow paragraph appear in one of the morning print : we understand that we enterprising and intelligent traveller joseph atterley esquire have bring from he lunar expedition a diamond of extraordinary size and lustre several of the most experienced jeweller of this city have estimate it at from 250000 to 300000 dollar and some have go so far as to say it would be cheap at half a million we have the authority of a near relative of that gentleman for assert that the satisfactory testimonial which he possess of the correctness of he narrative be sufficient to satisfy the most incredulous and to silence malignity itself but this gleam of sunshine soon pass away two day afterwards another paragraph appear in the same paper in these word : we be credibly inform that the suppose diamond of the _ famous _ traveller to the moon turn out to be one of those which be find on diamond island in lake george we have hear that mr a -- y mean to favor the public with a account of he travels under the title of ` lunarian adventure ' but we would take the liberty of recommend that for _ lunarian _ he substitute _ lunatic _ thus disappoint in my expectation and assail in my character what could i do but appeal to a impartial public by give they a circumstantial detail of what be most memorable in my adventure that they might judge from intrinsic evidence whether i be deficient either in soundness of understanding or of moral principle but let I first bespeak they candor and a salutary diffidence of themselves by one or two well-authenticated anecdote during the reign of loui the xivth the king of siam have receive a ambassador from that monarch be accustom to hear with wonder and delight the foreigner 's description of he own country : but the minister have one day mention that in france water at one time of the year become a solid substance the siamese prince indignantly exclaim -- hold sir i have listen to the strange thing you have tell I and have hitherto believe they all but now when you wish to persuade I that water which i know as well as you can become hard i see that you purpose be to deceive I and i do not believe a word you have utter but as the present patriotic preference for home-bred manufacture may extend to anecdote as well as to other production a story of domestic origin may have more weight with most of my reader than one introduce from abroad the chief of a party of indian who have visit washington during mr jefferson 's presidency have on he return home assemble he tribe give they a detail of he adventure and dwelling particularly upon the courteous treatment the party have receive from they great father state among other thing that he have give they ice though it be then mid-summer he countryman not have the vivacity of we lady listen in silence till he have end when a aged chief step forth and remark that he too when a young man have visit they great father washington in new-york who have receive he as a son and treat he with all the delicacy that he country afford but have give he no ice now add the orator if any man in the world could have make ice in the summer it be washington and if he could have make it i be sure he would have give it to I tustanaggee be therefore a liar and not to be believe in both these case though the argument seem fair the conclusion be false for have either the king or the chief take the trouble to satisfy himself of the fact he might have find that he limited experience have deceive he it be unquestionably true that if traveller sometimes impose on the credulity of mankind they be often also not believe when they speak the truth credulity and scepticism be indeed but different name for the same hasty judgment on insufficient evidence : and as the old woman readily assent that there might be mountain of sugar and river of rum because she have see they both but that there be fish which could fly she never would believe so thousand give credit to redheiffer 's patented discovery of perpetual motion because they have behold he machine and question the existence of the sea-serpent because they have not see it i would respectfully remind that class of my reader who like the king the indian or the old woman refuse to credit any thing which contradict the narrow limit of they own observation that there be more secret in nature than be dream of in they philosophy and that upon they own principle before they have a right to condemn I they should go or send to the mountain of ava for some of the metal with which i make my venturous experiment and make one for themselves as to those who do not call in question my veracity but only doubt my sanity i fearlessly appeal from they unkind judgment to the sober and unprejudiced part of mankind whether what i have state in the follow page be not consonant with truth and nature and whether they do not there see faithfully reflect from the moon the error of the learn on earth and the folly of the wise joseph atterley _ long-island September _ 1827 voyage to the moon chapter i _ atterley 's birth and education -- he make a voyage -- founder off the burman coast -- adventure in that empire -- meet with a learn brahmin from benare _ be about to give a narrative of my singular adventure to the world which i foresee will be greatly divide about they authenticity i will premise something of my early history that those to whom i be not personally know may be better able to ascertain what credit be due to the fact which rest only on my own assertion i be bear in the village of huntingdon on long-island on the 11th day of may 1786 joseph atterley my father formerly of east jersey as it be once call have settle in this place about a year before in consequence of have marry my mother alice schermerhorn the only daughter of a snug dutch farmer in the neighborhood by means of the portion he receive with my mother together with he own earnings he be enable to quit the life of a sailor to which he have be breed and to enter into trade after the death of he father-in-law by whose will he receive a handsome accession to he property he seek in the city of new-york a theater better suit to he enlarged capital he here engage in foreign trade and partaking of the prosperity which then attend american commerce he gradually extend he business and finally embark in we new branch of traffic to the east indy and china he be now very generally respect both for he wealth and fair dealing be several year a director in one of the insurance office be president of the society for relieve the widow and orphan of distressed seaman and it be say might have be choose alderman if he have not refuse on the ground that he do not think himself qualify my father be not one of those who set little value on book learning from they own consciousness of not possess it : on the contrary he would often remark that as he feel the want of a liberal education himself he be determine to bestow one on I i be accordingly at a early age put to a grammar school of good repute in my native village the master of which i believe be now a member of congress and at the age of seventeen be send to princeton to prepare myself for some profession during my third year at that place in one of my excursion to philadelphium and for which i be always invent pretext i become acquaint with one of those face and form which in a youth of twenty to see admire and love be one and the same thing my attention be favourably receive i soon become desperately in love and in spite of the advice of my father and entreaty of my mother who have form other scheme for I nearer home i be marry on the anniversary of my twenty-first year it be not until the first trance of bliss be over that i begin to think seriously on the course of life i be to pursue from the time that my mind have run on love and matrimony i have lose all relish for serious study and long before that time i have feel a sentiment border on contempt for the pursuit of my father besides he have already take my two younger brother into the counting-house with he i therefore prevail on my indulgent parent with the aid of my mother 's intercession to purchase for I a neat country-seat near huntingdon which present a beautiful view of the sound and where surround by the scene of my childhood i promise myself to realize with my susanna that life of tranquil felicity which fancy warm by love so vividly depict if we do not meet with all that we have expect it be because we have expect too much the happiest life like the purest atmosphere have its cloud as well as its sunshine and what be worse we never fully know the value of the one until we have feel the inconvenience of the other in the cultivation of my farm -- in educate we child a son and two daughter in read music painting -- and in occasional visit to we friend in new-york and philadelphium seventeen year glide swiftly and imperceptibly away at the end of which time death in deprive I of a excellent wife make a wreck of my hope and enjoyment for the purpose of seek that relief to my feeling which change of place only could afford i determine to make a sea voyage and as one of my father 's vessel be about to sail for canton i accordingly embark on board the well-known ship the _ two brother _ captain thoma and leave sandy-hook on the 5th day of June 1822 have first place my three child under the care of my brother william i will not detain the reader with a detail of the first incident of we voyage though they be sufficiently interesting at the time they occur and be not want in the usual variety we have in singular succession dead calm and fresh breeze stiff gale and sudden squall see shark flying-fish and dolphin speak several vessel : have a visit from neptune when we cross the line and be compel to propitiate he favor with some gallon of spirit which he seem always to find a very agreeable change from sea water and touch at table bay and at madagascar on the whole we voyage be comparatively pleasant and prosperous until the 24th of October when off the mouth of the gange after a fine clear autumnal day just about sunset a small dark speck be see in the eastern horizon by we experienced and watchful captain who after notice it for a few moment pronounce that we should have a hurricane the rapidity with which this speck grow into a dense cloud and spread itself in darkness over the heaven as well as the increase swell of the ocean before we feel the wind soon convinced we he be right no time be lose in lower we topmast take double reef and make every thing snug to meet the fury of the tempest i think i have already witness all that be terrific on the ocean but what i have formerly see have be mere child 's play compare with this never can i forget the impression that be make upon I by the wild uproar of the element the smooth long swell of the wave gradually change into a agitate frothy surface which constant flash of lightning present to we in all its horror and in the mean time the wind whistle through the rigging and the ship creak as if she be every minute go to piece about midnight the storm be at its height and i give up all for lose the wind which first blow from the south-west be then due south and the sailor say it begin to abate a little before day : but i see no great difference until about three in the afternoon soon after which the cloud break away and show we the sun setting in cloudless majesty while the billow still continue they stupendous rolling but with a heavy movement as if after such mighty effort they be seek repose in the bosom of they parent ocean it soon become almost calm a light western breeze barely swell we sail and gently waft we to the land which we could faintly discern to the north-east we ship have be so shake in the tempest and be so leaky that captain thoma think it prudent to make for the first port we could reach at dawn we find ourselves in full view of a coast which though not personally know to the captain he pronounce by he chart to be a part of the burmese empire and in the neighborhood of merguus on the martaban coast the leak have now increase to a alarming extent so that we find it would be impossible to carry the ship safe into port we therefore hastily throw we clothes papers and eight cask of silver into the long-boat and before we be fifty yard from the ship we see she go down some of the underwriter in new york as i have since learn have the conscience to contend that we leave the ship sooner than be necessary and have suffer themselves to be sue for the sum they have severally insure it be a little after midday when we reach the town which be perch on a high bluff overlook the coast and contain about a thousand house build of bamboo and cover with palm leave we dress appearance language and the manner of we arrival excited great surprise among the native and the liveliest curiosity but with these sentiment some evidently mingled no very friendly feeling the burmese be then on the eve of a rupture with the east indium company a fact which we have not before know and mistake we for english they suppose or affect to suppose that we belong to a fleet which be about to invade they and that we ship have be sink before they eye by the tutelar divinity of the country we be immediately carry before they governor or chief magistrate who order we baggage to be search and find that it consist principally of silver he have no doubt of we hostile intention he therefore send all of we twenty-two in number to prison separate however each one from the rest my companion be release the follow spring as i have since learn by the invade army of great britain but it be my ill fortune -lrb- if indeed after what have since happen i can so regard it -rrb- to be take for a officer of high rank and to be send the third day afterwards far into the interior that i might be more safely keep and either use as a hostage or offer for ransom as circumstance should render advantageous the reader be no doubt aware that the burman empire lie beyond the gange between the british possession and the kingdom of siam and that the native nearly assimilate with those of hindostan in language manners religion and character except that they be more hardy and warlike i be transport very rapidly in a palanquin -lrb- a sort of decorate litter -rrb- carry on the shoulder of four man who for greater despatch be change every three hour in this way i travel thirteen day in which time we reach a little village in the mountainous district between the irawaddus and saloon river where i be place under the care of a inferior magistrate call a mirvoon who there exercise the chief authority this place name mozaun be romantically situate in a fertile valley that seem to be completely shut in by the mountain a small river a branch of the saloon enter it from the west and after run about four mile in nearly a straight direction turn suddenly round a steep hill to the south and be entirely lose to view the village be near a gap in the mountain through which the river seem to have force its way and consist of about forty or fifty hut build of the bamboo cane and reed the house of my landlord be somewhat larger and better than the rest it stand on a little knoll that overlook the village the valley the stream that run through it and command a distant view of the country beyond the gap it be certainly a lovely little spot as it now appear to my imagination but when the landscape be new to I i be in no humor to relish its beauty and when my mind be more in a state to appreciate they they have lose they novelty my keeper whose name be sing fou and who from a long exercise of magisterial authority be rough and dictatorial behave to I somewhat harshly at first but my patient submission so win he confidence and good will that i soon become a great favorite be regard more as one of he family than as a prisoner and be allow by he every indulgence consistent with my safe custody but the difficulty in the way of my escape be so great that little restraint be impose on my motion the narrow defile in the gap through which the river rush like a torrent be close with a gate the mountain by which the valley be hem in be utterly impassable thickly set as they be with jungle consist of tangled brier thorn and forest tree of which those who have never be in a tropical climate can form no adequate idea in some place it would be difficult to penetrate more than a mile in the day during which time the traveller would be perpetually torment by noxious insect and in constant dread of beast of prey the only outlet from this village be by pass down the valley along the settlement and follow the course of the stream so that there be no other injunction lay on I than not to extend my ramble far in that direction sing fou 's household consist of he wife whom i rarely see four small child and six servant and here i enjoy nearly as great a portion of happiness as in any part of my life it have be one of my favorite amusement to ramble towards a part of the western ridge which rise in a cone about a mile and a half from the village and there ascend to some comparatively level spot or point project from its side enjoy the beautiful scenery which lay before I and the evening breeze which have such a delicious freshness in a tropical climate nor be this all in a deep sequestered nook form by two spur of this mountain there live a venerable hindoo whom the people of the village call the holy hermit the favourable account i receive of he character as well as he odd course of life make I very desirous of become acquaint with he and as he be often visit by the villager i find no difficulty in get a conductor to he cell he character for sanctity together with a venerable beard might have discourage advance towards a acquaintance if he lively piercing eye a countenance expressive of great mildness and kindness of disposition and he courteous manners have not yet more strongly invite it he be indeed not averse to society though he have seem thus to fly from it and be so great a favorite with he neighbor that he cell would have be throng with visitor but for the difficulty of the approach to it as it be it be seldom resort to except for the purpose of obtain he opinion and counsel on all the serious concern of he neighbor he prescribe for the sick and often provide the medicine they require -- expound the law -- adjusted dispute -- make all they little arithmetical calculation -- give they moral instruction -- and when he could not afford they relief in they difficulty he teach they patience and give they consolation he in short unite for the simple people by whom he be surround the function of lawyer physician schoolmaster and divine and richly merit the reverential respect in which they hold he as well as they little present of egg fruit and garden stuff from the first evening that i join the party which i see clamber up the path that lead to the hermit 's cell i find myself strongly attach to this venerable man and the more so from the mystery which hang around he history it be agree that he be not a burmese none deem to know certainly where he be bear or why he come thither he own account be that he have devote himself to the service of god and in he pilgrimage over the east have select this as a spot particularly favourable to the life of quiet and seclusion he wish to lead there be one part of he story to which i could scarcely give credit it be say that in the twelve or fifteen year he have reside in this place he have be occasionally invisible for month together and no one could tell why he disappear or whither he have go at these time he cell be close and although none venture to force they way into it those who be the most prying could hear no sound indicate that he be within various be the conjecture form on the subject some suppose that he withdraw from the sight of man for the purpose of more fervent prayer and more holy meditation other that he visit he home or some other distant country the more superstitious believe that he have by a kind of metempsychosis take a new shape which by some magical or supernatural power he could assume and put off at pleasure this opinion be perhaps the most prevalent as it gain a color with these simple people from the chemical and astronomical instrument he possess in these he evidently take great pleasure and by they means he acquire some of the knowledge by which he so often excite they admiration he soon distinguish I from the rest of he visitor by address question to I relative to my history and adventure and i in turn be gratify to have meet with one who take a interest in my concern and who alone of all i have here meet with could either enter into my feeling or comprehend my opinion we conversation be carry on in english which he speak with facility and correctness we soon find ourselves so much to each other 's taste that there be seldom a evening that i do not make he a visit and pass a hour or two in he company i learn from he that he be bear and breed at benare in hindostan that he have be intend for the priesthood and have be well instruct in the literature of the east that a course of untoward circumstance upon which he seem unwilling to dwell have change he destination and make he a wanderer on the face of the earth that in the neighbouring kingdom of siam he have form a intimacy with a learn french jesuit who have not only teach he he language but impart to he a knowledge of much of the science of europe its institution and manners that after the death of this friend he have renew he wanderings and have be detain in this village by a fit of sickness for some week he be warn that it be time to quit he rambling life this place be recommend to he both by its quiet seclusion and the unsophisticated manners of its inhabitant he determine to pass the remnant of he day here and by devote they to the purpose of piety charity and science to discharge he duty to he creator he species and himself for the love of knowledge he add have long be my chief source of selfish enjoyment we taste and sentiment accord in so many point that we acquaintance ripen by degree into the closest friendship we be both stranger -- both unfortunate and be the only individual here who have any knowledge of letter or of distant part of the world these be indeed the main spring of that sympathy without which there be no love among man it be be overwise to treat with contempt what mankind hold in respect : and philosophy teach we not to extinguish we feeling but to correct and refine they my visit to the hermitage be frequently renew at first because they afford I the relief of variety whilst he intimate knowledge of man and thing -- he remarkable sagacity and good sense -- he air of mingled piety and benignity -- cheat I into forgetfulness of my situation as these gradually yield to the lenitive power of time i seek he conversation for the positive pleasure it afford and at last it become the chief source of my happiness day after day and month after month glide on in this gentle unvarying current for more than three year during which period he have occasionally throw out dark hint that the time would come when i should be restore to liberty and that he have a important secret which he would one day communicate i should have be more tantalize with the expectation that these remark be calculate to raise have i not suspect they to be a good-natured artifice to save I from despondency as they be never make except when he see I look serious and thoughtful chapter ii _ the brahmin 's illness -- he reveal a important secret to atterley -- curious information concern the moon -- the glonglim -- they plan a voyage to the moon _ about this period one afternoon in the month of march when i repair to the hermitage as usual i find my venerable friend stretch on he humble pallet breathing very quickly and seemingly in great pain he be labor under a pleurisy which be not unfrequent in the mountainous region at this season he tell I that he disease have not yield to the ordinary remedy which he have try when he first feel its approach and that he consider himself to be dangerously ill i be however he add prepare to die sit down on that block and listen to what i shall say to you though i shall quit this state of be for another and a better i confess that i be alarm at the thought of expire before i have a opportunity of see and converse with you i be the depository of a secret that i believe be know to no other live mortal i once determine that it should die with I and have i not meet with you it certainly should but from we first acquaintance my heart have be strongly attract towards you and as soon as i find you possess of quality to inspire esteem as well as regard i feel disposed to give you this proof of my confidence still i hesitate i first wish to deliberate on the probable effect of my disclosure upon the condition of society i see that it might produce evil as well as good but on weigh the two together i have satisfy myself that the good will preponderate and have determine to act accordingly take this key -lrb- stretch out he feverish hand -rrb- and after wait two hour in which time the medicine i have take will have either produce a good effect or put a end to my suffering you may then open that blue chest in the corner it have a false bottom on remove the paper which cover it you will find the manuscript contain the important secret together with some gold piece which i have save for the day of need -- because -- -lrb- and he smile in spite of he suffering -rrb- -- because hoarding be one of the pleasure of old man take they both and use they discreetly when i be go i request you my friend to discharge the last sad duty of humanity and to see I bury accord to the usage of my caste the simple being around I will then behold that i be mortal like themselves and let this precious relic of female loveliness and worth -lrb- take a small picture set in gold from he bosom -rrb- be bury with I it have be warm by my heart 's blood for twenty-five year : let it be still near that heart when it cease to beat i have yet more to say to you but my strength be too much exhaust the good old man here close he eye with a expression of patient resignation and rather as if he court sleep than feel inclined to it : and after shut the door of he cell i repair to he little garden to pass the allotted two hour leave to my meditation when i think that i be probably about to be deprive for ever of the hermit 's conversation and society i feel the wretchedness of my situation recur with all its former force i sit down on a smooth rock under a tamarind tree the scene of many a interesting conference between the brahmin and myself and i cast my eye around -- but how change be every thing before I i no longer regard the sparkling eddy of the little cascade which fall down a steep rock at the upper end of the garden and form a pellucid basin below the gay flower and rich foliage of this genial climate -- the bright plumage and cheerful note of the bird -- be all there but my mind be not in a state to relish they i arise and in extreme agitation ramble over this little eden in which i have pass so many delightful hour before the allotted time have elapse -- shall i confess it -- my fear for the hermit be overcome by those that be purely selfish it occur to I if he should thus suddenly die and i be find alone in he cell i might be charge with be he murderer and my courage which from long inaction have sadly decline of late desert I at the think after the most torturing suspense the dial at length show I that the two hour have elapse and i hasten to the cell i pause a moment at the door afraid to enter or even look in make one or two step and hear no sound conclude that all be over with the hermit and that my own doom be seal my delight be inexpressible therefore when i perceive that he still breathe and when on draw nearer i find that he sleep soundly in a moment i pass from misery to bliss i seat myself by he side and there remain for more than a hour enjoy the transition of my feeling at length he awake and cast on I a look of placid benignity say -- atterley my time be not yet come though resign to death i be content to live the worst be over i be already almost restore to health i then administer to he some refreshment and after a while leave he to repose on again repair to the garden every object assume its wonted appearance the fragrance of the orange and the jasmine be no longer lose to I the hum bird which swarm round the flowering cytisus and the beautiful water-fall once more delighted the eye and the ear i take my usual bath as the sun be sink below the mountain and find the hermit still soundly sleep i throw myself on a seat under the shelter of some bamboo fall asleep and do not awake until late the next morning when i arise i find the good brahmin up and though much weaken by he disease able to walk about he tell I that the mirvoon uneasy at my not return as usual in the evening have send in search of I and that the servant finding I safe be content to return without I he advise I however not to repeat the same cause of alarm sing fou on hearing my explanation readily forgive I for the uneasiness i have cause he after a few day the brahmin recover he ordinary health and strength and have attend he at a earlier hour than usual accord to he request on the previous evening he thus address I : -- i have already tell you my dear atterley that i be bear and educate at benare and that science be there more thoroughly understand and teach than the people of the west be aware of we have for many thousand of year be good astronomer chymist mathematician and philosopher we have discover the secret of gunpowder the magnetic attraction the property of electricity long before they be hear of in europe we know more than we have reveal and much of we knowledge be deposit in the archive of the caste to which i belong but for want of a language generally understand and easily learn -lrb- for these record be always write in the sanscrit that be no longer a speak language -rrb- and the diffusion which be give by the art of print these secret of science be communicate only to a few and sometimes even sleep with they author until a subsequent discovery under more favourable circumstance bring they again to light it be at this seat of science that i learn from one of we sage the physical truth which i be now about to communicate and which he discover partly by he research into the writings of ancient pundit and partly by he own extraordinary sagacity there be a principle of repulsion as well as gravitation in the earth it cause fire to rise upward it be exhibit in electricity it occasion water-spouts volcano and earthquake after much labor and research this principle have be find embody in a metallic substance which be meet with in the mountain in which we be unite with a very heavy earth and this circumstance have great influence in induce I to settle myself here this metal when separate and purify have as great a tendency to fly off from the earth as a piece of gold or lead have to approach it after make a number of curious experiment with it we bethink ourselves of put it to some use and soon contrived with the aid of it to make car and ascend into the air we be very secret in these operation for we unhappy country have then recently fall under the subjection of the british nation we apprehend that if we divulge we arcanum they would not only fly away with all we treasure whether find in palace or pagoda but also carry off the inhabitant to make they slave in they colony as they government have not then abolish the african slave trade after various trial and many successive improvement in which we desire increase with we success we determine to penetrate the aerial void as far as we could provide for that purpose a apparatus with which you will become better acquaint hereafter in the course of we experiment we discover that this same metal which be repel from the earth be in the same degree attract towards the moon for in one of we excursion still aim to ascend higher than we have ever do before we be actually carry to that satellite and if we have not there fall into a lake and we machine have not be water-tight we must have be dash to piece or drown you will find in this book he add present I with a small volume bind in green parchment and fasten with silver clasp a minute detail of the apparatus to be provide and the direction to be pursue in make this wonderful voyage i have write it since i satisfied my mind that my fear of british rapacity be unfounded and that i should do more good than harm by publish the secret but still i be not sure he add with one of he faint but significant smile that i be not actuate by a wish to immortalize my name for where be the mortal who would be indifferent to this object if he think he could attain it read the book at you leisure and study it i listen to this recital with astonishment and doubt at first whether the brahmin 's late severe attack have not have the effect of unsettling he brain : but on look in he face the calm self-possession and intelligence which it exhibit dispel the momentary impression i be all impatience to know the adventure he meet with in the moon ask he fifty question in a breath but be most anxious to learn if it have inhabitant and what sort of being they be yes say he the moon have inhabitant pretty much the same as the earth of which they believe they globe to have be formerly a part but suspend you question and let I give you a recital of the most remarkable thing i see there i check my impatience and listen with all my ear to the wonder he relate he go on to inform I that the inhabitant of the moon resemble those of the earth in form stature feature and manners and be evidently of the same species as they do not differ more than do the hottentot from the parisian that they have similar passion propensity and pursuit but differ greatly in manners and habit they have more activity but less strength : they be feebler in mind as well as body but the most curious part of he information be that a large number of they be bear without any intellectual vigor and wander about as so many automaton under the care of the government until they be illuminate with the mental ray from some earthly brain by means of the mysterious influence which the moon be know to exercise on we planet but in this case the inhabitant of the earth lose what the inhabitant of the moon gain -- the ordinary portion of understand allot to one mortal be thus divide between two and as might be expect see that the two mind be originally the same there be a most exact conformity between the man of the earth and he counterpart in the moon in all they principle of action and mode of think these glonglim as they be call after they have be thus imbue with intellect be hold in peculiar respect by the vulgar and be think to be in every way superior to those whose understanding be entire the law by which two object so far apart operate on each other have be as yet but imperfectly develop and the wilder they freak the more they be the object of wonder and admiration the science of _ lunarology _ he observe be yet in its infancy but in the three voyage i have make to the moon i have acquire so many new fact and impart so many to the learn man of that planet that it be without doubt the subject of they active speculation at this time and will probably assume a regular form long before the new science of phrenology of which you tell I and which it must in time supersede now and then though very rarely the man of the earth regain the intellect he have lose in which case he lunar counterpart return to he former state of imbecility both party be entirely unconscious of the change -- one of what he have lose and the other of what he have gain the brahmin then add : though we party be the only voyager of which authentic history afford any testimony yet it be probable from obscure hint in some of we most ancient writings in the sanscrit that the voyage have be make in remote period of antiquity and the lunarian have a similar tradition while in the revolution which have so change the affair of mankind on we globe -lrb- and probably in its satellite -rrb- the art have be lose faint trace of its existence may be perceive in the opinion of the vulgar and in many of they ordinary form of expression thus it be generally believe throughout all asia that the moon have a influence on the brain and when a man be of insane mind we call he a lunatic one of the curse of the common people be ` may the moon eat up you brain ' and in china they say of a man who have do any act of egregious folly ` he be gather wool in the moon ' i be strike with these remark and tell the hermit that the language of europe afford the same indirect evidence of the fact he mention : that my own language especially abound with expression which could be explain on no other hypothesis -- for besides the term lunacy lunatic and the suppose influence of the moon on the brain when we see symptom of a disorder intellect we say the mind _ wander _ which evidently allude to a part of it rambling to a distant region as be the moon we say too a man be _ out of he head _ that be he mind be in another man 's head must of course be out of he own to know no more than the man in the moon be a proverbial expression for ignorance and be without mean unless it be consider to refer to the glonglim we say that a insane man be distract by which we mean that he mind be draw two different way so also we call a lunatic _ a man beside himself _ which most distinctly express the two distinct body he mind now animate there be moreover many other analogous expression as moonstruck deranged extravagant and some other which altogether form a mass of concur testimony that it be impossible to resist be that as it may say he whether the voyage have be make in former time or not be of little importance : it be sufficient for we to know that it have be effect in we time and can be effect again i be anxious to repeat the voyage for the purpose of ascertain some fact about which i have be lately speculate and i wish besides to afford you ocular demonstration of the wonder i have disclose for in spite of you good opinion of my veracity i have sometimes perceive symptom of incredulity about you and i do not wonder at it the love of the marvellous and the wish for a change which have long slumber in my bosom be now suddenly awaken and i eagerly catch at he proposal when can we set out father say i not so fast reply he we have a great deal of preparation to make we apparatus require the best workmanship and we can not here command either first-rate article or material without incur the risk of suspicion and interruption while most of the simple villager be kindly disposed towards I there be a few who regard I with distrust and malevolence and would readily avail themselves of a opportunity to bring I under the censure of the priesthood and the government besides the governor of merguus would probably be glad to lay hold of any plausible evidence against you as afford he the best chance of avoid any future reckoning either with you or he superior we must therefore be very secret in we plan i know a ingenious artificer in copper and other metal whose only child i be instrumental in cure of scrofula and in whose fidelity as well as good will i can safely rely but we must give he time he can construct we machine at home and we must take we departure from that place in the night chapter iii _ the brahmin and atterley prepare for they voyage -- description of they machine -- incident of the voyage -- the appearance of the earth africa greece -- the brahmin 's speculation on the different race of man -- national character _ have thus form we plan of operation we the next day proceed to put they in execution the coppersmith agree to undertake the work we want do for a moderate compensation but we do not think it prudent to inform he of we object which he suppose be to make some philosophical experiment it be forthwith arrange that he should occasionally visit the hermit to receive instruction as if for the purpose of ask medical advice during this interval my mind be absorb with we project and when in company i be so thoughtful and abstracted that it have since seem strange to I that sing fou 's suspicion that i be plan my escape be not more excite at length by dint of great exertion in about three month every thing be in readiness and we determine on the follow night to set out on we perilous expedition the machine in which we propose to embark be a copper vessel that would have be a exact cube of six foot if the corner and edge have not be round off it have a opening large enough to receive we body which be close by double slide pannel with quilted cloth between they when these be properly adjust the machine be perfectly air-tight and strong enough by means of iron bar run alternately inside and out to resist the pressure of the atmosphere when the machine should be exhaust of its air as we take the precaution to prove by the aid of a air-pump on the top of the copper chest and on the outside we have as much of the lunar metal -lrb- which i shall henceforth call _ lunarium _ -rrb- as we find by calculation and experiment would overcome the weight of the machine as well as its contents and take we to the moon on the third day as the air which the machine contain would not be sufficient for we respiration more than about six hour and the chief part of the space we be to pass through be a mere void we provide ourselves with a sufficient supply by condense it in a small globular vessel make partly of iron and partly of lunarium to take off its weight on my return i give mr jacob perkin who be now in england a hint of this plan of condensation and it have there obtain he great celebrity this fact i should not have think it worth while to mention have he not take the sole merit of the invention to himself at least i can not hear that in he numerous public notice he have ever mention my name but to return a small circular window make of a single piece of thick clear glass be neatly fit on each of the six side several piece of lead be securely fasten to screw which pass through the bottom of the machine as well as a thick plank the screw be so contrived that by turn they in one direction the piece of lead attach to they be immediately disengage from the hook with which they be connect the piece of lunarium be fasten in like manner to screw which pass through the top of the machine so that by turn they in one direction those metallic piece would fly into the air with the velocity of a rocket the brahmin take with he a thermometer two telescope one of which project through the top of the machine and the other through the bottom a phosphoric lamp pen ink and paper and some light refreshment sufficient to supply we for some day the moon be then in she third quarter and near the zenith : it be of course a little after midnight and when the coppersmith and he family be in they soundest sleep that we enter the machine in about a hour more we have the door secure and every thing arrange in its place when cut the cord which fasten we to the ground by means of small steel blade which work in the end of other screw we rise from the earth with a whiz sound and a sensation at first of very rapid ascent : but after a short time we be scarcely sensible of any motion in the machine except when we change we place the ardent curiosity i have feel to behold the wonderful thing which the brahmin related and the hope of return soon to my child and native country have make I most impatient for the moment of departure during which time the hazard and difficulty of the voyage be entirely overlook : but now that the moment of execution have arrive and i find myself shut up in this small chest and about to enter on a voyage so new so strange and beset with such a variety of danger i will not deny that my courage fail I and i would gladly have compromise to return to mozaun and remain there quietly all the rest of my day but shame restrain I and i dissemble my emotion at we first shock on leave the earth my fear be at they height but after about two hour i have tolerably well regain my composure to which the return light of day greatly contribute by this time we have a full view of the rise sun pour a flood of light over one half of the circular landscape below we and leave the rest in shade while those natural object the river and mountain land and sea be fast recede from we view we horizon keep gradually extend as we mount : but ere 10 o'clock this effect cease and the broad disc of the earth begin sensibly to diminish it be impossible to describe my sensation of mingled awe and admiration at the splendid spectacle beneath I so long as the different portion of the earth 's surface be plainly distinguishable the novelty of the situation in which i find myself as well as its danger prevent I indeed at first from give more than a pass attention to the magnificent scene but after a while encourage by the brahmin 's exhortation and yet more by the example of he calm and assure air i be able to take a more leisurely view of it at first as we partake of the diurnal motion of the earth and we course be consequently oblique the same portion of the globe from which we have set out continue directly under we and as the eye stretch in every direction over asia and its sea continent and island they appear like piece of green velvet the surround ocean like a mirror and the gange the hoogley and the great river of china like thread of silver about 11 o'clock it be necessary to get a fresh supply of air when my companion cautiously turn one of the two stop-cock to let out that which be no longer fit for respiration request I at the same time to turn the other to let in a fresh supply of condensed air but be awkward in the first attempt to follow he direction i be so affect by the exhaustion of the air through the vent now make for it that i faint and have at the same time give freer passage to the condensed air than i ought we must in a few seconds have lose we supply and thus have inevitably perish have not the watchful hermit see the mischief and repair it almost as soon as it occur this accident and the various agitation my mind have undergo in the course of the day so overpower I that at a early hour in the afternoon i fall into a profound sleep and do not awake again for eight hour while i sleep the good brahmin have contrived to manage both stop-cock himself the time of my waking would have be about 11 o'clock at night if we have continue on the earth but we be now in a region where there be no alternation of day and night but one unvarying cloudless sun its heat however be not in proportion to its brightness for we find that after we have ascend a few mile from the earth it be become much colder and the brahmin have recourse to a chemical process for evolve heat which soon make we comfortable : but after we be fairly in the great aerial void the temperature of we machine show no tendency to change the sensation cause by the novelty of my situation at first check those lively and vary train of thought which the bird 's - eye view of so many country pass in review before we be calculate to excite : yet after i have become more familiar with it i contemplate the beautiful exhibition with inexpressible delight besides a glass of cordial as well as the calm confide air of the brahmin contribute to restore I to my self-possession the reader will recollect that although we motion at first partook of that of the earth 's on its axis and although the _ positive _ effect be the same on we course the _ relative _ effect be less and less as we ascend and consequently that after a certain height every part of the terraqueous globe would present itself to we view in succession as we rapidly recede from it at 9 o'clock the whole of indium be a little to the west of we and we see as in a map that fertile and populous region which have be so strangely reduce to subjection by a company of merchant belong to a country on the opposite side of the globe -- a country not equal to one-fourth of it in extent or population its river be like small filament of silver the red sea resemble a narrow plate of the same metal the peninsula of indium be of a darker and arabium of a light and more grayish green the sun 's ray striking obliquely on the atlantic emit a effulgence that be dazzling to the eye for two or three hour the appearance of the earth do not greatly vary the wider extent of surface we could survey compensate for we greater distance and indeed at that time we could not see the whole horizon without put we eye close to the glass when the brahmin see that i have overcome my first surprise and have acquire somewhat of he own composure he manifest a disposition to beguile the time with conversation look through the telescope say he a little from the sun and observe the continent of africa which be present itself to we view i take a hasty glance over it and perceive that its northern edge be fringe with green then a dull white belt mark the great sahara or desert and then it exhibit a deep green again to its most southern extremity i try in vain to discover the pyramid for we telescope have not sufficient power to show they i observe to he that less be know of this continent than of the other : that a spirit of lively curiosity have be excite by the western nation of europe to become acquaint with the inhabit part of the globe but that all the effort yet make have still leave a large portion almost entirely unknown i ask if he do not think it probable that some of the nation in the interior of africa be more advance in civilization than those on the coast whose barbarous custom of make slave of they prisoner european have encourage and perpetuate by purchase they no no say he the benefit of civilization could not have be so easily confine but would have spread themselves over every part of that continent or at least as far as the great desert if they have ever exist the intense heat of a climate lie on each side of the line at once disincline man to exertion and render it unnecessary vegetable diet be more suit to they than animal which favor a denser population talent be elicit by the effort require to overcome difficulty and hardship and they natural birth-place be a country of frost and snow -- of tempest -- of sterility enough to give a spur to exertion but not enough to extinguish hope where these difficulty exist and give occasion to war and emulation the power of the human mind be most frequently develop do you think then say i that there be no such thing as natural inferiority and difference of race i have be much perplexed by that question say he when i regard the great mass of mankind i think there seem to be among they some characteristic difference i see that the european have every where obtain the ascendancy over those who inhabit the other quarter of the globe but when i compare individual i see always the same passion the same motive the same mental operation and my opinion be change the same seed become a very different plant when sow in one soil or another and put under this or that mode of cultivation and may not say i the very nature of the plant be change after a long continuance of the same culture in the same soil why that be but another mode of state the question i rather think if it have generally degenerate it may by opposite treatment be also gradually bring back to its original excellence who know then say i what we missionary and colonization society may effect in africa he inquire of I what these society be and on explain they history observe : by what you tell I it be indeed a small beginning but if they can get this grain of mustard-seed to grow there be no say how much it may multiply see what a handful of colonist have do in you own country a few ship-load of english have overspread half a continent and from what you tell I they descendant will amount in another century to more than one hundred million there be no rule he continue that can be lay down on this subject to which some nation can not be find to furnish a striking exception if mere difficulty be all that be want to call forth the intellectual energy of man they have they full share on the border of the great desert there be in that whitish tract which separate the country on the southern shore of the mediterranean from the rest of africa thousand of human being at this moment toiling over that dreary ocean of sand to whom a draught of fresh water would be a blessing and the simplest meal a luxury perhaps however you will say they be so engross with the animal want of hunger and thirst that they be incapable of attend to any thing else be it so but in the interior they be place in parallel circumstance with the native of europe : they be engage in struggle for territory and dominion -- for they altar and they home and this state of thing which have make some of they brave and warlike have make none poet or painter historian or philosopher there poetry have not wanted theme of great achievement and noble daring but hero have want poet nor can we justly ascribe the difference to the enervating influence of climate for the temperature of the most southern part of africa differ little from that of greece and the tropical nation too of you own continent the peruvian be more improve than those who inhabit the temperate region besides though the climate have instil softness and feebleness of character it might also have permit the cultivation of the art as have be the case with we in asia on the whole without we be able to pronounce with certainty on the subject it do seem probable that some organic difference exist in the various race of mankind to which they diversity of moral and intellectual character may in part be refer -- by this time the morea and the grecian archipelago be directly under we telescope do not greece say i furnish the clearest proof of the influence of moral cause on the character of nation compare what that country formerly be with what it now be once superior to all the rest of the habitable globe -lrb- of which it do not constitute the thousandth part -rrb- in letter art and arm and all that distinguish man from brute not merely in they own estimation -lrb- for all nation be dispose to rate themselves high enough -rrb- but by the general consent of the rest of the world do not the most improved and civilized of modern state still take they as they instructor and guide in every species of literature -- in philosophy history oratory poetry architecture and sculpture and those too who have attain superiority over the world in arm yield a voluntary subjection to the greek in the art the cause of they former excellence and they present inferiority be no doubt to be find in they former freedom and they present slavery and in the loss of that emulation which seem indispensable to natural greatness nay reply he i be very far from deny the influence of moral cause on national character the history of every country afford abundant evidence of it i mean only to say that though it do much it do not do every thing it seem more reasonable to impute the change in national character to the mutable habit and institution of man than to nature which be always the same but if we look a little nearer we may perhaps perceive that amidst all those mutation in the character of nation there be still some feature that be common to the same people at all time and which it would therefore be reasonable to impute to the great unvarying law of nature thus it require no extraordinary acuteness of observation no strained hypothesis to perceive a close resemblance between the german or the briton of antiquity and they modern descendant after the lapse of eighteen century and a entire revolution in government religion language and law and traveller still perceive among the inhabitant of modern greece deteriorate and debase as they be by political servitude many of those quality which distinguish they predecessor : the same natural acuteness -- the same sensibility to pleasure -- the same pliancy of mind and elasticity of body -- the same aptitude for the art of imitation -- and the same striking physiognomy that bright serene sky -- that happy combination of land and water constitute the perfection of the picturesque and that balmy softness of its air which have prove themselves so propitious to form of beauty agility and strength also operate benignantly on the mind which animate they whilst the fruit be still fair to the eye it be not probable that it have permanently degenerate in fragrance or flavor the great diversity of national character may perhaps be attribute principally to moral and accidental cause but partly also to climate and to original diversity in the different race of man chapter iv _ continuation of the voyage -- view of europe atlantic ocean america -- speculation on the future destiny of the united state -- moral reflection -- pacific ocean -- hypothesis on the origin of the moon _ by this time the whole mediterranean sea which with the arabian gulf be see to separate africa from europe and asia be full in we view the political division of these quarter of the world be of course undistinguishable and few of the natural be discernible by the naked eye the alp be mark by a white streak though less bright than the water by the aid of we glass we could just discern the danube the nile and a river which empty itself into the gulf of guinea and which i take to be the niger : but the other stream be not perceptible the most conspicuous object of the solid part of the globe be the great desert before mention the whole of africa indeed be of a lighter hue than either asia or europe owing i presume to its have a greater proportion of sandy soil : and i could not avoid contrast in my mind the color of these continent as they now appear with the complexion of they respective inhabitant i be strike too with the vast disproportion which the extent of the several country of the earth bear to the part they have act in history and the influence they have exert on human affair the british island have diminish to a speck and france be little larger yet a few year ago it seem at least to we in the united state as if there be no other nation on the earth the brahmin who be well read in european history on my make a remark on this subject remind I that athen and sparta have once obtain almost equal celebrity although they be so small as not now to be visible as i slowly pass the telescope over the face of europe i picture to myself the fat plodding hollander -- the patient contemplative german -- the ingenious sensual italian -- the temperate swiss -- the haughty superstitious spaniard -- the sprightly self-complacent frenchman -- the sullen and reflect englishman -- who monopolize nearly all the science and literature of the earth to which they bear so small a proportion as the atlantic fall under we view two faint circle on each side of the equator be to be perceive by the naked eye they be less bright than the rest of the ocean the brahmin suggest that they might be current which bring to my memory dr franklin 's conjecture on the subject now completely verify by this circular line of vapor as it have be previously render probable by the float substance which have be occasionally pick up at great distance from the place where they have be throw into the ocean the circle be whiter and more distinct where the gulf stream run parallel to the american coast and gradually grow fainter as it pass along the bank of newfoundland to the coast of europe where take a southerly direction the line of the circle be barely discernible a similar circle of vapor though less define and complete be perceive in the south atlantic ocean when the coast of my own beloved country first present itself to my view i experience the liveliest emotion and i feel so anxious to see my child and friend that i would gladly have give up all the promise pleasure of we expedition i even venture to hint my feeling to the brahmin but he gently rebuke my impatience say -- if to return home have be you only object and not to see what not one of you nation or race have ever yet see you ought to have so inform I that we might have arrange matter accordingly i do not wish you to return to you country until you will be enable to make yourself welcome and useful there by what you may see in the lunar world take courage then my friend you have pass the worst and as the proverb say do not when you have swallow the ox now choke at the tail besides although we make all possible haste in descend we should ere we reach the surface find ourselves to the west of you continent and be compel then to choose between some part of asia or the pacific ocean let we then proceed say i mortified at the imputation on my courage and influence yet more perhaps by the last argument the brahmin then try to soothe my disappointment by he remark on my native land i have a great curiosity say he to see a country where a man by he labor can earn as much in a month as will procure he bread and meat too for the whole year in a week as will pay he due to the government and in one or two day as will buy he a acre of good land : where every man preach whatever religion he please where the priest of the different sect never fight and seldom quarrel and stranger than all where the authority of government derive no aid from a army and that of the priest no support from the law i tell he when he should see these thing in operation with he own eye as i trust he would if it pleased heaven to favor we undertaking they would appear less strange i remind he of the peculiar circumstance under which we countryman have commence they career in all other country say i civilization and population have go hand in hand and the necessity of a increase subsistence for increase number have be the parent of useful art and of social improvement in every successive stage of they advancement such country have equally feel the evil occasion by a scanty and precarious subsistence in america however the people be in the full enjoyment of all the art of civilization while they be unrestricted in they means of subsistence and consequently in they power of multiplication from this singular state of thing two consequence result one be that the progress of the nation in wealth power and greatness be more rapid than the world have ever before witness another be that we people be less cramped and fetter by they necessity and feeling of course less of those moral evil which poverty and discomfort engender they character moral and intellectual will be develop and mature with greater celerity and i incline to think carry to a higher point of excellence than have ever yet be attain i anticipate for they the eloquence and art of athen -- the courage and love of country of sparta -- the constancy and military prowess of the roman -- the science and literature of england and france -- the industry of the dutch -- the temperance and obedience to the law of the swiss in fifty year they number will amount to forty million in a century to one hundred and sixty million in two century -lrb- allow for a decrease rate of multiplication -rrb- to three or four hundred million nor do it seem impossible that from the structure of they government they may continue unite for a few great national purpose while each state may make the law that be suit to its peculiar habit character and circumstance in another half century they will extend the christian religion and the english language to the pacific ocean to the south of they on the same continent other great nation will arise who if they be to be equally unite might contend in terrible conflict for the mastery of this great continent and even of the world but when they shall be completely liberate from the yoke of spanish dominion and have for some time enjoy that full possession of they faculty and energy which liberty only can give they will probably split into distinct state unite at first by the sympathy of man struggle in the same cause and by similarity of manners and religion they will after a while do as man always have do quarrel and fight and these war will check they social improvement and mar they political hope whether they will successively fall under the dominion of one able and fortunate leader or like the motley sovereignty of europe preserve they integrity by they mutual jealousy time only can show you reasoning about the native of spanish america appear very probable say the brahmin but be it not equally applicable to you own country i remind he of the peculiar advantage of we government he shake he head no atterley say he do not deceive yourself the duration of every species of polity be uncertain the work of nature alone be permanent the motion of the heavenly body be the same as they be thousand of year ago but not so with the work of man he be the identical animal that he ever be he political institution however cunningly devise have always be yet more perishable than he structure of stone and marble this be accord to all past history : and do not therefore count upon a exception in you favor that would be little short of the miraculous but he good-naturedly add such a miracle may take place in you system and although i do not expect it i sincerely wish it we be now able to see one half of the broad expanse of the pacific which glisten with the brightness of quicksilver or polish steel cast you eye to the north say he and see where you continent and mine approach so near as almost to touch both these coast be at this time thinly inhabit by a rude and miserable people whose whole time be spend in struggle against the rigor of they dreary climate and the scantiness of its production yet perhaps the indian and the kamtschadale will be gradually mould into a hardy civilized people : and here may be the scene of many a fierce conflict between you people and the russian whose number now four time as great as yours increase almost as rapidly he then amuse I with account of the manners and mode of life of the hyperborean race with whom he have once pass a summer glance my eye then to the south -- see say i while the kamtschadale be provide he supply of fur and of fish for the long winter which be already knock at the door of he hut the gay and voluptuous native of the sandwich and other island between the tropics how striking the contrast the one pass he life in ease abundance and enjoyment the other in toil privation and care no inclemency of the season inflict present suffering on these happy islander or bring apprehension for the future nature present they with she most delicious fruit spontaneously and abundantly and she have implant in they breast a lively relish for the favor she so lavishly bestow upon they the brahmin after muse a while reply : the difference be far less than you imagine perhaps on balance they respective pleasure and pain the superior gain of the islander will be reduce to nothing : for as to the simplest source of gratification that of palatable food if nature produce it more liberally in the island she also produce there more mouth to consume it the richest kamtschadale may indeed oftener go without a dinner than the richest otaheitan but it may be quite the reverse with the poorest then as to quality of the food : if nature have provide more delicious fruit for the native of tropical climate she have give a sharper appetite and stronger digestion to the hyperborean which equalize the sum of they enjoyment a dry crust be relish when a individual be hungry more than the most savoury and delicate dainty when he be in a fever and water to one man be a more delicious beverage than the juice of the grape or of the palm to another as to the necessity for labor which be ever press on the inhabitant of cold country it be this consequent and incessant activity which give health to they body and cheerful vigor to they mind since without such exercise man would have be ever a prey to disease and discontent and if no other occupation be provide for the mind of man it carve out employment for itself in vain regret and gloomy foreboding -- in jealousy envy and the indulgence of every hateful and torment passion : hence the proverb -- ` if you want corn cultivate you soil if you want weed let it alone ' but again : the native of those sunny isle be never sensible of the bounty of providence till he be deprive of it here as well as every where else desire outgo gratification man see or fancy much that he can not obtain and in he regret for what he want forget what he already possess what be it to one with a tooth-ache that a savoury dish be place before he it be the same with the mind as the body : when pain engross it in one way it can not relish pleasure in another every climate and country too have they own evil and inconvenience you think then say i that the native of kamtschatka have the advantage no he rejoin i do not mean to say that for the evil of he situation be likewise very great but they be more manifest and therefore less necessary to be bring to you notice it be now by we time-piece about two o'clock in the afternoon -- that be two hour have elapse since we leave terra firma and save a few biscuit and a glass of cordial a-piece we have not take any sort of refreshment the brahmin propose that we now should dine and open a small case and draw forth a cold fowl a piece of dry goat 's flesh a small pot of ghee some biscuit and a bottle of arrack flavor with ginger and spice with a larger one of water we eat as heartily as we have ever do at the hermitage the slight motion of we machine to one side or the other whenever we move give we nearly as much exercise as a vessel in a smooth sea the animal food have be provide for I for the brahmin satisfied he hunger with the ghee sweetmeat and biscuit and eat sparingly even of they we each take two glass of the cordial dilute with water and carefully put back the fragment again turn we thought to the planet we have leave the middle of the pacific now lay immediately beneath we i have never before be strike with the irregular distribution of land and water on we globe the expanse of ocean here be twice as large as in any other part and on remark this striking difference to the brahmin he reply : it be the opinion of some philosopher in the moon that they globe be a fragment of ours and as they can see every part of the earth 's surface they believe the pacific be the place from which the moon be eject they pretend that a short but consistent tradition of the disruption have regularly be transmit from remote antiquity and they draw confirmation of they hypothesis from many word of the chinese and other oriental with whom they claim affinity ridiculous say i the moon be one-fourth the diameter of the earth and if the two be unite in one sphere the highest mountain must have be submerge and of course there would have be no human inhabitant or if any part of the land be then bare on the water retire to fill up the chasm make by the separation of so large a body as the moon the part before habitable would be instead of two three or at most four mile as you himalah mountain be say to be some twenty or thirty mile above the level of the ocean that be not quite so certain say he : we know not of what the interior of the earth be compose any more than we could distinguish the contents of a egg by penetrate one hundredth part of its shell but we see that if one drop of water be unite with another they form one large drop as spherical as either of the two which compose it : and on the separation of the moon from the earth if they be compose of mingled solid and fluid or if the solid part rest on fluid both the fragment and the remain earth would assume the same globular appearance they now present on this subject however i give no opinion i only say that it be not contradict by the fact you have mention the fluid and the solid part settle down into a new sphere might still retain nearly they former proportion : or if the fragment take away a greater proportion of solid than of fluid then the water retire to fill up the cavity would leave part bare which they have formerly cover there be some fact which give a color to this supposition for most of the high mountain of the earth afford evidence of former submersion and those which be the highest the himalah be situate in the country to which the origin of civilization and even the human species itself may be trace the moon too we know have much less water than the earth : and all those appearance of violence which have so puzzle cosmogonist the topsy-turvy position in which vegetable substance be occasionally find beneath the soil on which they grow and the clear manifestation of the action of water in the formation of stratum in the undulating form it have leave and in the correspondent salient and retire angle of mountain and opposite coast be all cause by the disruption and as the moon have a smaller proportion of water than the earth she have also the highest mountain but father say i the diameter of the earth be but four time as large as that of the moon how can the violent separation of so large a portion of we planet be account for where be the mighty agent to rend off such a mass and throw it to thirty time the earth 's diameter upon that subject say he the lunarian sage be much divide many hypothesis have be suggest on the subject some of which be very ingenious and all very fanciful : but the two most celebrated and into which all the other be now merge be those of neerlego and darcandarca the former of whom in a treatise extend to nine quarto volume have maintain that the disruption be cause by a comet and the latter in a work yet more voluminous have endeavor to prove that when the material of the moon compose a part of the earth this planet contain large mass of water which though the particle cohere with each other be dispose to fly off from the earth and that by a accumulation of the electric fluid accord to law which he have attempt to explain the force be at length sufficient to heave the rock which encompass these mass from they bed and to project they from the earth when partaking of the earth 's diurnal motion they assume a spherical form and revolve around it and further that because the moon be compose of two sort of matter that be differently affect towards the earth in its revolution round that planet the same part of its surface always maintain some relative position to we which thus necessarily cause the singularity of she turning on she axis precisely in the time in which she revolve round the earth i see say i that doctor differ and dispute about they own fancy every where that be say he because they contend as vehemently for what they imagine as for what they see and perhaps more so as they _ perception _ be like those of other man while they _ reverie _ be more exclusively they own thus in the present instance the controversy turn upon the mode in which the separation be effect which afford the widest field for conjecture while they both agree that such separation have take place as to this fact i have not yet make up my mind though it must be confess that there be much to give plausibility to they opinion i recognize for instance a striking resemblance between the animal and vegetable production of asia and those of the moon do you think father say i that animal or even vegetable life could possibly exist in such a disruption as be suppose why not say he : you be not to imagine that the shock would be feel in proportion to the mass that be move on the contrary while it would occasion in some part a great destruction of life it would in other not be feel more than a earthquake or rather than a succession of earthquake during the time that the different part of the mass be adjust themselves to a spherical form whilst a few pair or even a single pair of animal save in some cavity of a mountain would be sufficient in a few century to stock the whole surface of the earth with as many individual as be now to be find on it after all he add it be often difficult in science to distinguish truth from the plausibility which personate she but let we not however be precipitate let we but hear both side in the east we have a say that ` he who hear with but one ear never hear well ' chapter v _ the voyage continue -- second view of asia -- the brahmin 's speculation concern indium -- increase of the moon 's attraction -- appearance of the moon -- they land on the moon _ the dryness of the precede discussion which lay out of the course of my study together with the effect of my dinner begin to make I a little drowsy whereupon the brahmin urge I to take the repose which it be clear i need remark that when i awake he would follow my example recline my head then on my cloak in a few minute my sens be steep in forgetfulness i sleep about six hour most profoundly and on wake find the good brahmin busy with he calculation of we progress i insist on he now take some rest after request I to wake he at the end of three hour -lrb- or sooner if any thing of moment should occur -rrb- and put up a short prayer which be manifest by he look rather than by he word he lay himself down and soon fall into a quiet sleep leave now to my own meditation and unsupported by the example and conversation of my friend i feel my first apprehension return and begin seriously to regret my rashness in thus venture on so bold a experiment which however often repeat with success must ever be hazardous and which could plead little more in its favor than a vain and childish curiosity i take up a book but whilst my eye run over the page i understand but little what i read and could not relish even that i now look down through the telescope and find the earth surprisingly diminish in she apparent dimension from the increase rapidity of we ascent the eastern coast of asia be still fully in view as well as the entire figure of that vast continent -- of new holland -- of ceylon and of borneo but the smaller island be invisible i strain my eye to no purpose to follow the indentation of the coast accord to the map before I the great bay and promontory could alone be perceive the burman empire in one of the insignificant village of which i have be confine for a few year be now reduce to a speck the agreeable hour i have pass with the brahmin with the little daughter of sing fou and my rambling over the neighbouring height all recur to my mind and i almost regret the pleasure i have relinquish i try with more success to beguile the time by make note in my journal and after have devote about a hour to this object i return to the telescope and now take occasion to examine the figure of the earth near the pole with a view of discover whether its form favor captain symme 's theory of a aperture exist there and i be convince that that ingenious gentleman be mistaken time pass so heavily during these solitary occupation that i look at my watch every five minute and could scarcely be persuade it be not out of order i then take up my little bible -lrb- which have always be my travel companion -rrb- read a few chapter in st matthew and find my feeling tranquillize and my courage increase the desire hour at length arrive when on wake the old man he alertly raise himself up and at the first view of the diminish appearance of the earth observe that we journey be a third over as to time but not as to distance after a few moment the brahmin again cast he eye towards he own natal soil on beholding which he fetch a deep sigh and if i be not mistaken i see a rise tear alas say he my country and my countryman how different you be in many respects from what i should wish you to be and yet i do not love you the less perhaps i love you the more for you fault as well as for you misfortune we lot continue he be a hard one that quarter of the world have send letter and art and religion abroad to adorn and benefit the other four and these the chief of human blessing and glory have desert we i tell he that i have hear the honor which he claim for indium attribute to egypt he contend with true love of country great plausibility and a intimate knowledge of oriental history that letter and the art have be first transplant from asia into egypt no other part of africa say he save egypt can boast of any ancient monument of the art or of civilization even the pyramid the great boast of egypt be proof of nothing more than ordinary patient labor direct by despotic power besides look at that vast region extend five thousand mile from the mediterranean to the cape of good hope and four thousand from the red sea to the atlantic its immense surface contain only ignorant barbarian who be as uncivilized now as they be three thousand year ago be it likely that if civilization and letter originate in egypt as be sometimes pretend it would have spread so extensively in one direction and not at all in another i make no exception in favor of the carthagenian whose origin be comparatively recent and who we know be a colony from asia i be oblige to admit the force of this reasoning and when he proceed to descant on the former glory and achievement of asiatic nation and they sad reverse of fortune -- while he freely speak of the present degradation and imbecility of he countryman he promptly resist every censure of mine it be easy indeed to see that he secretly cherish a hope that the day would come when the whole of hindostan would be emancipate from its european master and assume that rank among nation to which the genius of its inhabitant entitle it he admit that the dominion of the english be less oppressive than that of they native prince but say that there be this great difference between foreign and domestic despotism -- that the former completely extinguish all national pride which be as much the cause as the effect of national greatness i ask he whether he think if he countryman be to shake off the yoke of the english they could maintain they independence undoubtedly say he who would be able to conquer we i suggest to he that they might tempt the ambition of russium and cautiously inquire whether the abstinence from animal food might not render he country much less capable of resistance and whether it might not serve to explain why indium have so often be the prey of foreign conquest of this however he would hear nothing but reply with more impatience than be usual with he -- it be true hindostan be invade by alexander -- but not conquer and that it have since submit in succession to the arabian to the tartar under genghi khan and under tamerlane to the persian under nadir shah and finally to the british but there be few country of europe which have not be conquer as often that nation from which you be descend and to which mine be now subject furnish no exception as it have be subjugate in succession by the roman the dane the saxon the norman and as to courage we see no difference between those asiatic who eat animal food as you do and those who abstain from it as i do i be tell that the scotch peasantry eat much less animal food than the english and the irish far less than they and yet that these rank among the best troops of the british but surely a nation ought not to be suspect of fear death whose very woman show a contempt of life which no other people have exhibit this lead we to talk of that strange custom of he country which impel the widow to throw herself on the funeral pile of she husband and to be consume with he i tell he that it have often be represent as compulsory -- or in other word that it be say that every art and means be resort to for the purpose of work on the mind of the woman by she relative aid by the priest who would be naturally gratify by such signal triumph of religion over the strongest feeling of nature he admit that these engine be sometimes put in operation and that they impel to the sacrifice some who be waver but insist that in a majority of instance the _ suttee _ be voluntary woman say he be bring up from they infancy to regard we sex as they superior and to believe that they greatest merit consist in entire devotion to they husband under this feeling and have at the same time they attention frequently turn to the chance of such a calamity they be better prepare to meet it when it occur how few of the officer in you western army ever hesitate to march at the head of they man on a forlorn hope and how many even court the danger for the sake of the glory nay you tell I that accord to you code of honor if one man insult another he who give the provocation and he who receive it rather than be disgrace in the eye of they countryman will go out and quietly shoot at each other with firearm till one of they be kill or wound and this too in many case when the injury have be merely nominal if you show such a contempt of death in deference to a custom found in mere caprice can it be wonder that a woman should show it in the first paroxysm of she grief for the loss of he to whom be devoted every thought word and action of she life and who next to she god be the object of she idolatry my dear atterley he continue with emotion you little know the strength of woman 's love here he abruptly break off the conversation and after continue thoughtful and silent for some time he remark : but do not forget where we be nature demand she accustomed rest and let we prepare to indulge she i feel little inclined to sleep at present yet by the time you have take some hour ' repose i shall probably require the same refreshment i would willingly have listen longer but yield to he prudent suggestion again compose myself to rest and leave my good monitor to he melancholy meditation when i have sleep about four hour i be awaken by the brahmin in whose arm i find myself and who feeble as he be handle I with the ease that a nurse do a child or rather as a child do she doll on look around i find myself lie on what have be the ceiling of we chamber which still however feel like the bottom my eye and my feeling be thus in collision and i could only account for what i saw by suppose that the machine have be turn upside down i be bewildered and alarmed after enjoy my surprise for a moment the brahmin observe : we have while you be asleep pass the middle point between the earth 's and the moon 's attraction and we now gravitate less towards we own planet than she satellite i take the precaution to move you before you fall by you own gravity from what be lately the bottom to that which be now so and to keep you in this place until you be retain in it by the moon 's attraction for though you fall would have be at this point like that of a feather yet it would have give you some shock and alarm the machine therefore have undergo no change in its position or course the change be altogether in we feeling the brahmin then after have look through either telescope but for a longer time through the one at the bottom and have perform he customary devotions soon fall into a slumber but not into the same quiet sleep as before for he be often interrupt by sudden start of so distressing a character that i be almost tempt to wake he after a while however he seem more compose when i betook myself to the telescope turn towards the earth the earth 's appearance i find so diminish as not to exceed four time the diameter of the moon as see from the earth and its whole face be entirely change after the first surprise i recollect it be the moon i be then regard and my curiosity be greatly awaken on raise myself up and look through the upper telescope the earth present a appearance not very dissimilar but the outline of she continent and ocean be still perceptible in different shades and capable of be easily recognize but the bright glare of the sun make the surface of both body rather dim and pale after a short interval i again look at the moon and find not only its magnitude very greatly increase but that it be begin to present a more beautiful spectacle the sun 's ray fall obliquely on she disc so that by a large part of its surface not reflect the light i see every object on it so far as i be enable by the power of my telescope its mountain lake sea continent and island be faintly though not indistinctly trace and every moment bring forth something new to catch my eye and awaken my curiosity the whole face of the moon be of a silvery hue relieved and vary by the softest and most delicate shades no cloud nor speck of vapor intercept my view one of my exclamation of delight awaken the brahmin who quickly arise and look down on the resplendent orb below we observe that we must soon begin to slacken the rapidity of we course by throw out ballast the moon 's dimension now rapidly increase the separate mountain which form the ridge and chain on she surface begin to be plainly visible through the telescope whilst on the shaded side several volcano appear upon she disc like the flash of we fire-fly or rather like the twinkling of star in a frosty night he remark that the extraordinary clearness and brightness of the object on the moon 's surface be owe to she have a less extensive and more transparent atmosphere than the earth : add -- the difference be so great that some of we astronomical observer have be induce to think she have none if that however have be the case we voyage would have be impracticable after gaze at the magnificent spectacle with admiration and delight for half a hour the brahmin loose one of the ball of the lunar metal for the purpose of check we velocity at this time he suppose we be not more than four thousand mile or about twice the moon 's diameter from the nearest point of she surface in about four hour more she apparent magnitude be so great that we could see she by look out of either of the dark side-window she disc have now lose its former silvery appearance and begin to look more like that of the earth when see at the same distance it be a most gratifying spectacle to behold the object successively rise to we view and steadily enlarge in they dimension the rapidity with which we approach the moon impress I in spite of myself with the alarming sensation of fall and i find myself alternately agitate with a sense of this danger and with impatience to take a nearer view of the new object that greet my eye the brahmin be wholly absorb in calculation for the purpose of adjust we velocity to the distance we have to go he estimate of which however be in a great measure conjectural and ever and anon he would let off a ball of the lunar metal after a few hour we be so near the moon that every object be see in we glass as distinctly as the shell or marine plant through a piece of shallow sea-water though the eye could take in but a small part of she surface and the horizon which bound we view be rapidly contract on let the air escape from we machine it do not now rush out with the same violence as before which show that we be within the moon 's atmosphere this as well as rid ourselves of the metal ball aid in check we progress by and bye we be within a few mile of the highest mountain when we throw down so much of we ballast that we soon appear almost stationary the brahmin remark that he should avail himself of the current of air we might meet with to select a favourable place for landing though we be necessarily attract towards the same region in consequence of the same half of the moon 's surface be always turn towards the earth in we second voyage say he we be glad to get foothold any where for not have lighten we machine sufficiently we come down with a considerable concussion on a barren field remote from any human habitation and suffer more from hunger and cold for nearly three day than we have do from the peril and privation of the voyage the next time we aim at landing near the town of alamatua which stand as you may see a little to the right of we upon a island in a lake and look like a emerald set in silver we come down very gently it be true but we strike one of the numerous boat which ply around the island and have nearly occasion the loss of we life as well as of theirs in we last voyage we be every way fortunate the first part of the moon we approach be a level plain of great extent divide into corn-field on which have lower we grapnel we draw ourselves down without difficulty we must now continue he look out for some cultivate field in one of the valley we be approach where we may rely on be not far from some human abode and on escape the peril of rock tree and building while the brahmin be speak a gentle breeze arise as appear by we horizontal motion which waft we at the rate of about ten mile a hour in succession over a ridge of mountain a lake a thick wood and a second lake until at length we reach a cultivate region recognize by the brahmin as the country of the morosof the place we be most anxious to reach let off two of the ball of lead to the earth say he i do so and we descend rapidly when we be sufficiently near the ground to see that it be a fit place for landing we open the door and find the air of the moon inconceivably sweet and refreshing we now loose one of the lower ball and somewhat check we descent in a few minute more however we be within twenty yard of the ground when we let go the largest ball of lunarium which have a cord attach to it serve we in lieu of a grapnel it descend with great force to the ground while the machine thus lighten be dispose to mount again we however draw ourselves down and as soon as the machine touch the ground we let off some of we leaden ball to keep it there we release ourselves from the machine in a twinkling and we first impulse be to fall on we knee and return thanks for we safe deliverance from the many peril of the voyage chapter vi _ some account of morosofium and its chief city alamatua -- singular dress of the lunar lady -- religious self denial -- glouglim miser and spendthrift _ my feeling at the moment i touch the ground repay I for all i have endure i look around with the most intense curiosity but nothing that i see surprised I so much as to find so little that be surprising the vegetation insect and other animal be all pretty much of the same character as those i have see before but after i become better acquaint with they i find the difference to be much greater than i at first suppose have refresh ourselves with the remains of we store and secure the door of we machine we bent we course by a plain road towards the town we see on the side of a mountain about three mile distant and enter it a little before the sun have descend behind the adjacent mountain the town of alamatua seem to contain about two thousand house and to be not quite as large as albany the house be build of a soft shine stone and they all have portico piazza and veranda suit to the tropical climate of morosofium the people be tall and thin of a pale yellowish complexion and they garment light loose and flowing and not very different from those of the turk the lower order of people commonly wear but a single garment which pass round the waist one half the house be under ground partly to screen they from the continued action of the sun 's ray and partly on account of the earthquake cause by volcano the window of they house be different from any i have ever see before they consist of opening in the wall sloping so much upward that while they freely admit the light and air the sun be completely exclude : and although those who be within could readily see what be pass in the street they be conceal from the gaze of the curious in they hot-house it be common to have mirror in the ceiling which at once reflect the street passenger to those who be on the floor and enable the ostentatious to display to the public eye the decoration of they table whenever they give a sumptuous feast the inhabitant subsist chiefly on a vegetable diet live about as long as they do on the earth notwithstanding the great difference of climate and other circumstance and in short do not in they manners habit or character differ more from the inhabitant of we planet than some of these differ from one another they government be anciently monarchical but be now popular they code of law be say to be very intricate they language naturally soft and musical have be yet further refine by the cultivation of letter they have a variety of sect in religion politics and philosophy the territory of morosofium be about 150 mile square this brief sketch must content the reader for the present i refer those who be desirous of be more particularly inform to the work which i propose to publish on lunar geography and in the mean time some of the most striking peculiarity of this people in opinion manners and custom will be develop in this which must be consider as my _ personal narrative _ as soon as we be espy by the inhabitant we be surround by a troop of little boy as well as all the idle and inquisitive near we the brahmin have not go far before he be meet by some person of he acquaintance who immediately recognize he and seem very much pleased to see he again in the moon they politely conduct we to the house of the governor who receive we very graciously he appear to be about forty-five year of age be dress in a pearl-coloured suit and have a mild amiable deportment he begin a course of interesting inquiry about the affair of the earth but a gentleman whom we afterwards understand be one of the leader of the popular party come in he soon despatch we have however first direct a officer to furnish we with all that be necessary for we accommodation at the public expense -- which act of hospitality we have reason to fear occasion he some trouble and perplexity at the succeed election we very gladly withdraw as both by reason of we long walk and the excitement produce by so many new object we be greatly fatigue the officer conduct we to respectable private lodgings in a lightsome situation which overlook the chief part of the city after a frugal but not unpalatable repast and a few hour ' sleep the brahmin take I round the city and a part of its environs to make I acquaint with the public building street shop and the appearance of the inhabitant i soon find that we arrival be generally know and that we excite quite as much curiosity as we feel though many of the person we meet have see the brahmin before i be surprise that we see none of they woman but the brahmin tell I that they be every where gaze through they window and on look up through these slanting aperture i could often see they eye peep over the upper edge of the window-sill i shall now proceed to record faithfully what i deem most memorable not as many traveller have do from they recollection after they return home but from note which i regularly make either at the moment of observation or very shortly afterwards when we first visit the shop i be equally gratified and surprised with what be familiar and what be new but i be particularly amuse with those of the tailor and milliner in the lower part of they dress the lunarian chiefly resemble the european but in the upper part the asiatic -- for they shave the head and wear turban from which fact the brahmin draw another argument in favor of the hypothesis that the moon be originally a part of the earth some of the female fashion be so extremely singular and fanciful as to deserve particular mention one piece of they attire be form of a long piece of light stiff wood cover with silk and decorate with showy ornament it be wear across the shoulder beyond each of which it jut out about half a yard and from either end a cord lead to a ring run round the upper part of the head bear no small resemblance to the yard of a ship 's mast and the rope use for steer it several other dress i saw which i be satisfied would be highly disapprove by my modest countrywoman thus in some be insert glass like watch crystal adapt to the form and size of the female bosom but to do the lunar lady justice i understand that these dress be condemn by the sedate part of the sex and be wear only by the young and thoughtless who be vain of they form i observe too that instead of decorate they head with flower like the lady of we earth they tax the animal world for a correspondent ornament many of the head-dress be make of a stiff open gauze occasionally stick over with insect of the butterfly and _ coccinellum _ species and other of the gayest hue at other time these insect be alive when they perpetual buzz and flutter in they transparent cage have a very animating effect one decoration for the head in particular strike my fancy : it be form of a silver tissue contain firefly and intend to be worn in the night but the most remarkable thing of all be the whim of the lady in the upper class of make themselves as much like bird as possible in which art it must be confess they be wonderfully successful the dress use for this purpose consist of a sort of thick cloak cover with feather like those of the south sea island and be so fashion by means of a tight thick quilting as to make the wearer at a little distance very much resemble a overgrown bird except that the leg be somewhat too thick they arm be conceal under the wing and the resemblance be yet further increase by mark with beak adapt to the particular plumage : some personate dove some magpie other again hawk parrot & c accord to they natural figure humor & c while the deception be still further assist by they extraordinary agility compare with ours by means of which they could with ease hop eighteen or twenty foot i tell the brahmin that some of the indian of we continent show a similar taste in dress by decorate themselves with horn like the buffalo and with tail like horse which furnish he with a further argument in favor of a common origin we spend above a hour in examine these curious habiliment and in inquire the purpose and use of the several part sometimes i be induce through the brahmin to criticise they taste and skill have be always a admirer of simplicity in female attire but i remark on this occasion as on several other subsequently that the people of the moon be neither very thankful for advice nor think very highly of the judgment of those who differ from they in opinion after have ramble over the city about six hour we appetite tell we it be time to return to we lodgings and here i meet with a new cause of wonder the family with whom we be domesticate belong to a numerous and zealous sect of religionist and be in they way very worthy as well as pious people they dinner consist of several dish of vegetable variously serve up of root stalk seed flower and fruit some of which resemble the production of the earth and in particular i see a dish of what i at first take to be very fine asparagus but suppose i be mistake when i see they eat the coarse fibrous part alone on tasting it however in the ordinary way i find it to be genuine good asparagus but i perceive that the family look extremely shock at my taste after the other dish be remove some large fruit of the peach kind be set on the table when the member of the family have carefully pair off the skin eat it and throw the rest away they in like manner chew the shell of some small grayish nut and throw away the kernel which to I be very palatable the younger child consist of two boy and a girl exchange look with each other at the selection i make and i think i perceive in the look of the mother still more aversion than surprise i find too that my friend the brahmin abstain from all these thing and partook only of those vegetable and fruit of which both they and i eat alike some wine be offer we which appear to I to be neither more nor less than vinegar and what add to my surprise a bottle which they say be not yet fit to drink seem to I to be pretty good the brahmin have pass it to I for my judgment as soon as they pronounce upon it sentence of condemnation after we arise from this strange scene and have withdraw to we chamber i express my surprise to my companion at this contrariety in the taste of the terrestrial and lunarian : whereupon he tell I that the difference be rather apparent than real these people say he belong to a sect of ascetic in this country who be persuade that all pleasure receive through the sens be sinful and that man never appear so acceptable in the sight of the deity as when he reject all the delicacy of the palate as well as other sensual gratification and impose on himself that food to which he feel naturally most repugnant you may see that those peach which be so disdainfully throw into the yard be often secretly pick up by the child who obey the impulse of nature and devour they most greedily even in the old people themselves there be occasionally some backsliding into the depravity of worldly appetite you might have perceive that while the old man be abuse the wine you drink as unripe and make wry face at it he still keep tasting it and if i have not reach it to you he would probably before he have cease he meditation have finish half the bottle it must be confess that although religion cherish we best feeling it also often prove a cloak for the worst i tell he that we clergy be superior to this weakness most of they manifest a proper sense of the bounty of providence by eat and drinking of the best -lrb- not very sparingly neither -rrb- and that in new-york we consider some of we preacher the best judge of wine among we soon afterwards we again sally forth in quest of adventure and bent we course towards the suburb we have not go far before we see several person look at a man work hard at a forge in a low crazy building on approach he we find he be engage in make nail a operation which he perform with great skill and adroitness and as soon as he have make as many as he could take up in he hand at once he carry they behind he little hovel and drop they into a narrow deep well some of the by-stander wish to beg a few of what he seem to value so lightly and other offer to give he bread or clothes in exchange for he nail but he obstinately resist all they application in fact little heed they although he be almost naked have a starve haggard appearance and evidently regard the food they proffer with a wishful eye the looker on tell we the blacksmith have be for year engage in this business of nail-making he work with little intermission scarcely allow himself time for necessary sleep or refreshment that all the fruit of he incessant labor be dispose of in the manner we have just see and that he have already three well fill with nail which he have carefully close he have moreover a large and productive farm the increase arise from which be lay out in exchange for the metal of which he nail be make he have we be inform so much attachment to these piece of metal that he be often on the point of starvation before he would part with one i observe to the brahmin that it be a singular and somewhat inexplicable species of madness true he reply this man 's conduct can not be explain upon any rational principle -- but he be one of the glonglim of which i have speak to you and example be not want on we planet of conduct as irreconcilable to reason this man be make a article which be scarce as well as useful in this country where gravity be less than it be with we : the force of the wind be very great and the metal be possess but by a few now if you suppose these nail to be piece of gold and silver he conduct will be precisely that of some of we miser who waste they day and night in hoard up wealth which they never use nor mean to use but deny themselves every comfort of life anxiously and unceasingly toil for those who be to come after they though they be so far from feel towards these successor any peculiar affection that they often regard they with jealousy and hatred while we thus converse there step up to we a handsome man foppishly dress in blue trowser a pink vest and a red and white turban who after have shake my companion by the ear accord to the custom of the country among intimate friend express he delight at see he again in morosofium he then go on in a lively humorous strain to ridicule the nail-smith and tell we several story of he singular attachment to he nail in the midst of these sally however a harsh look personage in brown come up upon which the countenance of we lively acquaintance suddenly change and they walk off together i apprehend say the brahmin that my gay acquaintance yonder continue as he formerly be the man in brown who so unseasonably interrupted he pleasantry be a officer of justice and have probably take he before a magistrate to answer some one of he numerous creditor you must know add he that the people of the moon however irrational themselves be very prompt in perceive the absurdity of other : and this lively wit who as you see want neither part nor address act as strangely as the wretch he have be ridicule he inherit a large estate which bring he in a princely revenue and yet he desire and expense so far outgo he means that he be always in want both he and the nailmaker suffer the evil of poverty -- of poverty create by themselves -- which moreover they can terminate when they please but they must reach the same point by directly opposite road the blacksmith will allow himself nothing -- the beau will deny himself nothing : the one be a slave to pleasure -- the other the victim of fear i tell you that there be but few whose estate produce the metal of which these nail be make and this thoughtless youth happen to be one a few year since he want some of the blacksmith 's nail to purchase the first rose of the season and pledge he mine to pay at the end of the year three time the amount he receive in exchange and although if he be to use but half he income for a single year the other half would discharge he debt i apprehend from what i have hear that he have from that time to this continue to pay the same exorbitant interest when i be here before i prevail on he to take a ride with I into the country and under one pretext or another detain he ten day at a friend 's house where he have no inducement to expense when he return he find he debt pay off but know he be master of so ready and effectual a expedient he the next day borrow double the sum at the old rate since that time he debt have accumulate so rapidly that he will probably now be compel to surrender he whole estate be he also a glonglim i ask assuredly : what man in he entire sens could act so irrationally there be nothing on earth that exceed this say i no say the brahmin human folly be every where the same chapter vii _ physical peculiarity of the moon-celestial phenomenon -- further description of the lunarian -- national prejudice -- lightness of body -- the brahmin carry atterley to sup with a philosopher -- he character and opinion _ after we have be in the moon about forty eight hour the sun have sink below the horizon and the long twilight of the lunarian have begin i will here take occasion to notice the physical peculiarity of this country which though very familiar to those who be verse in astronomy may not be unacceptable to the less scientific portion of my reader the sun be above the horizon nearly a fortnight and below it as long of course the day here be equal to about twenty-seven of ours the earth answer the same purpose to half the inhabitant of the moon that the moon do to the inhabitant of the earth the face of the latter however be more than twelve time as large and it have not the same silvery appearance as the moon but be rather of a dingy pink hue like that of she iron when begin to lose its red heat as the same part of the moon be always turn to the earth one half of she surface be perpetually illuminate by a moon ten time as large to the eye as the sun the other hemisphere be without a moon the favored part therefore never experience total darkness the earth reflect to the lunarian as much light as we terrestrial have a little before sunrise or after sunset but we planet present to the lunarian the same change as the moon do to we accord to its position in relation to the sun it always however appear to occupy nearly the same part of the heaven when see from the same point on the moon 's surface but its altitude above the horizon be greater or less accord to the latitude of the place from which it be see : so that there be not a point of the heaven which the earth may not be see permanently to occupy accord to the part of the moon from which the planet be view from the length of time that the sun be above the horizon the continued action of he ray in those climate where they fall vertically or nearly so would be intolerable if it be not for the high mountain from whose snow-clad summit a perpetual breeze derive a refreshing coolness and for the deep glen and recess in which most animal seek protection from he meridian beam the transition from heat to cold be less than one would expect from the length of they day and night -- the coolness of the one as well as the heat of the other be temper by a constant east wind the climate gradually become colder as we approach the pole but there be little or no change of season in the same latitude the inhabitant of the moon have not the same regularity in they meal or time for sleep as we have but consult they appetite and inclination like other animal but they make amends for this irregularity by a very strict and punctilious observance of festival which be regulate by the motion of the sun at whose rise and set they have they appropriate ceremony those which be keep at sunrise be gay and cheerful like the hope which the approach of that benignant luminary inspire the other be of a grave and sober character as if to prepare the mind for serious contemplation in they long-enduring night when the earth be at the full which be they midnight it be also a season of great festivity with they _ eclipse of the sun _ be as common with the lunarian as those of the moon be with we -- the same relative position of the three body produce this phenomenon but a _ eclipse of the earth _ never take place as the shadow of the moon pass over the broad disc of we planet merely as a dark spot the inhabitant of the moon can always determine both they latitude and longitude by observe the quarter of the heaven in which the earth be see : and as the sun invariably appear of the same altitude at they noon the inhabitant be denominate and class accord to the length of they shadow and the term _ long shadow _ or _ short shadow _ be common form of national reproach among they accord to the relative position of the party i find the climate of those whose shadow be about the length of they own figure the most agreeably to my own feeling and most like that of my own country such be the most striking natural appearance on one side of this satellite on the other there be some difference the sun pursue the same path in the corresponding latitudes of both hemisphere but be without any moon they have a dull and dreary night though the light from the star be much greater than with we the science of astronomy be much cultivate by the inhabitant of the dark hemisphere and be indebted to they for its most important discovery and its present high state of improvement if there be much rivalship among the native of the same hemisphere who differ in the length of they shadow they all unite in hatred and contempt for the inhabitant of the opposite side those who have the benefit of a moon that be who be turn towards the earth be lively indolent and changeable as the face of the luminary on which they pride themselves while those on the other side be more grave sedate and industrious the first be call the hilliboo and the last the moriboo -- or bright night and dark night and this mutual animosity be the more remarkable as they often appear to I to be the same race and to differ much less from one another than the native of different climate it be true that enlighten and well educate man do not seem to feel this prejudice or at least they do not show it : but those who travel from one hemisphere to the other be sure to encounter the prejudice of the vulgar and be often treat with great contempt and indignity they be pointed at by the child who accord as they chance to have be breed on one side or the other say there go a man who never see glootin as they call the earth or there go a booblimak which mean a night stroller all body be much lighter on the moon than on the earth by reason of which circumstance as have be mention the inhabitant be more active and experience much less fatigue in ascend they precipitous mountain i be astonish at first at this seeming increase in my muscular power when on pass along a street in alamatua soon after my arrival and meet a dog which i think to be mad i propose to run out of he way and in leap over a gutter i fairly bound across the street i measure the distance the next day and find it to be twenty-seven foot five inch and afterwards frequently see the school-boy when engage in athletic exercise make run leap of between thirty and forty foot backwards and forwards another consequence of the diminish gravity here be that both man and animal carry much greater burden than on the earth the carriage be draw altogether by dog which be the largest animal they have except the zebra and a small buffalo this diminution of gravity be however of some disadvantage to they many of they tool be not as efficient as ours especially they axis hoe and hammer on the other hand when a person fall to the ground it be nearly the same thing as if a inhabitant of the earth be to fall on a feather bed yet i see as many instance of fractured limb hernia and other accident there as i ever see on the earth for when they fall from great height or miscarry in the feat of activity which they ambitiously attempt it inflict the same injury upon they as a fall nearer the ground do upon we after we have be here sufficiently long to see what be most remarkable in the city and i have commit the fruit of my observation to paper the brahmin propose to carry I to one of the monthly supper of a philosopher whom he know and who have obtain great celebrity by he writings and opinion we accordingly go and find he sit at a small table and apparently exhaust with the labor of composition and the ardor of intense thought he be a small man of quick abrupt manners occasionally very abstracted but more frequently voluble earnest and disputatious he frankly tell we he be sorry to see we as he be then put the last finish to a great and useful work he be about to publish : that we have thus unseasonably break the current of he thought and he might not be able to revive it for some day upon my rise to take my leave he assure I that it would be add to the injury already do if we then quit he he say he wish to learn the particulars of we voyage and that he in turn should certainly render we service by disclose some of the result of he own reflection he further remark that he expect six or eight friend -- that be -lrb- correct himself -rrb- enlighten and congenial mind to supper on the rising of a constellation he name which time he remark would soon arrive find he frankness to be thus seasoned with hospitality we resume we seat it soon appear that he be more disposed to communicate information than to seek it and i become a patient listener if the boldness and strangeness of he opinion occasionally startle I i could not but admire the clearness with which he state he proposition the fervor of he elocution and the plausibility of he argument the expect guest at length arrive and various question of moral and legislation be start in which the disputant seem sometimes as if they would have lay aside the character of philosopher but for the seasonable interposition of the brahmin wigurd we host often labor with he accustomed zeal to prove that every one who oppose he be either a fool or biass by some petty interest or the dupe of blind prejudice after about two hour of warm and as it seem to I unprofitable discussion we be summon to we repast in the adjoining room but before we rise from we seat we host request to know of each of we if we be hungry and whether it be from modesty perverseness or really because they have no appetite i know not but a majority of the company in which i be include vote that they hour of eating be not yet come : upon which wigurd remark that he own vote as be at home and the brahmin 's as be at once a philosopher and a stranger should each count for two and by this mode of reckon there be a casting vote in favor of go to supper we find the table cover with tempting dish serve up in a costly and tasteful style and a sprightly well-looking female prepared to do the honor of the feast she reprove we host for he delay and tell he the best dish be spoil by be cold i be fearful of a discussion but he sit down without make a reply and immediately address the company descant on the various quality of food and they several adaptation to different age constitution and temperament he condemn the absurd practice which prevail for the master or mistress of the house to lavish entreaty on they guest to eat that which they might be better without and insist at the same time that the guest ought not to consult they own taste exclusively he maintain that the only course worthy of rational and benevolent being be for every man to judge for he neighbor as well as for himself and should any collision arise between the different claimant then if any one be guide by that decision which a honest and unbiassed judgment would tell he be right they would all come to the same just and harmonious result but add he you have not yet be sufficiently prepare for this disinterested operation as ye have prove this night that ye be not yet purge of the feeling and prejudice of a vicious education i will perform this office for you all and set you a example by which ye may hereafter profit to begin then with you -- -lrb- address himself to a corpulent man of a florid complexion at the lower end of the table : -rrb- -- as you already have a redundancy of flesh and blood i assign the _ soupe magre _ to you while to we mathematical friend on this side whose delicate constitution require nourishment i recommend the smoking ragot this cooling dish will suit you temperament say he to a third and this stimulate one yours to a fourth those little bird which cost I five piece i shall divide between my terrestrial friend here -lrb- look at the brahmin -rrb- and myself we be the most meritorious of the company and it be of the utmost importance to society that food so wholesome should give nourishment to we body and impart vigor and vivacity to we mind from this decision there be no appeal and no other dissent than what be express by a look or a low murmur but i perceive the corpulent gentleman and the wan mathematician slily exchange they dish by which they both seem to consider themselves gainer the dish allot to I be of a middling character i eat of it without repine though from the savoury fume of my right-hand neighbor 's plate i could not help wish i have be allow to choose for myself this supper happen near the middle of the night -lrb- at which time it be always pretty cool -rrb- a cheerful fire blaze in one side of the room and i perceive that we host and hostess place themselves so as to be at the most agreeable distance the greater part of the guest be either too near or too far from it after we have finish we repast various subject of speculation be again introduce and discuss greatly to my amusement wigurd display he usual ingenuity and ardor and baffle all he antagonist by he vehemence and fluency he have two great principle by which he test the good or evil of every thing and there be few question in which he could not avail himself of one or the other these be general _ utility _ and _ truth _ by a skilful use of these weapon of controversy he could attack or defend with equal success if any custom or institution which he have denounce be justify by he adversary on the ground of its expediency he immediately retort on they its repugnancy to sincerity truth and unsophisticated nature and if they at any time resort to a similar justification for we natural feeling and propensity he triumphantly show that they be inimical to the public good thus he condemn gratitude as a sentiment calculate to weaken the sense of justice and to substitute feeling for reason he on the other hand proscribe the little form and courtesy which be either found in convenience or give a grace and sweetness to social intercourse as a direct violation of honest nature and therefore odious and mean he thus be able to silence every opponent i be very desirous of hear the brahmin 's opinion but while he evidently be not convince by we host 's language he decline engage in any controversy after we retire my friend tell I that wigurd be a good man in the main though he have be as much hate by some as if he conduct have be immoral instead of he opinion merely be singular he not long ago add the brahmin write a book against marriage and soon afterwards wed in due form the lady you see at he table she hold as strange tenet as he which she support with as much zeal and almost as much ability but i predict that the popularity of they doctrine will not last and if ever you visit the moon again you will find that they glory now at its height like the ephemeral fashion of the earth will have pass away chapter viii _ a celebrated physician : he ingenious theory in physics : he mechanical invention -- the feather-hunting glonglim _ on return to we lodgings we act under the influence of long habit go to bed though half the family be up and engage in they ordinary employment one consequence of the length of the day and night here be that every household be commonly divide into two part which watch and sleep by turn : nor have they any uniformity in they meal except in particular family which be

the sun or the star in which consider that it be nearly thirty time as slow as with we they attain surprising accuracy they have the same short interval of labor and rest in they long night as they day -- the light reflect from the earth be commonly sufficient to enable they to perform almost any operation and ere we planet be in she second quarter one may read the smallest print by she light to compensate they want of this natural advantage the inhabitant of moriboozium be abundantly supply with a petroleum or bituminous liquid which be find every where about they lake or on they mountain and which they burn in lamp of various size shape and construction they have also numerous volcano each of which shed a strong light for many mile around we sleep unusually long and owing in part to wigurd 's good cheer i awake with a head-ache i get up to take a long walk which often relieve I when suffer from that malady and on ascend the stair i meet we landlord 's eldest daughter a tall graceful girl of twenty i find she be come down backwards which i take to be a mere girlish freak or perhaps a piece of coquetry practice on myself : but i afterwards find that about the time the earth be at the full the whole family pursue the same course and be very scrupulous in make they step in this awkward and inconvenient way because it be one of the prescribed form of they church as my head-ache become rather worse than better from my walk the brahmin propose to accompany I to the house of a celebrated physician call vindar who be also a botanist chemist and dentist to consult he on my case and thither we forthwith proceed i find he a large unwieldy figure of a dull heavy look but by no means deficient in science or natural shrewdness he confirm my previous impression that i ought to lose blood and plausibly enough account for my present sensation of fulness from the inferior pressure of the lunar atmosphere to that which i have be accustom he propose however to return to my vein a portion of thinner blood in place of what he should take away and offer I the choice of several animal which he always keep by he for that purpose there be two white animal of the hog kind a male and a female lama three goat besides several bird about the size of a turkey some tortoise and other amphibious animal he profess himself willing in case i have any foolish scruple against mix my blood with that of brute to purify my own and put it back but i obstinately decline both expedient whereupon he open a vein in my arm and take from it about fourteen ounce of blood finding myself weaken as well as relieve by the operation he invite I to rest myself and while i be recover my strength he discourse with the brahmin and myself on several of he favorite topic on return home i commit to paper some of the most remarkable of he opinion which it may be as well to notice that those who have since propound or may hereafter propound the same to the world may not claim the merit of originality he maintain that the number of we sens be greater than that commonly assign to we that we have for example a sense of acid of alkali of weight and of heat that acid substance act upon we body by a peculiar set of nerve or through some medium of they own be evident from this that they set the tooth on edge though these from they hard and bony nature be insensible to the touch that astringent shrivel up the flesh and pucker the mouth even when they taste be not perceive that when the skin shrink on the application of vinegar could it be say that it have not a peculiar sense of this liquid or rather of its acidity since the existence of the sens be know only by effect which external matter produce on they that the sens like that of touch be seat in most part of the body but be most acute in the mouth nose ear and eye he show some disposition to maintain the popular notion of the greek and roman that the river and stream be endow with reason and volition and endeavor to prove that some of they winding and deviation from a straight line can not be explain upon mechanical principle vindar be moreover a projector of a very bold character and not long ago petition the commanding general of a army suddenly raise to repel a incursion of one of they neighbor to march he troops into goolo-tongtoium for the purpose of digging a canal from one of they petroleum lake into morosofium and conduct it by smaller stream over that country for the purpose of warm it during they long cool night he have too a large grist and see mill which be put in motion by the explosion of gunpowder this be convey by a sufficiently ingenious machine in very small portion to the bottom of a upright cylinder which be immediately shut perfectly close a flint and steel be at the same time make to strike directly over it and to ignite the powder the air that be thus generate force up a piston through a cylinder which piston strike the arm of a wheel put it in motion and with it the machinery of the mill a complete revolution of the wheel again prepare the cylinder for a fresh supply of gunpowder which be set on fire and produce the same effect as before he tell I he have be fifteen year perfect this great work in which time it have be twice blow up by accident arise from the carelessness or mismanagement of the workman but that he now expect it would repay he for the time and money he have expend he have once he say intend to use the expansive force of congelation for he move power but he find after make a full and accurate calculation that the labourer require to keep the machine supply with ice consume something more than twice as much corn as the mill would grind in the same time he then be about to move it to a fine stream of water in the neighborhood which by be dam up so as to form a large pond would afford he a convenient and inexhaustible supply of ice but the millwright after the dam be complete have artfully obtain he permission to use the waste water and fraudulently erect there a common water-mill which soon obtain all the neighbouring custom he have sell out that property and resort to the agency of gunpowder which be quite as philosophical a process as that of congelation and much less expensive in answer to a inquiry of the brahmin 's he admit that though he have be able by the force of congelation to burst metallic tube several inch thick he have never succeed in make it put the lightest machinery into a continued motion have now nearly recover and be i confess somewhat bewildered by the variety and complexity of these ingenious project i feel disposed to take my leave but vindar insist on conduct we into a inner apartment to see he _ poetry box _ this be a large piece of furniture profusely decorate with metal of various color curiously and fantastically inlay it contain a prodigious number of drawer which be label after the manner of those in a apothecary 's shop -lrb- from whence he deny however that he first take the hint -rrb- and the label be arrange in alphabetical order now say he as the excellence of poetry consist in bring before the mind 's eye what can be bring before the corporeal eye i have here collect every object that be either beautiful or pleasing in nature whether by its form color fragrance sweetness or other quality as well as those that be strikingly disagreeable when i wish to exhibit those picture which constitute poetry i consult the appropriate cabinet and i take my choice of those various substance which can best call up the image i wish to present to my reader for example : suppose i wish to speak of any object that be white or analogous to white i open the drawer that be thus label and i see silver lime chalk and white enamel ivory paper snow-drop and alabaster and select whichever of these substance will best suit the measure and the rhyme and have the most soft-sounding name if the color be yellow then there be substance of all shades of this hue from saffron and pickle salmon to brimstone and straw i have sixty-two red substance twenty-seven green one and other in the same proportion it be astonishing what labor this box have save I and how much it have add to the beauty and melody of my verse you perceive he add the drawer miss that contain substance offensive to the sight or smell which my maid conduct to it by she nose conceive to be some animal curiosity i have be collect in a state of putrefaction and decay and do not hesitate to throw they into the fire i afterwards find myself very much at a loss whenever my subject lead I to the mention of object of this character and i therefore speak of they as seldom as possible after bestow that tribute of admiration and praise which every great author or inventor expect in he own house and not omit he customary medical fee we take we leave we have not long left vindar 's house before we see a short fat man in the suburb prepare to climb to the top of a plane tree on which there be one of the tail feather of a sort of flamingo he be surround by attendant and servant to whom he issue he command with great rapidity and decision occasionally intermingle with he order the most threatening language and furious gesticulation some offer to get a ladder and ascend and other to cut down the tree all of which he obstinately reject he swear he would get the feather -- he would get it by climb -- and he would climb but one way which way be on the shoulder of he man he plan be to make a number of they form a solid square and interlock they arm then a smaller number to mount upon they shoulder on whom other be in like manner place and so on till the pyramid be sufficiently high when he himself be to mount and from the shoulder of the highest pluck the darling object of he wish he have in this way i afterwards learn gather some of the richest flower of the bignonium scarlatina as well as such fruit as have tempt he by they luscious appearance and at the same time frightening all the bird from they nest which he commonly destroy : and although some of he attendant be occasionally much hurt and bruise in this singular amusement he still persevere in it he have continue it for several year with no intermission except a short one when he be engage in break a young llana in the place of a old one which have be many year a favorite but be now in disgrace because as he say he do not think it so safe for go down hill but in reality because he like the figure and movement of the young one better i could not see this rash glonglim attempt to climb that dangerous ladder without feel alarm for he safety at first all seem to go on very well but just as he be about to lay hold of the gaudy prize there arise a sudden squall which throw both he and he supporter into confusion and the whole living pyramid come to the ground together many be kill -- some be wound and bruise polenap himself by light on he man who serve he as cushion barely escape with life but he receive a fracture in the upper part of he head and a dislocation of the hip which will not only prevent he from ever climb again but probably make he a cripple for life the brahmin and i endeavor to give the sufferer some assistance but this be render unnecessary by the crowd which they cry and lamentation bring to they relief i think that the author of so much mischief would have be stone on the spot but to my surprise he servant seem to feel as much for he honor as they own safety and warmly interfere in he behalf until they have somewhat appease the rage of the surround multitude chapter ix _ the fortune-telling philosopher who inspect the finger nail : he visiter -- another philosopher who judge of the character by the hair -- the fortune-teller dupe -- predatory warfare _ as we return to we lodgings we see a number of person some of whom be enter and some leave a neat small dwelling and on join the throng we learn that a famous fortune-teller live there who at state period open he house to all that be willing to pay for be instruct in the event of futurity or for have the secret of the present or past reveal to they on enter the house and descend a flight of step we find at the farther end of a dark room light with a chandelier suspend from the ceiling a elderly man with a long gray beard and a thin pale countenance deeply furrowed with thought rather than care he receive we politely and then resume the duty of he vocation he course of proceeding be to examine the finger nail and accord to they form color thickness surface and grain to determine the character and destiny of those who consult he i be at once pleased and surprised at the minuteness of he observation and the infinite variety of he distinction besides the quality of the nail that i have mention he notice some which altogether elude my sens such as they milkiness flintiness friability elasticity tenacity and sensibility whether they be aqueous unctious or mealy with many more which have escape my recollection a modest pensive look girl apparently about seventeen be timidly hold forth she hand for examination at the time we enter avarabet -lrb- for that be the name of this philosopher -rrb- utter two or three word with a significant shake of he head upon which i see the rise tear in she eye she withdraw she hand and have not courage to let he take another look a fat woman of a sanguine temperament hold a little girl by the hand then step up and show she finger he pronounce she amorous inconstant prone to anger and extravagant that she have make one man miserable and would probably make another she also abruptly withdraw give manifest sign of one of the quality ascribe to she a elderly matron then approach hold forth one tremble palsied hand with a small volume in the other avarabet hesitate for some time examine the edge as well as the surface of the nail draw he finger slowly over they and then say -- you have a susceptible heart you be in sorrow but you affliction will soon have a end it be easy to see in the look of the applicant sign of pious resignation and a lively hope of another and a better state of existence i think i perceive in the scene that be pass before we a exhibition that be not uncommon on we earth of cunning knavery impose on ignorance and credulity and i express my opinion to the brahmin but he assure I that the class of person in the moon who be resort to on account of they suppose power of divination be very different from the similar class in asia or europe and that oracular art be here regularly study and profess as a branch of philosophy you would be surprise say he to find how successful they have be in invest they craft with the form and trappings of science the parade of classification and the mystery impart by technical term by these means they have give plausibility enough to they theory to leave many a one in doubt whether it be really a new triumph of human discovery or merely a later form of empiricism its professor be commonly convert to they own theory at least in a great degree for strange as it may seem there can mingle with the disposition to deceive other the power of deceive one 's self and while they exercise much acuteness and penetration in discover by the air look dress and manner of those who consult they the lead point in the history or character of person of whom they have no previous knowledge they at the same time persuade themselves that they see something indicative of they circumstance in they finger nail such be the equivocal character of the greater part of they sect : but there be some who be mere honest dupe to the pretension of the science and other again who have not one tittle of credulity to extenuate they impudent pretension when i be here before i remember a physician who acquire great celebrity by affect to cure disease by examine a lock of the patient 's hair and not content with merely pronounce on the nature of the disease and suggest the remedy he would enter into a elaborate and often plausible course of reasoning in defense of he system that system be briefly this : that the hair derive its length strength hue and other property from the brain which opinion he support by a reference to acknowledged fact -- as that it change its hue with the difference of the mental character in the different stage of life that violent affection of the mind such as grief or fear have be know to change it in a single night science on this as on other occasion be merely augment and methodize fact that the mass of mankind have long observe -- as that red hair have always be consider indicative of warm temperament that affliction and even love be believe to create baldness and that in great terror the hair stand on end the different age too be distinguish as much by they hair as they complexion they facial angle or in any other way he be lead to this theory first by observe at school that a boy of a stiff bristly head of hair be remarkably cruel he profess to have be able from a long course of observation to assign to every different color and variety of hair its peculiar temperament and character one mental quality be indicate by its length another by its fineness and other again as it chance to be greasy or lank or curl he would also blow on it with a bellows to see how the part arrange themselves : hold it near the fire and watch the operation of its crisping by the heat : and although he have often be mistake in he estimate of character by the rule of he new science he do not lose the confidence of he disciple on that account -- some of they refuse to believe the truth rather than to admit themselves mistaken and other insist that if he science be not infallible it very rarely deceive it be now we turn to submit we hand to avarabet for examination he discover sign of the loftiest virtue and most heroic enterprise in the brahmin and near the bottom of one of he nail a deep-rooted sorrow which would leave he only with he life a transient shade of gloom on the brahmin 's countenance be soon succeed by a pierce inquisitive glance cast on the diviner he see the other 's eye direct on the miniature which he always wear and which discover itself to avarabet as he stoop forward a smile of contempt now take the place of he first surprise and he seem in a state of abstraction during the continue rhapsody of the oracle my hand be next examine but little be say of I except that i have be a great traveller and should be so again that i should encounter many danger and difficulty that i possess more intelligence than sensibility and more prudence than generosity thus he discover in I great courage enterprise and constancy of purpose a hale robust well-set man now burst through the crowd and thrust out he hand abruptly ask the wise man to tell he if he could in what part of the country he live avarabet mention a distant district on the coast of morosofium good say the other and what be my call after a slight pause he reply that he get he living on the water good again shall i ever be rich no not very : -- never better and better rejoin the inquirer at the same time give vent to a loud and hearty laugh surely think i sailor be every where the same sort of being rough and boisterous as the element they roam over and what be you opinion of I farther you be bold frank improvident credulous and good-natured excellent indeed now what will you say old sham wisdom when i tell you that i never make a voyage in my life be never two day ' journey from this spot and be seldom off my own dominion that i own the forest of tongloo where i sometimes hunt from morning till night and from night till morning twelve out of the thirteen day in the year that my wealth which be considerable when i come to my estate have by my habit of life greatly increase and that i be bent upon add to it yet more i drink nothing but water and have come here only to win a wager that you be not as know as you pretend to be and that i could impose on you you thus have a specimen of my candor improvidence and credulity so say he leap on he zebra give a sort of huntsman 's shout and be off in a twinkling this adventure create great tumult in the crowd a few enjoy the jest but the greater number manifest ill-will and resentment towards the sportsman the brahmin and i take advantage of the confusion to withdraw unnoticed by the bystander after remain at we lodgings long enough to take rest and refreshment and to make minute of what we have see we propose to spend the remainder of the night in the country the weather be more pleasant at this time in that climate than when the sun be above the horizon we accordingly set out when the earth be in she second quarter and it be about two of we day before sunrise after walk about three mile the freshness of the morning air the fragrance of the flower and the music of innumerable bird whose unceasing carol testify they joy and delight at the approach of a more genial month we come to a large well cultivate farm in which a number of coarse look man be employ with the aid of dog cross-bow and other martial weapon in hunting down llama and a small kind of buffalo which in one of we former walk we have see quietly feed on a rich and extensive pasture we inquire of some straggler from the throng the meaning of what we see but they be too much occupy with they sport to afford we any satisfaction we walk on indulge we imagination in conjecture but have not proceed more than a quarter of a mile before we behold a similar scene go on to we leave by the same ill-looking crew we curiosity be now redouble and we resolve to wait a while on the highway for the chance of some passenger more at leisure to answer we inquiry and more courteously inclined than these fierce marauder we have not stop many minute before a well-dressed man wear the appearance of authority have ride up we ask he to explain the cause of they violent and seemingly lawless proceedings you be stranger i see or you would have understand that i be exercise my baronial privilege of do myself justice these cattle belong to the owner of a neighbouring estate by whom i and my tenant have be injure and insult and accord to the usage in such case i have give the signal to my people to lay hold on what they can of he flock and herd and to quicken they exertion i give they half of what they catch and how do you neighbor bear this in the mean time say the brahmin oh for that matter say the other he be not at all behindhand and i lose nearly as many cattle as i get but it give I much more pleasure to kill one of he buffalo or llama than it do pain I when he kill one of mine i consider how much it will vex he and that some of he vassal be thereby deprive of they sustenance i have upward of thirty strong man employ in range this plain and wood and during the last year they take for I four hundred head indeed -- and how many do you lose in the same time not above three hundred and eighty but very inferior say the brahmin why no reply he : as my pasture be richer and more luxuriant than he two of my cattle be worth perhaps three of he be this custom ask the brahmin a advantage or a tax on you estate a tax indeed why it be worth from four to five hundred head a-year and how much be it worth to you neighbor i presume nearly as much do you vassal get rich by the bounty you give they as to that matter some who be lucky succeed very well and the rest make a living by it and what do they give you for the privilege of hunting you neighbor 's cattle nothing at all : i even lose my customary rent from those who engage in it and it be the same case with you neighbor certainly say he then say the brahmin it seem to I if you would agree to lay aside this old custom you would both be considerable gainer i see you look incredulous but listen a moment each one would in that case instead of have half he neighbor 's cattle have all he own and be keep in they native pasture they would be less likely to stray away and you could therefore slay and eat as you want they whereas in you hunting match many more be either kill or maim than be want for present use and they be consequently consume in waste you would moreover be a gainer by the amount of the labor of these thirty boor whom you keep in this employment and who very probably acquire habit of ferocity licentiousness and waste which be not very favourable to they obedience or fidelity the proprietor have ponder a while upon my friend 's remark in a tone of exultation say -- do you think then i could ever prevail on my people to forbear when they see a likely flock from lay violent hand on it or could i resist so favourable a opportunity of revenge nay more if we be then tamely to tie up we hand do you think that bulderent and he man would consent to do the same no no old man he continue with great self-complacency you argument appear plausible at first but when closely consider they will not stand the lest of experience they be the fancy of a stranger -- of one who know more of theory than practice have you live longer among we you would have know that you ingenious project could never be carry into execution if i observe it bulderent would not and if he observe it i verily believe i could not -- and thus you see the thing be altogether impracticable as one soon tire of preach to the wind the brahmin contented himself with ask he new acquaintance to think more on the subject at he leisure and we proceed on we walk chapter x _ the traveller visit a gentleman farmer who be a great projector : he breed of cattle : he apparatus for cooking : he be take dangerously ill _ after we have go about half a mile farther we attention be arrest by a gate of very singular character it be extremely ingenious in its structure and among other peculiarity it have three or four latch for child for grown person for those who be tall and those who be short and for the right hand as well as the leave in the act of open it be make to crush certain berry and the oil they yield be carry by a small duct to the hinge which be thus make to turn easily and be prevent from creak while we be admire its mechanism a elderly man rather plainly dress on a zebra in low condition ride up and show that he be the owner of the mansion to which the gate belong and that he be not displeased with the curiosity we manifest we find he both intelligent and oblige he inform we that he be a experimental farmer and when he learn that we be stranger and anxious to inform ourselves of the state of agriculture in the country he very civilly invite we to take we next meal with he we walk have now make we hungry and fatigue we gladly accept of he hospitality whereupon he alight and walk with we to he lodgings he be very communicative of he mode of cultivation and management but chiefly pride himself on he success in improve the size of he cattle he inform we that he have devote sixteen year of he life to this object and have then in he farm-yard a buffalo nearly as heavy as three of the ordinary size he practice be to kill all the young animal which be not uncommonly large and thrifty to cram those he keep with as much food as they would eat and to tempt they appetite by the variety of they nourishment as well as of the mode of prepare it all this say he cost a great deal it be true but i be pay for it by the additional price i be strike with this notable triumph of industry and skill in the goodly art of husbandry -- that art which i venerate above every other and i be all anxiety to receive from he some instruction which i might in case i should have the good fortune to get safely back communicate to my friend on long-island who have never be able even to double the common size and who boast greatly of that : but a hesitate look and a few inquiry on the part of my sly friend check my enthusiasm have you always he ask have the same number of acre in grain and grass under you new and old system pretty nearly say the other my new breed however though fewer consume more than they predecessor how many head do you formerly sell in a year about thirty how many do you now sell though for some year i have not sell more than nine or ten i expect to exceed that number in another year which you expect will yield you more than the thirty do formerly certainly because such meat as mine command a extraordinary price so long reply the brahmin as this be novelty you may receive a part of the price which man be ever ready to pay for it but as soon as other profit by you example you meat fall to the ordinary rate and then if i understand you aright as you will have somewhat less in quantity than you formerly have you gross receipt will be less to say nothing of you additional labor and expense but who have the skill quickly rejoin the other of which i can boast and who would take the same trouble although they have the skill but stop here a moment say we host till i go to see how my last improved oil-cake be relish by my cattle the brahmin then turn to I say -- this gentleman may indeed improve he fortune by the business of a grazier but the same pain and unremitting attention would always be sure of a liberal reward though the system on which they be exert be not among the best nothing my dear atterley be more true than the say of you wise book -- _ that all flesh be grass _ and it always take the same quantity of one to make a give quantity of the other whether that give quantity may be in the form of a single individual or two or three but in the former case great labor be require to force nature beyond she ordinary limit and the same labor must be unceasingly keep up or she will certainly relapse to she original dimension this system may do as we host here tell we it actually do for the moon but it be not suit to we earth if however you be ambitious of a name among the speculative man of you country this little stone add he stoop and pick up a small stone from the ground will answer you purpose quite as well as any improvement in husbandry it be precisely of the same species as those which we throw over in we aerial voyage and which though correctly call moon-stone by the vulgar -lrb- who be oftener right than the learn suppose -rrb- some of the western philosopher declare to have be gravitate in the atmosphere and be this really the origin say i of that strange phenomenon which have furnish so much matter of speculation to the sage both of europe and america nothing be more true reply he these stone be common to the earth and to the moon and some of those which have be so carefully analyze by you most celebrated chemist and pronounce different from any known mineral production of the earth be small fragment of a very common rock in the mountain of burma in we first voyage we have take some of they with we as ballast and those which we first throw over we afterwards learn from the public journal fall in france some of the other fall in indium but the greater number in the ocean those which have fall at other time have be real fossil of the moon and either such stone as this i hold in my hand or such metallic substance as be repel from that body and attract towards the earth and it be the force with which they strike the earth which first suggest the idea of a thunder-bolt we party be greatly amuse at the disputation of a learn society in europe in which they undertake to give a mathematical demonstration that they could not be throw from a volcano of the earth nor from the moon but be suddenly form in the atmosphere i should as soon believe that a loaf of bread could be make and baked in the atmosphere finding that we landlord pride himself on he interior management as well as on that without door we express a wish to see some of he household improvement he readily consent and conduct we at once into he kitchen and show we invention and contrivance out of number for save fuel and meat and labor in short for save every thing but money the large room into which he carry we appear as a vast laboratory from the infinite variety of pot pan skillet knife fork ladle mortar sieve funnel and other utensil of metal glass pottery and wood the steam which he use for cooking be carry along a pipe under a succession of kettle and boiler descend in regular gradation by which a great saving of fuel be effect and to perfect this part of the apparatus the pipe could be remove to give place to one of the size suit to the occasion he seven-guest pipe be now in use the wood which be all cut to the same length and channel out to admit the free passage of the air be then duly place in the stove and set on fire but the heat not pass very readily through all the sinuosity of the pipe he order he head cook to screw on he exhauster the man in less than ten minute unscrew a plate at the farther end and fix on a air-pump make for the purpose on which the door of the stove suddenly slam to we host see the accident and hurry to open the stove fall over a heap of channelled log and cut a gash in he forehead the cook run to help he up and after he be on he leg and he forehead wipe the stove be open when the fire which have be deprive of its aliment be entirely extinguish i think he be hardly sorry for the accident as it afford he a occasion of show how ingeniously he kindle a fire he have a electric machine bring to he by means of which he set fire to a few grain of gunpowder this light some tinder which again ignite spirit whose blaze reach the lower extremity of he lamp take the precaution of keep the stove open this time the air be again exhaust at the farther end of the pipe and in a little time the flame be see to ascend even to the air-pump and to scorch the part make of wood whereupon i see a glow of triumph on he face which amply compensate he for he wound and vexation there be a grand machine for roast that carry the fire round the meat the juice of which he say by a rotary motion would be throw to the surface and either evaporate or be deteriorate here be also he digestor for make soup of ram ' horn which he assure I contain a good deal of nourishment and the only difficulty be in extract it he next show we he smoke-retractor which receive the smoke near the top of the chimney and bring it down to be burn over again by which he compute that he save five cord and a half of wood in a year the fire which dress he victuals pump up by means of a steam engine water for the kitchen turn one or more spit as well as two or three mill for grind pepper salt & c and then by a spindle through the wall work a churn in the dairy and clean the knife : the fork indeed be still clean by hand but he say he do not despair of effect this operation in time by machinery i mention to he we contrivance of silver fork to lessen this labor but he coldly remark that he imagine science be in its infancy with we he inform we that he have be ten year in complete this ingenious machine and certainly when it be in full operation i never see exultation and delight so strongly depict in any human face the various sound and sight that meet the ear and eye in rapid succession still farther work on he feeling and heighten he rapture there be such a simmer and hiss and bubble of boil and broil and fry -- such a whirling and jerking and creaking of wheel and crank and piston -- such cloud of steam and vapor and even smoke notwithstanding all of the latter that be burn -- that i almost think myself in some great manufactory after have suffer as much as we could well bear from the heat and confine air of this laboratory of eatables and pass the proper number of compliment on the skill and ingenuity they display we ascend to he hall to partake of that feast to prepare which we have see all the element and the mechanical power call into action there be a few of he city acquaintance present besides ourselves : but whether it be owe to the effect of the steam from the dish on we stomach or that this scientific cookery be not suit to we unpractised palate i know not but we all make a indifferent repast except we host who taste every dish and seem to relish they all after sit some time at table conversing on the progress of science its splendid achievement and the please prospects which it yet dimly show in the future we hospitable entertainer perceive we be fatigue with the labor of the day invite we to take we next _ lallanea _ or sleep with he for which hospitality we feel very grateful we be then show to a room in which there be mark of the same fertile invention in save labor and promote convenience but we be too sleepy to take much notice of they we bed be fill with air which be quite as good as feather except that when the leather cover get a hole in it from rip or other accident it lose its elasticity with its air -- a accident which happen to I this very night for a mouse have gnaw the leather where the housemaid 's greasy finger have leave a mark i sink gently down not to soft repose but on the hard plank where i uncomfortably lay until the bell warn we to rise for breakfast as soon as i be dress i walk out into a large garden and as the sun be not yet so high as to make it sultry be enjoy the balmy sweetness of the air and the flowering shrub which in beauty and fragrance almost exceed those of indium when i see a servant run by the garden wall enter the stable and bring out a zebra on inquire the cause i be make to understand that we noble host be take suddenly ill i immediately return to the house and find the domestic run to and fro and manifest the greatest anxiety as well as hurry in they look i go into the brahmin 's room and find he dress he go out and after some time inform I that we kind host have a violent _ cholera morbus _ in consequence of the various kind of food with which he have overload he stomach at dinner that he consider himself near he last end and be endeavor to arrange he affair for the event i could not help meditate on the melancholy uncertainty of human life when i contrast the comfort the pleasure the pride of conscious usefulness and genius feel by this gentleman a short time since with the agony which that try and bitter hour bring to the stoutest and most callous heart -- when it must quit this state of be for another of which it know so little and over which fear and doubt throw a gloom that hope can not entirely dispel chapter xi _ lunarian physician : they consultation -- while they dispute the patient recover -- the traveller visit the celebrated teacher lozzus pozzi _ while i indulged in these sad meditation and feel for my host while i feel no less for myself i see the physician approach who have be send for he be a tall thin man with a quick step a lively piercing eye a sallow complexion and very courteous manners and always willing to display the ready flow of word for which he be remarkable i feel great curiosity to witness the skill of this lunar aesculapius and he be evidently please with the interest i manifest it turn out that he be well acquaint with the brahmin and learning from the latter my wish he conduct I into the room of we sick host we find he lie on a straw bed and strangely alter within a few hour the physician after feel he pulse -lrb- which as every country have its peculiar custom be do here about the temple and neck instead of the wrist -rrb- -- after examine he tongue he tooth he water and fece propose bleed we all walk to the door and venture to oppose the doctor 's prescription suggest that the copious evacuation he have already experience might make bleeding useless if not dangerous how little like a man of sense you speak say the other how readily you have chime in with the prejudice of the vulgar i should have expect better thing from you : but the sway of empiricism be destine yet to have a long struggle before it receive its final overthrow i have attack it with success in many quarter but when it have be prostrate in one place it soon rise up in another have you my good friend see my last essay on morbid action the brahmin reply that he have not yet have a opportunity of meeting with it i be sorry you have not say the other i have there completely demonstrate that disease be a unit and that it be the extreme of folly to divide disease into class which tend but to produce confusion of idea and a unscientific practice sir continue he in a more animated tone there be a beautiful simplicity in this theory which give we assurance of its conformity to nature and truth it need but to be see to be understand -- but to be understand to be approve and carry into successful operation the brahmin ask he if this unit do not present different symptom on different occasion certainly he reply : from too much or too little action in this set of vessel or that it be differently modify and must be treat accordingly this unit then say my friend assume different form and require various remedy be there not then a convenience in separate these modification -lrb- or _ form _ if you prefer it -rrb- from one another by different name stop my friend you do not apprehend the matter i will explain at this moment two other gentleman of a grave aspect and demeanor enter the room they also be physician of great reputation in the city they appear to be formal and reserved towards one another but they each manifest still more shyness and coldness towards the learn shuro they enter the sick chamber and have inform themselves of the state of the patient all three withdraw to a consultation they have not be long together before they voice grow from a whisper so loud that we could distinctly hear all they say sir say dr shakrack the patient be in a state of direct debility : we must stimulate if we would restore a healthy action pour in the _ stimulantium _ and _ irritentia _ and my life for it the patient be save will you listen to I for one moment say dr dridrano the youngest of the three gentleman it may be presumption for one of my humble pretension to set myself in opposition to person of you age experience and celebrity but i be bind by the sacred duty of the high function i have undertake to perform to use my poor ability in such a way as i can to advance the noble science of medicine and in so do to give strength to the weak courage to the dishearten and comfort to the afflict gentleman i say i hope if my simple view should be find widely different from yours you will not impute it to a presumption which be as foreign to my nature as it would be unsuited to you merit i consider the human body a mere machine whose part be complicate whose function be various and whose operation be liable to be impede and frustrate by a variety of obstacle there be you know one set of tube or vessel for the blood another for the lymph another for the sweat and so on now although each of these fluid have its several channel yet if by any accident any one of they be obstruct and there be so great a accumulation of the obstruct fluid that it can not find vent by its natural channel or duct then you must carry off the redundancy by some other for you well know that that which can be carry off by one can be carry off by all gentleman i beg you not to turn away hear I for a moment then if the current of the blood be obstruct i make large draught of urine or sweat or saliva or of the liquor amnius and i find it matter little which of these evacuant i resort to this system to which with deference to you longer experience i have have the honor of give some celebrity in morosofium explain how it be that such various remedy for the same disease have be in vogue at different time they have all have in town able advocate i could adduce undeniable testimonial of they efficacy because in fact they be all efficacious and it seem to I a mere matter of earthshine whether we resort to one or the other mode of restore the equilibrium of the human machine all that we have to do be to know when and to what extent it be proper to use either determine then gentleman -- you for whose maturer judgment and year i feel profound respect -- whether we shall blister or sweat or bleed or salivate dr shuro who have manifest he impatience at this long harangue by frequent interruption and which dridrano 's show of deference could scarcely keep down hastily reply : you have manifestly take the hint of you theory from I and because i have advance the doctrine that disease be a unit you come forward now and insist that remedy be a unit too you do I great honor learn sir say dridrano surely it would be very unbecoming in one of my age and stand to set up a theory in opposition to yours but it would be yet more discreditable to be a plagiarist and with all due respect for you superior wisdom it do seem to my feeble intellect that no two theory can be more different you use several remedy for one disease : i admit several disease and use one remedy and do not darkness remind we of light reply shuro by the contrast heat of cold -- north of south gentleman then say shakrack who have be walk to and fro during the precede controversy as you seem to agree so ill with each other i trust you will unite in adopt my course let we begin with this cordial we will then vary the stimulus if necessary by means of the elixir and you will see the salutary effect immediately a loss of blood would still farther increase the debility of the patient and i appeal to you candor dr shuro whether you ever practice venesection in such a case in such a case ay in what _ you _ would call much worse i be not long since call in to a man in a dropsy i open a vein he seem from that moment to feel relief and he so far recover that after a short time i bleed he again i return the next day and have i arrive half a hour sooner i should have bleed he a third time and in all human probability have save he life if you have stimulate he you might have have a opportunity of make you favorite experiment a little oftener say shakrack you be facetious sir i imagine you have be use you own panacea somewhat too freely to-day not so say he opponent angrily but if you be not more guard in you expression i shall make use of yours in a way you will not like upon which they proceed to blow dridrano all the while bellowing i beg my worthy senior for the honor of science that you will forbear the noise of the dispute have wake the patient who learn the cause of the disturbance calmly beg they would give themselves no concern about he but let he die in peace the domestic who have be for some time listen to the dispute on hear the scuffle run in and part the angry combatant who like a abscess just lance be give vent to all the malignant humor that have be so long silently gather in the mean while the smooth and considerate dr dridrano stept into the sick room with the view of offer a apology for the unmannerly conduct of he brethren and of tender he single service as the other sage of the healing art could not agree in the course to be pursue when he find that the patient profit by the simple remedy of the brahmin and a hour 's rest have be so much refresh that he consider himself out of danger and that he have no need of medical assistance or at any rate he be unwilling to follow the prescription of one physician which another if not two other unhesitatingly condemn each one then receive he fee and hurry home to publish he own statement of the case in a pamphlet the brahmin who have never leave the sick man 's couch during he sleep now that he be out of danger be greatly divert at the dispute but he good-naturedly add that notwithstanding the ridiculous figure they have that day make they be all man of genius and ability but have do they part injustice by they vanity and the ambition of originate a new theory with all the extravagance say he to which they push they several system they be not unsuccessful in practice for habitual caution and a instinctive regard for human life which they never can extinguish check they in carry they hypothesis into execution : and if i might venture to give a opinion on a subject of which i know so little and there be so much to be know i would say that the most common error of theorist be to consider man as a machine rather than a animal and subject to one set of the law of matter rather than as subject to they all thus he continue we have be regard by one class of theorist as a hydraulic engine compose of various tube fit with they several fluid the law and function of which have be deduce from calculation of velocity altitude diameter friction & c another class consider man as a mere chemical engine and he stomach as a alembic the doctrine of affinity attraction and repulsion now have full play then come the notion of sympathy and antipathy by which name unknown and unknowable cause be seek to be explain and ignorance be cunningly veil in mystery but the science will never be in the right tract of improvement until we consider conjointly the mechanical operation of the fluid the chemical agency of the substance take into the stomach and the animal function of digestion secretion and absorption as evince by actual observation i tell he that i believe that be now the course which be actually pursue in the best medical school both of europe and america we worthy host though very feeble have so far recover as to dress himself and receive the congratulation of he household who have all manifest a concern for he situation that be at once creditable to he and themselves express we gratitude for he kind attention and promise to renew we visit if we could we bid he adieu we take a different road home from the way we have come and have not walk far before we meet a number of small boy each have a bag on he back as large as he could stagger under surprise at see child of they tender year thus prematurely put to severe labor i be about to rail at the absurd custom of this strange country when my friend check I for my hasty judgment and tell I that these boy be on they way to school after they usual monthly holiday we attend they to they schoolhouse which stand in sight on the side of a steep chalky hill the brahmin tell I that the teacher 's name be lozzi pozzus and that he have acquire great celebrity by he system of instruction when the boy open they bag i find that instead of book and provision as i have expect they be fill with stick which they tell we constitute the arithmetical lesson they be require to practice at home these stick be of different length and dimension accord to the number mark on they so that by look at the inscription you could tell the size or by see or feel the size you could tell the number the master now make he appearance and learn we errand be very communicative he descant on the advantage of this manual and ocular mode of teach the science of number and give we practical illustration of its efficacy by examine he pupil in we presence he tell the first boy he call up and who do not seem to be more than seven or eight year of age to add 5 3 and 7 together and tell he the result the little fellow set about hunting with great alacrity over he bag until he find a piece divide like three finger then a piece with five division and lastly one with seven and put they side by side he find the piece of a correspondent length and thus in less than eight minute and a half answer fifteen the ingenious master then exercise another boy in subtraction and a third in multiplication : but the latter be throw into great confusion for one of the piece have lose a division it lead he to a wrong result the teacher inform we that he teach geometry in the same way and have even extend it to grammar logic rhetoric and the art of composition the rule of syntax be discover by piece of wood interlock with each other in square dovetail & c after the manner of geographical card and as they chance to fit together so be the concordance between the several part of speech ascertain the machine for composition occupy a large space different set of synonyme be arrange in compartment of various size when the subject be familiar a short piece be use when it be stately or heroic then the longest slip that could be find be resort to those that be round at the end be mellifluous the jagged one be harsh the thick piece express force and vigor where the curve correspond at one end they serve for alliteration and when at the other they answer for rhyme by way of prove its progress he show we a composition by a man who be deaf and dumb in praise of morosofium who merely by the use of he eye and hand have make a ingenious and high-sounding piece of eloquence though i confess that the sense be somewhat obscure we go away fill with admiration for the great lozzi pozzus 's invention have understand that there be a academy in the neighborhood in which youth of maturer year be instruct in the fine art we be induce to visit it but there be a vacation at that time we could see neither the professor nor student and consequently could gain little information of the course of discipline and instruction pursue there we be however conduct to a small _ menagerie _ attach to the institution by its keeper where the habit and accomplishment of the animal bear strong testimony in favor of the diligence and skill of they teacher we there see two game-cock which so far from fight -lrb- though they have be select from the most approved breed -rrb- bill and coo like turtle-dove there be a large zebra apparently ill-tempered which show he anger by run at and but every animal that come in he way two half-grown llama which be naturally as quiet and timid as sheep bit each other very furiously until they foam at the mouth and lastly a large mastiff make he appearance walk in a slow measure gait with a sleek tortoise-shell cat on he back and she in turn be surmount by a mouse which form the apex of this singular pyramid the keeper remark we unaffected surprise at the exhibition ask we if we could now doubt the unlimited force of education after such a display of the triumph of art over nature while he be speak the mastiff be jostle by the two llama still awkwardly worry each other turn round so suddenly that the mouse be dislodge from he lofty position and throw to the ground on see which the cat immediately spring upon it with a loud purr noise which be hear by the dog he with a fierce growl suddenly seize the cat the llama alarm at this terrific sound instinctively run off and have in they flight approach the heel of the zebra he give a kick which kill one of they on the spot the keeper who be deeply mortified at see the fabric he have raise with such indefatigable labor overturn in a moment protest that nothing of the sort have ever happen before to which we reply by way of consolation that perhaps the same thing might never happen again and that while he art have achieve a conquest over nature this be only a slight rebellion of nature against art we then thank he for he politeness and take we leave chapter xii _ election of the numnoonce or town-constable -- violence of party -- singular institution of the syringe boy -- the prize-fighter -- domestic manufacture _ when we get back to the city we find a unusual stir and bustle among the citizen and on inquire the cause we understand they be about to elect the town-constable after take some refreshment at we lodgings where we be very kindly receive we again go out and be hurry along with the crowd to a large building near the center of the city the multitude be shout and halloo with great vehemence the brahmin remark a elderly man who seem very quiet in the midst of all this ferment he think he a proper person to address for information i suppose say he from the violence of these partisan they be on different side in religion or politics not at all say the other those difference be forget at the present and the ground of the dispute be that one of the candidate be tall and the other be short -- one have a large foretop and the other be bald oh i forget one have be a schoolmaster and the other a butcher curiosity now prompt I to enter into the thickest of the throng and i have never see such fury in the maddest contest between old george clinton and mr jay or de witt clinton and governor tompkin in my native state they each reproach they adversary in the coarsest language and attribute to they the vilest principle and motive we guide farther tell we that the same person with two other have be candidate last year when the schoolmaster prevail and as the supporter of the other two unsuccessful candidate have to choose now between the remain two each party be perpetually reproach the other with inconsistency a dialogue between two individual of opposite side which we happen to hear will serve as a specimen of the rest be you not a pretty fellow to vote for bald-head whom you have so often call rogue and blockhead it become you to talk of consistency indeed pray sir how do it happen that you be now against he when you be so lately swear friend and use to eat out of the same dish yes but i be the butcher 's friend too i never abuse he you 'll never catch I support a man i have once abused but i catch you abuse the man you once support which be rather worse the difference between we be this : -- you profess to be friendly to both i profess to be hostile to both : you stick to one of you friend and cast the other off and i act the same towards my enemy a crowd then rush by cry huzza for the butcher 's knife damn pen and ink -- damn the book and all that read in they butcher ' knife and beef for ever we ask we guide what these man be to gain by the issue of the contest nineteenth of they nothing but a few hope to be make deputy if they candidate succeed and they therefore egg on the rest we draw near to the scaffold where the candidate stand and we ear be deafen with the mingled shout and exclamation of praise and reproach you cheat the corporation say one you kill two black sheep say another you can not read a warrant you let dondon cheat you you try to cheat nincan you want to build a watch-house you have a old ewe at home now that you do not come honestly by you deny you own hand -- with other ribaldry still more gross and indecent but the most singular part of the scene be a number of little boy dress in black and white who all wear badge of the party to which they belong and be provide with a syringe and two canteen one fill with rose-water and the other with a black liquid of a very offensive smell the first of which they squirt at they favorite candidate and voter and the last on those of the opposite party they be draw up in a line and seem to be under regular discipline for whenever the captain of the band give the word viltus mindoc they discharge the dirty liquid from they syringe and when he say viltus goulgoul they fill the air with perfume that be so overpowering as sometimes to produce sickness the little fellow would between while as if to keep they hand in use the black squirt against one another but they often give they a dash of the rose-water at the same time i wonder to see man submit to such indignity but be tell that the custom have the sanction of time that these boy be bring up in the church and be regularly train to this business besides add my informer the custom be not without its use for it point out the candidate at once to a stranger and especially he who be successful those be always the most blacken who be the most popular but it be amusing to see the ludicrous figure that the candidate and some of the voter make if you come near they on one side they be like rose drip with the morning dew but on the other they be as black as chimney sweep and more offensive than street scavenger as these syringe boy or goulmin be thus protect by custom the person assail affect to despise they but i could ever and anon see some of the most active partisan clap they on the back and say well do my little fellow give it to they again you shall have a ginger-cake -- and you shall have a new cap & c surely think i we custom of praise and abuse we public man in the newspaper be far more rational than this after the novelty of the scene be over i become wearied and disgusted with they coarseness violence and want of decency and we leave they without wait to see the result of the contest in return to we lodgings the brahmin take I along a quarter of the town in which i have never before be in a little while we come to a lofty building before the gate of which a great crowd be assemble this say my companion be one of the court of justice anxious to see they mode of proceeding in court i push through the crowd follow by the brahmin and on enter the building find myself in a spacious amphitheatre in the middle of which i beheld with surprise several man engage hand to hand in single combat on ask a explanation of my friend he inform I that these contest be favorite mode of settle private dispute in morosofium : that the prize-fighter i see hire themselves to any one who conceive himself injure in person character or property it seem a strange mode of settle legal dispute i remark which determine a question in favor of a party accord to the strength and wind of he champion nor be that all say the brahmin as the judge assign the victory accord to certain rule and precedent the reason of which be know only to themselves if know at all and which be often sufficiently whimsical -- as sometimes a small scratch in the head avail more than a disable blow in the body the blow too must be give in the right time as well as in the right place or they pass for nothing in short of all those spectator who be present to witness the power and address of the prize-fighter not one in a hundred can tell who have gain the victory until the judge have proclaim it i presume say i that the champion who thus expose they person and life in the cause of another be glonglim there say he you be altogether mistake in the first place the prize-fighter seldom sustain serious injury they weapon do not endanger life and as each one know that he adversary be merely follow he vocation they often fight without animosity after the contest be over you may commonly see the combatant walk and talk very sociably together : but as this circumstance make they a little suspect by the public they affect the greater rage when in conflict and occasionally quarrel and fight in downright earnest no he continue i be tell it be a very rare thing to see one of these prize-fighter who be a glonglim but most of they employer belong to this unhappy race on look more attentively i perceive many of these being among the spectator show by they gesture the greatest anxiety for the issue of the contest they each carry a scrip or bag the contents of which they ever and anon give to they respective champion whose wind it be remark be very apt to fail unless thus assist have learn some farther particulars respect this singular mode of litigation which would be uninteresting to the general reader i take my leave not without secretly congratulating myself on the more rational mode in which justice be administer on earth when we have nearly reach we lodgings we hear a violent altercation in the house and on enter we find we landlord and he wife engage in a dispute respect they domestic economy and they both make earnest appeal to my companion for the correctness of they respective opinion the old man be in favor of they child make they own shoe and clothes and he wife insist that it would be better for they to stick to they garden and dairy with the proceeds of which they could purchase what they want she assert that they could readily sell all the fruit and vegetable they could raise and that whilst they would acquire greater skill by a undivided attention to one thing they who follow the business of tailor shoemaker and seamstress would in like manner become more skilful in they employment and consequently be able to work at a cheaper rate she farther add that spin and sew be unhealthy occupation they would give the girl the habit of stoop which would spoil they shape and that they thought would be more likely to be run on idle and dangerous fancy when sit at they needle than when engage in more active occupation this dame be a very fluent ready-witted woman and she speak with the confidence that consciousness of the power of disputation commonly inspire she go on enlarge on the mischief of the practice she condemn and by insensible gradation so magnify they that at last she clearly make out that there be no surer way of render they daughter sickly deform vicious and unchaste than to set they about make they own clothes after she have cease -lrb- which she do under a persuasion that she have anticipate and refute every argument that could be urge in opposition to she doctrine -rrb- the husband with a emotion of anger that he could not conceal begin to defend he opinion he say as to the greater economy of he plan there could be no doubt for although they might at particular time make more by gardening than they could save by spin or sew yet there be other time when they could not till the ground and when of course if they do not sew or spin they would be idle but if they do work the proceeds would be clear gain he say he do not wish he daughter to be constantly employ in make clothes nor be it necessary that they should be a variety of other occupation equally indispensable claim they attention and would leave but a comparatively small portion of time for needlework : that in thus provide themselves with employment at home they at least save the time of go backwards and forwards and be spare some trip to market for the sale of vegetable to pay as would then be necessary for the work do by other besides the tailor who be most convenient to they and who it be admit be a very good one be insolent and capricious would sometimes extort extravagant price or turn they into ridicule and occasionally go so far as to set he water-dog upon they of which he keep a great number he declare that for he part he would incur a little more expense rather than he would be so impose upon and subject to so much indignity and vexation he deny that sew would affect he daughter ' health unless perhaps they follow it exclusively as a occupation but as they would have it in they power to consult they inclination and convenience in this matter they might take it up when the occasion require and lay it down whenever they find it irksome or fatiguing : that as they themselves be incline to follow this course it be a plain proof that the occupation be not unhealthy he maintain that they would stoop just as much in gardening and wash and nurse they child as in sewing and that we be not such frail or unpliant machine as to be seriously injured unless we persist in one set of straight formal notion but that we be adapt to variety and be benefit by it that as to the practice be favourable to wantonness and vice while he admit that idleness be productive of these effect he could not see how one occupation encourage they more than another that the tailor for example whom he have be speak of though purse-proud overbearing and rapacious be not more immoral or depraved than he neighbor and have probably less of the libertine than most of they he admit that evil thought would enter the mind in any situation and could not reasonably be expect to be keep out of he daughter ' head -lrb- be as he say but woman -rrb- : yet he conceive such a result as far less probable if they be suffer to ramble about in the street and to chaffer with they customer than if they be keep to sedate and diligent employment at home have with great warmth and earnestness use these argument he conclude by plainly hint to he wife that she have always be the apologist of the tailor in all they dispute and that she could not be so obstinately blind to the irrefragable reasoning he have urge if she be not influence by she old hankering after this fellow and do not consult he interest in preference to those of she own family upon this remark the old woman take fire and in spite of we presence they both have recourse to direct and the coarsest abuse the brahmin do not as i expect join I in laugh at the scene we have just witness but after some musing observe : there be much truth in what each of these party say i blame they only for the course they take towards each other they dispute be in fact of a most frivolous and unmeaning character for if the father be to carry he point the girl would occasionally sell the production of they garden and pay for make they clothes or even buy they ready make be the mother on the other hand to prevail they would still occasionally use they needle and exercise they taste and skill in sew spin knitting and the like nay add he if you have not be so much engross with this angry and indecorous altercation you might have see two of they at they needle in a adjoining apartment while one be busy at work in the garden and another up to the elbow in the soap-suds -- all so closely engage in they several pursuit that they hardly seem to know they be the subject of discussion i tell the brahmin that a dispute not unlike this have take place in my own country a few year since some of we politician contend that agricultural labor be most conducive to the national wealth whilst other maintain that manufacture industry be equally advantageous wherever it be voluntarily pursue -- but that the controversy have lately assume a different character -- the question now be not whether manufacture be as beneficial as agriculture but whether they deserve extraordinary encouragement by tax those who do not give they a preference that be say the brahmin as if we landlady by way of induce she daughter to give up gardening for spin be to tell they if they do not find they new occupation as profitable as the old she would more than make up the difference out of she own pocket which though it might suit the daughter very well would be a lose business to the family chapter xiii _ description of the happy valley -- the law custom and manners of the okalbian -- theory of population -- rent -- system of government _ the brahmin who be desirous of show I what be most remarkable in this country during the short time we intend to stay think this a favourable time to visit okalbium or the happy valley the okalbian be a tribe or nation who live separate from the rest of the lunar world and whose wise government prudence industry and integrity be very highly extol by all though by what i can learn they have few imitator they dwell about three hundred mile north of the city of alamatua in a fertile valley which they obtain by purchase about two hundred year since and which be about equal to twenty mile square that be to four hundred square mile a carriage and four well-broke dog be procure for we and we soon reach the foot of the mountain that enclose the fortunate valley in about fifty-two hour we then ascend for about three mile with far fatigue than i formerly experience in climb the catskill mountain of my native state and find ourselves on the summit of a extensive ridge which form the margin of a vast elliptical basin the bottom of which present a most beautiful landscape the whole surface be like a garden intersperse with patch of wood clump of tree and house stand singly or in groupe a lake about a mile across receive several small stream and on its edge be a town contain about a thousand house after enjoy the beauty of the scene for some minute we descend by a rough wind road and enter this lunar paradise in about four hour along the side of the highway we travel be plant row of tree not unlike we sycamore which afford a refreshing shade to the traveller and commonly a rivulet run bubble along one side or the other of the road after journey about eight mile we enter a neat well build town which contain as we be inform about fifteen thousand inhabitant the brahmin inform I that in a time of religious fervor about two century ago a charter be grant to the founder of a new sect the volbin who have chance to make convert of some of the lead man in morosofium authorise he and he follower to purchase this valley of the hunting tribe to whom it belong and to govern themselves by they own law they find no difficulty in make the purchase it be then use as a mere hunting ground no one liking to settle in a place that seem shut out from the rest of the world at first the new settler divide the land equally among all the inhabitant one of they tenet be that as there be no difference of person in the next world there should be no difference in share the good thing of this they try at first to preserve this equality but find it impracticable they abandon it it be say that after about thirty year by reason of a difference in they industry and frugality and of some family spend less than they make and some more the number of land owner be reduce to four hundred and that fifty of these hold one half of the whole since which time the number of land proprietor have decline with the population though not in the same proportion as the soil be remarkably fertile the climate healthy and the people temperate and industrious they multiply very rapidly until they reach they present number which have be long stationary and amount to 150000 that be about four hundred to a square mile of these more than one half live in town and village contain from one hundred to a thousand house they have little or no commerce with any other people the valley produce every vegetable production and the mountain every mineral which they require and in fact they have no foreign intercourse whatever except when they visit or be visit from curiosity though they have be occasionally bully and threaten by lawless and overbearing neighbor yet as they can be approach by only a single gorge in the mountain which be always well garrison -lrb- and they present no sufficient object to ambition to compensate for the scandal of invade so inoffensive and virtuous a people -rrb- they have never yet be engage in war i feel very anxious to know how it be that they number do not increase as they be exempt from all pestilential disease and live in such abundance that a beggar by trade have never be know among they and be remarkable for they moral habit let we inquire at the fountain-head say the brahmin and we go to see the chief magistrate who receive we in a style of unaffected frankness which in a moment put we at we ease after we have explain to he who we be and answer such inquiry as he choose to make : sir say i through the brahmin who act as interpreter i have hear much of you country and i find on see it that it exceed report in the order comfort contentment and abundance of the people but i be puzzle to find out how it be that you number do not increase i presume you marry late in life on the contrary say he every young man marry as soon as he receive he education and be capable of manage the concern of a family some be thus qualify sooner and some later some occasionally migrate then never a number of we young man indeed visit foreign country but not one in a hundred settle abroad how then do you associate continue stationary nothing be more easy no man have a larger family than he land or labor can support in comfort and as long as that be the case with every individual it must continue to be the case with the whole community we leave the matter to individual discretion the prudential caution which be thus indicate have be teach we by we own experience we have go on increase under the encouraging influence of a mild system of law genial climate and fruitful soil until about a century ago we find that we number be greater than we country abundant as it be could comfortably support and we season be unfavourable for two successive year many of we citizen be oblige to banish themselves from okalbium and they education not fitting they for a different state of society they suffer severely both in they comfort and moral it be now a primary moral duty enforce by all we juvenile instructor with every citizen to adapt he family to he means and thus a regard which each individual have for he offspring be the salvation of the state and can these prudential restraint be generally practice what a virtuous people love for one another bring the two sex together -- love for they offspring make they separate i see say the magistrate smile you be under a error no separation take place and none be necessary how then be i to believe you be to believe nothing say he with calm dignity which be incompatible with virtue and propriety i see that the most important of all science -- that one on which the well-being and improvement of society mainly depend -- be in its infancy with you but whenever you become as populous as we be and unite the knowledge of real happiness with the practice of virtue you will understand it it be one of we maxim that heaven give wisdom to man in such portion as he situation require it and no doubt it be the same with the people of you earth i do not after this push my inquiry farther but remark aside to the brahmin -- i would give a good deal to know this secret provide it would suit we planet it be already know there reply he and have be long practice by many in the east : but in the present state of society with you it might do more harm than good to be make public by remove one of the check of licentiousness where woman be so unrestrained as they be with you change now the subject i venture to inquire how they employ they leisure hour and whether many do not experience here a wearisome sameness and a feeling of confinement and restraint it be true say the magistrate man require variety but i would not have you suppose he can not find it here he may cultivate he land improve he mind educate he child these be he serious occupation afford every day some employment that be at once new and interesting : and by way of relaxation he have music painting and sculpture sailing ride conversation storytelling and read the news of what be pass both in the valley and out of it i ask if they have newspaper he answer in the affirmative and add that they contain minute detail of the birth death marriage accident state of the weather and crop arbitration public festival invention original poetry and prose composition in addition to which they have about fifty of they most promising young man travel abroad who make observation on all that be remarkable in the country they pass through which they regularly transmit once a month to okalbium i inquire if they travel at the public expense or they own they always pursue some profession or trade by the profit of which they support themselves we have nothing but intellect and ingenuity to export for though we country produce every thing there be no commodity that we can so well spare they talent find they employment every where and the necessity they be under of a laborious exertion of these talent and of submit to a great deal from those whose custom and manners be not to they taste and whom they feel inferior to themselves be a considerable check to the desire to go abroad so much so that we hold out the farther inducement of political distinction when they return what then you have ambition among you certainly we institution have only temper it and not vainly endeavor to extinguish it and we find it employment in this way : of we youthful traveller those who be most diligent in they vocation who give the most useful information and communicate it in the happiest manner be make magistrate on they return and sometimes have statue decree to they besides the name which they conduct or talent procure they abroad be echo back to the valley long before they return and have much influence in the general estimate of they character but have you not many more competitor than you have public office there be without doubt many who desire office but to manifest they wish would be one of the surest means of defeat it we require modesty -lrb- at least in appearance -rrb- moderation and disinterestedness and of course the less pain a candidate take to show himself off the better but have they no friend who can at once render they this service and relieve they from the odium of it there be indeed somewhat of this but you must remember that the highest of we magistrate have comparatively little power he have no army no treasury no patronage he merely execute the law but as a farther check on the immoderate zeal of friend the expense of do this as well as of maintain he in office be defray by those who vote for he there seem at first view but little justice in this regulation but we think that as every one can not have he way those who carry they point and have the power should also bear the burden : besides in this way the voice of the most generous and disinterested prevail we have he add find this the most difficult part of we government we once think that the very lively interest excite in the electioneer contest particularly for that of gompoo or chief magistrate be to be ascribe to the power he possess and we resort to various expedient to lessen it -- such as divide it among a greater number -- require a quick rotation of office -- abridge the power themselves : but we discover that however small the power the distinction it give to those who possess it be always a object of lively interest with the ambitious and indeed with the public in general we have therefore enlarged the power and the term of hold it and make he who would attain it purchase it by previous exertion and self-denial : and we farther compel those who favor he to lose as well as gain we array the love of money against the love of power or rather one love of power to another moreover as it be only by the civic virtue that we citizen recommend themselves to popular favor there be nothing of that enthusiasm which military success excite among the native we washington then present himself to my mind and for a moment i begin to question he claim to the unexampled honor bestow on he by he countryman until i recollected that he be as distinguish by he respect for the law and he sound view of national policy as for he military service i then inquire into the occupation and condition of those who be without land and be tell that they be either cultivator of the soil or practice some liberal or mechanical art and partly owe to the education they receive and partly from the active competition that exist among they they be skilful diligent and honest now and then there be some exception accord to the proverb that _ in the best field of grain there will be some bad ear _ the land-owner sometimes cultivate the soil with they own hand -- sometimes with hire labourer -- and sometimes they rent they for about a third of they produce the smallest proprietor commonly adopt the first course the middling the second and the great landholder the third but i think say i that all the land in the valley be of equal fertility so it be but what have that to do with rent sir say i we ablest writer on this subject have lately discover that there can be no rent where there be not a gradation of soil such as exist in every country of the earth i see not say he what could have lead they into that error it be true if there be inferior land there would be a difference of rent in proportion to the difference of fertility and if it be so poor as merely to repay the expense of cultivation it would yield no rent at all but surely if one man make as much as several consume -lrb- and this he can easily do with we -rrb- he will be able to get much of they labor in exchange for this surplus which be so indispensable to they and to get more and more until the greatest number have come into existence which such surplus can support what they thus give if the proprietor retain the land himself you may regard as the extraordinary profit of agricultural labor or rent if pay to any one to whom he transfer this benefit this be precisely we present situation there be no deny this statement of fact : but i could not help exclaim -- surely there be nothing certain in the universe or rather truth be one thing in the moon and another thing on the earth chapter xiv _ farther account of okalbium -- the field of rose -- curious superstition concern that flower -- the pleasure of smell trace to association by a glonglim philosopher _ though i feel some reluctance to abuse the patience of this polite and intelligent magistrate i could not help make some inquiry about the jurisprudence of he country and first what be they system of punishment we have no capital punishment say he for from all we learn it be not more efficacious in prevent crime than other punishment which be milder and we prefer make the example to offender a lasting one but we endeavor to prevent offence not so much by punishment as by education and the few crime commit among we bring certain censure on those who have the early instruction of the criminal murder be very rare with we theft and robbery perhaps still more so we ordinary dispute about property be commonly settle by arbitration where as well as in court each party be permit to state he case to examine what witness and to ask what question he please you do not say i examine witness who be interested why not the judge even examine the party themselves i then tell he that the smallest direct interest in the issue of the controversy disqualify a witness with we from the strong bias it create to misrepresent fact and even to misconceive they he reply with a smile -- it seem to I that you extreme fear of hearing falsehood must often prevent you from ascertain the truth it be true that wherever the interest of a witness be involve it have a immediate tendency to make he misstate fact : but so would personal ill-will -- so would he sympathy -- so would any strong feeling what then be you course in these case i tell he that these objection apply to the credibility and not to the competency of witness which distinction of the lawyer i endeavor to explain to he then i think you often exclude a witness who be under a small bias and admit another who be under a great one you allow a man to give testimony in a case in which the fortune or character of he father brother or child be involve but reject he in a case in which he be not interested to the amount of a greater sum than he would give to the first beggar he meet be it not so that indeed may be the operation of the rule but case of such flagrant inconsistency be very rare and this rule like every other must be try by its general and not its partial effect true but you rule must at least be a troublesome one and give rise to a great many nice distinction that make it difficult in the application all law be sufficiently expose to this evil and we do not wish unnecessarily to increase it we have therefore adopt the plan of allow either party to ask any question of any witness he please and leave it to the judge to estimate the circumstance which may bias the witness we in short pursue the same course in investigate fact in court that we pursue out of it when no one form a judgment until he have first hear what the party and they friend say on the subject on my return home i repeat this conversation to a lawyer of my acquaintance who tell I that such a rule of evidence might do for the people in the moon but it certainly would not suit we i leave the matter to be settle by more competent head than mine and return to my narrative i farther learn from this intelligent magistrate that the territory of the happy valley or okalbium be divide into forty-two county and each county into ten district in each district be three magistrate who be appoint by the legislature cause of small value be decide by the magistrate of the district those of greater importance by the county court compose of all the magistrate of the ten district a few by the court of last court consist of seven judge the legislature consist of two house of which the member be elect annually three from each county for one branch and one member for the other no qualification of property be require either to vote or to be eligible to either house of the legislature as they believe that the natural influence of property be sufficient without add to that influence by law and that the moral effect of education among they together with a few provision in they constitution be quite sufficient to guard against any improper combination of those who have small property besides there be no odious privilege exclusively possess by particular class of man to excite the envy or resentment of the other class and induce they to act in concert have you then no party say i oh yes we be not without we political party and dispute and we sometimes wrangle about very small matter -- such as what amount of labor shall be bestow on the public road -- the best mode of conduct we school and college -- the comparative merit of the candidate for office or the policy of some proposed change in the law man be make you know of very combustible material and may be kindle as effectually by a spark fall at the right time in the right place as when within reach of a great conflagration the woman appear here to be under few restraint i understand that they be teach like we sex all the speculative branch of knowledge but that they be more especially instruct by profess teacher in cookery needlework and every sort of domestic economy as be the young man in the occupation which require strength and exposure they have a variety of public school and some house for public festival but no public hospital or almshouse whatever the few case of private distress or misfortune be leave for relief to the merit of the sufferer and the compassion of individual after pass a week among this singular and fortunate people whom we every where find equally amiable intelligent and hospitable we return to alamatua in the same way that we have come that be in a light car draw by four large mastiff when we have recover from the fatigue of the journey and i have carefully commit to paper all that i have learn of the okalbian the brahmin and i take a walk towards a part of the suburb which i have not yet see and where some of the literati of he acquaintance reside the sun appear to be not more than two hour high -lrb- though in fact it be more than fifty -rrb- the sky be without a cloud and a fresh breeze from the mountain contribute to make it like one of the most delightful summer evening of a temperate climate we carelessly ramble along enjoy the balmy freshness of the air the picturesque scenery of the neighbouring mountain the beauty or fragrance of some vegetable production and the oddity of other until have pass through a thick wood we come to a extensive plain which be cover with rose-bush the queen of flower here appear under every variety of color size and species -- red white black and yellow -- bud full-blown and half-blown -- some with thorn and some without some odourless and other exhale they unrivalled perfume with a overpowering sweetness i be about to pluck one of these flower -lrb- of which i have always be particularly fond -rrb- when a man whom i have not previously observe step up behind I seize my arm and ask I if i know what i be do he tell we that the rose of this field which be call gulgal be deem sacred and be not allow to be gather without the special permission of the priest under a heavy penalty and that he be one of those whose duty it be to prevent the violation of the law and to bring the offender to punishment the brahmin have divert himself a while with my surprise and disappointment then inform I that the rose have ever be regard in morosofium as the symbol of female purity delicacy and sweetness which notion have grow into a popular superstition that whenever a marriage be consummate on the earth one of these flower spring up in the moon and that in color shape size or other property it be a fit type of the individual whose change of state be thus commemorate what father say i could have give rise to so strange a opinion i know not say he but i have hear it thus explain : -- that the rose generally spring up as well as blow in the course of they long night during which the earth 's resplendent disc be the most conspicuous object in the heaven which two fact stand in the opinion of the multitude in the relation of cause and effect attribute then the symbolical character of the rose to its tutelary planet they regard the earth in the same light as the ancient do the chaste diana and believe that she plant this she favorite flower in the moon whenever she lose a votary the priesthood encourage this superstition as they have graft on it some mystical rite which add to they power and profit and which one of we pundit think have a great resemblance to the eleusinian mystery there be however my dear atterley little satisfaction in trace the origin of vulgar superstition they grow up like a strange plant in a forest without we be able to tell how the seed find its way there it be generally believe in the east that the moon at particular period of she revolution round the earth have a great influence in cause rain though every one must see that notwithstanding such influence must be the same in every part of the earth it be invariably fair in one place at the very time that it be rainy in another nay we may safely aver that there be not a day nor a hour in the year in which it be not dry and rainy cloudy and clear windy and calm in hundred of place at once i tell the brahmin that the same opinion prevail in my country that the vulgar also believe the moon accord to its age to have particular effect on the flesh of slaughter animal and that all sailor distinguish between a wet and a dry day accord to the position of the crescent we then inquire of the warden of this flowery plain if he have ever remark any difference in the number of rose which spring up in a give period of time he say he think they be more numerous about five and twenty or thirty year ago than he have ever see they before or since with that exception he say the number appear to be nearly the same every year the brahmin happen to be in one of those pleasant mood which be occasionally experience by amiable temper even when under the pressure of sorrow and age now amuse himself in point out the flower which probably represent the different nation of the earth and when he see any one remarkably small pale and delicate he insist that it belong to he own country which point however i not yield to he in nationality warmly contest i would here remark that as the rose be call _ gul _ in the persian language and the ancient sanscrit the name of this field furnish another argument in support of the brahmin 's hypothesis of the origin of the moon while thus oblivious of the past and reckless of the future we be enjoy the present moment in this _ badinage _ and i be extol the odour of the rose as beyond every other grateful to the olfactory nerve of man a lively flippant little personage come up and accost the brahmin with the familiarity of a acquaintance my companion immediately introduce I to he and at the same time give I to understand that this be the great reffeus one of the most distinguished literati of the country although he eye be remarkably piercing i perceive in it somewhat of the wildness which always characterize a glonglim he be evidently impatient for discussion and have inform himself of the subject of my rhapsody when he join we party he vehemently exclaim -- i be surprise at you fall in with that popular prejudice while it be easy to show that but for some feeling of love or pity or admiration with which the rise happen to be associate -- some past pleasure which it bring to you recollection or some future pleasure which it suggest -- any other flower would be equally sweet you see the rise a very beautiful flower and you have be accustom whenever you see and feel its beauty to perceive at the same time a certain odour the beauty and the odour thus become associate in you mind and the smell bring along with it the pleasure you feel in look at it but the chief part of the gratification you receive from smell a rose arise from some past scene of delight of which it remind you as of the day of you innocence and childhood when you run about the garden -- or when you be decorate with nosegay -- or dance round a may-pole -lrb- this be rather a free translation -rrb- -- or present a bunch of flower to some little favorite he say a great deal more on the subject and speak so prettily and ingeniously as almost to make a convert of I when on bring my nose once more to the flower i find in it the same exquisite fragrance as ever why do we like he continue the smell of a beef-steak or of a cup of tea except for the pleasure we receive from they taste i mention as a exception to he theory the codfish which be esteem a very savoury dish by my countryman but which no one ever regard as very fragrant but he repel my objection by a ingenious hypothesis ground on certain physiological fact to show that this suppose disagreeable smell be also the effect of some early association i then mention to he assafoetida the odour of which i believe be universally odious he immediately reply that we be always accustom to associate with this drug the disagreeable idea of sickness female weakness hysteric affectation & c unable to continue the argument i feel myself vanquish i again stoop to the flower and as i inhale its perfume surely say i to myself this rise would be sweet if i be to lose my memory altogether : but recollect the great reffeus 's argument i mentally added thanks to divine philosophy which always correct we natural prejudice chapter xv _ atterley go to the great monthly fair -- its various exhibition difficulty -- preparation to leave the moon -- curiosity procure by atterley -- regress to the earth _ the philosopher not wait to enjoy the triumph of victory abruptly take he leave and we refresh and delighted with we walk return home we landlord inform we that we have arrive in good time to attend the great fair or market which regularly take place a little before the sun sink below the horizon have take a short repast while the brahmin call on one of he acquaintance i sallied forth into the street and soon find myself in the bustling throng who be hasten to this great resort of the busy the idle the knavish and the gay some in pursuit of gain and some of pleasure whilst other again without any settle purpose be carry along by the vague desire of meeting with somewhat to relieve they from the pain of idleness the fair be hold in a large square piece of ground in one of the suburb set apart for that purpose and on each of its four side a long low building or rather roof support on massy white column extend about six hundred yard in length and be thirty yard wide immediately within this arcade be arrange the finer kind of merchandise fabric of cotton or silk and article of jewelry cutlery porcelain and glass on the outside be provision of every kind vegetable and animal flesh fish and fowl as well as the coarser manufacture at no great distance from this hollow square -lrb- which be use exclusively for buying and selling -rrb- might be see a infinite variety of person collect in groupe all engage in some occupation or amusement accord to they several taste and humor here a party of young man be jump or wrestle or shoot at a mark with cross-bow there girl and boy be dance to the sound of a pipe or still smaller child be play at marble or amusing themselves with the toy they have just purchase not far from these a quack from one scaffold be descant on the virtue of he medicine whilst a preacher from another be hold forth to the graver part of the crowd the joy and terror of another life and yet farther on a motley groupe be listen to a blind beggar who be sing to the music of a sort of rude guitar here and there curtain hang from a slight frame of wood-work veil a small square from the eye of all except those who pay a nail for admittance some of these curtained box contain juggler -- some tumbler -- some libidinous picture -- and other again strange bird beast and other animal i observe that none of the exhibition be as much frequent as these booth and i be tell that the corporation of the city derive from they a considerable revenue amidst such a infinite variety of object my attention be so distract that it could not settle down upon any one and i stroll about without object or design when i have become more familiar with this mixed multitude of sight and sound i endeavor to take a closer survey of some of the object compose the medley the first thing which attract my particular notice be a profusion of oath and imprecation which proceed from one of the curtained booth i pay the admittance money to a well-dressed man of smooth easy manners and enter i find there several party pair off and engage at different game but like the rest of the bystander i feel myself most strongly attract towards the two who be bet highest one of these be a elderly man of a tall stature in a plain dress the other be a short man in very costly apparel and some year younger for a long time the scale of victory seem balanced between they but at length the tall man who have great self-possession and who play with consummate skill win the game : soon after which he rise up and make a graceful respectful bow to the rest of the company he retire not be able to catch he eye so intent be he on he game i feel some curiosity to know whether he be a glonglim but could not ascertain the fact as some of whom the brahmin inquire say that he be while other maintain that he be not he adversary however evidently belong to that class and when flush with hope remind I of the feather-hunter at first he endeavor by force smile to conceal he rage and disappointment he then bite he lip with vexation and challenge one of the bystander to play for a smaller stake fortune seem about to smile on he on this occasion but one of the company who appear to be very much respect by the rest detect the little man in some false play and publicly expose he break up the game i understand afterwards that before the fair be over the gamester avenge himself for this injury in the other 's blood : that he then return to the fair secretly enter another gambling booth where he bet so rashly that he soon lose not only he patrimonial estate which be large but he acquire wealth which be much larger have lose all he property and even he clothes he then stake and lose he liberty and even he tooth which be very good and he will thus be compel to live on soup for the rest of he life i see several other match play in which great sum be bet great skill be exhibit and occasionally much unfairness practice there be one man in the crowd whose extraordinary good fortune i could not but admire he go about from table to table sometimes bet high and sometimes low but be generally successful until he have win as much as he could fairly carry after which he go out and amuse himself at a puppet-show and the stall of a cake-woman with whom he have formerly quarrel but who now when she learn he success be obsequiously civil to he i do not see that he manifest superior skill but still he be successful and in he last great stake with a young but not inexpert player he win the game though the chance be three to two against he surely think i fortune rule the destiny of man in the moon as well as on the earth on look now at my watch i find that i have be longer a witness of these trial of skill and fortune than i have be aware and on leave the booth perceive that the sun have sink behind the western mountain and that the earth begin to beam with she nocturnal splendor those who have come from a distance be already hurry back with they cart and here and there light car of various form and color and draw by dog be convey those away whose object have be amusement some be snatch a hasty meal and a few by they quiet air seem as if they mean to continue on the spot as long as the regulation permit after sunset which be about twenty of we hour i find the brahmin at home when i return and i feel as much pleased to see he as if we have not see each other for many month as the shades of night approach my anxiety to return to my native planet increase and i urge my friend to lose no time in prepare for we departure we be soon afterwards inform that a man high in office and renown for he political sagacity propose to detain we on the ground that when such voyage as ours be show to be practicable the inhabitant of the earth who be so much more numerous than those of the moon might invade the latter with a large army for the purpose of rapine and conquest we farther learn that this opinion which be at first cautiously circulate in the higher circle have become more generally know and be produce a strong sensation among the people the brahmin immediately present himself before the council of state to remove the impression he point out to they the insurmountable obstacle to such a invasion physical and moral he urge to they that the nation of the earth feel so much jealousy and ill-will towards one another that they never cordially co-operate in any enterprise for they common interest or glory and that if any one nation be to send a army into the moon such a scheme of ambition would afford at once a temptation and pretext for its neighbor to invade it that he country have not the ability and mine have not the inclination to attack the liberty of any other : so far from that he inform they on my authority that we be in the habit of send teacher abroad to instruct other nation in the duty of religion moral and humanity he enter into some calculation to show that the project be also impracticable on account of its expense and lastly insist that if all other difficulty be remove we should find it impossible to convince the people of the earth that we have really be to the moon i have since find that the brahmin be more right in he last argument than i then believe possible i be not able to say what effect these representation of the brahmin would have produce if they have not be take up and enforce by the political rival of he who have first oppose we departure but by he powerful aid they finally triumph and we obtain a formal permission to leave the moon whenever we think proper as we mean to return in the same machine in which we come we be not long in prepare for we voyage we propose to set out about the middle of the night and we pass the chief part of the interval in make visit of ceremony and in call on those who have show we civility i endeavored also to collect such article as i think would be most curious and rare in my own country and most likely to produce conviction with those who might be dispose to question the fact of my voyage i be oblige however to limit myself to such thing as be neither bulky nor weighty the brahmin think that after we have take in we instrument and the necessary provision we could not safely take more than twenty or thirty pound in addition some of my lunar curiosity which i think would be most new and interesting to my countryman have prove to be very familiar to we man of science this have be most remarkably the case with my mineral specimen of the leaf and flower of above seventy plant which i bring more than forty be find on the earth and several of these grow in my native state with the insect i have be more successful but some of these as well as of the plant i be assure be find on the coast of the pacific or in the island of that ocean which fact by the way give a farther support to the brahmin 's hypothesis besides the production of nature that i have mention i procure some specimen of they cloth a few light toy a lady 's turban decorate with cantharide a pair of slipper with heavy metallic sole which be use there for walk in a strong wind and by the dancing girl to prevent they jump too high as this metal which gravitate to the moon be repel from the earth these slipper assist the wearer here in spring from the ground as much as they impede it in the moon and therefore i have lend they to madame -- of the new-york theater who be thus enable to astonish and delight the spectator with she wonderful lightness and agility but there be nothing that i have bring which i prize so highly as a few of they manuscript the lunarian write as we do from leave to right but when they word consist of more than one syllable all the subsequent syllable be put over the first so that what we call _ long word _ they call _ high _ one : which mode of write make they more striking to the eye this peculiarity have perhaps have some effect in give they writer a magniloquence of style something like that which so laudably characterise we fourth of July oration and funeral panegyric : that composition be think the finest in which the word stand highest another advantage of this mode of write be that they can crowd more in a small page so that a long discourse if it be also very eloquent may be compress in a single page i have leave some of the manuscript with the publisher of this work for the gratification of the public curiosity have take either respectful or affectionate leave of all and get every thing in readiness on the 20th day of August 1825 about midnight we again enter we copper balloon if i may so speak and rise from the moon with the same velocity as we have formerly ascend from the earth though i experienced somewhat of my former sensation when i again find myself off the solid ground yet i soon regain my self-possession and animated with the hope of see my child and country with the past success of we voyage and -lrb- i will not disguise it -rrb- with the distinction which i expect it would procure I from my countryman i be in excellent spirit the brahmin exhibit the same mild equanimity as ever as the course of we ascent be now less inclined from the vertical line than before in proportion as the motion of the moon on its axis be slower than that of the earth we for some hour could see the former only by the light reflect from we planet and although the object on the moon 's surface be less distinct they appear yet more beautiful in my eye than they have do in the glare of day the difference however may be in part attribute to my be now in a better frame of mind for enjoy the scene as we distance increase the face of the moon become of a lighter and more uniform tint until at length it look like one vast lake of melted silver with here and there small piece of greyish dross float on it after contemplate this lovely and magnificent spectacle for about a hour i turn to the brahmin and remind he of he former promise to give I the history of he early life he reply as you have see all that you can see of the moon and the object of the earth be yet too indistinct to excite much interest i be not likely to have a more suitable occasion and after a short pause he begin in the way that the reader may see in the next chapter chapter xvi _ the brahmin give atterley a history of he life _ i have already inform you that i be bear at benare which as you know be a populous city on the bank of the gange and the most celebrated seat of hindoo science and literature my father be a priest of vishun of a high rank and as he function require he to live within the precinct of the pagoda he be liberally maintain out of its ample revenue i be he only son and accord to the usage of we country be destine to the same holy call at a early age i be put under a private tutor and then send to one of the school attach to the pagoda upon what little matter my dear atterley do we fortune and even we character depend have i be send to another school the whole destiny of my life would have be change i be in my twelfth year when i enter this school which contain from thirty to forty boy about my age the cleverest of these be balty mahu who like myself belong to the higher order of brahmin he take the lead not only in the exercise within the school but in all the sport and pastime out of it nature however have not be equally kind to he in temper and disposition he be restless ambitious proud vindictive and implacable he could occasionally too practice cunning and deception although anger and violence be more congenial to he nature it soon appear that i be to be he rival in the school and from that moment he cordially hate I the praise that have previously be lavish on he by the teacher be now share by I and most of the boy secretly rejoice to see he proud spirit humble in we sport i be also he successful competitor nature have give I a excellent constitution and though i have not a very robust frame i could boast of great agility and flexibility of limb when the sun have descend behind the mountain which screen we play-ground from he evening ray we commonly amuse ourselves in foot-race and other pastime of which running be a important part in this exercise i have no equal i could also jump higher and farther than any boy in school except one and that one be not balty mahu he ill-will be not slow in manifest itself he take every occasion of contradict I : sometimes indulge in sly sneer at my expense and now and then even attempt to turn I into open ridicule i always reply with spirit but i find such contest as disagreeable to I as they be new one evening under the pretext that i have purposely jostle he in run he strike I and we fight although he be probably stronger than i as he be heavier and older my suppleness enable I to get the better of he in a wrestle and i get he under I when the master attract by the shout of the boy make he appearance he separate and reprove we and send we off in disgrace to we respective room from that time balty mahu treat I with more outward respect than before but i believe he hate I with more rancor than ever i have now become the general favorite of the boy the school be indeed divide into party but mine be much the strongest and of those who adhere to my rival very few seem cordially to dislike I though this state of thing be very annoying to I it prove advantageous in one respect as it make I more diligent in my study lest i should furnish my rival with a occasion of triumph ever I so that i owe a part of what i gain to the enmity of my rival when i have reach my sixteenth year i be remove to the college in benare this be commonly a very interesting event in the life of a youth as it remind he that he be draw near the period of manhood and leave he more a master of he action but on the present occasion my pleasure have two drawback : i could not but feel the contrast between the warm and confide attachment of my late school-fellow and the coldness and reserve of my new companion yet the most disagreeable circumstance be that i here meet with my former rival balty mahu he have enter the college about a month before I and aware of my intention have spare no pain as i afterwards learn of prejudice the student against I after a few month however we relative standing be the same here as it have be at the school i gradually overcome the prejudice of the student and gain they good will while he be always give offence by he meddlesome disposition and overbearing manners : yet he talent and force of character always procure he a few follower whom he manage as he please of they aid he make use to gratify he malevolence towards I for this feeling have grow with he growth and now seem to be the master passion of he breast i be able to trace the result of they machination every where sometimes it be intimate to the teacher that i have be assist in my exercise at other that i have infringe the college rule or have put false report in circulation or have neglect some of the many ceremony require by we religion this be they favorite as well as the most efficient mode of attack as in these respects there be some color for they accusation in my early childhood i have be spare by the tenderest of mother from many of the ablutions practice by the hindoo under the belief that they would be injurious to my constitution which though healthy have never be robust a foundation be thus lay with I for habitual remissness in these ceremony and after i grow up i persuade myself that they be of less importance than they be deem by my countryman my chief delight have ever be in book and although when engage in active pursuit i take a lively interest in they for the time i always return to my first love with unabated ardor some of these accusation be utterly groundless i be able to disprove but the few that be true i endeavor to excuse and thus by they admission credit be procure for they most unfounded calumny these petty transgression -lrb- for i can not even now regard they as sin -rrb- industriously report and artfully exaggerate do I lasting injury with all the most pious of we caste the charitable portion indeed be merely estrange from I but the more bigoted part begin to regard I with aversion and horror in one of we vacation my father allow I to visit a brother of he who live in the country about thirty mile from benare my uncle have two son of nearly my own age and several daughter with the former i ride play chess and engage in such sport as be not forbid to my profession but my female cousin i seldom see as they rarely leave they zenana into which i be not permit to enter i be of a age to be desirous of become better acquaint with my female cousin especially after i learn that they then have as guest a lady and she daughter who have come to pass some week here during the absence of she husband then employ in some public mission to calcutta but it be only now and then that i have be able to catch a transient and distant view of these female during the first week after my arrival and the little i see serve but to increase my curiosity chance however soon afford I the means of gratify it a important festival in we calendar be now approach and preparation be make to celebrate it in various mode and amongst other by a fight between a _ royal _ tiger and a elephant for several day all be bustle and confusion in my uncle 's family howdah newly gilded and paint be provide for the elephant -- new caparison for the horse -- new livery for the attendant -- cloth and silk of the richest dye and hue unite with a profusion of gold and silver ornament to dazzle the eye with they varied splendor this be one of those exhibition which those who be intend for the priesthood be prohibit from attend i confess when i witness these showy and costly preparation and picture to myself the magnificent scene for which they be intend -- those formidable animal contend in mortal conflict -- the thousand of gaily dress spectator gaze in breathless anxiety -- i repined at my lot and regret i have not be bear in a condition which though of less dignity would not have cut I off from some of the most exquisite pleasure of life at length the important day arrive and i find my mortification so acute that i determine to withdraw myself as much as i could from a scene that i could not witness without pain among my acquirement at college be a knowledge of you language and i have now begin to take the liveliest interest in its beautiful fiction which i greatly prefer to ours as be more true to nature and as exhibit woman in character at once lovely pure and elevated i be then read the vicar of wakefield and have reach the middle of that interesting tale on the morning of the festival when my tranquillity be interrupt in the way i have mention accordingly take my book and english dictionary i retire to a small summer-house at the foot of the garden and determine to remain there till the cavalcade have set out it be some time before i could fix my attention on what i read but after a while the interest the book have previously excite return and i become at length so engross by the incident of the story as to forget the festival the procession the tiger and the elephant as much as if they have never before enter my head after some hour pass in this intellectual banquet i wake from my day dream and i think again of the spectacle with a feeling border on indifference i walk towards the house where all appear to be still and silent as a desert i enter it and of the forty or fifty menial belong to it not one be to be see those who be not in attendance on the family have seek some respite from they ordinary labor the zenana then catch my eye and i feel irresistibly impel to enter it i use great caution however look around I in every direction as i proceed there i find the same silence and desertion as in the other part of the mansion i pass through a sitting-room into a long gallery with which the bed-chamber of the lady communicate the door be all open and the whole interior of they apartment exhibit so strange a medley of unseemly object and such utter disorder as materially to affect my opinion of female delicacy and to damp my desire of become acquaint with my cousin i pass on with a feeling of disappointment border on disgust when i come to a room which go far to redeem the character of the sex in my estimation here all be neatness and propriety : every thing be either in place or only enough out of it to indicate the recent occupation of the room or to show the taste or talent of the occupant such as a book leave half open at one end of a ottoman and a piece of embroidery at the other the flower too which decorate the room show by they freshness that they have not long leave they bed i could not help stop to survey a scene which accord so well with my previous notion of female refinement at the end of the gallery be a veranda face the east and surround by lattice in this be a number of flower-pot arrange with the same air of neatness and taste as have be conspicuous in the chamber i enter it for the purpose of look into the flower-garden with which it communicate and on approach the lattice i see seat in a alcove not far from the veranda a face and form that strike I as be the most beautiful i have ever behold i remain for some time rivet to the spot but soon find myself irresistibly impel to get a nearer view of the lovely object with as light a step and as little noise as possible i descend into the garden from the veranda and approach the alcove on the side where its foliage be thickest i find that the beauty of which i have before think so highly do not appear less on a closer survey the vision on which i gaze in silent rapture a maiden who though she have apparently attain she full stature do not seem to be more than thirteen or fourteen year of age she eye have the brightness and fulness of the antelope 's but owe to they long silken lash be yet more expressive of softness than of spirit and at this time they evince more than usual languor she be in a rich undress and be apparently a invalid she long raven lock hang with careless grace partly behind and partly over a neck that might have serve as a model for the sculptor she be look wistfully on a bunch of flower in she hand which i feel pleasure in recognize to be the same i have see on the piece of embroidery i fear to advance lest i should give offence but i feel also unable to retreat i fancied i see one of those lovely and dignified female which the writer in you language describe so well but a sudden movement of the fair damsel to get up bring I full in she view she start back with alarm and surprise and in a moment afterwards she cheek which have be before pale almost to european whiteness be deeply suffused i respectfully approach she and inquire if she be one of my cousin she answer in the negative say she be on a visit to the family to whom she be related : add that she have not expect to see any one in the garden but this be say as if she mean rather to apologise for she undress than to reproach I for my intrusion these remark be utter with a propriety and sweetness that win upon I yet more than she beauty i then in return assure she that i have not suppose any of the family have remain at home when i stroll to this part of the mansion i begged she would not regard I with the formality of a stranger and insist that as she be the cousin of my relation she be also mine to this ingenious argument she answer with so much good sense and at the same time so much gentleness and artlessness that i think i could have listen to she for ever while i speak she continue to move on i entreated to know if she be satisfy with my apology repeat that i have not mean to intrude on she privacy she mildly reply that she be i then ask permission to call she cousin she say she should not object if it would give I pleasure it be my dear atterley she ineffable sweetness of disposition and of manners so entirely free from pride coquetry or affectation in which this lovely creature excel all other woman yet more than in beauty and grace i then inquire when i should again see my lovely cousin she reply i walk in the great garden sometimes with my companion when they brother be away but the girl will not think it proper to walk when you be there perceive that i look chagrined she add : it be say you know that the light from men ' eye be yet worse for women ' face than the light of the sun and she blush as if she have say something wrong i stammer out i know not what extravagant compliment in reply and entreat that i might have a opportunity of see and converse with she sometimes : to which she promptly answer that she should not object if she mother approve it i inquire why she have not attend the exhibition when i learn from she that as she have be slightly indispose the day before and she mother be unwilling she should expose herself to the heat of the weather and the crowd she have be leave under the care of she nurse but that find herself better she have permit she attendant to walk over the grounds while she amuse herself in embroidery and that she have come into the garden to get a fresh supply of the flower she be work she have by this time approach a small gate which communicate with the apartment on the ground-floor of the zenana when turn to I she say you can return the way you come but i must leave you here and make a slight bow she spring like a young fawn through the gate and be out of sight in a moment you may wonder my dear atterley that i should remember all these minute circumstance after the lapse of more than forty year but every incident of that day be as fresh in my memory as the occurrence of yesterday to this single green spot in my existence my mind be never tire of return i continue for some time in a sort of dream ecstasy but as soon as i collect my thought i begin to devise some scheme by which i could again have the happiness of see and converse with the lovely veenah my brain have before that time teem with ambitious project of distinguish myself sometimes as a priest -- sometimes as a writer and occasionally i think i would bend all my effort to rouse my countryman to throw off the ignominious yoke of great britain but this short interview have change the whole current of my thought i have now a new set of feeling opinion and wish my mind dwelt solely upon the pleasure of domestic life -- the surpass bliss of loving and of be beloved when the cavalcade return in the evening its gaudy magnificence which i would not permit myself even to see in the morning i now regard with cold indifference nay more i congratulate myself on have miss the exhibition though a few hour before i have deem this privation one of the misfortune of my life the next day i go to the garden betime and as it communicate with the shrubbery and grounds attach to the zenana and the male of the family occasionally enter it when the lady be not present i prevail on the gardener to grant I admission under the pretext of gather some uncommonly fine mango which be then ripe i go to the several spot where i have first see veenah -- where i have converse with she -- where i have part from she and they each have some secret and indescribable charm for I i fear atterley i fatigue you the feeling of which i speak be fully know only to the native of warm climate and to those but once in they life i assure he that he be mistake that the emotion he describe be the same in all country and at all time and beg he to proceed i repeat my visit he continue several time the same day under any pretext i could invent -- to gather a orange or other fruit -- to pluck a rose -- to frighten away mischievous bird -- to catch the unobstructed breeze or sit in a cooler shade in which artifice i play a part that have before be foreign to my nature i be disappointed however in my wish i think indeed i once see some one in the veranda look through the lattice into the garden but the figure soon disappear on the follow day i have the satisfaction to hear my young companion propose to go on a fishing party a amusement in which by the rule of my caste i be not allow to partake they have scarcely leave the house before i fly to the garden with a book in my hand and pass as before to the shrubbery i bury myself in a close thicket at one end of it i remain there from the morning till late in the afternoon without refreshment of any kind and such be the intensity of my emotion that i do not feel the want of it at length a little before sunset i see veenah and she three cousin enter the garden i soon contrived to show myself with my book in my hand i approach bow to they all but to veenah last and although my cousin show surprise at see I in they garden at this time they do not seem displeased i feel very desirous i could not tell why to conceal my feeling from every person except she who be the object of they i force a conversation with my two eldest cousin who be modest pleasing girl and then with a embarrassed air address a few word to veenah and she companion the youngest of my cousin occasionally i would stray off from they as if i be about to leave they and then suddenly return in one of these movement i perceive that veenah and she associate have separate from the other and stroll to a distant part of the garden i soon join they as if it be by accident enter into conversation with they alternately and of course only one half of that which i either hear or say proceed from the heart or find its way thither i know not if veenah expect to see I but she be dress with unusual care we have not be converse many minute before the eldest sister beckon to they they bid I good night and return to the house to the same sort of management i have recourse every day and seldom fail to see and converse with veenah sometimes in company with all she cousin but oftener with fatima the youngest by divide my attention among they all i succeed for a while in conceal from they the object of my preference but the sex be too sharp-sighted to be long deceive in these matter as soon as i perceive that my secret be discover i endeavor to make a friend of fatima in which i be successful after this we meeting be more frequent and what be of greater importance they be uninterrupted fatima who be one of the most generous and amiable girl in the world would often take veenah out to walk when she sister be otherwise engage at which time she be perpetually contrive under some little pretext to leave we alone we be not long in understand each other and when i urge we early marriage she ingenuously reply that i have she consent whenever i have she father 's and that she hope i could obtain that but add -lrb- and she tremble while she speak -rrb- she do not know he view respect she in the first rapture of requited affection what lover think of difficulty in obtain veenah 's heart i believe that all mine be at a end and my time be pass in one dream of unmixed delight oh what happiness i enjoy in these interview -- in see veenah -- in gaze on she lovely feature -- in listen to she sentiment that be sometimes gay and thoughtless sometimes serious and melancholy but always tender and affectionate -- and now and then when not perceive in venture to take she hand these fleeting joy be ever recur to my imagination to show I what my lot might have be and to contrast it with its sad reverse the time now approach for veenah and she mother to return to benare on the evening before they set out fatima contrived for we a longer interview than usual it be as melancholy as it be tender but in the midst of my grief at the prospect of we separation i recollect that we be soon to meet again in the city while veenah 's tear for she do not attempt to disguise or suppress she feeling seem already to forebode that we happiness be here to terminate when about to part we exchange amaranth i take she hand to bid she adieu and without seem to intend it we lip meet and the first kiss of love be moisten with a tear pardon I atterley nature will have she way -- and here the venerable man weep aloud i availed myself of this interruption to the narrative to propose to my venerable friend to take some refreshment have partaken of a frugal repast and invigorated ourselves each with about four hour sleep the brahmin thus resume he story chapter xvii _ the brahmin 's story continue -- the voyage conclude -- atterley and the brahmin separate -- atterley arrive in new -- york _ i be not slow to follow veenah to the city and as have be agree upon have to ask the consent of she father to we union as soon as i have obtain the approbation of my own here i meet with a difficulty which i have not expect my partial father have form very high hope of my future advancement and think that a early marriage though not incompatible with my profession or a successful discharge of its duty would put a end to my ambition or at all event lessen my exertion he first urge I to postpone my wish till i have complete my college course and have by travel see something of the world but find I immoveable on this point he then suggest that i might meet with serious obstacle from veenah 's father whom he represent as remarkable both for he avarice and he bigotry that consequently he be likely to dispose of he daughter to the son-in-law who could pay most liberally for she and that the imputation which have be cast on my religious creed would reach he ear if they have not already do so and be sure to prejudice he against I these last consideration prevail on I to defer my application to shunah shoo until the suspicion regard my faith have either die away or be falsify by my scrupulous observance of all religious duty my excellent mother who at first have enter into my feeling and second my view readily acquiesce in the good sense of my father 's advice my next object be to communicate this to veenah i accordingly sit down and write a full account of all that have occur and folding up the packet hurry to the opposite quarter of the town where shunah shoo live it be then in the dusk of the evening and i be fearful it be too late for I to be recognize but after i have take two or three turn in the street i see the white amaranth i have give veenah suspend by a thread from the lattice of a upper window i immediately hold up the packet and soon afterwards a cord be let down from the same lattice to the ground to this i hastily fasten the paper and pass on to avoid observation the next evening you may be sure i be at the same spot the little amaranth again announce that i be recognize and as soon as we be satisfy that no one be observe we the cord let down one letter and take up another veenah 's pen have give a expression to she feeling that she tongue have never venture to do before she moreover commend my course -- besought I to be prudent -- and above all to do nothing to offend she father the first letter which a lover receive from he mistress be a new era in he life again and again i kiss the precious paper and almost wear it out in my bosom we afterwards improve in this mode of intercourse and by various preconcerted signal be able to carry on we correspondence altogether in the night not a day pass that we do not exchange letter which though they contain few fact and always express the same sentiment still repeat what we be never tire of hear to the moment at which i be to receive a letter from veenah my thought be continually and anxiously turn : and it now seem to I as if we passion be inflamed yet more by this sort of intercourse than by we personal interview i be convinced it work more powerfully upon we imagination in the mean time i continue my daily attendance at college though my study be utterly neglect one single object absorb all my thought and feeling i know not whether the evident change in my habit induce my old enemy balty mahu to observe my motion but so it be that one moonlight night i think i be watch by some person and on the follow night a individual of the same figure and whom i now suspect to be balty mahu come suddenly from a cross street and pass near I a few evening afterwards instead of a letter i receive a scrap of paper from veenah on which be write the follow word : -- we be discover balty mahu who be my relative and you enemy have be here he have persuade my father that you be a unbeliever i be deny pen and ink if you can not convince my father of he error o pity and try to forget you unhappy veenah this writing be indistinctly trace with a burnt stick on a blank leaf tear out of a book in the first moment of indignation i feel disposed to seek balty mahu the great enemy of my life and wreak my vengeance on he for all he persecution but the conviction that such a course would extinguish the last spark of hope restrain I i then determine to see shunah shoo and endeavor to remove he prejudice i accordingly call on he at he own house : but after he have hear my vindication -lrb- to which he evidently give no credit -rrb- he coolly tell I that he mean to dispose of he daughter in another way the word fall like ice upon my heart i expostulated and offensive as be he haughty air even have recourse to entreaty but he in a yet harsher manner tell I that he must be permit to manage he own affair in he own way and add that he do not wish to be longer prevent from attend to they i be compel to retire with my heart almost as full of hatred for the father as of love for the child on the same night i again betook myself to the street in which shunah shoo live but not by the ordinary route i cautiously approach he house all be stillness and quiet : no light appear to be burn in veenah 's room nor indeed in any other part of the house i hence conclude that they have now deprive she of light as well as of pen and ink i continue in the street until near morning strain my eye and ear in the hope of catch something that would give I intelligence concern she often in the course of that painful suspense do i fancy i hear a noise at the lattice in veenah 's apartment or in some other part of the mansion and once i persuade myself i see a light : but these illusion serve only to aggravate my disappointment the next morning before i have leave my room my father inform I that shunah shoo with he family have leave benare early the precede evening but whither they have go he have not learn i rise and immediately set about discover they course but all i could learn be that they have embark in one of the passage-boat which ply on the gange and that shunah have take he palanquin and many of he servant with he : and as balty mahu have suddenly absented himself from college at the same time i do not doubt that he have aid in execute the plan which he have also probably form my father who see what i suffer spare no pain to discover the place of they retreat but we endeavor be all ineffectual at the end of three month in which time my anxiety increase rather than diminish the mystery be dispel it be now trumpet through the city that shunah shoo have return to benare in great pomp accompany by a wealthy omrah of a neighbouring district to whom he have give or rather sell he daughter the news come upon I like a clap of thunder my previous state of suspense be happiness compare with what i now feel when i know she be in the arm of another in the first transport of my grief and rage i could have freely put to death the father daughter husband and myself i be particularly desirous of see veenah and vent on she the bitterest reproach unjust that i be she suffering be not inferior to mine but she have not like I the privilege of make they known i soon find that hircarrah in the pay of balty mahu watch all my motion and if i have attempt any scheme of vengeance its execution would have be impracticable after my first transport have subside into deep and settle grief my love and tenderness for veenah return in full force i endeavor to get a sight of she and think i should be comparatively happy if i could converse with she as formerly though she be the wife of another after a short time my uncle 's family come to benare on a visit to my father and to shunah shoo by the aid of my indulgent mother who be seriously alarmed for what she see i suffer i be able to see fatima and to make she the bearer of a letter to veenah complain of she breach of faith and solicit a interview she verbally reply to it through fatima and state in she justification that she be hurry from benare to a town on the river whence she be rapidly transport to the castle of omrah who have not long before lose he wife and who be more than four time she age that notwithstanding the notion of filial obedience in which she have be bring up and the severity with which she father have ever exercise he authority she have resist he command on this occasion and would have prefer death to marry the omrah -- nay would have inflict it on herself but that find she unyielding after all they exertion they have effect they purpose by a deception which they have practice on she wherein it seem that i have unconsciously concur for by means of a intercept letter of mine to fatima in which hopeless of learn the place of veenah 's retreat i have express a intention of visit england and by the farther aid of some dexterous forgery calculate to impose on more experienced mind than hers they succeed in persuade she that i have actually set out for europe with a intention of never return that entertaining no doubt of this intelligence -- hopeless of ever see I again and indifferent to every thing besides she have be lead a unresisting victim to the altar such be the vindication which she consider it just to make I but all the entreaty of fatima -- all my letter impassion as they be appeal at once to she generosity humanity and love -- could not prevail on she to grant I a interview ` tell he ' say she ` that heaven have forbid it and to its decree we be bind to submit i be now the wife of another and it be we duty to forget all that be past but if this be possible my heart tell I it can be only by we never meet ' in say this she weep bitterly but at the same time exact a promise from fatima that she would never mention the subject to she again find she thus inexorable i fall into a settle melancholy and my health be visibly decline the european consider the native of hindostan to be feeble and effeminate but the soul that which distinguish man from brute act with a intensity and constancy of purpose of which they can furnish no example how long i could have withstand the corrosive effect of my hopeless passion irritated as it be by my be in the vicinity of its object -- by hear perpetually of she beauty and sometimes catch a glimpse of it -- i know not but the omrah after a few month spend with he father-in-law return with he bride to he castle in the country yield now to the wish of my anxious parent i consent to travel i be at first benefit by the exercise and change of scene but after a while my melancholy return and my health grow worse though indifferent to life itself and all that it now promise i exert myself for the sake of my parent especially of my mother who suffer so acutely on my account : but i carry a barb arrow in my heart and the greater the effort to extract it the more they rankle the wound after spend more than a year in travel first through the mountainous district of we country and then along the coast and finding no change for the better i determine to try the effect of a sea voyage i accordingly embark at calcutta in a coast vessel that be bind to madras at this time i have waste away to a mere skeleton and no one who see I believe i could live a month such indeed be my own impression in the letter which i write to my parent i endeavor to prepare they for the worst when after a long voyage we reach madras my health be evidently improve but a piece of intelligence i here receive have perhaps a still greater effect i learn that balty mahu who have keep himself conceal from I before i leave benare have lately visit madra on a travel tour this news operate on I like a charm the idea of avenge myself on the author of all my calamity infuse new life into my exhaust frame and from the moment that i determine to pursue he i feel like another man you must not however suppose that i even then entertain the purpose of take away my enemy 's life no i could not bring my mind exactly to that but i have a vague undefined hope that if we meet some new provocation on he part would afford I just occasion for avenge myself on all so ingenious my dear friend be the sophistry of the passion i lose no time in set out on the track of balty mahu and ere many day overtake he at a small town which he have leave just as i enter it but not before he have receive through he servant notice of my arrival my wary enemy who have little expect to see I here and who have travel as much to keep out of my way as to see the country conjecture my purpose from the consciousness of what he have do to provoke it thus while we both appear to other to be merely make a tour of hindostan it be soon know to both of we that my chief purpose be to pursue he and he to elude my pursuit in the ardor as well as exercise of the chase my health mend rapidly but i be no nearer the object of my pursuit for although i travel somewhat faster than bally mahu as he wish to avoid the appearance of fly from I he sometimes contrived to put I on a wrong track in this way i be once lead to travel towards the coast while he proceed in a opposite direction to benare where he consider he would be most safe from my vengeance and where the restraint both of religion and law would be more likely to operate on I than in a foreign district my usual practice on arrive at any town be to endeavor to learn if balty mahu have pass through it if so when and in what direction and to get the information if possible without seem to seek it on one of these occasion i hear from a party of merchant that the omrah addaway whose health have be decline for some time have go to benare for the benefit of medical advice that he disease however have become more serious and that it be generally think it would soon occasion he death what a train of new thought hope and desire do this intelligence excite in I at first influence by the custom of my country which prohibit widow from marry again i think only of the pleasure of veenah 's society which i should of course be permit to enjoy when duty no longer forbid it but my imagination kindling in its course i soon picture she to myself as my wife the usage which stand in the way of we union appear to I barbarous and absurd and i think that banishment from my country with veenah would be infinitely better than any other condition of life without she these new-born vision so entirely absorb I that balty mahu be entirely forget or remember only as we think of a insect which have sting we a hour before i travel on at a yet more rapid rate than i have do and without stop on the road to make inquiry i hear enough to satisfy I that the omrah could not long survive when within something more than ten league of benare i call about twilight at a small inn and mean after refresh myself with a few hour ' rest to proceed on my journey two traveller be there who have just leave benare and have take up they quarter for the night they soon fall into conversation about the place they have leave when the mention of shunah shoo 's name excite my attention ` what a shame ' say one ` that he should have sacrifice that beautiful young creature to the rich old omrah when she have so good a offer as gurameer the brahmin gafawad 's only son ' ` and be it not strange ' say the other ` that a woman so young and beautiful should be content to follow to the grave one who be old enough to be she grandfather and whom she once loathe but i suppose that that old miser shunah shoo be at the bottom of it and as he deprive she of the man she love he have compel she to sacrifice herself to the one she hate that he may have she jewel and wealth ' ` for that matter ' say the first ` though shunah shoo be bad enough for any thing where money be in the way yet it be say that veenah go to the funeral pile of she own accord she have never seem to set any value on life since she marriage and after she hear of gurameer 's death she have never be see to smile poor young man ' -- and here they launch out into a strain of panegyric which be often bestow on the dead but i heed only the first part of they discourse have it not be nearly dark they must have discover the force of the feeling which then agitate I i tremble from head to foot and though burn with impatience to obtain from they farther particulars it be some moment before i could trust myself to speak at length i ask they when the suttee would take place and be answer by one of they that it would certainly be perform on the follow day and that he have see the funeral pile himself without any farther delay i set out immediately for the city and reach it in as short a time as a jaded horse could carry I i come in sight of benare the next morning from a hill which overlook it from the east the sun be just rise and pour a flood of light ever the city the river and the surrounding country never be contrast greater than between my present feeling and those which the same spectacle have formerly excite i now sicken at the prospect which once would have set my heart bound with joy i press on in desperate haste scarcely however know what i do be at once overpower with fatigue loss of sleep and harass emotion i still have to travel a circuitous course of some two or three mile and when i reach the city its crowded population be already in motion : a great multitude of woman of the lower order with alarm and expectation strongly depict in they face be to be see mingle in the crowd and press on in the same direction i would have proceed immediately to my father 's house but for the fear of be too late alighting therefore from my horse i give he in charge to my servant whom i send to inform my parent of my arrival and to request my father to meet I at the suttee i then join the mixed multitude which now throng the street occupy as my thought be with the scene i be about to witness and with fear for its issue they be often interrupted with remark make in the crowd in which veenah 's name or mine be mention -- some lament she cruel fate other pity mine but all condemn and execrate shunah shoo fortunately i be not recognize by any whom i see when we reach the spot select for the sacrifice the crowd that have there assemble be not so great as to prevent we get near the funeral pile but the number continue to augment until nothing could be see from the slight eminence on which i stand but one dense mass of head all look one way and express the intense interest they feel at length a murmur like that of distant thunder run through the crowd : a passage be with some difficulty effect through the multitude by the officer in attendance and the wretched veenah make she appearance support by she own father on one side and a uncle on the other -- pale enough to be take for a european -- emaciated indeed but still retain the same exquisite beauty of feature and symmetry of form she move with the air of one who be utterly indifferent to the concern of this world and to the awful fate which await she she turn she head on hear the sound of my voice and see I shriek out he live he live but immediately afterwards faint in the arm of she supporter : at the same moment i be forcibly hold back by some of the attendant and a number of the bystander rush in between we and intercept my view i hear my name now repeat in every direction by the multitude -- some call out to the priest to desist and other to proceed i struggle to extricate myself and passion lend I momentary strength but it be insufficient after a short interval i distinctly hear veenah implore they to spare she i call to the brahmin who hold she to leave she to herself i endeavor to rouse the multitude but they take the precaution to drown we voice by the musical instrument which be use on these occasion four of these monster i see profane the name of religion by forcibly place they victim on the pile under the show of assist she to mount it and there hold she down beside the dead body of she husband until by cord provide for the purpose she be prevent from rise i besought -- i threaten -- i rave -- but all thought and mind be engross by the premature fate of one so young and beautiful and i be unheeded among the relative who press around the funeral pile i see balty mahu and indignation for a moment get the better of grief the pile be now light and in a moment all be hide in smoke i sickened at the sight and be oblige to turn away even then i hear or think i hear the die shriek of the victim amid the groan and cry and the thousand shout that rent the air the pile and its contents be now envelop in flame my keeper set I free when by a impulse of frenzy i rush ' to the pile to make a last vain effort to rescue veenah or to share she fate but be stop by some of the bystander who call my act a profanation ` yes ' say balty mahu ` he have always be a scoffer of we religion ' as soon as these word reach my ear with the quickness of thought i snatch a cimeter from the hand of one of the guard and plunge it in he breast of all that happen afterwards my recollection be very confused i be rudely seize and hurry to prison my father be come to meet I when he be inform of the fatal deed i remember that my coolness or rather stupor be in strong contrast with the violence of he emotion he accompany I to prison and continue with I that night it be not easy to take the life of one of my caste in indium and by dint of the exertion of my friend in spite of the influence of shunah shoo and the family of the omrah i be pardon on condition of do penance which be that i should never live in a country in which the religion of brahmin prevail and should not again look at or converse with any woman for two minute together ere this take place my excellent mother unable to withstand the shock she have receive from my suppose death my misfortune and my crime die a martyr to maternal affection wish to conform to the sentence and to be as near my father as i could i remove to the kingdom of ava where you know they be follower of buddha here i continue as long as my father live which be about six year in this period time have so alleviated my grief that i begin to take pleasure in the cultivation of science which constitute my chief employment after my father 's death i indulge a curiosity i have feel in my youth of see foreign country and i visit china japan and england during my residence in asia i have discover lunarium ore in the mountain near mogaun and this circumstance many year afterwards when i determine to rest from my labor induce I to settle in that mountain as i have before state i have occasionally use the metal to counterbalance the gravity of a small car by which i have profit by a favourable wind to indulge the melancholy satisfaction of look down on the tomb of my parent and of the ill-fated veenah : approach the earth near enough in the night to see the sacred spot but not enough to violate the religious injunction of my caste to avoid which however it be sometimes necessary for I to go across hindostan to arabia or persia and there wait for a change of wind before i could return : and it be these excursion which suggest to the superstitious burman that my form have undergo a temporary transformation when such have be the woe of my life you can no longer think it strange atterley that i delay they painful recital or that after have endure so much all common danger and misfortune should appear to I insignificant \* \* \* \* \* the venerable brahmin here conclude he narrative and we both remain thoughtful and silent for some time he apparently absorb in the recollection of he eventful life and i partly in the reflection awaken by he story and partly in the intense interest of revisit my native earth and beholding once more all who be dear to I already the extended map beneath we be assume a distinct and varied appearance and the brahmin have apply he eye to the telescope and make a brief calculation of we progress consider that twenty-four hour more if no accident interrupt we would end we voyage part of which interval i pass in make note in my journal and in contemplate the different section of we many-peopled globe as they present themselves successively to the eye it be my wish to land on the american continent and if possible in the united state but the brahmin put a end to that hope by remind I that we should be attract towards the equator and that we have to choose between asia africa and south america and that we only course would be to check the progress of we car over the country of greatest extent through which the equinoctial circle might pass say which he relapse into he melancholy silence and i betook myself once more to the telescope with a bosom throb with emotion i see that we be descend towards the american continent when we be about ten or twelve mile from the earth the brahmin arrest the progress of the car and we hover over the broad atlantic look down on the ocean the first object which present itself to my eye be a small one-masted shallop which be buffet the wave in a south-westerly direction i presume it be a new england trader on a voyage to some part of the republic of colombium : and by way of divert my friend from he melancholy reverie i tell he some of the many story which be current respect the enterprise and ingenuity of this portion of my countryman and above all they adroitness at a bargain methink say the brahmin you be describe a native of canton or pekin but add he after a short pause though to a superficial observer man appear to put on very different character to a philosopher he be every where the same -- for he be every where mould by the circumstance in which he be place thus let he be in a situation that be propitious to commerce and the habit of traffic produce in he shrewdness and address trade be carry on chiefly in town because it be there carry on most advantageously this situation give the trader a more intimate knowledge of he species -- a more ready insight into character and of the mode of operate on it he chief purpose be to buy as cheap and to sell as dear as he can and he be often able to heighten the recommendation or soften the defect of some of the article in which he deal without danger of immediate detection or in other word he representation have some influence with he customer he avail himself of this circumstance and thus acquire the habit of lie but as he be studious to conceal it he become wary ingenious and cunning it be thus that the phenician the carthagenian the dutch the chinese the new-englander and the modern greek have always be regard as incline to petty fraud by they less commercial neighbor i mention the english nation if the english say he interrupt I who be the most commercial people of modern time have not acquire the same character it be because they be as distinguish for other thing as for traffic : they be not merely a commercial people -- they be also agricultural warlike and literary and thus the

morosofium and other lunarian _ : by joseph atterley new-york : elam bliss 1827 12mo pp 264 it be somewhat remarkable that perhaps the _ only _ voyage to the moon which have be publish in the english tongue should have be the production of english bishop : -- the first form a tract re-publish in the harleian miscellany and say to have be write by dr franci goodwin bishop of landaff -lrb- who die in 1633 -rrb- and entitle _ the man in the moon or the discourse of a voyage thither _ by domingo gonsale -- and the second write in 1638 by dr john wilkin bishop of chester under the title of _ the discovery of a new world or a discourse tend to prove that ` tis probable there may be another habitable world in the moon with a discourse concern the possibility of a passage thither _ these two work differ in several essential particulars : -- in dr goodwin 's we have man of enormous stature and prodigious longevity with a fly chariot and some other slight point of resemblance to the travels of gulliver : -- whilst bishop wilkin 's be intend honestly and scientifically to prove that it be possible for some of we posterity to find out a conveyance to this other world and if there be inhabitant there -lrb- which the bishop satisfactorily to himself settle -rrb- to have commerce with they from the first of these swift have derive many hint in he voyage to laputa and improve they into those humorous and instructive allusion which have cause the reputation of the author of the _ travels of gulliver _ to be extend to every portion of the civilized globe since the appearance of this celebrated satire no one sufficiently comprehensive to lash the folly of the age -- the _ quicquid agunt homine _ -- have make its appearance : we have have numerous ephemeral production inflict severe castigation upon particular vice or absurdity but the visionary conceit of the many constantly promulgate in the progressive advancement of human knowledge although legitimate object of censure have not since the time of swift be embody into one publication the evident aim of the author of the satirical romance before we be to fulfil for the present age what _ swift _ so successfully accomplish for that which have pass by : -- to attack by the weapon of ridicule those votary of knowledge who may have seek to avail themselves of the universal love of novelty amongst mankind to acquire celebrity or who may have be mislead by they own ill-regulated imagination to obtrude upon the world they crude and imperfect theory and system to the manifest retardation of knowledge : -- a effect too liable to be induce in a direct ratio with the degree of talent and ingenuity by which they view may have be support several of these may always be more successfully attack by ridicule than by reason inasmuch as they be in this way more likely to become the subject of popular animadversion and many who could withstand the serious argument of they fraternity can not placidly endure they ridicule satire have indeed often do more service to the cause of religion and morality than a sermon since the remedy be agreeable whilst it at the same time communicate indignation or fear : -- of all the way that wisest man could find to mend the age and mortify mankind satire well writ have most successful prov would and cure because the remedy be lov would to produce however the full effect satire must possess a certain degree of impartiality and be level in all instance at the vice or folly and not at the man the first sketch of gulliver 's travels occur in the propose travels of martinus scriblerus devise in that please society where most of swift 's miscellany be plan have the work however be execute under the same auspices it would probably as sir walter scott have suggest -lrb- 1 -rrb- have be occupy by that personal satire upon obscure and unworthy contemporary to which pope be but too much addict but when the dean muse in solitude over the execution of he plan it assume at once a more grand and a darker complexion the spirit of indignant hatred and contempt with which he regard the mass of humanity he quiet and powerful perception of they failing error and crime he zeal for liberty and freedom of thought tend at once to generalize while it embittered he satire and to change trait of personal severity for that deep shade of censure which gulliver 's travels throw upon mankind universally most of the sentiment which impress swift seem also to have be feel by the unknown author of the work before we : it be not however free from personal allusion but they be all convey in so good natured a manner as to satisfy the reader that the author have be solicitous to animadvert only on the vice of the individual and in no part of the work be there the slightest evidence of prejudice or venom the pseudo _ joseph atterley _ the hero of the narrative be bear in huntingdon long-island on the 11th of may 1786 he be the son of a seafaring individual who

October they voyage be comparatively agreeable but when off the mouth of the gange one of those hurricane well know to the experienced navigator of the eastern sea strike the ship and render she so leaky that the captain consider it advisable to make for the nearest port the leak however increase rapidly and find themselves off a coast which the captain by he chart pronounce to be a part of the burman empire and in the neighborhood of merguus on the martaban coast they hastily throw they clothes papers and eight cask of silver into the long-boat and before they be fifty yard from the ship have the melancholy satisfaction to see she go down it be a little after mid-day when we reach the town which be perch on a high bluff overlook the coast and contain about a thousand house build of bamboo and cover with palm leave we dress appearance language and the manner of we arrival excited great surprise among the native and the liveliest curiosity but with these sentiment some evidently mingled no very friendly feeling the burmese be then on the eve of a rupture with the east indium company a fact which we have not before know and mistake we for english they suppose or affect to suppose that we belong to a fleet which be about to invade they and that we ship have be sink before they eye by the tutelar divinity of the country we be immediately carry before they governor or

since happen i can so regard it -rrb- to be take for a officer of high rank and to be send the third day afterwards far into the interior that i might be more safely keep and either use as a hostage or offer for ransom as circumstance should render advantageous we hero be transport very rapidly in a palanquin for thirteen successive day when he reach mozaun a small village delightfully situate in the mountainous district between the irawaddus and saloon river where he be place under the care of a inferior magistrate who there exercise the chief authority by submissive and respectful behavior he succeed in ingratiate himself so completely with he keeper that he be regard more as one of he family than as a prisoner and be allow every indulgence consistently with he safe custody it have be one of he favorite recreation to ascend a part of the western ridge of mountain which rise in a cone about a mile and a half from the village for the purpose of enjoy the enchanting scenery that lay before he and the evening breeze which possess so delicious a degree of freshness in tropical climate here he become acquaint with a personage of whom as he exert a important influence over the future conduct of we hero it be of consequence that the reader should acquire early information : -- in a deep sequestered nook form by two spur of this mountain there live a venerable hindoo whom the people of the village call the holy hermit the favourable account i receive of he character as well as he odd course of life make I very desirous of become acquaint with he and as he be often visit by the villager i find no difficulty in get a conductor to he cell he character for sanctity together with a venerable beard might have discourage advance towards a acquaintance if he lively piercing eye a countenance expressive of great mildness and kindness of disposition and he courteous manners have not yet more strongly invite it he be indeed not averse to society though he have seem thus to fly from it and be so great a favorite with he neighbor that he cell would have be throng with visiter but for the difficulty of the approach to it as it be it be seldom resort to except for the purpose of obtain he opinion and counsel on all the serious concern of he neighbor he prescribe for the sick and often provide the medicine they require -- expound the law -- adjusted dispute -- make all they little arithmetical calculation -- give they moral instruction -- and when he could not afford they relief in they difficulty he teach they patience and give they consolation he in short unite for the simple people by whom he be surround the function of lawyer physician schoolmaster and divine and richly merit the reverential respect in which they hold he as well as they little present of egg fruit and garden stuff from the first evening that i join the party which i see clamber up the path that lead to the hermit 's cell i find myself strongly attach to this venerable man and the more so from the mystery which hang around he history it be agree that he be not a burmese none deem to know certainly where he be bear or why he come thither he own account be that he have devote himself to the service of god and in he pilgrimage over the east have select this as a spot particularly favourable to the life of quiet and seclusion he wish to lead there be one part of he story to which i could scarcely give credit it be say that in the twelve or fifteen year he have reside in this place he have be occasionally invisible for month together and no one could tell why he disappear or whither he have go at these time he cell be close and although none venture to force they way into it those who be the most prying could hear no sound indicate that he be within various be the conjecture form on the subject some suppose that he withdraw from the sight of man for the purpose of more fervent prayer and more holy meditation other that he visit he home or some other distant country the more superstitious believe that he have by a kind of metempsychosis take a new shape which by some magical or supernatural power he could assume and put off at pleasure this opinion be perhaps the most prevalent as it gain a color with these simple people from the chemical and astronomical instrument he possess in these he evidently take great pleasure and by then mean he acquire some of the knowledge by which he so often excite they admiration he soon distinguish I from the rest of he visiter by address question to I relative to my history and adventure and i in turn be gratify to have meet with one who take a interest in my concern and who alone of all i have here meet with could either enter into my feeling or comprehend my opinion we conversation be earn on in english which he speak with facility and correctness we soon find ourselves so much to each other 's taste that there be seldom a evening that i do not make he a visit and pass a hour or two in he company i learn from he that he be bear and breed at benare in hindostan that he have be intend for the priesthood and have be well instruct in the literature of the east that a course of untoward circumstance upon which he seem unwilling to dwell have change he destination and make he a wanderer on the face of the earth that in the neighbouring kingdom of siam he have form a intimacy with a learn french jesuit who have not only teach he he language but impart to he a knowledge of much of the science of europe its institution and manners that after the death of this friend he have renew he wanderings and have be detain in this village by a fit of sickness for some week he be warn that it be time to quit he rambling life this place be recommend to he both by its quiet seclusion and the unsophisticated manners of its inhabitant he determine to pass the remnant of he day here and by devote they to the purpose of piety charity and science to discharge he duty to he creator he species and himself ` for the love of knowledge ' he add ` have long be my chief source of selfish enjoyment ' the acquaintance between atterley and the brahmin ripened by degree into that close friendship which a congeniality of taste and sentiment under proper opportunity never fail to engender atterley 's visit to the hermitage become more and more frequent for upward of three year during which period the brahmin have occasionally throw out obscure hint that the time would come when we hero should be restore to liberty and that he have a important secret which he would one day communicate about this period one afternoon in the month of march when atterley repair as usual to the hermitage he find the brahmin dangerously ill of a pleuritic affection and apprehensive that the attack might prove fatal -- sit down say he on that block and listen to what i shall say to you though i shall quit this state of be for another and a better i confess that i be alarm at the thought of expire before i have a opportunity of see and converse with you i be the depository of a secret that i believe be know to no other live mortal i once determine that it should die with I and have i not meet with you it certainly should but from we first acquaintance my heart have be strongly attract towards you and as soon as i find you possess of quality to inspire esteem as well as regard i feel disposed to give you this proof of my confidence still i hesitate i first wish to deliberate on the probable effect of my disclosure upon the condition of society i see that it might produce evil as well as good but on weigh the two together i have satisfy myself that the good will preponderate and have determine to act accordingly take this key -lrb- stretch out he feverish hand -rrb- and after wait two hour in which time the medicine i have take will have either produce a good effect or put a end to my suffering you may then open that blue chest in the corner it have a false bottom on remove the paper which cover it you will find the manuscript contain the important secret together with some gold piece which i have save for the day of need -- because -- -lrb- and he smile in spite of he suffering -rrb- -- because hoarding be one of the pleasure of old man take they both and use they discreetly atterley quit the cell and wait with feverish expectation for the termination of the allot two hour when to he inexpressible delight he find on re-enter the cell that not only do the brahmin breathe but that he sleep soundly and in the course of a hour he awake almost restore to health this event however be the occasion of a more early disclosure of the brahmin 's important secret but not until he have recover he ordinary health and vigor : -- i have already tell you my dear atterley that i be bear and educate at benare and that science be there more thoroughly understand and teach than the people of the west be aware of we have for many thousand of year be good astronomer chymist mathematician and philosopher we have discover the secret of gunpowder the magnetic attraction the property of electricity long before they be hear of in europe we know more than we have reveal and much of we knowledge be deposit in the archive of the castle to which i belong but for want of language generally understand and easily learn -lrb- for these record be always write in the sanscrit that be no longer a speak language -rrb- and the diffusion which be give by the art of print these secret of science be communicate only to a few and sometimes even sleep with they author until a subsequent discovery under more favourable circumstance bring they again to light it be at this seat of science that i learn from one of we sage the physical truth which i be now about to communicate and which he discover partly by he research into the writings of ancient pundit and partly by he own extraordinary sagacity there be a principle of repulsion as well as gravitation in the earth it cause fire to rise upward it be exhibit in electricity it occasion water-spouts volcano and earthquake after much labor and research this principle have be find embody in a metallic substance which be meet with in the mountain in which we be unite with a very heavy earth and this circumstance have great influence in induce I to settle myself here this metal when separate and purify have as great a tendency to fly off from the earth as a piece of gold or lead have to approach it after make a number of curious experiment with it we bethink ourselves of put it to some use and soon contrived with the aid of it to make car and ascend into the air we be very secret in these operation for we unhappy country have then recently fall under the subjection of the british nation we apprehend that if we divulge we arcanum they would not only fly away with all we treasure whether find in palace or pagoda but also carry off the inhabitant to make they slave in they colony as they government have not then abolish the african slave trade after various trial and many successive improvement in which we desire increase with we success we determine to penetrate the aerial void as far as we could provide for that purpose a apparatus with which you will become better acquaint hereafter in the course of we experiment we discover that this same metal which be repel from the earth be in the same degree attract towards the moon for in one of we excursion still aim to ascend higher than we have ever do before we be actually carry to that satellite and if we have not there fall into a lake and we machine have not be water-tight we must have be dash to piece or drown you will find in this book he add present I with a small volume bind in green parchment and fasten with silver clasp a minute detail of the apparatus to be provide and the direction to be pursue in make this wonderful voyage i have write it since i satisfied my mind that my fear of british rapacity be unfounded and that i should do more good than harm by publish the secret but still i be not sure he add with one of he faint but significant smile that i be not actuate by a wish to immortalize my name for where be the mortal who would be indifferent to this object if he think he could attain it read the book at you leisure and study it here by the way we may remark that the kind of vehicle best adapt for conveyance through the aerial void have be a weighty stumbling block to author from the time of the eagle-mounted ganymede to that of daniel o'rourke or of the wing furnished daedalus and icarus to that of the fly turk in constantinople refer to by busbequius or of the fly artist of the happy valley in rassela when trygaeus be desirous of reach the god he erect we be tell a series of small ladder -- -lrb- greek : epeita lepta klimakium -rrb- -- but receive a severe contusion on the head from they downfall he ingeniously have recourse to a scheme of fly through the air on a colossal variety of those industrious but not over-delicate insect the _ scarabaeus carnifex _ -- the only insect notwithstanding accord to aesop privileged to ascend to the habitation of the god -- -lrb- greek : monos peteinoon eis theous aphigmeno -lrb- 2 -rrb- -rrb- most of the story of pegasus and hippogriff and of fly chariot from that of phaeton downward to astolfo 's -lrb- 3 -rrb- be evidently intend by they author as mythical not so however with bishop wilkin -- he boldly aver for several reason which he keep to himself and for other not very comprehensible to we which he detail seriously and on good grounds that it be possible to make a fly chariot in which a man may sit and give such a motion unto it as shall convey he through the air and this perhaps might be make large enough to carry diver man at the same time together with food for they _ viaticum _ and commodity for traffic it be not lucidly continue the bishop the bigness of any thing in this kind that can hinder its motion if the motive faculty be answerable thereunto we see a great ship swim as well as a small cork and a eagle fly in the air as well as a little gnat this engine may be contrived from the same principle by which archyta make a wooden dive and regiomontanus a wooden eagle i conceive it be no difficult matter -lrb- if a man have leisure -rrb- to show more particularly the means of compose it -- which want of leisure in the credulous bishop we reader will regret with we especially those inventive genius who like the projector in the reign of george i publish a scheme for manufacture pine plank from pine saw-dust or the still more ingenious undertaker of later time who propose to make _ pine plank _ out of _ oak _ saw-dust by the mere addition of a little turpentine again swift 's fly island of laputa be a phenomenon so oppose to all scientific probability and so directly at variance with natural law that it lose in interest in a direct ratio with the violence it do to we feeling nor be the mode of conveyance imagine by voltaire less incongruous than that of swift when micromega ah inhabitant of sirius whose adventure be evidently suggest by those of gulliver accompany by a inhabitant of saturn leave the latter planet they be in the first place make to leap upon the ring of saturn which they find tolerably flat comme l' a fort bien devin un illustre habitant de notre petit globe : thence they go from moon to moon and a comet pass close to one of these they throw themselves upon it with they attendant and instrument in they course they fall in with the satellite of jupiter and pass on to jupiter itself where they remain for a year but what become of the comet in the mean time we be not inform leave jupiter they coast along the planet mar and finally reach the earth where they resolve to disembark accordingly ils passrent sur la queue de la comte et trouvant une aurore borale toute prte ils se mirent dedans et arrivrent  terre sur le bord septentrional de la mer baltique -lrb- 4 -rrb- the vehicle however have not form the sole obstacle to those projector : -- the _ viaticum _ especially the food have be a difficulty not readily get over before bishop wilkin allude to he fly chariot he remark that even if man could fly the swiftest of they would probably be half a year in reach the end of he journey and hence a problem would arise how it be possible to tarry so long without sleep or diet of the former obstacle however he quickly dispose -- see we do not then spend ourselves in any labor we shall not it may be _ need _ the refreshment of sleep : but if we do we can not desire a softer bed than the air where we may repose ourselves firmly and safely as in we chamber of the latter he find somewhat more difficulty in dispose -- and here it be considerable that since we body will then be devoid of gravity and other impediment of motion we shall not at all spend ourselves in any labor and so consequently not much need the reparation of diet but may perhaps live altogether without it as those creature have do who by reason of they sleep for many day together have not spend any spirit and so not want any food which be commonly related of serpent crocodile bear cuckoo swallow and such like to this purpose mendoca reckon up diver strange relation as that of epimenide who be story to have sleep seventy-five year and another of a rustic in germany who be accidentally cover with a hay-rick sleep there for all the autumn and the winter follow without any nourishment or if we must need feed upon something else why may not smell nourish we plutarch and pliny and diver other ancient tell we of a nation in indium that live only upon please odour and it be the common opinion of physician that these do strangely both strengthen and repair the spirit hence be it that democritus be able for diver day together to feed himself with the mere smell of hot bread -lrb- 5 -rrb- or if it be necessary that we stomach must receive the food why then it be not impossible that the purity of the etherial air be not mix with any improper vapor may be so agreeable to we body as to yield we sufficient nourishment with many other argument of the like nature the bishop ultimately however sever the knot by the suggestion of he fly chariot which he make large enough -lrb- for _ ce n'est que le premier pas qui coute _ -rrb- to carry not only food for the _ viaticum _ of the passenger but also commodity for they traffic infinitely more ingenuity do the great comic poet of antiquity display when he select the _ scarabaeus _ as the food which have already serve the purpose of digestion with the rider be still capable of afford nutrition to the animal : -- -lrb- greek : nun d'att ` a auto kataphagoo ta sitia toutoisi tois autoisi touton chortasoo -lrb- 6 -rrb- -rrb- now all these scheme ingenious as they may be be objectionable for the same reason as the fly island of laputa -- they glaring violation of verisimilitude and many of they of possibility in these respects that of the author of the work before we be liable to less objection : he only resort to a extension of avowed physical principle and if we could suppose a substance which instead of gravitate towards the earth be repel from it and attract towards the moon -lrb- certainly a difficult _ premier pa _ -rrb- the remainder of the machinery for reach that luminary would not be inconsistent with probability or the known law of physics but to return to the narrative : -- the brahmin have give atterley a description of some of the remarkable object which he meet with in he voyage to the moon express he anxiety to repeat it for the purpose of ascertain some fact about which he have be speculate as well as of remove the incredulity with which he could not but perceive he story have impress he hearer notwithstanding he belief in the hermit 's integrity when atterley eagerly catch at the proposal they preparation however require time as well as considerable skill not only for the construction of the vehicle but also to avoid suspicion and interruption from the governor of merguus -- and the priesthood who possess the usual oriental superstition and intolerance for the construction of they apparatus they have recourse to a ingenious artificer in copper and other metal whose child the brahmin have be instrumental in cure of a chronic disease and in whose fidelity as well as good will they could securely rely the coppersmith agree to undertake the work we want do for a moderate compensation but we do not think it prudent to inform he of we object which he suppose be to make some philosophical experiment it be forthwith arrange that he should occasionally visit the hermit to receive instruction as if for the purpose of ask medical advice during this interval my mind be absorb with we project and when in company i be so thoughtful and abstracted that it have since seem strange to I that sing fou 's suspicion that i be plan my escape be not more excite at length by dint of great exertion in about three month every thing be in readiness and we determine on the follow night to set out on we perilous expedition the machine in which we propose to embark be a copper vessel that would have be a exact cube of six foot if the corner and edge have not be round off it have a opening large enough to receive we body which be close by double slide pannel with quilted cloth between they when these be properly adjust the machine be perfectly air-tight and strong enough by means of iron bar run alternately inside and out to resist the pressure of the atmosphere when the machine should be exhaust of its air as we take the precaution to prove by the aid of a air pump on the top of the copper chest and on the outside we have as much of the lunar metal -lrb- which i shall henceforth call _ lunarium _ -rrb- as we find by calculation and experiment would overcome the weight of the machine as well as its contents and take we to the moon on the third day as the air which the machine contain would not be sufficient for we respiration more than about six hour and the chief part of the space we be to pass through be a mere void we provide ourselves with a sufficient supply by condense it in a small globular vessel make partly of iron and partly of lunarium to take off its weight on my return i give mr jacob perkin who be now in england a hint of this plan of condensation and it have there obtain he great celebrity this fact i should not have think it worth while to mention have he not take the sole merit of the invention to himself at least i can not hear that in he numerous public notice he have ever mention my name but to return a small circular window make of a single piece of thick clear glass be neatly fit on each of the six side several piece of lead be securely fasten to screw which pass through the bottom of the machine as well as a thick plank the screw be so contrived that by turn they in one direction the piece of lead attach to they be immediately disengage from the hook with which they be connect the piece of lunarium be fasten in like manner to screw which pass through the top of the machine so that by turn they in one direction those metallic piece would fly into the air with the velocity of a rocket the brahmin take with he a thermometer two telescope one of which project through the top of the machine and the other through the bottom a phosphoric lamp pen ink and paper and some light refreshment sufficient to supply we for some day the moon be then in she third quarter and near the zenith : it be of course a little after midnight and when the coppersmith and he family be in they soundest sleep that we enter the machine in about a hour more we have the door secure and every thing arrange in its place when cut the cord which fasten we to the ground by means of small steel blade which work in the end of other screw we rise from the earth with a whiz sound and a sensation at first of very rapid ascent but after a short time we be scarcely sensible of any motion in the machine except when we change we place after the apprehension of atterley occasion by the novelty and danger of he situation have partly subside he be enable with mingled awe and admiration to contemplate the magnificent spectacle beneath he as the earth turn round its axis during they ascent every part of its surface come successively under view at nine o'clock the whole of indium be to the west of they its river resemble small filament of silver and the red sea a narrow plate of the same metal the peninsula of indium be of a dark and arabium of a light grayer green and the sun 's ray strike on the atlantic emit a effulgence dazzling to the eye on look some time afterwards through the telescope they observe the african continent at its northern edge fringe as it be with green then a dull white belt mark the great sahara or desert and then it exhibit a deep green to its most southern extremity the morea and grecian archipelago now fall under they telescope and gradually the whole mediterranean and arabian gulf -- the great media separate africa from europe and asia the political division of these quarter of the world be of course undistinguishable and few of the natural be discernible by the naked eye the alp be mark by a white streak though less bright than the water by the aid of the glass they could just discern the danube the nile and a river which empty itself into the gulf of guinea and which atterley take to be the niger but the other stream be not perceptible the most conspicuous object of the solid part of the globe be the great desert the whole of africa however appear of a brighter hue than either asia or europe i be strike too with the vast disproportion which the extent of the several country of the earth bear to the part they have act in history and the influence they have exert on human affair the british island have diminish to a speck and france be little larger yet a few year ago it seem at least to we in the united state as if there be no other nation on the earth the brahmin who be well read in european history on my make a remark on this subject remind I that athen and sparta have once obtain almost equal celebrity although they be so small as not now to be visible as i slowly pass the telescope over the face of europe i picture to myself the fat plodding hollander -- the patient contemplative german -- the ingenious sensual italian -- the temperate swiss -- the haughty superstitious spaniard -- the sprightly self-complacent frenchman -- the sullen and reflect englishman -- who monopolise nearly all the science and literature of the earth to which they bear so small a proportion as the atlantic fall under we view two faint circle on each side of the equator be to be perceive by the naked eye they be less bright than the rest of the ocean the brahmin suggest that they might be current which bring to my memory dr franklin 's conjecture on the subject now completely verify by this circular line of vapor as it have be previously render probable by the float substance which have be occasionally pick up at great distance from the place where they have be throw into the ocean the circle be whiter and more distinct where the gulf stream run parallel to the american coast and gradually grow fainter as it pass along the bank of newfoundland to the coast of europe where take a southerly direction the line of the circle be barely discernible a similar circle of vapor though less define and complete be perceive in the south atlantic ocean by degree the traveller see one half of the broad expanse of the pacific which glisten like quicksilver or polish steel and subsequently the middle of the pacific lay immediately beneath they the irregular distribution of land and water on the globe the expanse of ocean here be twice as large as in any other part give occasion to some amusing discussion on the various theory of cosmogony to which we can only refer the reader weary however by these and other discussion atterley sleep for six hour and on awake find the brahmin busy in calculate they progress after which the latter lay down and soon fall into a tranquil sleep have previously request that he might be awaken at the expiration of three hour or sooner if any thing of moment should occur atterley now look down again through the telescope and find the earth surprisingly diminish in its apparent dimension from the increase rapidity of they ascent the eastern coast of asia be still full in view as well as the whole figure of that extensive continent -- of new-holland of ceylon and of borneo but the smaller island be invisible i strain my eye to no purpose to follow the indentation of the coast accord to the map before I the great bay and promontory could alone be perceive the burman empire in one of the insignificant village of which i have be confine for a few year be now reduce to a speck the agreeable hour i have pass with the brahmin with the little daughter of sing fou and my rambling over the neighbouring height all recur to my mind and i almost regret the pleasure i have relinquish i try with more success to beguile the time by make note in my journal and after have devote about a hour to this object i return to the telescope and now take occasion to examine the figure of the earth near the pole with a view of discover whether its form favor captain symme 's theory of a aperture exist there and i be convince that that ingenious gentleman be mistaken time pass so heavily during these solitary occupation that i look at my watch every five minute and could scarcely be persuade it be not out of order i then take up my little bible -lrb- which have always be my travel companion -rrb- read a few chapter in st matthew and find my feeling tranquillize and my courage increase the desire hour at length arrive when on wake the old man he alertly raise himself up and at the first view of the diminish appearance of the earth observe that we journey be a third over as to time but not as to distance after have again compose himself to rest for about four hour atterley be awaken by the brahmin in whose arm he find himself and on look around discover that he be lie on what have be the ceiling of the chamber which still however feel like the bottom the reason of this phenomenon be thus explain to he by the brahmin -- we have while you be asleep pass the middle point between the earth 's and the moon 's attraction and we now gravitate less towards we own planet than -lrb- to -rrb- she satellite i take the precaution to move you before you fall by you own gravity from what be lately the bottom to that which be now so and to keep you in this place until you be retain in it by the moon 's attraction for though you fall would have be at this point like that of a feather yet it would have give you some shock and alarm the machine therefore have undergo no change in its position or course -- the change be altogether in we feeling the whole face of the moon atterley now find to be entirely change and on look through the upper telescope the earth present a appearance not very dissimilar but the outline of she continent and ocean be still perceptible in different shades and capable of be readily recognize the bright glare of the sun however make the surface of both body somewhat dim and pale after a short interval i again look at the moon and find not only its magnitude very greatly increase but that it be begin to present a more beautiful spectacle the sun 's ray fall obliquely on she disc so that by a large part of its surface not reflect the light i see every object on it so far as i be enable by the power of my telescope its mountain lake sea continent and island be faintly though not indistinctly trace and every moment bring forth something new to catch my eye and awaken my curiosity the whole face of the moon be of a silvery hue relieved and vary by the softest and most delicate shades no cloud nor speck of vapor intercept my view one of my exclamation of delight awaken the brahmin who quickly arise and look down on the resplendent orb below we observe that we must soon begin to slacken the rapidity of we course by throw out ballast the moon 's dimension now rapidly increase the separate mountain which form the ridge and chain on she surface begin to be plainly visible through the telescope whilst on the shaded side several volcano appear upon she disc like the flash of we fire-fly or rather like the twinkling of star in a frosty night he remark that the extraordinary clearness and brightness of the object on the moon 's surface be owe to she have a less extensive and more transparent atmosphere than the earth : add -- ` the difference be so great that some of we astronomical observer have be induce to think she have none if that however have be the case we voyage would have be impracticable ' after gaze for some time on this magnificent spectacle with admiration and delight one of they ball of _ lunarium _ be let off for the purpose of check they velocity at this time the brahmin suppose they be not more than four thousand mile from the nearest point of the moon 's surface in about four hour more she apparent magnitude be so great that they could see she by look out of either of the side window she disc have now lose its former silvery appearance and begin to look more like that of the earth when see at the same distance it be a most gratifying spectacle to behold the object successively rise to we view and steadily enlarge in they dimension the rapidity with which we approach the moon impress I in spite of myself with the alarming sensation of fall and i find myself alternately agitate with a sense of this danger and with impatience to take a nearer view of the new object that greet my eye the brahmin be wholly absorb in calculation for the purpose of adjust we velocity to the distance we have to go he estimate of which however be in a great measure conjectural and ever and anon he would let off a ball of the lunar metal after a few hour we be so near the moon that every object be see in we glass as distinctly as the shell or marine plant through a piece of shallow sea-water though the eye could take in but a small part of she surface and the horizon which bound we view be rapidly contract on let the air escape from we machine it do not now rush out with the same violence as before which show that we be within the moon 's atmosphere this as well as rid ourselves of the metal ball aid in check we progress by and by we be within a few mile of the highest mountain when we throw down so much of we ballast that we soon appear almost stationary the brahmin remark that he should avail himself of the current of air we might meet with to select a favourable place for landing though we be necessarily attract towards the same region in consequence of the same half of the moon 's surface be always turn towards the earth the brahmin now point out the necessity of look out for some cultivate field in one of the valley they be approach where they might rely on be not far distant from some human habitation and on escape the peril necessarily attendant on a descent amongst rock tree and building a gentle breeze now arise as appear by they horizontal motion which waft they at the rate of about ten mile a hour over a ridge of mountain a lake a thick wood & c they at length reach a cultivate region which the brahmin recognize as the country of the morosof the place they be anxious to visit by now let off two ball of lead to the _ earth _ they descend rapidly and when they be sufficiently near the ground to observe that it be a fit place for landing open the door of they balloon and find the air of the moon inconceivably sweet and refreshing they now let loose one of they lower ball which somewhat retard they descent and in a few minute more be within twenty yard of the ground they let go the largest ball of lunarium which have a cord attach to it serve in lieu of a grapnel by this they draw themselves down be disengage from the machine in a twinkling and land safe and sound on we presume _ luna firma _ have see we traveller securely deposit in the moon we may remark that in the passage from the earth various topic of a interesting and important character be canvass by the brahmin and he companion one _ on the cause of national superiority _ suggest by the view of africa and a comparison between that benighted country and other more illuminate be especially worthy of attention as contain a condensed and philosophical view of the subject eloquently and perspicuously convey the view of america suggest some remark on the _ political peculiarity of the united state _ with speculation on they future destiny a lively description of the contrast between the circumstance of the kamtschadale -- the shudder tenant of the frigid zone and the gay voluptuous native of the sandwich and other isle within the tropics -- the one pass he life in toil privation and care -- the other in ease abundance and enjoyment -- lead to a similar conclusion to that express by goldsmith : -- and yet perhaps if country we compare and estimate the blessing which they share though patriot flatter still shall wisdom find a equal portion deal to all mankind a disquisition also take place -- _ whether indium or egypt be the parent of the art _ this lead they to refer to the strange custom in the country of the brahmin which impel the widow to throw herself on the funeral pile and be consume with she husband : -- i tell he say atterley that it have often be represent as compulsory -- or in other word that it be say that every art and means be resort to for the purpose of work on the mind of the woman by she relative aid by the priest who would be naturally gratify by such signal triumph of religion over the strongest feeling of nature he admit that these engine be sometimes put in operation and that they impel to the sacrifice some who be waver but insist that in a majority of instance the _ suttee _ be voluntary ` woman ' say he ` be bring up from they infancy to regard we sex as they superior and to believe that they greatest merit consist in entire devotion to they husband under this feeling and have at the same time they attention frequently turn to the chance of such a calamity they be better prepare to meet it when it occur how few of the officer in you western army ever hesitate to march at the head of they man on a forlorn hope and how many even court the danger for the sake of the glory nay you tell I that accord to you code of honor if one man insult another he who give the provocation and he who receive it rather than be disgrace in the eye of they countryman will go out and quietly shoot at each other with fire-arm till one of they be kill or wound and this too in many case when the injury have be merely nominal if you show such a contempt of death in deference to a custom found in mere caprice can it be wonder that a woman should show it in the first paroxysm of she grief for the loss of he to whom be devoted every thought word and action of she life and who next to she god be the object of she idolatry my dear atterley ' he continue with emotion ` you little know the strength of woman 's love ' other topic of interest be also discuss with the like ingenuity after this episode it be time for we to return to we traveller whose feeling the moment they touch the ground repay they for all they have endure atterley look around with the most intense curiosity but nothing he see surprised he so much as to find so little that be surprising : -- vegetation insect and other animal be pretty much of the same character as those he have before see but on better acquaintance he find the difference greater than he have at first suppose have refresh themselves with the remains of they store and secure the door of the machine they bent they course to the town of alamatua about three mile distant which seem to contain about two thousand house and to be not quite as large as albany the people be tall and thin and of a pale yellowish complexion they garment light loose and flowing and not very different from those of the turk they subsist chiefly on a vegetable diet live about as long as we do on the earth notwithstanding the great difference of climate and other circumstance and do not in they manners habit or character differ more from the inhabitant of this globe than some of the latter do from one another they government anciently monarchical be now popular they code of law very intricate they language naturally soft and musical have be yet further refine by the cultivation of letter and they have a variety of sect in religion politics and philosophy the lunarian do not as butler have it -- when the sun shine hot at noon inhabit cellar under ground of eight mile deep and eighty round but one half of they house be beneath the surface partly for the purpose of screen they from the continued action of the sun 's ray and partly on account of the earthquake cause by volcano the window of the house consist of opening in the wall sloping so much upward that whilst they freely admit the light and air the sun be completely exclude as soon as they be espy by the native great curiosity be of course excite not however to so troublesome a extent as might have be from the circumstance of the brahmin 's have visit the moon before hence he be soon recognize by some of he acquaintance and conduct to the house of the governor by whom they be graciously receive and who begin a course of interesting inquiry regard the affair of the earth but a gentleman whom they afterwards understand to be one of the leader of the popular party come in he soon despatch they have however first direct a officer to furnish they with all that be necessary for they accommodation at the public expense which act of hospitality they have reason to fear occasion he some trouble and perplexity at the succeed election a more minute description follow of the dress of the male and female lunarian especially of that of the latter to which we can merely refer the reader there be one portion however of the inhabitant with whom the reader must be make acquaint inasmuch as they form some of the author 's most prominent character a large number of lunarian it seem be bear without any intellectual vigor and wander about like so many automaton under the care of the government until illumine by the mental ray from some terrestrial brain through the mysterious influence which the moon be know to exercise on we planet but in this case the inhabitant of the earth lose what he of the moon gain the ordinary portion of understand be divide between two and as might be expect there be a most exact conformity between the man of the earth and he counterpart in the moon in all they principle of action and mode of thinking : -- these glonglim as they be call after they have be thus imbue with intellect be hold in peculiar respect by the vulgar and be think to be in every way superior to those whose understanding be entire the law by which two object so far apart operate on each other have be as yet but imperfectly develop and the wilder they freak the more they be the object of wonder and admiration now and then though very rarely the man of the earth regain the intellect he have lose in which case he lunar counterpart return to he former state of imbecility both party be entirely unconscious of the change -- one of what he have lose and the other of what he have gain -lrb- 7 -rrb- the belief of the influence of the moon on the human intellect the brahmin remark may be perceive in the opinion of the vulgar and in many of the ordinary form of expression and he take occasion to remark that these very opinion as well as some obscure hint in the sanscrit give countenance to the idea that they be not the only voyager to the moon but that on the contrary the voyage have be perform in remote antiquity and the lunarian we be tell have a similar tradition many ordinary form of expression be adduce in support of these idea thus say the brahmin it be generally believe throughout all asia that the moon have a influence on the brain : and when a man be of insane mind we call he a lunatic one of the curse of the common people be ` may the moon eat up you brain ' and in china they say of a man who have do any act of egregious folly ` he be gather wool in the moon ' i be strike with these remark and tell the hermit that the language of europe afford the same indirect evidence of the fact he mention -- that my own language especially abound with expression which could be explain on no other hypothesis : for besides the term lunacy lunatic and the suppose influence of the moon on the brain when we see symptom of a disorder intellect we say the mind _ wander _ which evidently allude to a part of it rambling to a distant region as be the moon we say too a man be _ out of he head _ that be he mind be in another man 's head must of course be out of he own to know no more than the man in the moon be a proverbial expression for ignorance and be without mean unless it be consider to refer to the glonglim -lrb- 8 -rrb- we say that a insane man be ` distract ' by which we mean that he mind be draw two different way so also we call a lunatic _ a man beside himself _ which most distinctly express the two distinct body he mind now animate there be moreover many other analogous expression as ` moonstruck ' ` deranged ' ` extravagant ' and some other which altogether form a mass of concur testimony that it be impossible to resist leave this ingenious _ badinage _ with the defense of the serious and sentimental schiller hoher sinn liegt oft in kindischen spiele we return to we traveller who at they lodgings meet with a instance of _ lunar puritanism _ -- the family eat those portion of fruit vegetable & c which be throw away by we and _ vice versa _ from a persuasion that all pleasure receive through the sens be sinful and that man never appear so acceptable in the sight of the deity as when he reject all the delicacy of the palate as well as other sensual gratification and impose on himself that food to which he feel naturally most repugnant _ avarice _ be satirize by the story of one of these glonglim who be occupy in make nail and then drop they into a well -- refuse to exchange they for bread or clothes notwithstanding he starve haggard appearance and evident desire for the food proffer : -- mettant toute sa gloire et son souverain bien a grossir un trsor quus ne lui sert de rien and this be follow by a picture of _ reckless prodigality _ in another glonglim we pass over the description of the physical peculiarity of the moon which seem to be accord to the receive opinion of astronomer as well as the satire on _ national prejudice _ in the person of the hilliboo and moriboo and that on the godwinian system of moral a indisposition experience by atterley occasion he introduction to vindar -lrb- 9 -rrb- a celebrated physician botanist & c on whose opinion we have a keen satire on leave vindar 's house they observe a short man -lrb- napoleon -rrb- prepare to climb to the top of a plane tree on which there be one of the tail feather of a flamingo and this he would only mount in one way -- on the shoulder of he man : -- i could not see this rash glonglim attempt to climb that dangerous ladder without feel alarm for he safety at first all seem to go on very well but just as he be about to lay hold of the gaudy prize there arise a sudden squall which throw both he and he supporter into confusion and the whole living pyramid come to the ground together many be kill -- some be wound and bruise polenap himself by light on he man who serve he as cushion barely escape with life but he receive a fracture in the upper part of he head and a dislocation of the hip which will not only prevent he from ever climb again but probably make he a cripple for life the brahmin and i endeavor to give the sufferer some assistance but this be render unnecessary by the crowd which they cry and lamentation bring to they relief i think that the author of so much mischief would have be stone on the spot but to my surprise he servant seem to feel as much for he honor as they own safety and warmly interfere in he behalf until they have somewhat appease the rage of the surround multitude the _ absurdity _ of the _ physiognomical system _ of lavater and of the _ craniological system _ of mm gall and spurzheim be not likely to escape animadversion in a work of general satire fruitful as they have already be in such theme the representative of the former be a fortune-telling philosopher avarabet -lrb- lavater -rrb- whose course of proceeding be to examine the finger nail and accord to they form color thickness surface grain and other property to determine the character and destiny of those who consult he and that of the latter

in lay hold of what they can of each other 's flock and herd and do as much mischief as possible by which both party of necessity suffer a visit to a projector in building husbandry and cookery introduce we to some invention not unworthy of the occupation of the courtier of _ la reine quinte _ or of the professor of the academy of lagado the doctrine of the aerial formation of meteoric stone receive too a pass notice from we author who be clearly no supporter of it it be a long time before the ancient receive credit for they story of shower of stone and all be ready to joke with butler at the story of the thracian rock which fall in the river aego : -- for anaxagora long agon saw hill as well as you i ` th ' moon and hold the sun be but a piece of red hot iron as big as greece believ

they have be designate have now be find in almost every region and climate of the globe -- from arabium to the farthest point of baffin 's bay and this very circumstance would seem to be oppose to they aerial origin unless we be to suppose that they can be form in every state and in the opposite extreme of the atmosphere the brahmin assign they a lunar origin and add we party be greatly amuse

divide disease into class which tend but to produce confusion of idea and a unscientific practice the enthusiasm of the justly celebrated individual -- the original of this portrait be so great that the slightest datum be sufficient for the formation of some of he most elaborate _ hypothesis _ -- for _ theory _ they could not properly be call and accordingly many of he beautiful and ingenious superstructure be now prostrate leave in open day the insufficiency of they foundation one of the most striking example of this nature be he belief that the black color of the negro be a disease which depletion properly exercise might be capable of remedy -- a scheme not a whit more feasible than that of the courtier of _ la reine quinte _ refer to by rabelai who make blackamoor white as fast as hop by just rub they stomach with the bottom of a pannier the satire here be not so fortunately display as in other instance owe probably to the difficulty of say any thing new on so hackneyed a subject for it have ever happen that -- the galenist and paracelsian condemn the way each other deal in the affair conclude by the doctor quarrel and in the mean time the patient profit by some simple remedy administer by the brahmin and a hour 's rest be so much refresh that he consider himself out of danger and have no need of medical assistance _ pestolozzus 's system of education _ be with justice satirize since instead of afford facility to the student as the superficial observer might fancy it retard he acquisition of knowledge by teach he to exercise he external sens rather than he

with rose water and the other with a black offensive fluid : the rose water be squirt at the favorite candidate and voter -- the other fluid on the opposite party all these be under regular discipline

curiosity atterley become anxious to return to he native planet and accordingly urge the brahmin to lose no time in prepare for they departure they be soon however inform that a man high in office by way of affect political sagacity have propose to detain they on the ground that when such voyage as they 's be show to be practicable the inhabitant of the earth who be so much more numerous than those of the moon might invade the latter with a large army for the purpose of rapine and contest but notwithstanding the influence of this sapient politician they finally obtain leave to quit the moon whenever they think proper have take a respectful or affectionate leave of all they lunarian friend and get every thing in readiness -- at midnight of the twentieth of August they again enter they copper _ balloon _ and after they have ascend until the face of the moon look like one vast lake of melted silver with here and there small piece of grayish dross float on it atterley remind the brahmin of a former promise to detail the history of he early life to which he assent : -- of this perhaps the most interesting part of the book to the general reader we regret that we limit will only admit of we give a very condensed and imperfect narrative gurameer the brahmin be bear at benare he be the only son of a priest of vishnu of rank and be himself intend for the priesthood at school he meet with a boy of the name of _ balty mahu _ between whom and himself a degree of rivalry and subsequently the most decide enmity exist -- a circumstance that decide the character of gurameer 's subsequent life they afterwards meet at college where a more extended theater be afford for the exercise of balty mahu 's malignity during a vacation gurameer be on a visit to a uncle in the country one day when the family have go to witness a grand spectacle in honor of a important festival in they calendar which he could not himself attend consistently with the rule of he caste be tempt to visit the desert zenana or lady ' apartment where he accidentally meet with a beautiful young female the acquaintance thus begin soon ripened into intimacy by means of walk in the garden contrived by fatima one of he female cousin at length they be constrain to separate veenah -lrb- for so the young lady be name -rrb- return to benare whither gurameer soon follow she on make he father acquaint with he attachment the latter endeavor to persuade he to overcome it and inform he that veenah 's father be avaricious and a bigot and hence that he would probably be prejudice against he owe to some imputation which have be cast on gurameer 's religious creed and industriously circulate by he old enemy balty mahu who prove to be the cousin of veenah these consideration prevail upon gurameer to defer any application to veenah 's father until the suspicion regard he faith have either die away or be falsify by he scrupulous observance of all religious duty this resolution he determine to communicate to he mistress accordingly in the evening he betake himself to the quarter of the city where veenah 's father life and walk to and fro before the house soon discover that he be recognize by a cord let down from the window he convey a letter to she which the follow evening she answer and thus a regular correspondence be keep up which by the exercise it afford to they imagination and the difficulty attendant upon it inflamed they passion to the highest pitch he have however soon the misfortune to be discover by balty mahu and in consequence veenah be debar from pen and ink but contrive to acquaint she lover that they intercourse have be discover by a short note write with a burnt stick gurameer now go in despair to veenah 's father from whom he experience a haughty repulse and who in the follow night secretly leave the city with he daughter embark on the gange and take measure to prevent the discovery of the place of he retreat at the expiration of two or three month a end be put to gurameer 's doubt and apprehension by he return with he daughter and son-in-law -- a rich omrah four time she age after the first ebullition of rage have subside he love return but he be never able to succeed in obtain a interview with veenah by he cousin fatima he learn the circumstance of veenah 's marriage and the deception which have be practice on she aid by the unbounded authority which parent exercise in eastern country the unhappy veenah as firm in she principle as she be gentle in disposition refuse to see he tell he say she that heaven have forbid it and to its decree we be bind to submit i be now the wife of another and it be we duty to forget all that be past but if this be possible my heart tell I it can be only by we never meet gurameer now fall into a state of settle melancholy and consent to travel more for the purpose of please he parent than from any concern for he own health but travel have little effect -- he carry a barb arrow in he heart and the greater the effort to extract it the more they rankle the wound when so much emaciate that he be not expect to live a month he take a voyage coastwise to madras and on he arrival there learn that balty mahu have recently leave that place this intelligence operate like a charm the desire of revenge rouse all he energy and become he master passion he immediately set off in pursuit but although often near could never overtake he he health rapidly improve and at length he hear that the old omrah 's health be rapidly decline this information awaken new thought and hope and balty mahu be forget he hasten hack to benare and when near the city hear two merchant in conversation remark that the omrah be dead and that he widow be the next day to perform the _ suttee _ he immediately mount he horse and reach the city the next morning at sunrise in the street he mix with the throng -- hear veenah pity she father blame and himself lament he now see veenah approach the funeral pile who at the well know sound of he voice shriek out he live he live and would have attempt to save herself from the flame but the shout of the surround multitude and the sound of the instrument drown she voice he now attempt to approach the pile for the purpose of rescue she but be forcibly hold back until the wretched veenah be envelop in flame on he again attempt to reach the pile he be charge with profanation and on balty mahu 's make he appearance and encourage the charge in frantic desperation he seize a scymetar from one of the guard and plunge it in he breast the influence of he friend and the sacred character of person of he caste save the brahmin from capital punishment but he be banish from hindostan he now remove to the kingdom of ava where he continue so long as he parent live after which he visit several country both of asia and europe and in one of he journey have discover lunarium ore in the mountain near mogaun he determine to pass the remainder of he day in that secluded retreat -- so end this strange eventful history when the brahmin terminate he narrative the extended map beneath they be already assume a distinct and varied appearance : -- the brahmin have apply he eye to the telescope and make a brief calculation of we progress consider that twenty-four hour more if no accident interrupt we would end we voyage part of which interval i pass in make note in my journal and in contemplate the different section of we many peopled globe as they present themselves successively to the eye it be my wish to land on the american continent and if possible in the united state but the brahmin put a end to that hope by remind I that we should be attract towards the equator and that we have to choose between asia africa and south america and that we only course would be to check the progress of we car over the country of greatest extent through which the equinoctial circle might pass say which he relapse into he melancholy silence and i betook myself once more to the telescope with a bosom throb with emotion i see that we be descend towards the american continent when we be about ten or twelve mile from the earth the brahmin arrest the progress of the car and we hover over the broad atlantic look down on the ocean the first object which present itself to my eye be a small one-masted shallop which be buffetting the wave in a south-westerly direction i presume it be a new-england trader on a voyage to some part of the republic of colombium : and by way of divert my friend from he melancholy reverie i tell he some of the many story which be current respect the enterprise and ingenuity of this portion of my countryman and above all they adroitness at a bargain ` methink ' say the brahmin ` you be describe a native of canton or pekin but ' add he after a short pause ` though to a superficial observer man appear to put on very different character to a philosopher he be every where the same -- for he be every where mould by the circumstance in which he be place thus let he be in a situation that be propitious to commerce and the habit of traffic produce in he shrewdness and address trade be carry on chiefly in town because it be there carry on most advantageously this situation give the trader a more intimate knowledge of he species -- a more ready insight into character and of the mode of operate on it he chief purpose be to buy as cheap and to sell as dear as he can and he be often able to heighten the recommendation or soften the defect of some of the article in which he deal without danger of immediate detection or in other word big representation have some influence with he customer he avail himself of this circumstance and thus acquire the habit of lie but as he be studious to conceal it he become wary ingenious and cunning it be thus that the phenician the carthagenian the dutch the chinese the new-englander and the modern greek have always be regard as incline to petty fraud by they less commercial neighbor ' i mention the english nation ` if the english ' say he interrupt I ` who be the most commercial people of modern time have not acquire the same character it be because they be as distinguish for other thing as for traffic : they be not merely a commercial people -- they be also agricultural warlike and literary and thus the natural tendency of commerce be mutually counteract ' we afterwards descend slowly the prospect beneath we become more beautiful than my humble pen can hope to describe or will even attempt to portray in a short time after we be in sight of venezuelum we meet with the trade wind and be carry by they forty or fifty mile inland where with some difficulty and even danger we land the brahmin and myself remain together two day and part -- he to explore the ande to obtain additional light on the subject of he hypothesis and i on the wing of impatience to visit once more my long-deserted family and friend but before we separation i assist my friend in conceal we aerial vessel and receive a promise from he to visit and perhaps spend with I the evening of he life of my journey home little remain to be say from the citizen of colombium i experienced kindness and attention and means of conveyance to caracca where embark on board the brig juno captain withers i once more set foot in new-york on the 18th of August 1826 after a absence of four year resolve for the rest of my life to travel only in book and persuade from experience that the satisfaction which the wanderer gain from actually behold the wonder and curiosity of distant clime be dearly buy by the sacrifice of all the comfort and delight of home we have thus place before the reader a analysis of this interesting satirical romance the time and space we have occupy sufficiently indicate the favourable sentiment respect it with which we have be impressed of the execution of the satire from the several extract we have give the reader will himself be enable to judge this be of course unequal but generally felicitous in the personal allusion which occur through the work the author exhibit as we have before notice a freedom from malice and all uncharitableness and in many of they have attain that happy _ desideratum _ which dryden consider a matter of so much difficulty : -- how easy be it he observe to call rogue and villain and that wittily but how hard to make a man appear a fool a blockhead or a knave without use any of those opprobrious term to spare the grossness of the name and to do the thing yet more severely be to draw a full face and to make the nose and cheek stand out and yet not to employ any depth of shadow this be the mystery of that noble trade which yet no master can teach to he apprentice he may give the rule but the scholar be never the nearer in he practice neither be it true that this fineness of raillery be offensive a witty man be tickle while he be hurt in this manner and a fool feel it not : the occasion of a offence may possibly be give but he can not take it if it be grant that in effect this way do more mischief -- that a man be secretly wound and though he be not sensible himself yet the malicious world will find it out for he yet there be still a vast difference betwixt the slovenly butchering of a man and the fineness of a stroke that separate the head from the body and leave it stand in its place a man may be capable as jack ketch 's wife say of he servant of a plain piece of work a bare hanging but to make a malefactor die sweetly be only belong to she husband -lrb- 11 -rrb- in conclusion we must express we regret that the author should not have add note to the work -- the want of they will be seriously feel by every one some of the satire indeed must escape the reader unless he pay a degree of attention which note would have render unnecessary in he next edition we trust that this deficiency may be supply and we anticipate as much instruction and entertainment from the wide scope which such a undertaking will afford as we have derive from the perusal of the text cheerfully would we extend to he if require the leisure claim by spenser after he have compose the first six book of he _ faerie queene _ provide he would promise we similar condition : -- after so long a race as i have run through faery land which those six book compile give leave to rest I be half foredonne and gather to myself new breath awhile then as a steed refresh after toyle out of my prison will i break anew and stoutly will that second work assoyle with strong endeavor and attention due \* \* \* \* \* -lrb-
