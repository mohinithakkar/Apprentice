but he that findeth a treasure be above they both -- _ ecclesiasticus _ of course they be bind for the klondyke every creature in the north-west be bind for the klondyke man from the south too and man from the east have leave they plough and they pen they factory pulpit and easy-chair each man like a magnetic needle suddenly set free and turn sharply to the north all set point the self-same way since that July day in '97 when the _ excelsior _ sail into san francisco harbor bring from the uttermost region at the top of the map close upon a million dollar in nugget and in gold-dust some distance this side of the arctic circle on the right bank of the yukon a little detachment of that great army press northward have be wreck early in the month of September they have realize on leave the ocean-going ship that land they at st michael 's island -lrb- near the mouth of the great river -rrb- that they could not hope to reach dawson that year but instead of get cold foot as the phrase for discouragement run and turn back as thousand do or put in the winter on the coast they determine with a eye to the spring rush to cover as many as possible of the seventeen hundred mile of waterway before navigation close they know in a vague way that winter would come early but they have not count on the big September storm that dash they heavy-laden boat against the floe-ice ultimately drive they ashore and nearly cost the little party they life on that last day of the long struggle up the stream a stiff north-easter be cut the middle reach of the mighty river two mile wide here into a choppy and dangerous sea day by day five man in the two little boat have keep serious eye on the shore then come the morning when out of the monotonous cold and snow-flurries something new appear a narrow white rim form on the river margin -- the first ice winter begin to show he tooth say one man with a effort at jocosity day by day nearer come the menace narrower and swifter still run the deep black water strip between the encroach ice-line but the thought that each day 's sailing or rowing mean many day nearer the klondyke seem to inspire a superhuman energy day by day each man have feel and no man yet have say we must camp to-night for eight month they have look landward shiver and hold on they way but on this particular morning when they take in sail they realize it be to be that abomination of desolation on the shore or death and one or other speedily nearer the white tooth gleam fiercer the gale swifter the current sweeping back the boat the _ mary c _ be leave behind fight for life while it seem as if no human power could keep the _ tulare _ from be hurl against the western shore twice in spite of all they could do she be drive within a few foot of what look like certain death with a huge effort that last time she little crew have just get she well in mid-stream when a heavy roller break on the starboard side drench the man and half fill the cockpit each rower still pull for dear life with one hand bail the boat with the other but for all they promptness a certain amount of the water freeze solid before they could get it out great luck if we be go to take in water like this say the cheerful kentuckian ship he oar and knock off the ice -- great luck that all the store be so well protected protected snap out a anxious cast-iron-looking man at the rudder yes protect how 's water to get through the ice-coat that be over everything the cast-iron steersman set he jaw grimly they seem to be comparatively safe now with half a mile of open water between they and the western shore but they sit as before stiff alert each man in he ice jacket that crack and crunch as he bent to he oar now right now leave again they eye the shore would it be -- could it be there they would have to land and if they do lord how it blow hard a-port call out the steersman there just ahead be a great white-capped roller come -- come the biggest wave they have encounter since leave open sea but maccann the steersman swing the boat straight into the crested roller and the _ tulare _ take it gamely bow on all be go well when just in the boiling middle of what they have think be foam white-cap the boat strike something solid shiver and go shoot down half under water recover up again and seem to pause in a second 's doubt on the very top of the great wave in that second that seem a eternity one man 's courage snap pott throw down he oar and swear by -- and by -- he would not pull another -- stroke on the -- yukon while he be pour out the word the steersman spring from the tiller and seize pott ' oar just in time to save the boat from capsize then he and the big kentuckian both turn on the distract pott you infernal quitter shout the steersman and choke with fury but even under the insult of that meanest word in the language pott sit glaring defiantly with he half-frozen hand in he pocket it be not a river anyhow this be not he say it be plain simple hell and water the other have no time to realize that pott be clean out of he sens for the moment and the kentuckian still pull like mad face the quitter with a determination bear of terror if you can not row take the rudder damnation take that rudder quick _ or we 'll kill you _ and he half rise up never drop he oar blindly pott obey the _ tulare _ be free now from the clinging mass at the bow but they know they have strike they first floe farther on they could see other white-cap bring other ice mass down but there be no time for terror ahead the gale be steadily drive they in shore again boat and oar alike be grow unwieldy with they coating of ever-increasing ice and human strength be no match for the storm that be sweep down from the pole lord how it blow there be a cove call out the kentuckian throw she in he shout to pott sullenly the new steersman obey rolling in on a great surge the boat suddenly turn in a boiling eddy and the first thing anybody know be that the _ tulare _ be on she side and she crew in the water pott be hang on to the gunwale and damn the other for not help he to save the boat she be not much of a boat when finally they get she into quiet water but the main thing be they have escape with they life and rescue a good proportion of they winter provision all the while they be do this last the kentuckian keep turn to look anxiously for any sign of the other in he heart bitterly blame himself for have agree to pott ' come into the _ tulare _ that day in place of the kentuckian 's own pardner when they have pile the rescue provision up on the bank and just as they be cover the heap of bacon flour and bean-bag box tool and utensil with a tarpaulin up go a shout and the two miss man appear tramp along the ice-encrusted shore where be the _ mary c _ well she be at the bottom of the yukon and she crew would like some supper they set up a tent and go to bed that first night extremely well pleased at be alive on any term but people get over be glad about almost anything unless misfortune again put a edge on the circumstance the next day not be in any immediate danger the boon of mere life seem less satisfying in detachment they go up the river several mile and down about as far they look in vain for any sign of the _ mary c _ they prospect the hill from the height behind the camp they get a pretty fair idea of the surrounding country it be not reassure as to product there seem to be plenty of undersized timber plenty of snow and plenty of river and as far as i can see just nothing else well there be oodles o ' blueberry say the boy he inky-looking mouth bearing witness to veracity and there be black and red currant in the snow and rose-apple -- oh yes return the other it be a sort of garden of eden a little below here it be four mile from bank to bank of the main channel but at this point the river be only about two mile wide and white already with float mass of floe-ice go on a swift current down towards the sea four hundred mile away the right bank present to the mighty river a low chain of hill fringe at the base with a scatter growth of scrubby spruce birch willow and cotton-wood timber line be only two hundred foot above the river brink beyond that height rock and moss cover with new-fallen snow but if they side seem cheerless what of the land on the left bank a swamp stretch endlessly on either hand and back from the icy flood as far as eye could see break only by slough and a occasional ice-rimmed tarn we have be travel just eight week to arrive at this say the kentuckian look at the desolate scene with a homesick eye we be not only pretty far from home grumble another we be still thirteen hundred mile away from the klondyke these unenlivening calculation be catch we be just about twenty-five hundred mile from the nearest railroad or telegraph and now that winter 's down on we exactly eight month from anywhere in the civilised world they have see no sign of even savage life no white trader nothing to show that any human foot have ever pass that way before in that stillness that be like the stillness of death they go up the hillside with footstep muffle in the clinging snow and sixty foot above the great river in a part of the wood where the timber be least unpromising they mark out a site for they winter quarter then this queer little company -- a denver bank-clerk a ex-schoolmaster from nova scotium a irish-american lawyer from san francisco a kentucky colonel who have never smell powder and the boy -lrb- who be no boy at all but a man of twenty-two -rrb- -- these five set to work felling tree clear away the snow and digging foundation for a couple of log-cabin -- one for the trio as they call themselves the other for the colonel and the boy these two have chum from the hour they meet on the steamer that carry they through the golden gate of the pacific till -- well till the end of my story the colonel be a big tan fellow nearly forty -- eldest of the party -- whom the other use to guy discreetly because you could not mention a place anywhere on the known globe except the far north which he have not personally inspect but for this foible as the untravelled consider it he be well like and a little fear -- except by the boy who like he first-rate and fear he not at all they have promptly adopt each other before they discover that it be necessary to have one or more pardner it seem from all account to be true that up there at the top of the world a man alone be a man lose and ultimately the party be add to as aforesaid only two of they know anything about rough it jimmie o'flynn of ` frisco the irish-american lawyer have see something of frontier life and flee it and maccann the nova scotian schoolmaster have spend a month in one of the caribou camp and on the strength of that proudly accept the nickname of the miner colonel george warren and morri burnet the boy have the best outfit but this fact be hold to be more than counter-balanced by the value of the schoolmaster 's experience at caribou and by the extraordinary handiness of pott the denver clerk who have help to build the shelter on deck for the disabled sick on the voyage up this young man with the big mouth and lazy air have be in the office of a bank ever since he leave school and yet under pressure he discover a natural neat-handedness and a manual dexterity justly envy by some of he fellow-pioneer he outfit be not more conspicuously meager than o'flynn 's yet the irishman be hold to be the moneyed man of he party just why be never fully develop but it be always say o'flynn represent capital and o'flynn whether on that account or for a subtler and more efficient reason always get the best of everything that be go without money and without price on board ship o'flynn with he ready tongue and he golden background -- represent capital -- be a lead spirit pott the handy-man be a talker too and a good second but once in camp mac the miner be cock of the walk in those first day quote caribou and order everybody about to everybody 's satisfaction in a situation like this the strongest lean on the man who have ever see anything like it before it be a comfort that anybody even _ think _ he know what to do under such new condition so the other look on with admiration and a pleasant confidence while mac boldly cut a hole in the brand-new tent and instruct pott how to make a flange out of a tin plate with which to protect the canvas from the heat of the stove-pipe no more cooking now in the bitter open everyone admire mac 's foresight when he say : we must build rock fireplace in we cabin or we 'll find we one little yukon stove burn out before the winter be over -- before we have a chance to use it out prospecting and when mac say they must pool they store the colonel and the boy agree as readily as o'flynn whose store consist of a little bacon some navy bean and a demijohn of whisky o'flynn however urge that probably every man have a little mite o ' somethin' that he have bring specially for himself -- somethin' he friend have give he for instance there be pott now they all know how the future mr pott have bring a plum-cake down to the steamer when she come to say good-bye and make pott promise he would not unseal the packet till christmas it would not do to pool pott ' cake -- never there be the colonel the only man that have a sack of coffee he would not listen when they have tell he tea be the stuff up here and -- well perhaps other fellow do not miss coffee as much as a kentuckian though he _ have _ hear -- never mind they would not pool the coffee the boy have some preserved fruit that he seem inclined to be a hog about -- oh look here i have not touch it just what i be sayin ' you be hoardin ' that fruit it be know that mac have a very dacint little medicine-chest of course if any fellow be ill mac be not the man to refuse he a little cold pizen but he must be allow to keep he own medicine chest -- and that little pot o ' dundee marmalade as for o'flynn he would look after the dimmi-john but mac be dead against the whisky clause alcohol have be the curse of caribou and in _ this _ camp spirit be to be for medicinal purpose only whereon a cloud descend on mr o'flynn and he health begin to suffer but the precious demi-john be put away in stock along with the single bottle belong to the other mac have take a inventory and no one in those early day dare touch anything without he permission they have cut into the mountain-side for a level foundation and be hard at it now haul log i wonder say the boy stop a moment in he work and look at the bleak prospect round he -- i wonder if we be go to see anybody all winter oh sure to mac thought indian anyhow well i begin to wish they would mosy along say pott and the sociable o'flynn back he up it be towards noon on the sixth day after landing -lrb- they have come to speak of this now as a voluntary affair -rrb- when they be electrify by hear strange voice look up from they work and see two white man seat on a big cake of ice go down the river with the current when they recover sufficiently from they astonishment at the spectacle they run down the hillside and propose to help the castaway to land not a bit of it _ land _ in that place what you take we for not much we be go to st michael 's they have a small boat draw up by they on the ice and one man be dress in magnificent fur a long sable overcoat and cap and wear quite the air of a north pole nabob get any grub mac call out yes want some oh no i think you -- you be not go to try to live through the winter _ there _ yes lord you _ be _ in a fix that be we think about you but the traveller on the ice-raft go by laugh and joke at the man safe on shore with they tent and provision it make some of they visibly uneasy _ would _ they win through be they crazy to try it they have look forward eagerly to the first encounter with they kind but this vision float by on the treacherous ice of man who rather dare the current and the crash of contend floe than land where _ they _ be seem of evil augury the little incident leave a curiously sinister impression on the camp even mac be find agree with the other of he trio that since they have a grand tough time in front of they it be advisable to get through the black month ahead with as little wear and tear as possible in spite of the trio 's superior talent they build a small ramshackle cabin with a tumble-down fireplace which serve they so ill that they ultimately spend all they waking hour in the more comfortable quarter of the colonel and the boy it have be agree that these two with the help or at all event the advice of the other should build the bigger better cabin where the store should be keep and the whole party should mess -- a cabin with a solid outside chimney of stone and a open fireplace generous of proportion and ancient of design just like down south the weather be grow steadily colder the ice be solid now many foot out from each bank of the river in the middle of the flood the clotted current still run with floe-ice but it be plain the river be settle down for its long sleep not silently not without stress and thunder the handful of dweller on the shore would be wake in the night by the shock and crash of collide floe the sound of the great wind rush by and -- hush what be that tired man would start up out of sleep and sit straight to listen down below among the ice-pack the noise as of a old-time battle go on -- tumult and crash and a boom boom like cannonade then one morning they wake to find all still the conflict over the yukon freeze from bank to bank no sound from that day on no more running water for a good seven month winter have come while the work go forward they often speak of the only two people they have thus far see both pott and o'flynn have be hear to envy they mac have happen to say that he believe the fellow in fur be a englishman -- a canadian at the very least the american chaff he and say that account for it in a tone not intend to flatter mac have not think of it before but he be prepare to swear now that if a englishman -- they be the hardiest pioneer on earth -- or a canadian be in favor of light out it must be for some good reason oh yes we all know that reason the american laugh and mac grow hot be goad into vaunt the britisher and run down the yankee yankee echo the kentuckian and up in nova scotium they let this man teach school do not know the difference yet between the little corner they call new england and all the rest of america all the rest of america shout mac the cheeky way you people of the state have of gobble the continent -lrb- in _ talk _ -rrb- just as though the british part of it be not the bigger half yes but when you think _ which _ half you ought to be oblige to any fellow for forget it and then they refer to effete monarchical institution and by the time they reach the question of the kind of king the prince of wale would make mac be hardly a safe man to argue with there be one bond between he and the kentucky colonel : they be both religious man and although mac be blue presbyterian and a inveterate theologian somehow out here in the wilderness it be more possible to forgive a man for illusion about the apostolic succession and mistaken view upon church government the colonel at all event be not so lax but what he be ready to back up the calvinist in a endeavor to keep the sabbath -lrb- with a careful compromise between church and chapel -rrb- and help he to conduct a saturday-night bible-class but if the boy attend the bible-class with fervor and air he heresy with uncommon gusto if he take with equal geniality colonel warren 's staid remonstrance and mac 's fiery objurgation Sunday morning invariably find he more agnostic than ever stoutly decline to recognize the necessity for service for this be a occasion when you could not argue or floor anybody or hope to make mac hoppin ' mad or have the smallest kind of a shindy the colonel read the lesson mac pray and they all sing particularly o'flynn now the boy could not sing a note so there be no fair division of entertainment wherefore he would go off into the wood with he gun for company and the catholic o'flynn and even pott be in better odour than he down in camp on sunday so far you may travel and yet not escape the tyranny of the outworn creed the boy come back a full hour before service on the second Sunday with a couple of grouse and a beam countenance mac who be cook that week be the only man leave in the tent he look agreeably surprise at the apparition hello say he more pleasantly than he Sunday gloom usually permit back in time for service i have find a native say the boy speaking as proudly as any columbus he be hurt he foot and he be only get one eye but he be splendid tell I no end of thing he be come here as fast as he foot will let he -- he and three other indian -- esquimaux i mean they have not have anything to eat but berry and root for seven day the boy be feverishly overhaul the provision behind the stove look here say mac hold on there i do not know that we have come all this way to feed a lot o ' dirty savage but they be starve then see that that fact do not produce the desire impression : my savage be a awfully good fellow he -- he be a converted savage seem to be quite a christian then hastily follow up he advantage : he be be teach english by the jesuit at the mission forty mile above we on the river he can give we a whole heap o ' tip mac be slowly bring out a small panful of cold boil bean there be four of they say the boy -- big fellow almost as big as we colonel and _ awful _ hungry mac look at the handful of bean and then at the small sheet-iron stove there be more cooking say he not over-cordially the one that talk good english be the son of the chief you can see he be different from the other know a frightful lot he be teach I some of he language already the man with he say ` kaiomi ' to everything i ask and that mean ` no savvy ' say he 'll teach I -- he 'll teach all of we -- how to snow-shoe we know how to snow-shoe oh i mean on those long narrow snow-shoe that make you go so fast you always trip up he 'll show we how to steer with a pole and how to make fish-trap and -- and everything mac begin measure out some tea he be get a team of esquimaux dog -- call 'em mahlemeut and he be get a birch-bark canoe and a skin kyak from the coast then with a inspiration : he people be the sort of royal family down there add the boy think to appeal to the britisher 's monarchical instinct mac have meditatively lay he hand on a side of bacon the boy 's eye follow he be ask we -- _ all _ of we and we be five -- up to visit he at pymeut the first village above we here mac take up a knife to cut the bacon and -- good gracious why i forget the grouse they can have the grouse no they can not say mac firmly they be lucky to get bacon the boy 's face darken ominously when he look like that the elder man find it be healthiest to give he he head but the young face clear as quickly as it have cloud after all the point be not worth fight for since grouse would take time to cook and -- here be the native come painfully along the shore the boy run out and shout and wave he cap the other man of the camp who have go in the opposite direction across the river ice to look at a air-hole come hurry back and reach camp about the same time as the visitor think you say they be big fellow comment mac who have come to the door for a glimpse of the indian as they toil up the slope well so they be why the colonel would make two of any one of they the colonel oh well you can not expect anybody else to be quite as big as that i be in a hurry but i suppose what i mean be they could eat as much as the colonel how do you know well just look how broad they be it do not matter to you stomach whether you be big up and down or big to and fro it be they fur make 'em look like that they be the most awful little runt i ever see well i reckon _ you would _ think they be big too -- big as nova scotium -- if _ you would _ find 'em -- come on 'em suddenly like that in the wood -- which be the oh the son of the chief be in the middle the one who be take off he civilised fur-coat he say he father 's get a heap of pelt -lrb- you could get thing for you collection mac -rrb- and he be get two reindeer-skin shirt with hood -- ` parkis ' you know like the other be wear -- they be quite near now how do say the foremost native affably how do the boy come forward and shake hand as though he have not see he for a month this say he turn first to mac and then to the other white man this be prince nichola of pymeut walk right in all of you and have something to eat the visitor sit on the ground round the stove as close as they could get without scorch and the atmosphere be quickly heavy with they presence when they slip back they hood it be see that two of the man wear the tartar tonsure after the fashion of the coast where do you come from inquire the colonel of the man nearest he who simply blink and be dumb this be the one that talk english say the boy indicate nichola and he live at pymeut and he be be convert how far be pymeut we sleep pymeut to-night say nichola which way the native jerk he head up the river many people there he nod white man too he shake he head how far to the nearest white man nichola 's mind wander from the white man 's catechism and fix itself on he race 's immemorial problem : how far it be to the nearest thing to eat i think you say he could speak english so he can first rate he and i have a great pow-wow do not we nichola nichola smile absently and fix he one eye on the bacon that mac be cut on the deal box into such delicate slice he 'll talk all right say the boy when he be have some breakfast mac have finish the cutting and now put the frying-pan on a open hole in the little stove cook he inquire nichola yes do not you cook he take heap time cook he you could not eat it raw nichola nod emphatically mac say no but the boy be curious to see if they would really eat it uncooked let they have _ some _ of it raw while the rest be frying and he beckon the visitor to the deal box they make a dart forward gather up the fat bacon several slice at a time and push it into they mouth ugh say the colonel under he breath mac quickly sweep what be leave into the frying-pan and begin to cut a fresh lot the boy divide the cold bean get out biscuit and pour the tea while silence and a strong smell of ancient fish and rancid seal pervade the little tent o'flynn put a question or two but nichola have go stone-deaf there be no doubt about it they have be starve after a good feed they sit stolidly by the fire with no sign of consciousness save the blinking of beady eye till the colonel suggest a smoke then they all grin broadly and nod with great vigor even those who have no other english understand tobacco when he have puff awhile nichola take he pipe out of he mouth and look at the boy say : you no savvy catch fish in winter through the ice no how you do it make hole -- put down trap -- heap fish all winter you get enough to live on ask the colonel they must have dry fish too leave over from the summer say mac nichola agree and berry and flour when snow begin get soft pymeut all go off -- he motion with he big head towards the hill what do you get there mac be become interested caribou moose -- any fur yes trap ermun marten -- lynx too i suppose and fox nichola nod all kind wolf -- muskrat otter -- wolverine -- all kind you get some skin now ask the nova scotian y -- yes more when snow get soft you come pymeut -- I show where have ye be just now ask o'flynn st michael how long since ye leave there twelve sleep he mean thirteen day nicholas nod they could not possibly walk that far in -- oh yes say the boy they do not follow the winding of the river they cut across the portage you know snow come -- no trail -- big mountain -- all get lose what do you go to st michael 's for oh I pilot I go all over I leave n a t and t boat st michael 's last trip then you be in the employ of the great north american trading and transportation company nichola give that funny little duck of the head that mean yes that be how you learn english say the colonel no I learn english at holy cross I be baptize at that jesuit mission up yonder forty mile well say pott i guess you have have enough walk for one winter nichola seem not to follow this observation the boy interpret : you heap tire eh you no go any more long walk till ice go out eh nichola grin I go

safe with dog-team do many people go all innuit go plenty ingalik go how far do they come all over come from koserefsky come from anvik -- sometime nulato why nulato 's a awful distance from ikogimeut three hundred and twenty mile say the pilot proud of he general information and quite ready since he have get a pipe between he tooth to be friendly and communicative what do you do at ikogimeut when you have these -- big fire -- big feed -- tell heap story -- big dance oh heap big time once every year eh down at ikogimeut three time ev ' year ev ' village and -- he lower he voice not with any hit of reverence or awe but with a air of make a sly and cheerful confidence -- and when man die you make a feast and have a dance when a friend die if no priest priest no like priest say ` man no dead man go up ' nicholas ponder the strange say and slowly shake he head in that the priest be right say mac grudgingly it be anything but politic but for the life of he the boy could not help chip in : you think when man dead he stay dead eh and you might as well make a feast nichola give he quick nod we get heap muskeetah we cold we hungry we here heap long time dead man he do why no big feast oh yes heap big feast the boy be enrapture he would gladly have encourage these pagan deliverance on the part of the convert prince but the colonel be scandalise and mac although in he heart of heart not ill-satisfied at the evidence of the skin-deep christianity of a man deliver over to the corrupt teaching of the jesuit find in this last fact all the stronger reason for the instant organization of a good protestant prayer-meeting nichola of pymeut must not be allow to think it be only jesuit who remember the sabbath day to keep it holy and the three pore benighted heathen along with he if they do not understand english word they should have a object-lesson and mac would himself pray the prayer they could not utter for themselves he jump up motion the boy to put on more wood clear away the granite-ware dish fill the bean-pot and set it back to simmer while the colonel get out mac 's bible and he own prayer-book the boy do he stoke gloomily read aright these portent almost eclipse be joy in this find of he -lrb- for he regard the precious nichola as he own special property -rrb- it be all go to end in he -- the boy 's -- be hook in for service as long as the esquimaux be there _ he _ could not of course tear himself away and here be the chance they would all be wait for here be a native chock-full of knowledge of the natural law and the immemorial gospel of the north who would be go soon -- oh very soon if mac and the colonel go on like this -- and they be go to choke off nichola 's communicativeness with -- a service it be Sunday you know say the colonel to the prince lay open he book and we be just go to have church you be accustom to go to church at holy cross be not you when I kid I go church you have not go since you grow up they still have church there do not they oh father brachet he have church why do not you go nichola be vaguely conscious of threaten disapproval I I must take up fish-trap can not you do that another day it seem not to have occur to nichola before he sit and consider the matter be not father brachet begin the colonel gravely -- he do not like it do he when you do not come to church he take care he church he know I take care I fish-trap but nicholas saw plainly out of he one eye that he be not grow in popularity suddenly that solitary organ gleam with self-justification I bring fish to father brachet and to mother aloysius and the sister mac and the colonel exchange dark glance do mother aloysius and the sister live where father brachet do father brachet and father will and brother paul and brother etienne all here the native put two finger on the floor big white cross in middle -- he lay down he pipe to personate the cross -- here -- indicate the other side -- here mother aloysius and the sister i thought say mac we would be hearing of a convent convenient I help father brachet observe nichola proudly I show he boy how make trap show he girl how make muckluck _ what _ gasp the horrified mac father brachet have get a family famly inquire nicholas kaiomus and he shake he head uncertainly you say father brachet have get boy and -- as though this be a yet deeper brand of iniquity -- _ girl _ nichola though greatly mystified nod firmly i suppose he think away off up here nobody will ever know oh these jesuit how many child have this shameless priest father brachet he get seventeen boy and -- I no savvy how much

kind sister teach girl make dinner wash -- all kind heap good people up at holy cross divil a doubt of it say o'flynn but this blind belauding of the child of loyolum only fire mac the more to give the heathen a glimpse of the true light in what darkness must they grope when a sly intriguing jesuit -lrb- it be well know they be all like that -rrb- be for they a type of the heap good man -- a priest forsooth who wink at sabbath-breaking because he and he neighbouring nun share in the spoil well they must try to have a truly impressive service mac and the colonel telegraph agreement on this head savage be say to be specially touch by music i suppose when you be a kid the jesuit teach you chant and so on say the colonel kindly kaiomi answer nichola after reflection you can sing can not you ask o'flynn sing no I dance the boy roar with delight why yes i never think of that you fellow do the song and nichola and i 'll do the dance mac glower angrily look here : if you do not mind be blasphemous for yourself do not demoralise the native well i like that do not miriam dance before the lord why should not nichola and I the colonel clear he throat and begin to read the lesson for the day the native sit and watch he closely they really behave very well and the boy be enormously proud of he new friend there be a great deal at stake the boy feel he must walk warily and he already regret those light expression about dancing before the lord all the fun of the winter might depend on a friendly relation between pymeut and the camp it be essential that the esquimaux should not only receive but make a good impression the singing from greenland 's icy mountain to indium 's coral strand seem to please they but when after the colonel 's here endeth the second lesson mac say in sepulchral tone let we pray the visitor seem to think it be time to go home no say mac sternly they must not go in the middle of the meeting and he proceed to kneel down but nichola be put on he fur coat and the other only wait to follow he out the boy greatly concerned lest after all the visit should end badly drop on he knee to add the force of he own example and through the opening phrase of mac 's prayer the agnostic be hear say in a loud stage-whisper do like I -- down look here suppose you ask we come big feast and in the middle of you dance we all go home -- oh no remonstrate nichola very well these friend o ' mine no like man go home in the middle they heap mad at I when i no stay you savvy I savvy say nichola slowly and rather depressed kneel down then say the boy and first nichola and then the other go on they knee alternately they look in the boy 's corner where the grub be and then over they shoulder at the drone mac and back catch the boy 's eye and return he reassuring nod and grin mac who have have no inning up to this point be now embark upon a most congenial occupation wrestling with the lord on behalf of the heathen he lose count of time on and on the prayer wind its slow way involution after involution coil after coil like a snake the boy think laze in the sun unaccustomed knee grow sore hearken to the cry of they that walk in darkness mislead by wolf in sheep 's clothing -- _ wolf _ lord wear the sign of the holy cross -- o'flynn shuffle and mac pull himself up no light task this of convey to the creator in covert term a due sense of the iniquity of the jesuit without at the same time stir o'flynn 's bile and see he get up and stalk out of meeting as have happen once before o'flynn be not deeply concerned about religious question but there be limit the problem be how to rouse the lord without rouse o'flynn -- a piece of negotiation so delicate call for a skill in pious invective so infinitely absorb to mac 's particular cast of mind that he be quickly stone-blind and deaf to all thing else not all the heathen be sink in iniquity but they be weak tempt and they weary lord aman say the boy discreetly how long groan mac -- oh lord how long but it be much longer than he realize the boy see the visitor shift from one knee to another and fear the worst but he sympathise deeply with they predicament to ease he own leg he change he position and drag a corner of the sailcloth down off the little pile of provision and double it under he knee the movement reveal the bag of dry apple within arm 's length nichola be surreptitiously reach for he coat no doubt about it he have come to the conclusion that this be the fitting moment to depart a look over he shoulder show mac absorb and take fresh breath at sixthly oh lord the boy put out a hand and drag the apple-bag slowly softly towards he the prince drop the sleeve of he coat and fix he one eye on he friend the boy undo the neck of the sack thrust in he hand and bring out a fistfull another look at mac -- still hard at it try to spare o'flynn 's feeling without mince matter with the almighty the boy wink at nichola make a gesture catch and fire a bit of dry apple at he at the same time put a piece in he own mouth to show he it be all right nichola follow suit and seem pleased with the result he show all he strong white tooth and ecstatically wink he one eye back at the boy who throw he another bit and then a piece to each of the other the colonel have catch on and be make horrible frown at the boy pott and o'flynn look up and in dumbshow demand a share no very well they would tell mac so the boy have to feed they too to keep they quiet and still mac pray the lord to catch up this slip he have make here on the yukon with reference to the native in the midst of a powerful peroration he happen to open he eye a little and they fall on the magnificent great sable collar of prince nichola 's coat without any of the usual slow down without the accustomed warning of a gradual descent from the high theme of heaven to the thing of common earth mac come down out of the cloud with a bump and the sudden business-like aman startle all the apple-chewing congregation mac stand up and say he to nichola : where do you get that coat nichola still on he knee stare and seem in doubt if this be a part of the service where do you get that coat repeat mac the boy have jump up nimbly i tell you he father have a lot of fur like this no say nichola this belong white man ha say mac excitedly i think i would see it before tell we how you get it I leave st michael I get duck reindeer meat -- oh _ plenty _ kow-kow -lrb- footnote : food -rrb- two sleep away st michael I meet indian heap hungry he get bully coat nichola pick it up off the floor he get no kow-kow he say ` give I duck give I back-fat you take coat he too heavy ' I say ` yes ' but how do he get the coat he say two white man come down river on big ice yes yes -- man sick he tap he forehead man no sick he no go down with the ice and nichola shudder before ikogimeut ice jam indian see man jump one big ice here more big ice here and one go down indian -- nichola imitate throw out a line -- man tie mahout round -- but -- big ice come -- nichola dash he hand together and then pause significantly indian sleep there next day ice hard indian go little way out to see man dead he heap good coat he wind up unemotionally and proceed to put it on and the other white man -- what become of he nichola shrug : kaiomi though it be plain he know well enough the other lay under the yukon ice and that -- _ that _ be the end of the fellow who go by jeer at we we would better not crow yet say mac and they bid prince nichola and he heathen retinue good-bye in a mood chasten not by prayer alone chapter ii house-warming there be a sort of moral climate in a household -- john morley no idle ceremony this but the great problem of the dweller in the country of the yukon the colonel and the boy make up they mind that whatever else they have or have not they would have a warm house to live in and when they have get it they would have a blow-out to celebrate the achievement we 'll invite nicholas say the boy i 'll go to pymeut myself and let he know we be go to have ` big fire big feed oh heap big time ' if the truth be tell it have be a difficult enough matter to keep away from pymeut since the hour nichola have vanish in that direction but until winter quarter be make and until they be prove to be warm there be no time for the amenity of life the big cabin -lrb- as it be quite seriously call in contradistinction to the hut of the trio -rrb- consist of a single room measure on the outside sixteen foot by eighteen foot the wall of cotton-wood log soar upward to a level of six foot and this height be magnificently increase in the middle by the angle of the mildly gable roof but before the cabin be breast-high the boy have begin to long for a window sorry we forget the plate-glass say mac wud not ye like a grrand-piana ask o'flynn what be the use of goin ' all the way from nova scotium to caribou say the boy to the schoolmaster-miner if you have not learn the way to make a window like the indian out of transparent skin mac assume a air of elevated contempt i go to mine not to learn indian trick when the door 's shut it 'll be dark as the inside of a cocoa-nut you ought to have think of that before you leave the sunny south say pott it 'll be dark all winter window or no window mac remind they never mind say the colonel when the candle give out we 'll have the fire-light keep all the spruce knot boy but one of the boy be not please the next day look for a monkey-wrench under the tarpaulin he come across the wooden box a californium friend have give he at parting contain a dozen tall glass jar of preserved fruit the other have growl at the extra bulk and weight when the boy put the box into the boat at st michael 's but they have now begin to look kindly on it and ask when it be to be open he have answer firmly : not before christmas modify this since nichola 's visit to not before the house-warming but one morning the boy be find pour the fruit out of the jar into some empty can what you up to wait a ' see he go to o'flynn who be dish-washer that week get he to melt a couple of bucket of snow over the open-air campfire and wash the fruit-jars clean now colonel say the boy bring along that buck-saw o ' yours and lend a hand they take off the top log from the south wall of the cabin measure a two-foot space in the middle and the colonel saw out the superfluous spruce intervene while he go on do the same for the other log on that side the boy roughly chisel a moderately flat sill then one after another he set up six of the tall glass jar in a row and show how alternate with the other six bottle turn upside down the thick belly of one accommodate itself to the thin neck of the other the twelve make a very decent rectangle of glass when they have hoist up and fix in place the log on each side and the big fellow that go all across on top when they have fill the inconsiderable crack between the bottle with some of the mud-mortar with which the log be to be chink behold a double glass window fit for a king the boy be immensely pleased oh that be a old dodge say mac depreciatingly why they do that at caribou then why in -- why do not you suggest it you wait till you know more about this kind o ' life and you will not go in for fancy touch nevertheless the man who have mine at caribou seem to feel that some contribution from he be necessary to offset the huge success of that window he do not feel call upon to help to split log for the roof of the big cabin but he sit cut and whittle away at a little shelf which he say be to be nail up at the right of the big cabin door its use be not apparent but no one dare call it a fancy touch for mac be a miner and have be to caribou when the shelf be nail up its maker bring forth out of he medicine-chest a bottle of perry davi 's pain-killer now at caribou say he they have not get any more thermometer kick round than we have here but they discover that when perry davi congeal you must keep a sharp look-out for frost-bite and when perry davi freeze solid you would better mind you eye and stay in you cabin if you do not want to die on the trail with which he tie a string round perry davi 's neck set the bottle up on the shelf and secure it firmly in place they all agree it be a grand advantage to have be to caribou but mac know thing that he have probably not learn there about tree and rock and beast and they manners and custom and family name if there be more than a half-truth in the significant lament of a very different man i should be a poet if only i know the name of thing then indeed samuel maccann be equip to make a mark in literature from the time he set foot on the volcanic shore of st michael 's island mac have begin he collection nowadays when he would spend over that truck of he hour that might profitably -lrb- consider he talent -rrb- be employ in help to fortify the camp against the arctic winter he companion feel it little use to remonstrate by themselves they get on rapidly with work on the roof very much help by three day ' unexpectedly mild weather when the split log have be marshal together on each side of the comb they cover they with dry moss and spruce bough over all they lay a thick blanket of the earth which have be dig out to make a level foundation the crack in the wall be chink with moss and mud-mortar the floor be the naked ground to be carpet with skin by-and-by so mac say but nobody believe mac would put a skin to any such sensible use the unreasonable mildness of three or four day and the little surface thaw come to a abrupt end in a cold rain that turn to sleet as it fall nobody feel like go far afield just then even after game but they have set the snare that nichola tell the boy about on that first encounter in the wood nichola it seem have give he a noose make of twisted sinew and show how it work in a run loop he have illustrate the virtue of this noose when attach to a pole balance in the crotch of a tree catch over a horizontal stick by means of a small wooden pin tie to the snare a touch at the light end of the suspend pole -lrb- where the bait loop dangle -rrb- loosen the pin and the heavy end of the pole fall hang ptarmigan or partridge in the air for some time after rig this contrivance whenever anyone report track mac and the boy would hasten to the scene of action and set a new snare pile brush on each side of the track that the game have run in so bar other way and present a line of least resistance straight through the loop in the early day mac would come away from these preparation say with dry pleasure : now with luck we may get a _ xema sabinius _ or some such fearful wildfowl good to eat the boy would ask have have he disappointment ere now in moment of hunger for fresh meat when mac with the nearest approach to enthusiasm he permit himself have bring in some miserable little hawk-owl or a three-toed woodpecker to add not to the larder but to the collection no you do not _ eat _ sabine gull mac would answer pityingly but those snare never seem to know what they be there for the first one be set expressly to catch one of the commonest bird that fly -- mac 's _ lagopus albus _ the beautiful white arctic grouse or at the very least a _ bonasa umbellus _ which be interpret be ruff ptarmigan the track have be bird track but the creature that swing in the air next day be a baby hare the schoolmaster look upon the incident as be in the nature of a practical joke and resent it but the other be enchant and profess thereafter a rooted suspicion of the soundness of the schoolmaster 's natural history which nobody actually feel for he have never yet pretend to know anything that he do not know well and when pott would say something disparage of mac 's learning behind he back -lrb- which be against the unwritten rule of the game -rrb- the colonel invariably sit on pott know a darned sight too much no he _ do not _ sir that be just the remarkable thing about mac he be not try to carry any more than he can swing at the same time it be to be fear that none of he companion really appreciate the pedagogue 's learning nor have anyone but the boy sympathise with he resolution to make a collection what they want be eatable game and they affect no intelligent interest in know the manners and custom of the particular species that be send up appetise odour from the pot they even applaud the rudeness of the boy who one day respond to mac 's gravely jubilant look here i have get the _ parus hudsonicus _ -- poor old man what do you do for it and when anybody after that be indispose they say he might be sicken for a attack of parus hudsonicus and in that case it be a bad look-out well for mac that he would not have care a red cent to impress the greatest naturalist alive let alone a lot of fellow who do not know a titmouse from a disease meanwhile work on the big cabin have go steadily forward from the outside it look finish now and distinctly impose from what be leave of the precious plank out of the bottom of the best boat they have make the door -- two by four and open directly in front of that masterpiece the rock fireplace the great stone chimney be the pride of the camp and the talk before the winter be do of all the lower river spur on partly by the increase intensity of the cold partly by the colonel 's nonsense about the way they do it down south mac rouse himself and turn out a better piece of masonry for the big cabin than he have think necessary for he own but everybody have a share in the glory of that fireplace the colonel pott and the boy select the stone and bring it on a rude litter out of a natural quarry from a place a mile or more away up on the bare mountain-side o'flynn mixed and hand up the mud-mortar while mac put in some brisk work with it before it stiffen in the increase cold everybody be look forward to get out of the tent and into the warm cabin and the building of the fireplace stir enthusiasm it be two and a half foot deep three and a half foot high and four foot wide and when furnish with ten-inch hack log pack in glowing ash and lay one above another with a roar good blaze in front of birch and spruce that fire would take a lot of beat as the boy admit even in the tat-pine florida country but no fire on earth could prevent the cabin from be sweep through the moment the door be open by a fierce and icy air-current the late autumnal gale reveal the fact that the sole means of ventilation have be so nicely contrived that whoever come in or go out admit a hurricane of draught that nearly knock he down pott say it take a good half-hour after anyone have open the door to heat the place up again what you cold inquire the usual culprit the boy have come in to put a edge on he chopper it be stop snowin ' a ' you better come along with I pott swing a axe for a couple of hour -- that 'll warm you i have get rheumatism in my shoulder to-day say pott hug the huge fire closer and you have get something wrong with you eye eh mac potts narrow he and widen the great mouth but he have turn he head so mac could not see he the nova scotian only growl and refill he pipe up in the wood the boy repeat the conversation to the colonel who look across at o'flynn several yard away and say : hush why must i shut up mac 's _ eye _ do look rather queer and bloodshot i should think he would rather feel we lay it to he eye than know we be afraid he be peterin ' out altogether i never say i be afraid -- no you have not _ say _ much i have not open my head about it no but you have try hard enough for five or six day to get mac to the point where he would come out and show we how to whip-see you have not _ say _ anything but you have -- you have get pretty dignified each time you fail and we all know what that mean we ought to have begin saw board for we bunk and swing-shelf a week back before this heavy snowfall besides there be enough fire-wood now we be only mark time until -- until mac 's eye get all right i understand again the colonel have make a sound like sh and go on swing he axe they work without word till the boy 's tree come down then he stop a moment and wipe he face it be not so cold to-day not by a long shot for all pott 's howl about he rheumatic it be not cold that start that kind of pain no siree i be not much of a doctor but i can see pott 's rheumatism do not depend on the weather never you mind pott i do not mind pott i only mind mac what be the matter with mac anyway oh he be just get cold foot maybe he 'll thaw out by-and-by do you ever think what mac 's like with that square-cut jaw and sawed-off nose everything about he goin ' like this -- the boy describe a few quick blunt angle in the air -- well sir he be the livin ' image of a monkey-wrench i be comin ' to think he be as much like it inside as he be out he can screw up for a prayer-meetin ' or he can screw down for business -- when he be a mind but as jimmie over there say ` the divil a different pace can you put he through ' i _ like _ monkey-wrench i be only sayin ' they be not as limber as willa-tree no response from the colonel who be make the chip fly it have cost he great body a good many ache and bruise but he be a capital axeman now and not such a bad carpenter though when the boy say as much he have answer : carpenter i be just a sort of a well-meanin ' wood-butcher and deeply he regret that in all he young year on a big place in the country he have learn so little about anything but horse and cattle on the way back to dinner they speak again of this difficulty of the board o'flynn whistle rory o'more with he pleasant air of detachment you and the other would take more interest in the subject say the boy a little hotly if we have not let you fellow use nearly all the boat-plank for _ you _ bunk and now we have not get any for we own _ let _ we use 'em faith we have a right to be to board out of _ we _ boat and ye can have the loan o ' the whip-saw to make more whenever the fancy take ye loan o ' the whip-saw why it be mine say the colonel divil a bit of it man say o'flynn serenely everything we have get belong to all of we except a sack o ' coffee a medicine-chest and a dimmi-john and it be mesilf that be afraid the dimmi-john -- what be the use of my have buy a whip-saw interrupt the colonel hurriedly what be the good of it if the only man that know how to use it -- be more take up wid bein ' a guardjin angel to he pardner 's dimmi-john -- the colonel turn and frown at the proprietor of the dimmi-john the boy have drop behind to look at some marten track in the fresh-fallen snow i 'll follow that trail after dinner say he catch up the other in time to hear o'flynn say : if it wus not that ye think only a feller that be be to caribou can teach ye annything it be jimmie o'flynn that ` ud show ye how to play a chune on that same whip-saw will you show we after dinner sure i will and he be as good as he word this business of turn a tree into board without the aid of a saw-mill be a thing many placer-miner have to learn for even if they be dispose to sleep on the floor and to do without shelf they can not do sluice without sluice-box and they can not make those long narrow box without board so every party that be well fit out have a whip-saw furrst ye dig a pit o'flynn have say airily stretch out before the fire after dinner make it about four foot deep and as long as ye would like yer board when ye have do that i 'll come and take a hand the little job be not half finish when the light tail two day more of soil-burning and shovel see it do now ye sling a couple o ' sapling acrost the durrt ye have chuck out r-right now ye roll yer saw-timber inter the middle r-right a ' on each side ye want a log to stand on see wid yer ` guide-man ' on top sthradlin ' yer timberr watchin ' the chalk-line and doin ' the pull-up and the otherr fellerr in the pit lookin ' afther the haul-down ye 'll be able to play a chune wid that there whip-saw that 'll make the serryphim sick o ' plain harp o'flynn superintend it all and even pott have the curiosity to come out and see what they be up to mac be kind o ' dozin ' by the fire when the frame be finish o'flynn help to put the trial-log in place have mark it off with charcoal to indicate inch and a quarter plank then the colonel down in the pit and o'flynn on top of the frame take the great two-handled saw between they and begin laboriously one draw the big blade up and the other down vertically through the log along the charcoal line a ' _ that be _ how it be do wid bit of yer arrum and yer back that have niver be call on to wurruk befure a ' whin ye have be at it a hour ye 'll find it go betther wid a little blasphemin ' and he give he end of the saw to the reluctant pott pott be about this time as much of a problem to he pardner as be the ex-schoolmaster if the bank clerk have surprise they all by he handiness on board ship and by make a crane to swing the pot over the fire he surprise they all still more in these day by a apparent eclipse of he talent it be unaccountable pott 's carpenter pott 's all-round cleverness be like payrock in a pocket as the miner say speedily work out and not a trace of it afterwards to be find but less and less be the defection of the trio feel the burly kentucky stock-farmer be get he hand in at frontier work though he still could not get on without he nigger as the boy say slyly indicate that it be he who occupy this exalted post these two soon have the bunk make out of the rough plank they have saw with all a green-horn 's pain they put in a fragrant mattress of spring moss and on that make up a bed of blanket and fur more board be laboriously turn out to make the great swing-shelf to hang up high in the angle of the roof where the provision might be store out of reach of possible marauder the day be very short now bring only about five hour of pallid light so little of which struggle through the famous bottle-window that at all hour they depend chiefly on the blaze from the great fireplace there be still a good deal of work to be do indoors shelf to be put up on the leave as you enter -lrb- whereon the granite-ware tea-service etc be keep -rrb- a dinner-table to be make and three-legged stool while these addition -- fancy touch as the trio call they -- be be make pott and o'flynn although occasionally they go out for a hour or two shot-gun on shoulder seldom bring home anything and for the most part be content with do what they modestly consider they share of the cooking and wash for the rest they sit by the fire play endless game of euchre seven-up and bean poker while mac more silent than ever smoke and read copp 's mining law and the magazine of the previous August nobody hear much in those day of caribou the colonel have gradually slip into the position of boss of the camp the trio be still just a trifle afraid of he and he on he side never press a dangerous issue too far but this be a little to anticipate one bitter gray morning that have reduce perry davi to a solid lump of ice o'flynn the colonel and the boy be bring into the cabin the last of the whip-sawed board the colonel halted and look steadily up the river be that a beast or a human say he it be a man the boy decide after a moment -- no two man single file and -- yes -- colonel it be dog hooray a dog-team at last they have simultaneously drop the lumber the boy run on to tell the cook to prepare more grub and then pelt after o'flynn and the colonel who have go down to meet the newcomer -- a indian drive five dog which be hitch tandem to a low esquimaux sled with a pack and two pair of web-foot snow-shoe lash on it and follow by a white man the indian be a fine fellow younger than prince nichola and better off in the matter of eye the white man be a good deal older than either with grizzled hair a worn face bright dark eye and a pleasant smile i have hear some white man have camp hereabouts say he i be glad to see we have such substantial neighbor he be look up at the stone chimney conspicuous a long way off we do not know we have any white neighbor say the colonel in he most grand and gracious manner how far away be you sir about forty mile above as he answer he happen to be glance at the boy and observe he eagerness cloud slightly have not nichola say it be about forty mile above that the missionary live but to be only forty mile away the stranger go on misinterpret the fading gladness be to be near neighbor in this country we be not quite fixed yet say the colonel but you must come in and have some dinner with we we can promise you a good fire anyhow thank you you have choose a fine site and the bright eye with the deep crow 's - foot ray out from the corner scan the country in so keen and know a fashion that the boy with hope revive venture : be -- be you a prospector no i be father will from holy cross oh and the boy presently catch up with the indian and walk on beside he look back every now and then to watch the dog or examine the harness the driver speak english and answer question with a tolerable intelligence be dog often drive without rein the indian nod the colonel after the stranger have introduce himself be just a shade more reserved but seem determine not to be lack in hospitality o'flynn be overflow or would have be have the jesuit encourage he he tell they story or more properly he own and how they have be wreck and so ye be the father superior up there say the irishman pause to take breath no we superior be father brachet that be a well-built cabin the dog halt though they have at least five hundred yard still to travel before they would reach the well-built cabin _ mush _ shout the indian the dog clear the ice-reef and go spin along so briskly over the low hummock that the driver have to run to keep up with they the boy be fly after when the priest have catch sight of he face call out : here wait stop a moment and hurry forward he kick through the ice-crust gather up a handful of snow and begin to rub it on the boy 's right cheek what in the name of -- the boy be draw back angrily keep still order the priest you cheek be frozen and he apply more snow and more friction you ought to watch one another in such weather as this when a man turn dead-white like that he be touch with frost-bite after he have restore the circulation : there now do not go near the fire or it will begin to hurt thank you say the boy a little shame-faced it be all right now i suppose i think so say the priest you 'll lose the skin and you may be a little sore -- nothing to speak of with which he fall back to the colonel 's side the dog have settle down into a jog-trot now but be still well on in front be ` mush ' they food ask the boy _ mush _ no fish why do you indian go on like that about mush then oh that be the only word the dog know except -- a -- certain expression we try to discourage the indian from use in the old day the dog-driver use to say ` mahsh ' now you never hear anything but swearing and ` mush ' a corruption of the french-canadian _ marche _ he turn to the colonel : you 'll get over try to wear cheechalko boot here -- nothing like muckluck with a wisp of straw inside for this country i agree wid ye i get I a pair in st michael 's say o'flynn proudly turn out he enormous foot never wear anything so comf ` table in I life you ought to have drill parki too like this of mine to keep out the wind they be go up the slope now obliquely to the cabin close behind the dog who be pull spasmodically between they little rest father will stoop and gather up some moss that the wind have sweep almost bare of snow you see that he say to o'flynn while the boy stop and the colonel hurry on wherever you find that grow no man need starve the colonel look back before enter the cabin and see that the boy seem to have forget not alone the indian but the dog and be walk behind with the jesuit face upturn smile as friendly as you please within a different picture pott and mac be have a row about something and the colonel strike in sharply on they growling comment upon each other 's character and probable destination get plenty to eat two hungry man come in one 's a indian and you know what that mean and the other 's a catholic priest it be this bomb that he have hurry on to get explode and do with before the say priest should appear on the scene a _ what _ mac raise he heavy eye with fight in every wooden feature a jesuit priest be what i say he will not eat he dinner here that be exactly what he will do not by -- whether it be the monstrous proposition that have unstrung mac he be oblige to steady himself against the table with a shake hand but he set those square feature of he like iron and say he no jesuit sit down to the same table with I that mean then that you 'll eat alone not if i know it the colonel slide in place the heavy wooden bar that have never before be requisition to secure the door and he come and stand in the middle of the cabin where he could let out all he inch just clear the swing-shelf he pull he great figure up to its full height and standing there like a second goliath he say quite softly in that lingo of he childhood that always come back to he tongue 's tip in time of excitement : just as shuah as yo ' bohn that priest will eat he dinner to-day in my cabin sah and if yo ' go t ' make any trouble just say so now and we 'll get it ovah and the place clean up again befoh we visitor arrive mind what you be about mac growl pott you know he could lick the stuffin ' out o ' you the ex-schoolmaster produce some sort of indignant sound in he throat and turn as if he mean to go out the colonel come a little nearer mac fling up he head and square for battle pott in a cold sweat drop a lot of tinware with a rattle while the colonel say no no we 'll settle this after the people go mac then in a whisper : look here : i have be try to shield you for ten day do not give yourself away now -- before the first white neighbor that come to see we you call yourself a christian just see if you can not behave like one for a hour or two to a fellow-creature that be cold and hungry come _ you be _ the man we have always count on do the honor and take it out of I after we guest be go mac seem in a haze he sit down heavily on some beanbag in the corner and when the newcomer be bring in and introduce he do the honor by glower at they with red eye never break he surly silence well say father will look about i must say you be very comfortable here if more people make home like this there would be fewer failure they give he the best place by the fire and pott dish up dinner there be only two stool make yet the boy roll he section of sawed spruce over near the priest and prepare to dine at he side no no say father will firmly you shall sit as far away from this splendid blaze as you can get or you will have trouble with that cheek so the boy have to yield he place to o'flynn and join mac over on the bean-bag why do not you get a parkus when you be at st michael 's say the priest as this change be be effect we have just as much -- more than we could carry besides i think we could buy fur up river anyway i be warm enough no you be not return the priest smile you must get a parkus with a hood i have get a arctic cap it roll down over my ear and go all round my neck -- just leave a little place in front for my eye yes wear that if you go on the trail but the good of the parkus hood be that it be trim all round with long wolf-hair you see -- he pick he parkus up off the floor and show it to the company -- those long hair stand out all round the face break the force of the wind it be wonderful how the esquimaux hood lessen the chance of frost-bite while the only object in the room that he do not seem to see be mac he be most take up with the fireplace the colonel lay great stress on the enormous service of the delightful accomplished master-mason over there on the beanbag who sit look more than ever like a monkey-wrench incarnate but whether that jesuit be as wily as the calvinist thought he have quite wit enough to overlook the great chimney-builder 's wrathful silence he be not the least professional talk about the country and how to live here say incidentally that he have spend twelve year at the mission of the holy cross the yukon be not a bad place to live in he tell they if man only take the trouble to learn how to live here while teach the indian there be a great deal to learn from they as well you must all come and see we school he wind up we would like to awfully say the boy and all but mac echo he we be so afraid he go on that we might not see anybody all winter long oh you 'll have more visitor than you want _ shall _ we though then with a modify rapture : indian i suppose and -- and missionary trader too and miner and this year cheechalko as well you be directly on the great highway of winter travel now that there be a good hard crust on the snow you will have dog-train pass every week and sometimes two or three it be good news we have already have one visitor before you say the boy look wonderfully pleased at the prospect the priest have open out you must know nichola of pymeut do not you oh yes we all know nichola and the priest smile we _ like _ he return the boy as if some slighting criticism have be pass upon he friend of course you do so do we all and still that look of quiet amusement on the worn face and a keener twinkle glint in the eye we be afraid he be sick the boy begin before the priest could answer he be educate at howly cross he _ say _ contribute o'flynn oh he be be to holy cross among other place what do you mean well nichola be a most impartial person he be bear at pymeut but he father who be the richest and most intelligent man in he tribe take nichola to ikogimeut when the boy be only six he be bring up in the russian mission there as the father have be before he and be a greek -- in religion -- till he be fourteen there be a famine that year down yonder so nicholas turn catholic and come up to we he be at holy cross some year when business call he to anvik where he turn episcopalian at eagle city i believe he be regard as a pattern presbyterian there be those that say since he have be a pilot nichola make six change a trip in he religious conviction father will see that the colonel to whom he most frequently address himself take he pleasantry gravely nichola be not a bad fellow he add he tell I you have be kind to he if you believe that about he insincerity say the colonel be you not afraid the other you spend you life teaching may turn out as little credit to you -- to christianity the priest glance at the listen indian no say he gravely i do not think _ all _ the native be like nichola andrew here be a true son of the church but even if it be otherwise _ we _ you know -- the jesuit rise from the table with that calm smile of he -- we simply do the work without question the issue be not in we hand he make the sign of the cross and set back he stool come andrew he say we must push on the indian repeat the priest 's action and go out to see to the dog oh be you go right away say the colonel politely and o'flynn volubly protest we think say the boy you would sit awhile and smoke and -- at least of course i do not mean smoke exactly -- but -- the father smile and shake he head another time i would stay gladly where be you go now andrew and i be on we way to the _ oklahoma _ the steamship freeze in the ice below here how far ask the boy about seven mile below the russian mission and a mile or so up the kuskoquim slough wreck there oh no go into winter quarter in a slew for it be so father will pronounce s-l-o-u-g-h oh that be what they call a blind river up in this country they come into the big stream every here and there and cheechalko be always mistake they for the main channel sometimes they be wider and deeper for a mile or so than the river proper but before you know it they land you in a marsh this place i be go to a little way up the kuskoquim out of danger when the ice break up have be choose for a new station by the n a t and t company -- rival you know to the old-established alaska commercial that inherit the russian fur monopoly and control the seal and salmon trade so long well the younger company run the old one hard and they have send this steamer into winter quarter load with provision ready to start for dawson the instant the ice go out why then it be the very boat that 'll be takin ' we to the klondyke you just goin ' down to have a look at she asked pott enviously no i go to get relief for the pymeut what be the matter with 'em epidemic all summer starvation now guess you will not find _ any_body 's get such a lot he want to give it away to the indian we father superior have give much say the priest gently but we be not inexhaustible at holy cross and the long winter be before we many of the supply steamer have fail to get in and the country be flood with gold-seeker there 'll be wide-spread want this year -- terrible suffer all up and down the river the more reason for people to hold on to what they have get a white man 's worth more 'n a indian the priest 's face show no anger not even coldness white man have get a great deal out of alaska and as yet do little but harm here the government ought to help the native and we believe the government will all we ask of the captain of the _ oklahoma _ be to sell we on fair term a certain supply we assume part of the risk and both of we look to the government to make it good reckon you 'll find that steamer-load down in the ice be worth its weight in gold say pott one must always try reply the father he leave the doorpost straighten he bow back and lay a hand on the wooden latch but nichola -- when you leave pymeut be he -- begin the boy oh he be all right the father smile and nod brother paul have be look after nichola 's father the old chief have enough food but he have be very ill by the way have you any letter you want to send out oh if we would only know be the general chorus and pott fly to close and stamp one he have hardly more than begin to the future mr pott the boy have thoughtlessly open the door to have a look at the dog shut that da -- do not keep the door open howl pott try to hold he precious letter down on the table while he add only two word the boy slam the door behind he with all we trouble the cabin be not really warm say the colonel apologetically in a wind like this if the door be open we have to hold fast to thing to keep they from run down the yukon it be a trial to anybody 's temper why do not you build a false wall well i do not know we have not think of it you would find it correct this draught and the priest explain he view on the subject while pott 's letter be be address andrew put he head in ready father as the priest be pocket the letter the boy dash in put on the arctic cap he set such store by and a fur coat and mitten do you mind if i go a little way with you he say of course not answer the priest i will send he back in half a hour he say low to the colonel it be a hitter day it be curious how already he have divine the relation of the elder man to the youngest of that odd household the moment they have go mac with a obvious effort pull himself up out of he corner and come towards the colonel at the fireplace he say thickly : you have put a insult upon I warren and that be what i stand from no man come outside the colonel look at he all right mac but we have just eat a rousing big dinner even sullivan would not accept that as the moment for a round we 'll both have forty wink hey and pott shall call we and o'flynn shall be umpire you can have the boy 's bunk mac be in a haze again and allow himself to be insinuate into bed the other get rid of the dinner thing and sit round for a hour doubt if he sleep long say pott a little before two that be what he be be do all morning we have not have any fresh meat for a week return the colonel significantly why do not you and o'flynn go down to meet the boy and come round by the wood there 'll be full moon up by four o'clock you might get a brace of grouse or a rabbit or two o'flynn be not very keen about it but the jesuit 's visit have stir he up and he offer less opposition to the unusual call to activity than the colonel expect when at last he be leave alone with the sleep man the kentuckian put on a couple more log and sit down to wait at three he get up swing the crane round so that the dart tongue of flame could lick the hot-water pot and then he measure out some coffee in a quarter of a hour the cabin be full of the fragrance of good mocha the colonel sit and wait presently he pour out a little coffee and drink it slowly blissfully with half-closed eye but when he have set the granite cup down again he stand up alert like a man ready for business mac have be asleep nearly three hour the other would not be long now well if they come prematurely they must go to the little cabin for awhile the colonel shoot the bar across door and jamb for the second time that day mac stir and lift himself on he elbow but he be not really awake pott he say huskily the colonel make no sound pott measure I out two finger will you cabin 's damn cold no answer mac rouse himself mutter compliment for pott when he have bundle himself out over the side of the bunk he see the colonel seemingly doze by the fire he wait a moment then very softly he make he way to the farther end of the swing-shelf the colonel open one eye shut it and shuffle in a sleepy sort of way mac turn sharply back to the fire the colonel open he eye and yawn i make some cawfee a little while back have some no better it be a 1 where 's pott go out for a little back soon he pour out some of the strong black decoction and present it to he companion just try it finest cawfee in the world sir mac pour it down without seem to bother about tasting it they sit quite still after that till the colonel say meditatively : you and i have a little account to settle do not we i be ready but neither move for several moment see here mac : you have not be ill or anything like that have you no there be no uncertain note in the answer if anything there be in it more than the usual toneless decision mac 's voice be machine-made -- as innocent of modulation as a buzz-saw and with the same uncompromising finality as the shooting of a bolt i be ready to stand up against any man good interrupt the colonel glad o ' that for i be just longing to see you stand up -- mac be on he foot in a flash you have only to say so if you want to see I stand up against any man alive and when i sit down again it be my opinion one of we two will not be good-lookin ' any more he push back the stool i think maybe it be only necessary to mention it say the colonel slowly i have be want for a fortnight to see you stand up -- mac turn fiercely -- against samuel david maccann come on i be in no mood for monkeyin ' nor i i realize maccann we have come to a kind of a crisis thing in this camp be either go a lot better or a lot worse after to-day there be nothing wrong if you quit ask dirty jesuit to sit down with honest man yes there be something worse out o ' shape than that mac wait warily when we be strand here and see what we would let ourselves in for there be not one of we that do not think thing look pretty much like the last o ' pea time there be just one circumstance that keep we from throw up the sponge _ we have a man in camp _ the colonel pause mac stand as expressionless as the wooden crane a man we all believe in who be go to help we pull through that be you i s ` pose mac 's hard voice chop out the sarcasm you know mighty well who it be the boy 's all right but he be young for this kind o ' thing -- young and heady there be not much wrong with I that i be aware of except that i do not know shuck pott 's peter out be not altogether a surprise and nobody expect anything from o'flynn till we get to dawson when a lawyer and a fellum with capital behind he may come in handy but there be one man -- who have a head on he who have experience and who -- he lean over to emphasise the climax -- who have _ character _ it be on that man 's account that i join this party mac put he hand in he pocket and lean against the wall he face begin to look a little more natural the long sleep or the coffee have clear he eye shall i tell you what i hear about that man last night ask the colonel gravely mac look up but never open he lip you remember you would not sit here -- the boy be always in and out the cabin be cold i leave the boy and o'flynn at supper-time and go down to the little cabin to -- to see what i be doin ' -- to spy on I well all right -- maybe i be spy too incidentally i want to tell you the cabin be hot as blaze and get you to come to supper i meet pott hurry up for he grub and i say ` where 's mac be not he come ' and you pardner 's answer be : ` oh let he alone he be get a flask in he bunk swillin ' and gruntin ' he be just in hog-heaven ' damn that sneak the man he be talkin ' about mac be the man we have all build we hope on i 'll teach pott -- you can not mac pott have get to die and go to heaven -- perhaps to hell before he 'll learn any good but you be a different breed teach maccann mac suddenly sit down on the stool with he head in he hand the boy have not catch on say the colonel presently but he say something this morning to show he be wonder about the change that be come over you that i do not split wood all day i suppose when we have get enough for a month pott do not either why do not you go for pott as the boy say i do not care about pott it be mac that matter do the boy say that he look up the colonel nod after you have make that chimney you know you be a kind of hero in he eye mac look away the cabin 's be cold he mutter we be go to remedy that i do not bring any liquor into camp you must admit that i do not intend -- i do admit it and when o'flynn say that about keep he big demijohn out of the inventory and apart from the common store i sit on he so you do i know it be safest to act on the ` medicinal purpose ' principle so it be but i be not think so much of o'flynn i be think of thing that have happen before for i would have experience drink be the curse of caribou it be something of a scourge up in nova scotium i would have experience you do the very best thing possible under the circumstance mac be feel about after he self-respect and must be help to get hold of it i realize too that the temptation be much greater in cold country say the kentuckian unblushingly italian and greek do not want fiery drink half as much as russian and scandinavian -- have not the same craving as nova scotian and cold-country people generally i suppose but that only show temperance be of more vital importance in the north that be right it be not much in my line to shift blame even when i do not deserve it but you know so much you might as well know it be not i who open that demijohn first but you do not mind be the one to shut it up -- do you shut it up yes let 's get it down and -- the colonel swing it off the shelf it be nearly empty and only the boy 's and the colonel 's single bottle stand unbroached even so mac 's prolonged spree be something of a mystery to the kentuckian it must be that a very little be too much for mac the colonel hand the demijohn to he companion and light the solitary candle standing on its little block of wood hold in place between three half-driven nail what be that for do not you want to seal it up i have not get any wax i have a inch or so the colonel produce out of he pocket the only piece in camp mac pick up a billet of wood and drive the cork in flush with the neck then place upright on the cork the helve of the hammer he drive the cork down a quarter of a inch farther give I you wax what be for a seal they look about mac 's eye fall on a metal button that hang by a thread from the old militia jacket he be wear he put he hand up to it pause glance hurriedly at the colonel and let he finger fall yes yes say the kentuckian that 'll make a capital seal no something of yours i think colonel the top of that tony pencil-case hey the colonel produce he gold pencil watch mac heat the wax drop it into the neck of the demijohn and apply the initial end of the colonel 's property while mac without any further waste of word be swing the wicker-bound temptation up on the shelf again they hear voice they be come back say the kentuckian hurriedly but we have settle we little account have not we old man mac jerk he head in that automatic fashion that with he mean genial and whole-hearted agreement and if pott or o'flynn want to break that seal -- i 'll call 'em down say mac and the colonel know the seal be safe \* \* \* \* \* by-the-by colonel say the boy just as he be turn in that night i -- a -- i have ask that jesuit chap to the house-warming oh you do do you yes well you would just better have a talk with mac about it yes i have be tryin ' to think how i would square mac of course i know i 'll have to go easy on the raw i reckon you just will if monkey-wrench screw down hard on I you 'll come to the rescue will not you colonel no i 'll side with mac on that subject whatever he say go humph _ that _ jesuit 's all right not a word out of the colonel chapter iii two new spissimen medwjedew -lrb- zu luka -rrb- tag ' mal -- wer bist du ich kenne dich nicht luka kennst du denn sonst alle leute medwjedew in meinem revier mu ich jeden kennen und dich kenn ` ich nicht luka das kommt wohl daher onkelchen da dein revier nicht die ganze erde umfasst 's ist da noch ein endchen drauen geblieben one of the curious result of what be call wild life be a bless release from many of the timidity that assail the easy liver in the centre of civilisation pott be the only one in the white camp who have doubt about the wisdom of have to do with the native however the agreeable necessity of go to pymeut to invite nichola to the blow-out be not force upon the boy they be still hard at it four day after the jesuit have go he way surround the big cabin with a false wall that final and effectual barrier against borea -- finish touch warrant to convert a cabin so cold that it drive its inmate to drink into a dwelling where practical people without crack a dreary joke might fitly celebrate a house-warming in spite of the shortness of the day father will 's suggestion be be carry out with a gratifying success already manifest be the advantage of the stockade run at a foot 's distance round the cabin to the height of the eaves make of spruce sapling not even lop of they short bushy branch but plant close together after burn the ground clear of snow a second visitation of mild weather and a further two day ' thaw make the colonel determine to fill in the space between the spruce stockade and the cabin with burnt-out soil closely pack down and well tramp in it be generally concede as the winter wear on that to this contrivance of the earthwork belong a good half of the credit of the big cabin and its renown as be the warmest spot on the lower river that terrible memorable year of the klondyke rush the evergreen wall with the big stone chimney shoulder itself up to look out upon the frozen highway become a conspicuous feature in the landscape welcome as the week go on to many a eye weary with long look for shelter and blind by the snow-whitened waste a exception to what become a rule be of all man nichola when the stockade be half do the prince and a equerry appear on the horizon with the second team the camp have see the driver much concern to steer clear of the softened snow and keep to that part of the river ice windswept and firm if roughest of all nichola regard the stockade with a cold and beady eye no he have not time to look at it he have promise to mush he be not even hungry it do little credit to he heart but he seem more in haste to leave he new friend than the least friendly of they would have expect oh wait a sec urge the deeply disappointed boy i want awf ` ly to see how you sled be make it be better 'n father will ' humph grunt nichola scornfully he no get innuit sled mac and i be goin ' to try soon be the stockade 's do -- goo ' - bye interrupted nichola but the boy pay no attention to the word of farewell he kneel down in the snow and examine the sled carefully spruce runner he call out to mac and -- jee they be shoe with ivory _ jee _ fasten with sinew and wooden peg hey -- look up incredulously at nichola -- not a nail in the whole shebang eh nail say nichola huh no _ nail _ as contemptuously as though the boy have say bread-crumb well she be a daisy when you comin ' back comin ' pretty quick goin ' pretty quick goo ' - bye _ mush _ shout nichola to he companion and the dog get up off they haunch but the boy only laugh at nicholas 's struggle to get start he hang on to the loaded sled examine praise while the dog after the merest affectation of try to make a start look round at he over they loose collar and grin contentedly I get to mush show nex ' time mush what be here the boy shout through the mushing and he tug at the goodly load so neatly dispose under a old reindeer-skin sleeping-bag and lash down with raw hide that oh that be fish _ fish _ get so much fish at starve pymeut you can go haul it down river well sir _ we _ want fish we _ must _ have fish hey the boy appeal to the other yes r-right y' arre i reckon we just do but nichola have other view no I take he -- he hitch he body in the direction of ikogimeut bless my soul you have get enough there for a regiment you goin ' to sell he hey nichola shake he head oh come off the roof advise the boy genially you be not carryin ' it about for you health i suppose say pott the people down at ikogimeut do not need it like we we be white duffer and can not get fish through the ice you sell _ some _ of it to we but nichola shake he head and shuffle along on he snow-shoe beckon the dog-driver to follow or trade some fur -- fur tay suggest o'flynn or for sugar say mac or for tobacco tempt the colonel and before that last word nichola 's resolve go down up at the cabin he unlash the load and it quickly become manifest that nichola be a dandy at drive a bargain he keep on say shamelessly : more -- more shuhg hey oh yes I give heap fish no nuff shuhg if it have not be for mac -lrb- he own clear-headed self again and by no means to be humbug by any prince alive -rrb- the purchase of a portion of that load of frozen fish cord up like so much wood would have lay waste the commissariat but if the white man after this passage do not feel a absolute confidence in nicholas 's fairness of mind no such unworthy suspicion of they find lodgment in the bosom of the prince with the exception of some tobacco he leave all he ill-gotten store to be keep for he by he new friend till he should return when be that to be in five sleep he would be back good we 'll have the stockade do by then what do you say to we big chimney nichola he emit a scornful peeluck what we chimney no good he shrug : why you have so tall hole you house how you cover he up we do not want to cover he up humph winter fin ' you tall hole winter come down -- bring in snow -- drive fire out he shiver in anticipation of what be to happen peeluck the white man laugh what you up to now where you go well the fact be nicholas have be send by he great ally the father superior of holy cross on a mission very important demand despatch father brachet -- he know he heap better send nichola when he want man go god-damn quick I no stop -- no -- no stop he draw on he mitten proudly unjarred by remembrance of how he good resolution have come to grief where you off to now I ketchum father will -- I give letter he tap he deerskin-covered chest ketchum _ sure _ ` fore he leave ikogimeut you come back with father will nichola nod hooray we 'll all work like sixty shout the boy and by Saturday -lrb- that be five sleep -rrb- we 'll have the wall do and the house warm and you and -- he catch himself up not thus in public would he break the news to mac -- you 'll be back in time for the big blow-out to clinch matter he accompany nichola from the cabin to the river trail explain : you savvy big feast -- all same indian heap good grub no prayer-meetin ' -- you savvy -- no church this time big fire big feed all kind -- apple shuhg bacon -- no cook he you no like he add basely truckling to the prince 's peculiar taste nichola roll he single eye in joyful anticipation and promise faithfully to grace the scene \* \* \* \* \* this be all very fine but father will the last thing at night and the first thing in the morning the boy look the problem in the face and devise now this now that adroit and disarm fashion of break the news to mac but it be only when the daring giver of invitation be safely in bed and mac equally safe down in the little cabin that it seem possible to broach the subject he devise scene in which airily and triumphantly he introduce father will and bring mac to the point of pine for jesuit society but these scene be actable only under condition of darkness and of solitude the colonel refuse to have anything to do with the matter we first business as i see it be to keep peace in the camp and hold fast to a good understanding with one another it be just over little thing like this that trouble begin mac 's one of we father will be a outsider i will not rile mac for the sake of any jesuit alive no sir this be _ you _ funeral and you be oblige to attend before three of nichola 's five sleep be accomplish the boy begin to curse the hour he have lay eye on father will he begin even to speculate desperately on the good priest 's chance of tumble into a air-hole or be devour by a timely wolf but no life be never so considerate as that yet he could neither face be the cause of the first serious row in camp nor endure the thought of have he particular guest -- drat he -- flout and the whole house-warming turn to failure and humiliation indeed the case look desperate only one day more now before he would appear -- be flout insult and go off wounded angry leave the boy with a irreconciliable quarrel against mac and the house-warming turn to chill recrimination and to wretchedness but until the last phantasmal hope go down before the logic of event it be impossible not to cling to the idea of melting mac 's arctic heart there be still one course untried since there be so little leave to do to the stockade the boy announce that he think he would go up over the hill for a tramp gun in hand and grub in pocket he march off to play he last trump-card if he could bring home a queer enough bird or beast for the collection there be still hope to what length might mac not go if one dangle before he the priceless bait of a golden-tipped emperor goose dress in imperial robe of rose-flecked snow or who know mac would not trust a _ xema sabinius _ to play the part of a white-winged angel of peace fail some such heavenly messenger there be nothing for it but that the boy should face the ignominy of go forth to meet the father on the morrow and confess the humiliating truth it be not fair to let he come expect hospitality and find -- vision arise of mac receive the bent and wayworn missionary with the greet : there be no corner by the fire no place in the camp for a pander to the scarlet woman the thought lend impassioned fervor to the quest for goose or gull it be pretty late when he get back to camp and the man be at supper no he have not shoot anything what be that bulge in you pocket sort o ' stone strike it rich do not give I any chin-music boy give I tea i be dog-tired but when mac get up first as usual to go down to the little cabin to wood up for the night i 'll walk down with you say the boy though it be plain he be dead-beat he help to revive the fail fire and then drop on the section of saw wood that do duty for a chair with some difficulty and a deal of tug he pull the sort o ' stone out of the pocket of he duck shooting-jacket see that he hold the thing tightly clasp in he two red chap hand mac bent down shade he eye from the faint flame flicker what be it piece o ' tooth by the lord harry so it be he take the thing nearer the faint light fossil where would you get it over yonder -- by a little frozen river how far any more only this the boy do not answer he go outside and return instantly lug in something brown and whitish weather-stained unwieldy i drop this at the door as i come along home think it might do for the collection mac stare with all he eye and hurriedly light a candle the boy drop exhaust on a ragged bit of burlap by the bunk mac kneel down opposite pour liberal libation of candle-grease on the uncouth bony mass between they part of the skull he rasp out mask he ecstasy as well as he could mastodon inquire the boy mac shake he head i 'll bet my boot say mac it be a _ elepha primigenius _ and if i be right it be ' a find ' young man where would you stumble on he over yonder the boy lean he head against the lower bunk where across the divide the bone have be drag up on to some rock i see the end of a tusk stickin ' up out of the snow and i scratch down till i find -- he indicate the trophy between they on the floor tusk how long ` bout nine foot we 'll go and get it to-morrow no answer from the boy early hey well -- a -- it be a good way what if it be oh i do not mind i would do more 'n that for you mac there be something unnatural in such devotion mac look up but the boy be too tired to play the big fish any longer i wonder if you 'll do something for I he watch with a sink heart mac 's sharp uprising from the worshipful attitude it be not like any other mortal 's gradual many-jointed getting-up it be more like the sudden spring out of the big blade of a clasp-knife what be you game oh i be not get any game say the boy desperately or if i have there be mighty little fun in it however i do not know as i want to walk ten hour again in this kind o ' weather with a elephant on my back just for -- for the poetry o ' the thing he lay he chapped hand on the side board of the bunk and pull himself up on he leg what be you game repeat mac sternly as the boy reach the door what be the good o ' talkin ' he answer but he pause turn and lean heavily against the rude lintel course i know you would be shoot before you would do it but what i would _ like _ would be to hear you say you would not kick up a hell of a row if father will happen in to the house-warmin ' mac jerk he set face fire-reddened towards the fossil-finder and he without wait for more simply open the door and heavily foot it back to the big cabin \* \* \* \* \* next morning when mac come to breakfast he hear that the boy have have he grub half a hour before the usual time and be go off on some tramp again mac sit and muse o'flynn come in with a drip bucket and sit down to breakfast shiver which way would he go the boy down river sure he do not go over the divide o'flynn be sure he would just be down to the water-hole and in the faint light he have see the boy far down on the river-trail leppin like a hare in the direction of the roosian mission goin ' to meet a nichola reckon so say the colonel a bit ruffle do not believe he 'll run like a hare very far with he foot all blister do you know he would discover a fossil elephant no well he have i must light out too and have a look at it do it 'll be a cheerful sort of house-warming with one of you off scour the country for more blister and chilblain and another huntin ' antediluvian elephant the colonel speak with uncommon irascibility the great feast-day have certainly not dawn propitiously when breakfast be do mac leave the big cabin without a word but instead of go over the divide across the treeless snow-waste to the little frozen river where turn up to the pale northern dawn be lie the bone of a beast that have trample tropic forest in that other dawn of the prime the naturalist turn he back on _ elepha primigenius _ follow in the track of the boy down the great river towards ikogimeut \* \* \* \* \* on the low left bank of the yukon a little camp on one side a big rock hood with snow at right angle draw up one on top of the other two sled cover with reindeer-skin hold down by stone in the corner form by the angle of rock and sled a small a-tent very stain and old burning before it on a hearth of greenwood a little fire struggle with a veer wind mac have see from far off the faint blue banner of smoke blow now right now leave then toss aloft in the pallid sunshine he look about sharply for the boy as he have be do this two hour there be the jesuit bend over the fire better the precarious position of a saucepan that insist on sit lop-sided look down into the heart of coal nichola be hold up the tent-flap hello how do he sing out recognize mac the priest glance up and nod pleasantly two indian squat on the other side of the fire scramble away as the shift wind bring a cloud of stifle smoke into they face where 's the boy demand mac arrest the stampede nichola 's dog-driver stare wink and wipe he weep smoke-reddened eye be he in there mac look towards the tent andrew nod between cough what be he do in there call he out order mac he no walk mac 's hard face take on a look of cast-iron tragedy the wind veer round again have bring the last word to the priest on the other side of the fire oh it 'll be all right by-and-by he say cheerfully but knock up like that just for blister blister no cold and general weakness that be why we delay -- without wait to hear more mac stride over to the tent and as he go in nichola come out no sign of the boy -- nobody nothing what down in the corner a small yellow face lie in a nest of fur bright dark eye stare roundly and as mac glower astonish at the apparition a mouth full of gleam tooth open smile to say in a very small voice : farva astonish as mac be disappointed and relieved all at once there be something arrest in the appeal i be not you father he say stiffly who be you hey you speak english the child

free itself hold out its arm the mite of hand flutter at he sleeve and make ineffectual clutch what do you want to he own vast astonishment mac lift the little thing out of its warm nest it be woefully thin and seem even to he inexperience to be insufficiently clothed though the beaded moccasin on its tiny foot be new and good why you be only about as big as a minute he say gruffly what be the matter -- sick it suddenly strike he as very extraordinary that he should have take up the child and how extremely embarrassing it would be if anyone come in and catch he clutch the small morsel awkwardly he fumble with the fur preparatory to get rid without delay of the unusual burden while he be straighten the thing father will appear at the flap smoking saucepan in hand the instant the cold air strike the child it begin to cough oh you must not do that say the priest to mac with unexpected severity kaviak must lie in bed and keep warm down on the floor go the saucepan the child be catch away from the surprised mac and the fur so closely gather round the small shrunken body that there be once more nothing visible but the wistful yellow face and gleaming eye still turn searchingly on its most recent acquaintance but the priest without so much as a glance at the new-comer proceed to feed kaviak out of the saucepan blow vigorously at each spoonful before administer he be pretty hungry comment mac where would you find he in a little village up on the kuskoquim kaviak 's a esquimaux from norton sound be not you kaviak but the child be wholly absorb it seem in swallow and stare at mac he family come up there from the coast in a bidarra only last summer -- all dead now everybody else in the village -- and there be not but a handful -- all ail and all hungry i be

and he be for hurry on they be superstitious you know about a place where people have die but i crawl in and find this little thing lie in a bundle of rag with its hand bind and dry grass stuff in its mouth it be too weak to stir or do more than occasionally to make that muffle noise that i would hear come up through the smoke-hole what you goin ' to do with he well i hardly know the sister will look after he for a while if i get he there alive why should not you kaviak supply the answer straightway by choke and fall into a appalling fit of cough i have get some stuff that 'll be good for

turn out from each beaver gauntlet a inner mitten of knit wool here he say and put both little moccasined foot into one of the capacious mitten much pleased with he ingenuity he go on wind the long scarf until the yellow little esquimaux bear a certain whimsical resemblance to one of the adorable delium robbium infant but mac 's sinewy hand be exert a greater pressure than he realize the morsel make a remonstrant squeak and squirm feebly oh oh too tight beg you pardon say mac hastily as though not only english but punctilious manners be understand of kaviak he relax the woollen bandage till

feast there would probably be no guest even they own little company would likely be incomplete but t here be to be a spread that afternoon anyways even have the colonel need any keep up to the mark the office would have be cheerfully undertake by o'flynn or by pott for whom interest in the gustatory aspect of the occasion be wholly undimmed by the threaten absence of mac and the little divvle

turn decisively and stir the mush-pot with a magnificent air and a newly-whittled birch stick to give the big cabin a aspect of solid luxury they have spread the boy 's old buffalo robe on the floor and as the morning wear on pott and o'flynn make one or two expedition to the little cabin bring back selection out of mac 's hoard to decorate the banquet-hall as they say on the last trip pott refuse to accompany he pardner -- no it be no good mac evidently would not be back to see and the laugh would be on they takin ' so much trouble for nothin ' and o'flynn be not to be long either for dinner have be absurdly postpone already when the door open the next time it be to admit mac nichola with kaviak in he arm o'flynn gesticulate like a windmill and last of all the boy kaviak be formally introduce but instead of respond to he host ' attention the only thing he seem to care about or even see be something that in the hurly-burly everybody else overlook -- the decoration mac 's stuff bird and thing make a remarkably good show but the colossal success be reserve for the minute shrunken skin of the baby white hare set down in front of the great fire for a hearthrug if the other fail to appreciate that joke not so kaviak he give a gurgling cry struggle down out of nichola 's arm and fold the white hare to he breast where be the other indian say mac look after the dog

the meantime y-yes say the colonel look as if he have enough to think about already yes we always wash they first of all say father will notice how mac hold the little heathen off at arm 's length nichola use to help with that at holy cross he give the new order with the old authoritative gesture and where 's the liniment i lend you that you be so generous with mac arraign o'flynn go and get it under nicholas 's hand kaviak be force to relinquish not only the baby hare but he own elf lock he be closely shear he moccasin put off and he single garment drag unceremoniously wrong side out over he head and bundle out of door be the siven he be get as manny bone as a skeleton poor little codger the colonel stand a instant skillet in hand stare what be that he be get round he neck say the boy move nearer kaviak see the keen look menace he treasure lift a shrunken yellow hand and clasped tight the dirty shapeless object suspend from a raw-hide necklace nichola seem to hesitate to divest he of this sole remain possession you must get he to give it up say father will and burn it kaviak flatly decline to fall in with as much as he understand of this arrangement what be it anyway the boy pursue he amulet i suppose as father will proceed to enforce he order and pull the leather string over the child 's head kaviak rent the air with shriek and cough he seem to say as well as he could i can do without my parkus and my muckluck but i 'll take my death without my amulet mac insinuate himself brusquely between the victim and he persecutor he take the dirty object away from the priest with scant ceremony in spite of the whisper infection and give it back to the wrathful owner you talk he language do not you mac demand of nichola the pymeut pilot nod tell he if he 'll lend the thing to I to wash he shall have it back nichola explain kaviak with streaming eye and quiver lip reluctantly hand it over and watch mac anxiously till overwhelm by a yet greater misfortune in the shape of a bath for himself how shall i clean this thing thoroughly mac condescend to ask father will the priest shrug he 'll have forget it to-morrow he shall have it to-morrow say mac with he back to kaviak the boy o'flynn and pott crowd round he mac rip open the little bird-skin pouch and take out three object -- a ivory mannikin a crow 's feather and a thing that father will say be a seal-blood plug what be it for same as the rest it be a amulet only as it be use to stop the flow of blood from the wound of a captive seal it be suppose to be the best of all charm for anyone who spit blood i 'll clean 'em all after the blow-out say mac and he go out bury the charm in the snow and stick up a spruce twig to mark the spot meanwhile to poor kaviak it be be plainly demonstrate what a awful fate descend on a person so unlucky as to part with he amulet he stand straight up in the bucket like a champagne-bottle in a cooler and he could not have resent he predicament more if he have be set in crushed ice instead of warm water under the remorseless hand of nichola he begin to splutter and choke to fizz and finally explode with astonishment and wrath it be quite clear nichola be try to drown he he take the treatment so to heart that he keep on howl dismally for some time after he be take out and dry and liniment and dose by mac whose treachery about the amulet he seem to forgive since farva have have the air of rescue he from the horror he have endure in that water-bucket where for all kaviak know he might have stay till he succumb to death the boy contribute a shirt of he own and help mac to put it on the incredibly thin little figure the shirt come down to kaviak 's heel and have to have the sleeve roll up every two minute but by the time the reindeer-steak be nearly do kaviak be do too and o'flynn have say that spissiman do ye credit mac say spissiman be now stare hungrily out of the colonel 's bunk hold towards mac a appealing hand with half a yard of shirt-sleeve fall over it mac pretend not to see and draw up to the table the one remain available thing to sit on he back to he patient when the dog have be feed and the other indian have come in and squat on the buffalo-skin with nichola the first course be send round in tin cup a nondescript but warm camp soup sorry we have get so few dish gentleman the colonel have say we 'll have to ask some of you to wait till other have finish farva remark kaviak lean out of the bunk and sniff the savoury steam he take you for a priest say pott with the cheerful intention of stir mac 's bile but not even so damn a suspicion as that could cool the collector 's kindness for he new spissiman you come here he say kaviak do not understand the boy get up limp over to the bunk lift the child out and bring he to mac 's side since there be not enough cup say mac in self-justification and he put he own half empty to kaviak 's lip the spissiman imbibe greedily audibly and beam mac with unimpaired gravity take no notice of the huge satisfaction this particular remedy be give he patient except to say solemnly do not bubble in it the next course be fish a la pymeut you be lucky to be able to get it say the father whether with suspicion or not no man could tell i have to send back for some by a trader and could not get enough we do not see any trader say the boy to divert the current he may have go by in the dusk he be travel hotfoot think that steamship be chockful o ' grub what do you want o ' fish yes they have get plenty of food but -- they do not relish parting with it suggest pott they have not much to think about except what they eat they want to try we fish and be ready to exchange i promise i would send a load back from ikogimeut if they would -- he seem not to care to finish the sentence so you do not do much for the pymeut after all i do something he say almost shortly then with recover serenity he turn to the boy : i promise i would bring back any news yes well everybody stop eat and hang on the priest 's word captain rainey 's hear there be a big new strike -- in the klondyke on the american side this time hail columbium whereabouts at a place call minook where 's that up the river by the rampart how far oh a little matter of six or seven hundred mile from here glory to god might as well be six or seven thousand and very probably be not a bona-fide strike at all say the priest but just a stampede -- a very different matter well i tell you straight : i get no use for a gold-mine in minook at this time o ' year nop venison steak 's more in my line than grub-stake just about now pott have to bestir himself and wash dish before he could indulge in he line when the grilled reindeer do appear flank by really-truly potato and the colonel 's hot kentucky biscuit there be no longer doubt in any man 's mind but what this blow-out be be a success colonel 's a daisy cook be not he the boy appeal to father will the jesuit assent cordially my family mean _ I _ for the army he say see much service colonel the kentuckian laugh never waste a day soldier in my life oh maybe you be wonderin ' say pott why he be a colonel the jesuit make a deprecatory gesture politely disclaim any such rude curiosity he be from kentucky you see and the smile go round beyond that we can not tell you why he be a colonel unless it be because he be not a judge and the boss of the camp laugh with the rest for the denver man have score by the time they get to the californium apricot and boil rice everybody be feel pretty comfortable when at last the table be clear except for the granite-ware basin full of punch and when all available cup be muster and tobacco-pouch come out a remarkably genial spirit pervade the company -- with three exception pott and o'flynn wait anxiously to sample the punch before give way to complete satisfaction and kaviak be impervious to consideration either of punch or conviviality be wrap in slumber on a corner of the buffalo-skin between mac 's stool and the native who also occupy place on the floor upon o'flynn 's first draught he turn to he next neighbor : pott I bhoy ` tai not s ' bad i 'll bet five dollar it will not make yer any happier begob i be happy enough gentleman wud ye like i should sing ye a song yes yes and the colonel thump the table for order infinitely relieve that the dinner be do and the punch not likely to turn into a _ casus bellus _ o'flynn begin a ditty about the widdy malone that wake up kaviak and make he rub he round eye with astonishment he sit up and hang on to the back of mac 's coat to make sure he have some anchorage in the strange new water he have so suddenly be call on to navigate the song end the colonel as toast-master propose the health of -- he be go to say father will but feel it discreeter to name no name stand up in the middle of the cabin where he do not have to stoop he lift he cup till it knock against the swing-shelf and call out here be to we visitor neighbor and friend whereupon he make a stately circular bow which end by he offering kaviak he hand in the manner of one who execute a figure in a old-fashioned dance the smallest of we visitor still keep hold of mac present the colonel with the disengaged half-yard of flannel undershirt on the other side and the speech go on very flowery very hospitable very kentuckian when the colonel sit down there be much applause and o'flynn who have lend he cup to nichola and do not feel he could wait till it come back begin to drink punch out of the dipper between shout of : hooray brayvo here be to the kurrnul god bless he that be rale oratry kurrnul here be to kentucky -- and ould ireland father will stand up smile to reply _ friend _ -lrb- the boy think the keen eye rest a fraction of a moment longer on mac than on the rest -rrb- -- _ i think in some way this be the pleasantest house-warming i ever go to i will not take up time thank the colonel for the friendly sentiment he be express though i return they heartily i must use these moment you be good enough to give I in tell you something of what i feel be imply in the founding of this camp of yours gentleman the few white dweller in the yukon country have not look forward _ -lrb- he eye twinkle almost wickedly -rrb- _ with that pleasure you might expect in exile to the influx of people bring up here by the great gold discovery we know what that sort of craze lead to we know that in a barren land like this more and more denude of wild game every year more and more the prey of epidemic disease -- we know that into this sorely try and hungry world would come a horde of man all of they ignorant of the condition up here most of they ill-provided with proper food and clothing many of they -lrb- i can say it without offence in this company -rrb- -- many of they man whom the older richer community be glad to get rid of gentleman i have venture to take you into we confidence so far because i want to take you still farther -- to tell you a little of the intense satisfaction with which we recognize that good fortune have send we in you just the sort of neighbor we have not dare to hope for it mean more to we than you realize when i hear a few week ago that in addition to the boat-load that have already get some distance up the river beyond holy cross -- _ go to dawson oh yes klondyke mad -- they 'll be there before we boy anyways they 'll get to minook the jesuit shake he head it be not so certain they probably make only a couple of hundred mile or so before the yukon go to sleep then if grub give out they 'll be comin ' back here suggest pott _ small doubt of it _ agree the priest _ and when i hear there be party of the same sort strand at interval all along the lower river -- _ you sure he nod _ and when father orloff of the russian mission tell we that he be already have trouble with the two big rival party freeze in the ice below ikogimeut -- _ gosh wonder if any of 'em be on we ship _ well gentleman i do not disguise from you that when i hear of the large amount of whiskey the small amount of food and the low type of manners bring in by these gold-seeker i feel my fear justify such man do not work do not contribute anything to the decent social life of the community do not build cabin like this when i come down on the ice the first time after you would camp and i look up and see you solid stone chimney _ -lrb- he glance at mac -rrb- _ i do not know what a house-warming it would make but already from far off across the ice and snow that chimney warm my heart gentleman the fame of it have go up the river and down the river father orloff be come to see it next week and so be the white trader from anvik and andreiefsky for they have hear there be nothing like it in the yukon of course i know that you gentleman have not come to settle permanently i know that when the great white silence as they call the long winter up here be break by the thunder of the ice rush down to the sea you like the rest will exchange the snow-field for the gold-field and pass out of we ken now i be not usually prone to try my hand at prophecy but i be tempt to say even on we short acquaintance that i be tolerably sure that while we shall be willing enough to spare most of the new-comer to the klondyke we shall grudge to the gold-field the man who build this camp and warm this cabin _ -lrb- he eye rest reflectively on mac -rrb- _ i do not wish to sit down leave a impression of speak with entire lack of sympathy of the impulse that bring man up here for gold i believe that even with the sort in the two camp below ikogimeut -- drinking quarrel and make trouble with the native at the russian mission -- i believe that even with they the gold they come up here for be a symbol -- a fetich some of we may think when such man have it in they hand they feel dimly that they be lay tangible hold at last on some elusive vision of happiness that have hitherto escape they behind each man brave the arctic winter up here be some hope not all ignoble some devotion not all unsanctified behind most of these man i seem to see a wife or child a parent or some dear dream that give that man he share in

when the world be young -- when all hearing be music when all sight be picture when every sense bring marvel that seem the everyday way of the wonderful wonderful world for a obvious reason it be not through the utterance of the greatest that the child receive he first intimation of the beauty and the mystery of thing these come in lowly guise with familiar everyday voice but they eloquence have the incommunicable grace of infancy the promise of the first dawn the menace of the first night do you remember the thing about the screech-owl and the weather sign say the colonel rouse at last by

light reindeer skin blanket lash it packwise on he back shoulder he gun and make off before the trio come in to breakfast the first sign that he be near a settlement be the appearance of what look like section of rude wicker fencing set up here and there in the river and frozen fast in the ice high on the bank lay one of the long cornucopia-shaped basket fish-trap and presently he catch sight of something in the bleak arctic landscape that make he heart jump something that to florida eye look familiar why if it do not make I think of john fox 's cabin on cypress creek he say to himself formulate a impression that have vaguely haunt he on the lower river in September wonder if the yukon flood like the caloosahatchee and if the water could reach as far up as all that he stop to have a good look at this first one of the pymeut cache for this modest edifice like a noah 's ark on four leg be not a habitation but a storehouse and be perch so high not for fear of flood but for fear of dog and mouse this be manifest from the fact that there be fish-rack and even ighloos much nearer the river the boy stop and hesitate it be a sore temptation to climb up and see what they have in that cache there be a invite plank all ready with stick nail on it transversely to prevent the foot from slip but the boy stop at the rude ladder 's foot decide that this particular mark of interest on the part of a stranger might be misinterpret it would perhaps be prudent to find nichola first of all but where be nicholas -- where be anybody the scatter half-buried hut be more like earth-mounds snow-encrusted some with drift-log prop against the front face look riverward while he be cogitate how to effect a entrance to one of these or to make he presence know he see to he relief the back of a solitary indian go in the direction of a ighloo farther up the river hi hi he shout and as the figure turn he make sign it stop how-do the boy call out when he get nearer you talk english the native laugh a flash of fine tooth and sparkling eye light up a young good-looking face this boy seem promising how d'ye do you know nichola yes the laugh be even gayer it seem to be a capital joke to know

by twenty foot two-third underground log-wall chink with moss a roof of pole slope upward tent-like but leave a opening in the middle for a smoke-hole some three foot square and cover at present by a piece of thin translucent skin with the sole exception of the smoke-hole the whole thing be so cover with earth and cap with snow that expect a mere cave one be surprise at the wood-lining within the boy be still more surprised at the concentration there of malignant smell he gasp and be for get out again as fast as possible when the bearskin flap fall behind he over the kachime end of the entrance-tunnel through the tobacco-smoke and the stifle air he see vaguely a grave gathering of buck sit or rather lounge and squat on the outer edge of the wide sleeping-bench that run all round the room about a foot and a half from the hewn-log floor they solemn intent face be light grotesquely by the uncertain glow of two seal-oil lamp mount on two post plant one in front of the right sleeping-bench the other on the leave the boy hesitate be it possible he could get use to the atmosphere certainly it be warm in here though there be no fire that he could see nichola be talk away very rapidly to the half-dozen grave and reverend signior they punctuate he discourse with occasional grunt and a well-nigh continuous cough nicholas wound up in english I tell you : he heap good

inquire of nichola ol' father a ' heap ol' man go dead gee well whoever do it be on to he job he say i do not see a nail in the whole sheebang no no nail the boy remember nicholas 's sled and look

in bring dog in here dog that be no dog yes he dog he my che make a human noise like that nichola nod the only sound for some time be the doleful lamenting of the mahlemeut without and the ravings of the pymeut chief within the boy be conscious of a queer dream-like feeling all this have be go on up here for age it have be like this when columbus come over the sea all the world have change since then except the steadfast north the boy sit up suddenly and rub he eye with that faculty on the part of the unlearned that one be tempt to call american a faculty for assimilate the grave conclusion of the doctor and import they light-heartedly into personal experience he realize that what meet he eye here in nichola ' house be one of the oldest picture humanity have present this be what be go on by the yukon when king john beside that other river be yield magna charta to the baron while the caesar be build rome the pymeut forefather be build just such ighloo as this while pheidia work he

unroll a old reindeer-skin full of hole and examine it at this the girl who have be about to make up the fire throw down the bit of driftwood and hide she face the sick man babble on faint under the desolate sound another -- sibilant clearer uncannily human nichola have hear too for he throw down the tattered deerskin and go to the other side of the fire voice in the tunnel nichola hold back the flap and gravely wait there till one pymeut after another crawl in they be the man the boy have see at the kachime with one exception -- a vicious-looking old fellow thin wiry with a face like a smoked chimpanzee and eye of unearthly brightness he be give the best place by the fire and hold he brown claw over the red coal while the other be find they place the boy feeling he would need a interpreter sign to muckluck to come and sit by he grave as a judge she get up and do as she be bid that the shamn whisper the boy she nod it be plain that this apparition however hideous have give she great satisfaction any more people come get no more now in pymeut where be everybody some sick some dead the old chief ramble on but not so noisily see whisper muckluck devil ` fraid already he begin to speak small the shamn never once look towards the sufferer till he himself be thoroughly warm even then he withdraw from the genial glow only to sit back hump together blinking silent the boy begin to feel that if he do finally say something it would be as surprising as to hear a aged monkey break into articulate speech nichola edge towards the shamn present something in a birch-bark dish what be that a deer 's tongue whisper muckluck the boy remember the koyukun song thanks for a good meal to kuskokala the shamn nichola seem to be harangue the shamn deferentially but with spirit he pull out from the bottom of he father 's bed three fine marten-skin shake they and dangle they before the shamn they produce no effect he then take a box of match and a plug of the boy 's tobacco out of he pocket and hold the lot towards the shamn seem to say that to save he life he could not rake up another earthly thing to tempt he shamnship although the shamn take the offering he little black eye glitter none the less rapaciously as they fly swiftly round the room fall at last with a vicious snap and gleam upon the boy then it be that for the first time he speak nuh nuh interrupted muckluck chatter volubly and evidently commend the boy to the shamn several of the old buck laugh he say yukon inua no like you he think white man bring plague bring devil get some money whisper muckluck not here the boy see the moment when he would be turn out he plunge he hand down into he trousers pocket and fish up a knife he second-best one fortunately tell he i be all right and he can give this to yukon inua with my respects muckluck explain and hold up the shine object blade open corkscrew curl attractively before the covetous eye of the shamn when he could endure the temptation no longer he two black claw shoot out but nicholas intercept the much-envied object while as it seem he drive a more advantageous bargain term finally settle the shamn seize the knife shut it secrete it with a final grunt and stand up everyone make way for he he jerk he loosely-jointed body over to the sick man lift the seal-oil lamp with he shaky old hand and look at the patient long and steadily when he have set the lamp down again with a grunt he put he black thumb on the wick and squeeze out the light when he come back to the fire which have burn low he pull open he parkus and draw out a ivory wand and a long eagle 's feather with a fluffy white tuft of some sort at the end he deposit these solemnly side by side on the ground about two foot apart turn round to the die fire he take a stick and with nichola 's help gather the ash up and lay they over the smouldering brand the ighloo be practically dark no one dare speak save the yet unabashed devil in the sick man who mutter angrily it be curious to see how the cough of the other which in the kachime have be practically constant be here almost silence whether this be achieve through awe and respect for the shamn or through nervous absorption in the task he have undertake who shall say the boy feel rather than see that the shamn have lie down between the ivory wand and the eagle 's feather each man sit as still as death listen stare wait presently a little jet of flame spring up out of the ash the shamn lift he head angrily see it be no human hand that have dare turn on the light growled and pull something else from under he inexhaustible parkus the boy peer curiously the shamn seem to be shut out the offensive light by wrap himself up in something head and all what be he do now the boy venture to whisper under cover of the devil 's sudden loud remonstrance the sick man at this point break into ghastly groan he put on the kamlayka sh the shamn still envelop head and body begin to beat softly keep time with the eagle 's feather you could follow the faint gleam of the ivory wand but on what it fall with that hollow sound no eye could see now at interval he utter a cry a deep bass danger-note singularly unnerving someone answer in a higher key and they keep this up in a kind of rude sharply-timed duet till one by one the whole group of native be gather into the swing of it sweep along involuntarily it would seem by some magnetic attraction of the rhythm _ ung hi yah ah-ha-yah yah-yah-yah _ be the chorus to that deep recurrent cry of the shamn its accompany drum-note be muffle like far-off thunder conjure out of the earth by the ivory wand presently a scream of terror from the bundle of skin and bone in the corner ha muckluck clasp she hand and rock back and forth they 'll frighten the old man to death if he be conscious say the boy half rise she pull he down no no frighten devil she be shake with excitement and with ecstacy the sick man cry aloud a frenzy seem to seize the shamn he raise he voice in a series of blood-curdling shriek then drop it moan whining then burst suddenly into diabolic laughter bellow whisper ventriloquise with quite extraordinary skill the dim and foetid cave might indeed be full of devil if the hideous outcry slacken but a instant you hear the sick man rave with the preternatural strength of delirium or of mad resentment for some time it seem a serious question as to who would come out ahead just as you begin to feel that the old chief be at the end of he tether and ready to give up the ghost the shamn rise suddenly with a demoniac yell flung himself down on the floor in a convulsion he body writhe horribly he kick and snap and quiver the boy be for shield muckluck from the crazy fling out of leg and arm but she lean over breathless to catch what word might escape the shamn during the fit for these be omen of deep significance when at last the convulsive movement quiet and the shamn lay like one dead except for a occasional faint twitch the boy realize for the first time that the sick man too be dumb dead the only sound now be the wind up in the world above even the dog be still the silence be more horrible than the hell-let-loose of a few minute before the dim group sit there motionless under the spell of the stillness even more than they have be under the spell of the noise at last a queer indescribable scratch and scrape come up out of the bowels of the earth how do the old devil manage to do that think the boy but the plain truth be that he heart be in he mouth for the sound come from the opposite direction behind the boy and not near the shamn at all it grow louder come nearer more inexplicable more awful he feel he could not bear it another minute spring up and stand there tense wait for what might befall be _ all _ the other dead then not a sound in the place only that indescribable stir of something in the solid earth under he foot the shamn have he knife a ghastly sensation of stifle come over the boy as he think of a struggle down there under the earth and the snow on come the horrible underground thing desperately the boy stir the almost extinct ember with he foot and a faint glow fall on the terror-frozen face of the native fall on the bear-skin flap _ it move _ a huge hand come steal round a hand the skeleton of a hand -- white ghastly with finger unimaginably long no mortal in pymeut have a hand like that -- no mortal in all the world a crisp smart sound and a match blaze a tall lean figure rise up from behind the bear-skin and receive the sudden brightness full in he face pale and beautiful but angry as a avenge angel 's for a instant the boy still think it a spectre the delusion of a bewildered brain till the girl cry out brother paul and fall forward on the floor hide she face in she hand light make a light he command nichola get up dazed but obedient and light the seal-oil lamp the voice of the white man the call for light reach the shamn he seem to shiver and shrink under the fold of the kamlayka but instead of get up and look he enemy in the face he wriggle along on he belly still under cover of the kamlayka till he get to the bear-skin push it aside with a motion of the hooded head and crawl out like some snaky symbol of darkness and superstition flee before the light brother paul sob the girl do not _ do not _ tell sister winifr he take no notice of she bend down over the motionless bundle in the corner you have kill he i suppose brother paul -- begin nichola falter oh i hear the pandemonium he lift he thin white face to the smoke-hole it be all useless useless i might as well go and leave you to you abomination but instead go _ you _ all of you -- go he fling out he long arm and the group break and scuttle huddle near the bear-skin fighting like rat to get out faster than the narrow passage permit the boy turn from watch the instantaneous flight the scuffle and the disappearance to find the burning eye of the jesuit fix fascinate on he face if brother paul have appear as a spectre in the ighloo it be plain that he look upon the white face present at the diabolic rite as dream or devil the boy stand up the lay-brother start and cross himself in christ 's name what -- who be you i -- a -- i come from the white camp ten mile below and you be _ here _ -- you allow this ah-h he fling up he arm the pale lip move convulsively but no sound come forth i -- you think i ought to have interfere begin the boy i think -- the brother begin bitterly check himself kneel down and feel the old man 's pulse nichola at the bear-skin be make the boy sign to come the girl be sob with she face on the ground again nichola beckon and then disappear there seem to be nothing to do but to follow he host when the bear-skin have drop behind the boy and he crawl after nichola along the dark passage he hear the muffle voice of the girl pray : oh mary mother of god do not let he tell sister winifred chapter vi a penitential journey certain london parish still receive # 12 per annum for fagot to burn heretic -- john richard green the boy sleep that night in the kachime beside a very moody restless host yagorsha dispense with the formality of go to bed and seem bent on do what he could to keep other people awake he sit monologue under the seal lamp till the boy long to throw the dish of smoulder oil at he head but strangely enough when through sheer fatigue he voice fail and he chin fall on he broad chest a lad of fourteen or so who have also have difficulty to keep awake would jog yagorsha 's arm repeat interrogatively the last phrase use whereon the old story-teller would rouse himself and begin afresh with a iteration of the previous statement if the lad fail to keep he go one or other of the native would stir uneasily lift a head from under he deerskin and remonstrate yagorsha open he eye with a guilty start would go on with the yarn when morning come and the other wake yagorsha and the lad sleep nichola and all the rest who share the bench at night and the fire in the morning seem desperately depressed and glum a heavy cloud hang over pymeut for pymeut be in disgrace about sunset the woman come in with the kantak and the lard-cans yagorsha sit up and rub he eye he listen eagerly while the other question the woman the old chief be not dead at all no he be much better brother paul have be about to all the house-bound sick people and give everybody medicine and flour and a terrible scolding oh yes he be angrier than anybody have ever be before some

call it you savvy say nichola to he guest brother paul go plenty soon you wait i 'll have company back to camp be the boy 's first thought and then -- would there be any fun in that after all it be plain brother paul be no such genial companion as father will and so it be that he do not desert nichola although brother paul 's companion fail to put in a appearance on the follow morning however on the third day after the incident of the shamn -lrb- who seem to have vanish into thin air -rrb- brother paul shake the snow of pymeut from he foot and with three indian from the holy cross school and a dog-team he disappear from the scene not till he have be go some time do nicholas venture to return to the parental roof they find muckluck subdue but smile and the old man astonishingly better it look almost as if he have turn the corner and be get well there be certainly something very like magic in such a recovery but it be quickly apparent that this aspect of the case be not what occupy nichola as he sit regard he parent with a keen and speculative eye he ask he some question and they discuss the point volubly muckluck follow the argument with close attention presently it seem that father and son be take the guest into consideration muckluck also turn to he now and then and by-and-by she say : i think he go go where holy cross say the old man eagerly brother paul nichola explain

present together the lively ol' chief -- so lately die -- make off in a fine new parkus on all fours curious no doubt to watch the preparation without but not a bit of it the ol' chief 's be a more intimate concern in the expedition when the boy join he there he be sit up in nicholas 's sled appallingly emaciated but brisk as you please order the disposition of the axe and rifle along either side the tea-kettle and grub between he foot show how the deer-skin blanket should be wrap and especially be he dictatorial about the lash of the mahout how far 's he comin ' ask the boy astonish all the way say muckluck he want to be _ sure _ several buck come run down from the kachime and stand about cough and spat and offer assistance or advice when at last ol' chief be satisfy with the way the

confidently then lower shamn make all well quick hey goo ' - bye good-bye do not forget tell sister winifr i say my p -- but the boy have to run to keep up with the sled for some time he keep watch the ol' chief with unabated astonishment wonder if he would die on the way but after all the open-air cure be try for he trouble in various other part of the world -- why not here there be no doubt about it nichola have a capital team of dog and know how to drive they two-legged folk often have to trot pretty briskly to keep up pymeut be soon out of sight nichola what 'll you take for a couple o ' you dog no sell pay you a good long price no sell well will you help I to get a couple I try but he speak dubiously what do they cost good leader cost hunder and fifty in st michael you do not mean dollahs mean dollah come off the roof but nichola seem to think there be no need you mean that if i offer you a hundred and fifty dollah for you leader straight off this minute you will not take it no no take say the prince stolidly and he friend reflect nichola without a dog-team would be practically a prisoner for eight month of the year and not only that but a prisoner in danger of starve to death after all perhaps a dog-team in such a country _ be _ priceless and the ol' chief be travel in truly royal style however it be stinging cold and run after those expensive dog be a occupation that pall by-and-by how much be you sled worth he ask ol' chief six sable say the monarch \* \* \* \* \* it be a comfort to sight a settlement off there on the point what be this place fish-town pymeut there no all go come back when salmon run not a creature there as nichola have foretell -- a place build wilfully on the most exposed point possible bleak beyond belief if you open you mouth at this place on the yukon you have to swallow a hurricane the boy choke turn he back to spit out the throttle blast and when he could catch he breath inquire : this a good place for a village bully wind come blow muskeetah -- nichola signify a remote destination with he whip b ` lieve you this kind o ' thing would discourage even a mosquito in the tooth of the blast they go past the pymeut summer resort unlike pymeut proper its cabin be build entirely above ground of log unchink its roof of watertight birch-bark a couple of hour farther on nichola permit a halt on the edge of a struggle little grove of dwarf cotton-wood the kettle and thing be withdraw from various portion of the ol' chief 's person he once more warmly tuck up and tightly lash down draw the edge of the outer coverlid up till it meet the wolf-skin fringe of he parkus hood and relapse into slumber nichola chop down enough green wood to make a hearth what bang on the snow nichola nod lay the log side by side and on they build a fire of the seasoned wood the boy have gather they boil the kettle make tea and cook some fish ol' chief wake up just in time to get he share the boy who have keep hang about the dog with unabated interest have get up from the fire to carry they the scrap when nichola call out quite angrily no no feed dog and wave the boy off what it be only some of my fish fish be what they eat be not it no feed now wait till night what for they be hungry you give fish -- dog no go any more peremptorily he wave the boy off and fall to work at pack up not understand nichola 's wisdom the boy be feel a little sulky and do not help he finish up the fish himself then sit on he heel by the fire scorch he face while he back freeze or wheeling round and singe he new parkus while he hand grow stiff in spite of seal-skin mitten no it be no fun camp with the temperature at thirty degree below zero -- better to be trot after those expensive and dinnerless dog and he be glad when they start again but once beyond the scant shelter of the cottonwood it be evident the wind have rise it be blow straight out of the north and into they face there be time when you could lean you whole weight against the blast after sunset the air begin to fill with particle of frozen snow they do not seem to fall but continually to whirl about and present stinging point to the traveller ' face talk be not possible even if you be in the humor and the dead blank silence of all nature unbroken hour after hour become as nerve-wearing as the cold and stinging wind the boy fall behind a little those place on he heel that have be so badly gall have begin to be troublesome again well it would not do any good to holla about it -- the only thing to do be to harden one 's foolish foot but in he heart he feel that all the time-honoured condition of a penitential journey be be comply with except on the part of the arch sinner ol' chief seem to be get on first-rate the dog hardly yet break in to the winter 's work be grow discourage travel so long in the eye of the wind and nichola in the kind of stolid depression that have take possession of he seem to have forget even to shout mush for a very long time by-and-by ol' chief call out sharply and nicholas seem to wake up he stop look back and beckon to he companion the boy come slowly on why you no push push what handle-bar he go to the sled and illustrate lay he hand on the arrangement at the back that stand out like the handle behind a baby 's perambulator the boy remember of course there be usually two man with each sled one run ahead and break trail with snow-shoe but that be not necessary today for the crust bear but the other man 's business be to guide the sled from behind and keep it on the trail I gottah drive you gottah push dog heap tired nichola speak severely the boy stare a moment at what he mentally call the nerve of the fellum laugh and take hold swallow nichola 's intimation that he after all be far more considerate of the dog than the person merely sentimental who have be willing to share he dinner with they how much farther oh pretty quick now the driver crack he whip call out to the dog and suddenly turn off from the river course unerringly he follow a invisible trail turn sharply up a slough and go zig-zagging on without apparent plan it be better go when they get to a frozen lake and the dog seem not to need so much encouragement it would appear a impossible task to steer accurately with so little light but once on the other side of the lake it be find that nichola have hit a well-beaten track as neatly as a thread find the needle 's eye far off out of the dimness come a sound -- welcome because it be something to break the silence but hardly cheerful in itself hear that nichola mission dog they own have already throw up they nose and better the pace the bark of the dog have not only announce the mission to the traveller but to the mission a stranger at the gate before anything could be see of the settlement clumsy fur-clad figure have come run down the slope and across the ice greet nichola with hilarity indian or esquimaux boy they seem to be who talk some jargon understand of the pymeut pilot the boy lifting tired eye see something white glimmer high in the air up on the right river bank in this light it refuse to form part of any conceivable plan but hang there in the air detach enigmatic spectral below it more on humanity 's level could be dimly distinguish now the mission building apparently in two group with a open space in the middle where be the white people wonder the boy childishly impatient will not they come and welcome we he follow the esquimaux and indian from the river up to the left group of building with the heathen jargon beat on he ear he look up suddenly and realize what the white thing be that have shine out so far in the middle of the open space a wooden cross stand up encrust with frost crystal and lift gleaming arm out of the gloom twenty foot or so above the head of the people funny thing for a agnostic he admit to himself but i be right glad to see a christian sign and as he knock at the door of the big two-story log-house on the leave he defend himself it be the swing-back of the pendulum after a big dose of pymeut and heathen trick i welcome it as a mark of the white man he look over he shoulder a little defiantly at the holy cross recognition of what the high white apparition be have give he a queer jolt stir unsuspected thing in imagination and in memory he have be accustom to see that symbol all he life and it have never speak to he before up here it cry aloud and dominate the scene humph he say to himself to look at you a body would think ` the origin ' have never be write and spencer and huxley have never be bear ' he knock again and again turn about to scan the cross just as much a superstition just as much a fetich as kaviak 's seal-plug or the shamn 's eagle feather with long look at a couple of cross stick man grow as dazed as hypnotize as pymeut watch a shamn 's ivory wand all the same i be not sure that faith in ` first principle ' would build a house like this in the arctic region and it be convenient to find it here -- if only they would open the door he give another thunder knock and then nearly fall backwards into the snow for brother paul stand on the threshold hold up a lamp i -- a -- oh how do you do can i come in brother paul still with the look of the avenge angel on he pale young face hold the door open to let the boy come in then lean out into the night and lift the lamp high be that nichola he say sternly but the pymeut and the school-boy have vanish he come in and set down the lamp we -- a -- we hear you be go down river say the boy tamely for he have not yet recover himself after such a unexpected blow be you cold be you wet demand brother paul standing erect unwelcoming by the table that hold the lamp the boy pull himself together look here -- he turn away from the comforting stove and confront the jesuit -- those pymeut be not only cold and wet and sick too but they be sorry they have come to ask forgiveness it be easily do such scorn you would hardly expect from a follower of the meek galilean no not easily do a penance like this i know for i have just travel that thirty mile with 'em over the ice from pymeut you yes it amuse you the sombre eye shine with a cold disconcerting light well to tell you the truth i have be better amuse the boy look down at he weary wounded foot and the other -- where be he fellow pilgrim it strike he as comic that the upshot of the journey should be that he be do penance for the pymeut but he could not smile with that offended archangel in front of he thirty mile over the ice in the face of a norther have not be so ` easy ' even for I and i be not old nor sick -- no nor frightened brother paul he fling up he head but he heart fail he even while he make the boast silently for a moment they confront each other where be you bind for i -- a -- the boy have a moment of wonder if he be expect to answer hell and he hesitate be you on you way up the river no -- i -lrb- be the man not go to let they rest they wicked bone there a single night -rrb- -- a -- i -- the frozen river and the wind-racked wood be as hospitable as the beautiful face of the brother involuntarily the boy shiver i come to see the father superior he drop back into a chair the father superior be busy i 'll wait and very tired so be i -- wear out with the long rage of the plague i have wait till he be less harass to tell he about the pymeut ' deliberate depravity nichola too -- one of we own people one of the first pupil of the school a communicant in the church distinguish by a thousand kindness and this the return the return be that he take he backsliding so to heart he can not rest without come to confess and to beg the father superior -- i shall tell the father superior what i hear and see he will agree that for the sake of other who be try to resist temptation a example should be make of nichola and of he father and yet you nurse the old man and be kind to he i believe after the offense i -- i think you have kill he but even you must see that we can not have a man receive here as nichola be -- the most favored child of the mission -- who help to perpetuate the degrading blasphemy of he unhappy race it be nothing to you you even encourage -- ` pon my soul -- but brother paul strike in with a impassioned earnestness : we spend a life-time make christian of these people and such as you come here and in a week undo the work of year i -- _ i _ it be only eighteen month since i myself come but already i have see -- the torrent pour out with never a pause last summer some white prospector bribe we best

vain be protest for brother paul the visitor be not a particular individual he stand there for the type of the vicious white adventurer the sunken eye of the lay-brother burning impersonal saw not a particular young man and a case compound of mixed element but -- the enemy against whom night and day he wage incessant warfare the father and sister wear out they life to save these people we teach they with incredible pain the fundamental rule of civilization we teach they how to save they soul alive the boy have jump up and lay he hand on the door-knob _ you _ come you teach they to smoke -- the boy wheel round i do not smoke and to gamble nichola teach _ I _ to gamble brother paul i swear -- yes and to swear and get drunk and so find the shortest way to hell father brachet father will a voice call without the door-knob turn under the boy 's hand and before he could more than draw back a whiff of winter blow into the room and a creature stand there such as no man look to find on he way to a arctic gold camp a girl of twenty odd with the face of a saint dress in the black habit of the order of st anne oh brother paul you be want -- want quickly i think catherine be worse do not wait or she 'll die without -- and as suddenly as she come the vision vanish carry brother paul in the wake of she streaming veil the boy sit down by the stove cogitate how he should best set about find nichola to explain the failure of they mission what be that voice from the other side the opposite door open and a man appear with nichola and he father close behind look anything but cast down or decently penitential how do you do the white man 's english have a strong french accent he shake hand with great cordiality we have hear of you from father will also these pymeut friend of ours say you have something to tell I he speak as though this something be expect to be highly gratifying and indeed the cheerfulness of nichola and he father would indicate as much as the boy hesitate do not accept the chair offer smile the jesuit go on : will you talk of zis matter -- whatever it be -- first or will you first go up and wash and have we conference after supper no thank you -- a -- be you the father superior he bow a little ceremoniously but still smile i be father brachet oh well nichola be right the first thing to do be to explain why we be here be it the heat of the stove after the long hour of cold that make he feel a little dizzy he put up he hand to he head i have tell zem to take hot water upstairs the father be say and i zink a glass of toddy would be a good sing for you he slightly emphasise the you and turn as if to supplement the original order no no the boy call after he choke a little half with suppress merriment half with nervous fatigue father brachet if you be kind to we brother paul will never forgive you we be all in disgrace hein what yes we be all desperately wicked no no object nichola ready to go back on so tactless a advocate and brother paul have just be say -- what be it what be it the father superior speak a little sharply and himself sit down in the wooden armchair he before have place for he white guest the three culprit stand in front of he on a dead level of iniquity you see father brachet ol' chief have be very ill -- i know much as we need he here paul insist on hurry back to pymeut -- he interrupt himself as readily as he have

on steamboat up from st michael one white man he get coast sickness sun shine salmon run big yukon full o ' boat two day : no canoe on river man all sit in tent like so he let he mitten fall on the floor crouch on he heel and rock he head in he hand spring up he go on with slow sorrowful emphasis : man begin die -- zen we come say the father wiz nurse and proper medicine -- nichola give the ghost of a shrug add the damaging fact : sickness come to holy cross the father nod we have have to turn ze school into ward for we patient he explain to the stranger we do little now but nurse ze sick and prepare ze die ze muzzer superieure have break down after heroic labor paul i fear be sicken too yes it be true : ze disease come to we from pymeut in the father 's mind be the thought of contagion courageously face in order to succor the least of these my brethren in nicholas 's mind be the perplexing fact that these white man could bring sickness but not stay it even the heap good people at holy cross be not save by they deaf and impotent god father sick eight sister sick boy die in school three girl die holy cross people kind -- again he make that almost french motion of the shoulder shamn say ` peeluck ' no good be kind to devil scare 'em -- make 'em run nichola the priest speak wearily i be ashamed of you i seek you have learn better zat old shamn -- he be a rare old rogue what do you give he nichola ' mental process may not have be flattering but they clearness be unmistakable if father brachet be jealous of the rival holy man 's revenue it be time to bring out the present ol' chief have a fine lynx-skin over he arm he advance at a word from nichola and lay it down before the father no say father brachet with startling suddenness take it away and try to understand nichola approach tremble but no doubt remember how necessary it have be to add to the shamn 's offering before he would consent to listen with favor to pymeut prayer he pull out of they respective hiding -- place about he person a carve ivory spoon and a embroidered bird-skin pouch advance boldly under the fire of the superior 's keen eye and sharp word and lay the further offering on the lynx-skin at he foot take zem away say the priest interrupt he brief homily and stand up do not you understand yet zat we be you friend wizzout money and wizzout price we do not want zese sing

pardon mon pre cet homme quus vient de minok -- faudrait le coucher de suite -- mais o mon dieu o while the superior cogitate how-do brother etienne say nichola and they nod brother etienne bring the rest of he heavy body half inside the door he wear aged weather-beaten breeches and a black sweater over a old hickory shirt se compagnon l'ont laiss l je crois mais a ne durera pas longtemps faudra bien qu'il reste ici -- je ne vois pas d'autre moyen say the father enfin -- on verra attendez quelque instant c'est bien brother etienne go out ol' chief be pull the boy 's sleeve during the little colloquy and say you tell but the boy get up like one who mean to make a end you have not any time or strength for this -- oh yes say father brachet smile and arrest the impetuous movement ziz be -- part of it well say the boy still hesitate they _ be _ sorry you know _ really _ sorry you sink so the question ring a little sceptically yes i do and i be in a position to know you would forgive they if you would see as i do how miserable and overwhelmed they be when brother paul -- when -- i be not say it be the highest kind of religion that they be so almighty afraid of lose you good opinion but it -- it give you a hold do not it and then as the superior say nothing only keep intent eye on the young face the boy wind up a little angrily : unless of course you be like brother paul ready to throw away the power you have gain -- paul serve a great and noble purpose -- but -- zese question be -- a -- not in he province still he bore into the young face with those kind gimlet he good little eye and -- you be -- one of we he ask of ze church no i -- i be afraid i be not of any church ah and i ought to take back ` afraid ' but i be tell you the truth when i say there never be honester penitent than the pymeut the whole kachime 's miserable even the girl ol' chief 's daughter she cry like anything when she think sister -- winifr sister winifr would be disappoint in she ah yes sister winifred have zem -- he hold out he hand spread the finger apart and slowly gently close they comme a but what be the good of it if brother paul -- ah it be not just zere paul come in but i tell you my son paul do a work here no ozzer man have do so well he be a flint -- a fanatic fanatique he fling out a expressive hand it be a name my son it often mean no more but zat a man be in earnest out of such a ` flint ' we strike spark and many a generous fire be set alight we all do what we can here at holy cross but paul will do what we can not well give _ I _ -- he be on the point of say father will but change it to a man who be tolerant tolerant zere be plenty to be tolerant my son ze world be full but when you find a man zat can _ care _ zat can be ` fanatique ' -- ah it be -- he come a little nearer -- it be but as if i would look at you and say ` he have earnest eye he will go far _ whatever _ road he follow ' he draw off smile shrewdly you may live my son to be yourself call ` fanatique ' zen you will know how little -- i the boy break in you be pretty wide of the mark this time ah perhaps but zere be more trail zan ze yukon for a fanatique you have zere somesing to show I i promise the girl that cry so -- i promise she to bring the sister this he have pull out the picture in spite of the careful wrap it have get rather crumple the father look at it and then a swift glance pass between he and the boy you could see it be like pull out tooth to part with it can it go up there till the sister send for it father brachet nod and the gorgeous worldling counselling all man to smoke kentucky leaf be set up in the high place of honor on the mantel-shelf beside a print of the madonna and the holy child nichola cheer up at this and ol' chief stop wipe he eye while the boy stand at the mantel with he back to father brachet act on a sudden impulse he pull the ivory pen-rest out of he shirt and stick its various part together say as he do so she send a offering to you too if the ol' chief a ' i fail to convince you of we penitence we be all willin ' to let this gentleman plead for we whereupon he wheel round and hold up the woeful one before the father 's eye the priest grasp the offering with a almost convulsive joy and instantly turn he back that the pymeut might not see the laugh that twist up he humorous old feature the penitent look at each other and telegraph in pymeut that after all the boy have come up to time the father have refuse the valuable lynx-skin and nichola ' superior spoon but be ready it appear to look with favor on anything the boy offer but very seriously the priest turn round upon the pymeut i will just say a word to you before we wash and go in to supper with a kindly gravity he pronounce a few simple sentence about the gentleness of christ with the ignorant but how offend the heavenly father be when those who know the true god descend to idolatrous practice and how entirely he could be depend upon to punish wicked people ol' chief nod vigorously and with sudden excitement I jus ' like god hein oh yes I no stan ' wicked people when I young I kill two ol' squaw -- _ witch _ with a outward gesture of he lean claw he sweep these wicked one off the face of the earth like a besom of the lord a sudden change have pass over the tired face of the priest go go he call out drive the pymeut forth as one shoo chicken out of a garden go to ze schoolhouse and get feed for it be all you seem able to get zere but the perplexed flight of the pymeut be arrest brother paul and brother etienne block the way with a stretcher they all stand back to let the little procession come in nobody notice they further but the pymeut scuttle away the instant they could get by the boy equally forget sit down in a corner while the three priest confer in low-voiced french over the prostrate figure father brachet a weak voice come up from the floor brother paul hurry out call brother etienne softly from the door i be here the superior come from the foot of the pallet and kneel down near the head you -- remember what you say last July about -- about make restitution yes well i can do it now i be glad i have bring you the papers that be why -- i -- _ have _ to come will you -- take they -- out of my -- the priest unbuckle a travel-stained buckskin miner 's belt and lay it on the floor all the many pocket be empty save the long one in the middle he unbutton the flap and take out some soil worn-looking papers be zese in proper form he ask but the man seem to have drop into unconsciousness hurriedly the priest add : zere be no time to read zem ah mr -- will you come and witness zi last will and testament the boy get up and stand near the man from minok open he eye here the priest have get write material and put a pen into the slack hand with a block of letter-paper under it i -- i be no lawyer say the faint voice but i think it be all -- in shape anyhow -- you write -- and i 'll sign he half close he eye and the paper slip from under he hand the boy catch it and set down the faint word : -- will and bequeath to john m berg kansa city my right and title to claim no 11 above little minok yukon rampart -- and the voice fall away into silence they wait a moment and the superior whisper : can you sign it the dull eye open do not i -- father brachet hold he up the boy give he the pen and steady the paper thank you father oblige to you too he turn he dimming eye upon the boy who write he name in witness you -- go to minok i hope so the father go to the writing-table where he tie up and seal the packet anybody that be go to minok will have to hustle the slang of everyday energy sound strangely from die lip -- almost a whisper and yet like a far-off bugle call a captive to battle the boy lean down to catch the word yet fainter : good claim go like hot cake how much the boy ask breathless do you get out of yours wait till summer nex ' summer -- the eyelid fall so it be not a fake after all the boy stand up the camp 's all right you 'll see it will out-boom the klondyke ha how long have you be make the trip since August the wild flame of enterprise sink in the heart of the hearer since _ August _ no cash for steamer we have a canoe she go to piece up by -- the weak voice fall down into that deep gulf that yawn wait for man 's last word but there be gold at minok you be sure you have see it the father superior lock away the packet and stand up but the boy be bend down fascinate listen at the white lip there be gold there he repeat out of the gulf come faintly back like a echo : plenty o ' gold there -- plenty o ' gold jee-rusalem he stand up and find himself opposite the contemplative face of the priest we have neglect you my son come upstairs to my room they go out the old head bent and full of think the young head high and full of dream oh to reach this minok where there be plenty of gold plenty of gold before the spring flood bring thousand what do any risk matter think of the pymeut do they sixty mile over the ice just to apologise to father brachet for be pymeut this other this white man 's penance might would involve a greater mortification of the flesh what then the reward be proportionate -- plenty of gold the faint whisper fill the air a little more hardship and the long process of fortune-building be shorten to a few month no more office grind no more anxiety for those one love gold plenty of gold while one be young and can spend it gaily -- gold to buy back the orange grove to buy freedom and power to buy wing and to buy happiness on the stair they pass brother paul and the native supper in five minute father the superior nod there be a great deal to do the native go on hurriedly to paul we have get to bury catherine to-morrow -- and this man from minok agree paul pause with he hand on the door chapter vii kaviak 's crime my little son who look would from thoughtful eye and move and speak in quiet grown-up wise have my law the seventh time disobey would i strike he and dismiss would with hard word and unkiss would even with the plague and brother paul rage at the mission -- even with everyone preoccupy by the claim of dead and die the boy would have be glad to prolong he stay have it not be for nagging thought of the colonel as it be with the mercury rapidly rise and the wind fall he get the pymeut on the trail next day at noon spend what be leave of the night at the kachime and set off for camp early the follow day he arrive something of a wreck and with a enormous respect for the yukon trail it do he good to sight the big chimney and still more to see the big colonel put on he snow-shoe near the bottom of the hill where the cabin trail meet the river trail when the boss o ' the camp look up and see the prodigal come along rather groggy on he leg he just stand still a moment then he kick off he web-feet turn back a few pace uphill and sit down on a spruce stump fold he arm and wait be it the knapsack on he back that bow he so hello kentucky but the colonel do not look up till the boy get quite near chanting in he tuneless voice : ` grasshoppah sett 'n on a swee ' p ` tater vine swee ' p ` tater vine swee ' p ` tater vine -- ' what be the matter hey colonel sorry as all that to see I back reckon it be the kind o ' sorrah i can bear say the colonel we think you be dead you ought t ' know I better be you just sendin ' out a rescue-party of one the colonel nod that party would have start before but i cut my foot with the axe the day you leave where have you be in the name o ' the nation pymeut a ' holy cross holy cross holy mose _ you _ yes and do you know one thing i see there give I a serious nervous shock that do not surprise I what be it sheet when i come to go to bed -- a real bed colonel on leg -- i find i be expect to sleep between sheet and i just about faint that the only shock you have no i have several i see a angel i tell you straight colonel -- you can bank on what i be sayin ' -- that jesuit outfit 's all right oh you think so the rejoinder come a little sharply yes sir i just do i think i would be bigoted not to admit it so you 'll be thick as pea in a pod with the priest now well i be the one that can afford to be they will not convert _ I _ and from my point o ' view it do not matter what a man be s ' long 's he be a decent fellum the colonel 's only answer be to plunge obliquely uphill say boss wait for I the colonel look back the boy be hold on to a scrub willow that put up wiry twig above the snow feel as if i would never get up the last rung o ' this darn ice-ladder tired h be something of a walk to holy cross even on a nice mild day like this the colonel make the reflection with obvious satisfaction take off he knapsack and sit down again the boy do the same the very day you light out father orloff come up from the russian mission what be he like oh little fellum in petticoat with a beard a ' a high pot-hat like a russian and that same afternoon we have a half-breed trader fellum here with two white man since that day we have not see a human creature we buy some fur of the trader where would you get yours pymeut any news about the strike well the trader fellum be sure it be all gammon and tell we story of man who have sacrifice everything and join a stampede and get sell -- sell badly but the two crazy whites with he -- miner from dakotah -- they be on fire about minok keep on brag they have not cold foot and swear they would get near to the diggin as they dog would take 'em the half-breed say they might do a hundred mile more but probably would not get beyond anvik crazy fool i tell you to travel even thirty mile on the yukon in winter even with a bully team and old nick to drive 'em and not a extra ounce on you back -- i tell you colonel it be no joke b ` lieve you sonny it be not thirty seconds before sonny be add : do that half-breed think it be any use we try to get dog be not to be have now for love or money lord colonel if we have a team -- yes i know we 'll probably owe we life to the fact that we have not it suddenly occur to the boy that although he have just do a pretty good tramp and feel he would rather die than go fifty foot further it be the colonel who be most tired how 's everybody oh i s ` pose we might all of we be worse off what be the matter he be so long answering that the boy 's eye turn to follow the serious outward gaze of the older man even before he lift one hand and sweep it down the hill and out across the dim gray prospect this say the colonel they eye have drop down that last stretch of the steep snow slope across the two mile of frozen river and run half round the wide horizon-line like creature in a cage whether they like it or whether they do not for they there be no way out it be the awful stillness the colonel arraign the distant ice-plain they sit there look listen as if they hope they protest might bring some signal of relent no creature not even a crystal-coated willow-twig nothing on all the ice-bound earth stir by as much as a hair no mark of man past or present break the gray monotony no sound but they two voice disturb the stillness of the world it be a quiet that penetrate that prick to vague alarm already both know the sting of it well it be the kind of thing that get on a fellum 's nerve say the colonel i do not know as i ever feel helpless in any part of the world before but a man count for precious little up here do you notice how you come to listen to the silence oh yes i have notice stop again he lift he hand and they strain they ear i have do that by the hour since you leave and the daft gold-digger go up trail after you the other fella feel it too do not know what we would have do without kaviak think we ought to keep that kid you know i could get on without kaviak if only we have some light it be this villainous twilight that get into my head all the same you know -- he stand up suddenly -- we come expect to stand a lot do not we the elder man nod big game big stake it be all right eventless enough after this except for the passing of a indian or two the day crawl by the boy would get up first in the morning rake out the dead ash put on a couple of back-log bank they with ash and then build the fire in front he break the ice in the water-bucket and wash fill coffee-pot and mush-kettle with water -lrb- or ice -rrb- and swing they over the fire then he mix the corn-bread put it in the dutch oven cover it with coal and leave it to get on with its bake sometimes this part of the program be vary by he mix a hoe-cake on a board and set it up to do in front of the fire then he would call the colonel -- ` wake up massa de day be breakin ' pea in de pot en de hoe-cake bakin '' -- for it be the colonel 's affair to take up proceedings at this point -- make the coffee and the mush and keep it from burn fry the bacon and serve up breakfast Saturday bring a slight variation in the early morning routine the other come straggle in as usual but once a week mac be sure to be first for he have to get kaviak up mac 's view of he whole duty to man seem to center in the Saturday scrubbing of kaviak vainly have the esquimer stand out against compliance with this most repulsive of foreign custom he seem to be always ready with some deep-laid scheme for turn the edge of mac 's iron resolution he try hide at the bottom of the bed it do not work the next time he crouch far back under the lower bunk he be drag out another Saturday he embed himself like a moth in a bundle of old clothes mac shake he out he have be very sanguine the day he hide in the library this be a wooden box nail to the wall on the right of the door most of the bigger book -- byron wordsworth dana 's mineralogy and two bible -- he have take out and conceal in the lower bunk very skilfully far back behind the colonel 's foot copp 's mining and the two work on parliamentary law pile at the end of the box serve as a pillow after climb in and folding himself up into a incredibly small space kaviak manage with superhuman skill to cover himself neatly with a patchwork quilt of _ munsey scribner century strand _ and _ overland _ for August '97 no one would suspect glance into that library that underneath the usual top layer of light reading be matter less August than law poetry science and revelation it be the base byron tip the wink to mac out of the back of the bunk that betray kaviak it become evident that farva begin to take a dour pride in the kid 's perseverance one morning he even point out to the camp the strong likeness between kaviak and robert bruce no sah the scottish chief have to have a object-lesson but kaviak -- lawd -- kaviak could give point to any spider livin ' this be on the morning that the esquimer think to escape scrub even at the peril of he life by get up on to the swing-shelf -- how no man ever know but there he sit in terror like a very young monkey in a wind-rocked tree hardly daring to breathe he arm clasp tight round the demijohn but have mac to deal with the end of it be that he always get wash and equally always he seem to register a vow that s ` help he heaven it should never happen again after breakfast come the clearing up it should have be do -lrb- under this rgime -rrb- by the little cabin man but it seldom be o'flynn be expect to keep the well-hole in the river chop open and to bring up water every day this do not always happen either though to drink snow-water be to invite scurvy father will say there be also a daily need if the colonel could be believe for everybody to chop firewood we get enough be pott ' invariable opinion for how long s ` pose we get scurvy and can not work we would freeze to death in a fortnight never see a fireplace swallum log whole a ' never blink like this one but you get no objection to sittin ' by while the log-swallerin ' go on the colonel or the boy cook the eternal bean bacon and mush dinner after whatever desultory work be do as a matter of fact there be extraordinarily little to occupy five able-bodied man the fun of snow-shoeing mitigate by frostbite quickly degenerate from a sport into a mere means of locomotion one or two of the party go hunting now and then for the scarce squirrel and the shy ptarmigan they try with signal lack of success to catch fish indian fashion through a hole in the ice but for the most part as winter darken round they they lounge from morning till night about the big fireplace and smoke and growl and play card and live as man do find out a deal about each other 's character something about each other 's opinion and little or nothing about each other 's history in the appalling stillness of the long arctic night any passer-by be hail with enthusiasm and although the food-supply in the big cabin be plainly go to run short before spring no traveller -- white indian or esquimaux -- be allow to go by without be warm and feed and make to tell where he come from and whither he be bind -- question to tax the sage they unfailing hospitality be not in the least unexpected or unusual be a virtue practice even by scoundrel in the great north-west but it strain the resource of the little camp a fourth of whose outfit lay under the yukon ice in the state of lowered vitality to which the poor ill-cooked food the cold and lack of exercise be slowly reduce they they talk to one another less and less as time go on and more and more -- silently and each against he will -- grow hyper-sensitive to the shortcoming and even to the innocent way of the other fellow not mac 's inertia alone but he trick of stick out he jaw become a offence he rasping voice a torture the boy 's occasional ebullition of spirit be a outrage the colonel 's mere size intolerable o'flynn 's brogue which have amuse they grow to be just part of the hardship and barbarism that have overtake they like a evil dream coerce subdue all the force of life only kaviak seem likely to come unscathed through the ordeal of the winter 's captivity only he could take the best place at the fire the best morsel at dinner and not stir angry passion only he dare rouse mac when the nova scotian fall into one of he bear-with-a-sore-head mood kaviak put a stop to he stare angrily by the hour into the fire and set he to whittle out boat and a top thereby provide occupation for the morrow since it be one man 's work to break kaviak of spin the one on the table during mealtime and sail the other in the drinking-water bucket at all time when older eye be not watch the colonel write up he journal and read the midsummer magazine and byron in the face of mac 's i do not like byron 's thought i do not consider he healthy or instructive in one of he more energetic mood the colonel make a four-footed cricket for kaviak who prefer it to the high stool and always sit on it except at meal once in a while when for hour no word have be speak except some broken reference to a royal flush or a jack-pot or o'flynn have say bedad i 'll go it alone or pott have inquire anxiously get the joker guess i be euchred then the boy in desperation would catch up kaviak balance the child on he head or execute some other gymnastic soothing the solemn little heathen 's ruffle feeling afterwards by croon out a monotonous plantation song it be that kind of addition to the general gloom that at first would fire o'flynn to raise he own spirit at least by roar out a irish ditty but this be seldomer as time go on even jimmie 's brogue suffer and grow less robust in a depressed sort of way mac be openly teach kaviak he letter and surreptitiously down in the little cabin he prayer he be very angry when pott and o'flynn eavesdrop and roar at kaviak 's struggle with ow farva in fact kaviak do not shine as a student of civilisation though that tell less against he with o'flynn than the fact that he be not jolly and jump about like white child moreover jimmie swear there be something bogey about the boy 's intermittent knowledge of english often for day he would utter nothing but farva or maw when he want he plate replenish then suddenly he would say something that nobody could remember have teach he or even say in he presence it be not to be deny that kaviak love sugar mightily and steal it when he could mac lecture he and slap he minute yellow hand and kaviak steal it all the same when he be bad -- that be when he have eat he daily fill of the camp 's scanty store -lrb- in such a little place it be not easy to hide from such a hunter as kaviak -rrb- -- he be take down to the little cabin smack and make to say ow farva nobody could discover that he mind much though he learn to try to shorten the ceremony by say i solly all the way to the cabin as a rule he be strangely undemonstrative but in he own grave little fashion he conduct life with no small intelligence and learn with a almost uncanny quickness each man 's use from the kaviak point of view the only person he be not swear friend with be the handy-man and there come to be a legend current in the camp that kaviak 's first attempt at spontaneously string a sentence under that roof be I get no use for pott the best thing about kaviak be that he be no craven soul he be oblige to steal the sugar because he live with white people who be bigger than he and who always take it away when they catch he but once the sugar be safe under he shirt he own up without the smallest hesitation and take he smack like a man for the rest he flourish fill out and get as fat as a seal but never a whit less solemn one morning the colonel announce that now the day have grow so short and the trio be so late come to breakfast and nobody do any work to speak of it would be a good plan to have only two meal a day the motion be excessively unpopular but it be carry by a plain and somewhat alarming exposition of the state of supplies we ought not to need as much food when we lazy round the fire all day say the colonel but pott retort that they would need a lot more if they go on adoptin ' the aborigine they knock off supper and all but the aborigine know what it mean sometimes to go hungry to bed towards the end of dinner one day late in December when everybody else have finish except for coffee and pipe the aborigine hold up he empty plate have not you have enough ask the colonel mildly surprise at kaviak 's bottomless capacity maw still the plate be extend there be not a drop of syrup leave say pott who have drain the can and even wipe it out carefully with half of hot biscuit he do not really want it must not open a fresh can till to-morrow no sir_ee _ we have only get -- besides he 'll bust kaviak meanwhile during this paltry discussion have stand up on the high stool farva have make for he and personally inspect the big mush-pot then he turn to mac and point a finger like a straw -lrb- nothing could fatten those infinitesimal hand -rrb- he say gravely and fluently : maw in de plenty-bowl yes maw mush but no maw syrup the round eye travel to the store corner we 'll have to open a fresh can some time -- what be the odds mac get up and not only kaviak watch he -- for syrup be a luxury not expect every day -- every neck have crane every pair of eye have follow anxiously to that row of rapidly diminish tin all that be leave of the thing they all like best and they still this side of christmas what you rubber-neckin ' about mac snap at the boy as he come back with the fresh supply this unprovoked attack be ample evidence that mac be uneasy under the eye of the camp angry at he own weakness and therefore the readier to dare anybody to find fault with he how can i help watchin ' you say the boy mac lift he eye fiercely i be fascinate by you winnin ' way we be all like that kaviak have meanwhile make a prosperous voyage to the plenty-bowl and return to mac 's side -- a absurd little figure in a strange priest-like cassock button from top to bottom -lrb- a waistcoat of mac 's -rrb- and a jacket of the boy 's which be usually fall off -lrb- and trail on the ground when it be not -rrb- and whose sleeve be roll up in inconvenient muff still with a gravity that do not seem impaired by these detail he stand clutch he plate anxiously with both hand while down upon the corn-mush descend a slender golden thread manipulate with a fine skill to make the most of its sweetness it curl and spiral and describe the kind of involve and long-looped flourish which the grave and reverend of a hundred year ago write jauntily underneath the most sober name lovingly the dark eye watch the engrossing process even when the attenuate thread be break and the golden rain descend in slow infrequent drop kaviak stand wait always for just one drop more that be enough greedy now go away and gobble but kaviak daintily skim off the syrupy top and leave he mush almost as high a hill as before it be not long after the dinner thing have be wash up and the colonel settle down to the magazine -- he be read the advertisement now -- that pott draw out he watch golly do you feller know what o'clock it be he hold the open timepiece up to mac hardly middle o ' the afternoon all these hour before bedtime and nothin ' to eat till to-morrow why you have just finish -- but look at the _ time _ the colonel say nothing maybe he have be a little previous with dinner today it be such a relief to get it out of the way oppressive as the silence be the sound of pott 's voice be worse and as he keep on about how many hour it would be till breakfast the colonel say to the boy : ` johnny get you gun ' and we 'll go out in these December day before the watery sun have set the great rich-coloured moon arise have now in she resplendent fulness quite the air of snuff out the sun the pale and heavy-eyed day be put to shame by this brilliant night-lamp that could cast such heavy shadow and by which man might read the instant the big cabin door be open kaviak dart out between the colonel 's leg throw up he head like a siwash dog sniff at the frosty air and the big orange moon fling up he heel and tear down to the forbid the fascinating fish-hole if he have not get snare in he trail coat he would have win that race when the two hunter have capture kaviak and shut he indoors they act on he implied suggestion that the fish-trap ought to be examine they chop away the fresh-formed ice empty as usual it have be very nice and neighbourly of nichola as long ago as the 1st of December to bring the big new cornucopia-shaped trap down on he sled on the way to the ikogimeut festival it have take a long time to cut through the thick ice to drive in the pole and fasten the slight fencing in such relation to the mouth of the sunken trap that all well-conducted fish ought easily to find they way thither as a matter of fact they do not pott say it be because the boy be always haul out the trap to see but what good would it be to have it full of fish and not know they have be out about a hour when the colonel bring down a ptarmigan and say he be ready to go home the boy hesitate go to give in and cook that bird for supper it be a tempting proposition but the colonel say rather sharply : no sir get to keep he for a christmas turkey well i 'll just see if i can make it a brace the colonel go home hang he trophy outside to freeze and find the trio have decamp to the little cabin he glance up anxiously to see if the demijohn be on the shelf yes and kaviak sound asleep in the bottom bunk the colonel would climb up and have forty wink in the top one before the boy get in for they game of chess he do not know how long he have sleep when a faint scratch prick through the veil of slumber and he say to himself kaviak 's on a raid again but he be too sodden with sleep to investigate just before he drop off again however open a heavy eye he see pott go by the bunk stop at the door and listen then he pass the bunk again and the faint noise recommence the colonel drop back into the gulf of sleep never even wake for he chess and in the morning the incident have pass out of he mind just before dinner the next day the boy call out : see here who be spill the syrup spill it syrup no it do not seem to be spill either he pat the ground with he hand you do not mean that new can -- not a drop in it he turn it upside down every eye go to kaviak he be sit on he cricket by the fire wait for dinner he return the accuse look of the company with self-possession come here he get up and trot

something have take hold of he and make he behave as he have not dream of behave it be perhaps a fear of play the fool as much as a determination to see how much ground he have lose with the youngster the child be observe he with a almost feverish intensity with eye fix upon the wooden face to find out how far he might venture shakily he drag the cricket from where mac place it closer closer and as no terrible change in the unmoved face warn he to desist he pull it into its usual evening position between mac 's right foot and the fireplace he sink down with a sigh of relief as one who finish a journey long and perilous the fire crackle and the spark fly gaily kaviak sit there in the red glow dress only in a shirt stare with incredulous mournful eye at the farva who have -- then as mac make

feast of reason as by a flow of soul and a bang-up dinner to be follow by speech and some sort of cheerful entertainment we be goin ' to lay ourselves out on this entertainment say the boy with painful misgiving as to the bang-up dinner every time the banquet be mention somebody be sure to say well anyhow there be pott 's cake and that reflection never fail to raise the tone of expectation for pott 's cake be a beauty evidently very rich and fruity and fit by nature to play the noble part of plum-pudding but in make out the bill of fare fact have to be face we have get we everyday little ration of bean and bacon and we have get pott 's cake and we have get one skinny ptarmigan to make a banquet for six hungry people but we 'll have a high old time and if the bill o ' fare be a little restricted there be nothin ' to prevent we program of toast song and miscellaneous contribution from bein ' rich and varied and one thing we can get even up here -- the colonel be look at kaviak -- and that be a little christmas-tree y-yes say pott you can get a little tree but you can not get the smallest kind of a little thing to hang on it sh say the boy it must be a surprise and he

you _ have not any luck the boy suggest you must have see other -- oh i see some wash gravel that keep body and soul together and i see some that do not in the pause he add remorseless : i help to bury some of they you experience be unusual or why do man come back year after year do you ever hear of a thing call hope they move uneasily on they stool and some rub stubbly chin with perplexed uncertain finger and they all glower at the speaker he be uncomfortable this fellow well there may not be as much gold up here as man think but there be more hope than anywhere on earth to hell with hope give I certainty say salmon p exactly so you shuffle the card and laugh down the five-cent limit you 'll play one last big game and it 'll be for life this time as well as fortune cheerful cuss

trade give I a modest little claim in the klondyke oh klondyke klondyke benham get up and step over kaviak on he way to the fire he light a short briarwood with a flaming stick and turn about shall i tell you fellow a little secret about the klondyke he hold up the burning brand in the dim room with tell emphasis the smoke and flame blow black and orange across he face as he say : _ every dollar that be take out of the klondyke in gold-dust will cost three dollar in coin _ a sense of distinct dislike to benham have spread through the company -- a fellow who call american enterprise love of gamble for whom heroism be foolhardy and hope insane where be a pioneer so bold he could get up now and toast the klondyke who now without grim misgiving could forecast a rosy future for each man at the board and that in brief have be the program oh help the puddin ' colonel say the boy like one who start up from a evil dream but they sit chill and moody eating plum-pudding as if it have be so much bean and bacon mac feel robert bruce 's expensive education slip out of reach pott see he girl tire of wait take up with another fellow the boy 's orange grove be farther off than florida schiff and hardy wonder for a moment who be the gainer for all they killing hardship not they at present although there be the prospect -- the hope -- oh damn the trader the colonel make the punch o'flynn drain he cup without wait for the mockery of that first toast -- _ to we enterprise _ -- although no one have take more interest in the program than o'flynn benham talk about the anvik saw-mill and the money make in wood camp along the river nobody listen though everyone else sit silent smoking and sulkily drink he punch kaviak 's demand for some of the beverage remind the boy of the christmas-tree it have be intend as a climax to wind up the entertainment but to produce it now might save the situation he get up and pull on he parkus back 'n a minute but he be go a long time benham look down the toast-list and smile inwardly for it be klondyke from top to bottom the other too steal uneasy glance at that program stare they in the face unabashed covertly ironic -- nay openly jeer they actually have not notice the fact before but every bless speech be aim straight at the wonderful gold camp across the line -- not the klondyke of benham 's croak but the klondyke of they dream even the death 's head at the feast regret the long postponement of so spirit a program intersperse as it promise to be with song dance and trick and wind up with a original poem he will not be happy till he get it benham 's indian have get up and go out kaviak have try to go too but the door be slam in he face he stand there with he nose to the crack exactly as a dog do suddenly he run back to mac and tug at he arm even the dull white man could hear a ominous snarl among the mahlemeut out of the distance a faint answering howl of derision from some enemy advance or at bay it be often like this when two team put up at the big chimney camp reckon we dog be gettin ' into trouble say salmon p anxiously to he deaf and cripple partner it be nothing say the trader a siwash dog of any spirit be always trail he coat and salmon p subside not so kaviak back to the door head up he listen they have observe the oddity before the melancholy note of the mahlemeut never yet have fail to stir he sombre little soul he be stand now look up at the latch high and make for white man eager breathing fast listen to that dismal sound that be like nothing else in nature -- listen as might a exile scot to the skirl of bagpipe listen as a tyrolese who hear yodel on foreign hill or as the dweller in a distant land to the sound of the dear home speech the noise outside grow louder the air be rent with howl of rage and defiance sound as if there be ` bout a million mad dog on you front stoop say schiff know there must be a great deal go on if any of it reach he ear you set still he pardner push he down on he stool mr benham and i 'll see what be up the trader leisurely open the door salmon p keep modestly behind while kaviak dart forward only to be catch back by mac a avalanche of sound sweep in -- a mighty howling and snarling and crack of whip and underneath the higher clamor human voice -- and in dash the boy powdered with snow laughing and balancing carefully in he mittened hand a little yukon spruce every needle diamond-pointed every sturdy branch white with frost crystal and soft woolly snow and bear its little harvest of curious fruit -- sweet-cake ring and star and two gingerbread man hang by pack-thread from the white and green branch the noah 's ark lodge in one crotch the very amateur snow-shoe in another and the lose toy wrap up transfigure in tobacco-foil dangling merrily before kaviak 's incredulous eye there be you christmas-tree and the bringer who have carry the tree so that no little puff of snow or delicate crystal should fall off have make a successful entrance and dazzle the child give way to the strong excitement that shoot light out of he eye and bring scarlet into he cheek here take it he dash the tree down in front of kaviak and a sudden storm agitate its sturdy branch it snow about the floor and the strange fruit whirl and spin in the blast kaviak clutch it far too daze to do more than stare the boy stamp the snow off he muckluck on the threshold and dash he cap against the lintel call out : come in come in let the dog fight it out behind he between the snow-wall at the entrance have appear two face -- weather-beaten man crowd in the narrow space crane to see the reception of the christmas-tree and the inside of the famous big chimney cabin these gentleman say the boy shake with excitement as he usher they in be mr john dillon and general lighter they have just do the six hundred and twenty-five mile from minok with dog over the ice they have be forty day on the trail and they be as fit as fiddle a ' no yonder for little minok have make big millionaire o ' both o ' they millionaire or not they 'll never either of they create a greater sensation than they do that christmas day in the big chimney cabin on the bleak hillside up above the never-know-what here be certainty at last here be justification precious symbol of success they be take by both hand they be shake and wildly welcome peel set down by the fire give punch ask ten thousand question all in a breath rejoice over and look up to as glorious dispeller of doubt bless savior from despair schiff have totter forward on bandaged foot hand round ear mouth open as if to swallow whole whatever he could not hear the colonel keep on bow magnificently at interval and press refreshment o'flynn slapping he thigh and reiterate be the siven pott not only widen he mouth from ear to ear but as o'flynn say after stretch it clane round he head and tye it up furr jy in a nate knot behind benham take a back seat and when anybody remember he for the next hour it be openly to gloat over he discomfiture john dillon be one of those frontiersman rightly call typically american you see he again and again -- as a cowboy in texa as a miner or herdsman all through the far west you see he cut lumber along the columbium or throw the diamond hitch as he go from camp to camp for gold and freedom he take risk cheerfully and he never work for wages when he can go on he own john dillon be like the majority tall lean muscular not a ounce of superfluous flesh on he bone a face almost gaunt in its clearness of cut a thin straight nose chin not heavy but well curve out the eye orbit arched and deep a frown fix between thick eyebrow and few word in he firm rather grim-looking mouth he be perhaps thirty-six have be in ten year and have mine before that in idaho under he striped parkus he be dress in spotted deer-skin wear white deer-skin muckluck arctic cap and moose mitten pin on he inner shirt be the badge of the yukon order of pioneer -- a footrule bent like the letter a above a scroll of leaf and in the angle two link o 's over y p it be the other man -- the western town be full of general lighter -- who do the talk a attorney from seattle he have come up in the July rush with very little but boundless assurance fall in with a old miner who have be grubstake by captain rainey out of the _ oklahoma 's _ supplies and get to minok before the river go to sleep no we be not pardner exactly he say glance good-humouredly at dillon we have work separate but we be go home two by two like animal into the ark we have get this in common we have both ` strike ile ' -- have not we dillon dillon nod little minok 's as rich a camp as dawson and the gold 's of higher grade -- be not it dillon that be right one of the many great advantage of minok be that it be the _ nearest _ place on the river where they have strike pay dirt say the general and another great advantage be that it be on the american side of the line what advantage be that mac grate out just the advantage of not have all you hard earnings take away by a iniquitous tax look out this fellum 's a britisher -- do not care if he be and no disrespect to you sir the canadian in the klondyke be the first to say the tax be nothing short of highway robbery you 'll see the minute they hear of gold across the line there 'll be a stampede out of dawson i can put you in the way of get a claim for eight thousand dollar that you can take eighty thousand out of next August with no inspector come round to check you clean-up and no government grab at you royalty why be not you take out that eighty thousand yourself ask mac bluntly get more 'n one man can handle answer the general reckon we have earn a holiday dillon back he up then it be not shortage in provision that take you outside say the boy not much plenty of food at rampart city that be the name o ' the town where the little minok meet the yukon food at gold-craze price i suppose no just about the same they quote you in seattle how be that possible when it be be carry four thousand mile because the a c and n a t and t boat get freeze in this side of dawson they know by the time they get there in June a lot of stuff will have come in by the short route through the lake and the town will be overstock so there be flour and bacon to burn when you get up as far as minok it be only along the lower river there be any real scarcity the big chimney man exchange significant look and there be more supply-boats wintering up at fort yukon and at circle city the general go on i tell you on the upper river there be food to burn again the big chimney man look at one another the general keep help himself to punch and as he toss it off he would say minok 's the camp for I when he have give vent to this conviction three time benham who have not speak since they entrance say quietly : and you be go away from it as hard as you can pelt the general turn moist eye upon he be you a man of family sir no then i can not expect you to understand he eye brim at some think too fine and move for public utterance each member of the camp sit deeply cogitate not only gold at minok but food in the inner vision of every eye be a ship-load of provision freeze in hard by a placer claim in every heart a fervid prayer for a dog-team the boy jump up and run he finger through he long wild hair he pant softly like a hound strain at a leash then with a obvious effort to throw off the magic of minok he turn suddenly about and poor old kaviak say he look round and speaking in quite a everyday sort of voice the child be lean against the door clasp the forget christmas-tree so tight against the musk-rat coat that the branch hide he face from time to time with reverent finger he touch silver boat and red-foil top and watch fascinate how they swing a white child in a tenth of the time would have eat the cake tear off the transfiguring tinfoil tired of the tree and forget it the boy feel some compunction at the sight of kaviak 's steadfast fidelity look here we 'll set the tree up where you can see it better he put a empty bucket on the table and with mac 's help wedge the spruce in it firmly between some block of wood and book of the law the cabin be very crowd little mr schiff be sit on the cricket kaviak retire to he old seat on elepha beyond the bunk where he still have a good view of the wonderful tree agreeably light by what be leave of the two candle those thing be good to eat you know say the colonel kindly mac cut down a gingerbread man and give it into the tiny hand what wind blow that thing into you cabin ask the general squint up he snow-blinded eye at the dim corner where kaviak sit there be not a man in the camp who do not resent the millionaire 's tone this be a great friend of ours -- be not you kaviak say the boy he be get a soul above gold-mine have not you he see other fella help themselves to he cricket and he high chair -- too polite to object --

out but mac motion they back i do not think say john dillon slyly -- do not think _ this _ punch will hurt the gentleman and a roar go up at the colonel 's expense general lighter pull himself to he foot say there be a little good old rye leave outside and he could stock up again when he get to the _ oklahoma _ oh and it be yersilf that do not shoy off from a dthrop o ' the craythur whin yer

untie the thong hold he sack aslant between the two light and pour out a stream-nugget and coarse bright gold the crowd about the table draw audible breath nobody actually speak at first except o'flynn who say reverently : be -- the siven howly piper -- that dance at I -- gran ' - mother 's weddin ' -- when the divvle -- call the chune even the swimming wick flare up and seem to reach out each a hungry tongue of flame to touch and taste the glittering heap before they go into the dark low exclamation hand thrust out to feel and draw back in a sort of superstitious awe here it be this wonderful stuff they would come for each one know by the wild excitement in he own breast how in secret he have be bring to doubt its be here but here it be lie in a heap on the big cabin table and -- now it be go the right candle have give out and o'flynn blow with impatience like a walrus have simultaneously extinguish the other for a instant a group of man with strained and dazzled eye still bent above the blackness on the board stir the fire call the colonel and fly to do it himself i 'll light a piece of fat pine shout the boy catch up a stick and thrust it into the coal where 's you bitch say dillon calmly bitch have not you get a condensed milk can with some bacon grease in it and a rag wick make a good enough light but the fire have be poke up and the cabin be full of dance

here say o'flynn it be hearin ' about that winder bring _ I _ add pott everyone long to touch and feel about in the glitter pile but no one as yet have dare to lay a finger on the smallest grain in the hoard a electrical shock flash through the company when the general pick up one of the biggest nugget and throw it down with a rich full-bodied thud that one be four ounce he take up another this be worth about sixty dollar more like forty say dillon they be of every conceivable shape and shapelessness most of they flatten some of they the greenhorn would swear be fashion by man into roughly embossed heart or shell or polished disc like rude defaced coin one be a perfect staple another the letter l another like a axe-head and one like a peasant 's sabot some be almost black with iron stain and some be set with jewel of quartz but for the most part they be formless fragment of a rich and brassy yellow lot of the little fella be like melon-seed and the boy point a shake finger longing and still not daring to touch the treasure each man have a dim feeling in the back of he head that after all the hillock of gold be a illusion and he own hand upon the dazzling pile would clutch the empty air where 's you dust ask the boy dillon stare why here this be all nugget and grain well what more do you want oh it would do well enough for I but it be not dust it be what we call dust as coarse as this the sour-dough nodded and lighter laugh there be a fox 's mask say the colonel at the bottom of the table point a triangular bit out let I look at it a minute beg the boy hand it round whisper schiff it be real it be gold they finger tingle under the first contact this be the begin the rude bit of metal breed a glorious confidence under the magic of its touch robert bruce

victorious sense of have just buy back the orange grove and salmon p pass the nugget to he partner with a blissful sigh well i be glad we do not get cold foot say he yes whisper schiff it look like we goin ' to the right place the sheen of the heap of yellow treasure be try even to the nerve of the colonel put it away he say quite solemnly lay the nugget on the paper -- put it all away before the firelight die down dillon leisurely gather it up and drop the nugget with a absent-minded air into the pouch which lighter hold but the san francisco _ examiner _ have be wear to the softness of a old rag and the thinness of tissue under dillon 's sinewy finger pinch up the gold the paper give way oh exclaim more than one voice as at some grave mishap dillon improvise a scoop out of a dirty envelope nobody speak and everybody watch and when finally with he hand he brush the remain grain off the tear paper into the envelope pour they into the gaping sack-mouth and lazily pull at the buckskin draw-string everybody sit wonder how much if any of the precious metal have escape through the tear and how soon dillon would come out of he brown study remember and recover the loss but a spell seem to have fall on the company no one speak till dillon with that lazy motion hoist one square shoulder and half turn he body round be in the act of return the sack to he hip-pocket wait say mac with the explosiveness of a firearm and o'flynn jump you be not get it all whisper schiff hurriedly oh i be leavin ' the fox-face for luck dillon nod at the colonel but schiff point reverently at the tear in the paper as dillon only go on push he sack deep down in he pocket while mac lift the _ examiner _ all but the two millionaire bent forward and scrutinise the table o'flynn impulsively run one lone hand over the place where the gold-heap have lie he other hand hold ready at the table 's edge to catch any sweepings none but the result of o'flynn 's action be that those particle of gold that that fall through the paper be drive into the crack and inequality of the board there see now look what you have do mac point out a rough knot-hole too that slyly hold back a pinch of gold oh that dillon slap he hip and settle into he place but the man nearest the crack and the knot-hole fall to digging out the renegade grain and piously offer they to they lawful owner that be not worth botherin ' about laugh dillon you always reckon to lose a little each time even if you get a china soup-plate plenty more where that come from say the general easily such indifference be feel to be magnificent indeed the little incident say more for the richness of minok than all the general 's blow they forget that what be lose would amount to less than fifty cent the fact that it be gold -- minok gold -- give it a symbolic value not to be compute in coin how do you go ask the colonel as the two millionaire begin put on they thing we cut across to kuskoquim take on a indian guide there to nushagak and from there with dog across the ocean ice to kadiak oh the way the letter go out when they _ do _ smile dillon yes it be the old russian post trail i believe south of kadiak island the sea

you get to seattle and blow in a couple o ' hundred thousand the sooner you 'll get back to minok dillon go out and rouse up the dog asleep in the snow with they bushy tail shelter they sharp nose see you later yes ` outside ' outside no sir _ inside _ dillon swear a blood-curdling string of curse and crack he whip over the leader why you comin ' back bet you life and nobody who look at the face of the yukon pioneer could doubt he mean what he say they go indoors the cabin wear a unwonted and a rakish air the stool seem to have try to dance the lancer and have fall out about the figure two be overturn the unwashed dish be toss helter-skelter a tipsy christmas tree lean in drunken fashion against the wall and under its bough lay a forget child asleep on the other side of the cabin a empty whisky bottle catch a ray of light from the fire and glint feebly back among the ash on the hearth be a screw of paper char at one end and throw there after light someone 's pipe the boy open it the famous program of the yukon symposium it be be a different sort of christmas from what we plan observe the colonel not quite as gaily as you might expect begob say o'flynn stretch out he interminable leg ye can not say we have not hearrd glad tiding of gr-reat j' y -- colonel interrupt the boy throw the program in the fire let 's look at you nugget again and they all take turn except pott he be busy digging the remain gold-grain out of the crack and the knothole chapter ix a christian agnostic -- giver mig rum himlen bar stjerner natten er stum it be a good many day before they get the dazzle of that gold out of they eye they find they tongue again and talk minok from morning till night among themselves and with the rare passer up or down the trail mac begin to think they might get dog at anvik or at one of the ingalik village a little further on the balance of opinion in the camp be against this view but he have pott on he side when the new year open the trail be in capital condition on the second of January two lot of indian pass one with dog haul flour and bacon for benham and the other lot without dog drag light hand-sled pott say restlessly : after all _ they _ can do it so can we if we have a mind to say mac come on then the camp try hard to dissuade they naturally neither listen they pack the boy 's sled and set off on the morning of the third to kaviak 's unbounded surprise and disgust he view of life be that wherever mac go he be bind to follow and he do follow -- make off as hard as he swift little foot could carry he straight up the yukon trail and farva lose a good half of that first morning bring he home just eight day later the two man walk into the cabin and sit down -- pott with a heart-rending groan mac with he jaw almost dislocate in he cast-iron attempt to set he face against defeat they lip be crack with the cold they face raw from frostbite they eye inflamed the weather -- they call it the weather -- have be too much for they it be obvious they have not bring back any dog but -- what do you think of anvik say the boy anvik you do not suppose we get to anvik in weather like this how far _ do _ you get mac do not answer pott only groan he have freeze he cheek and he right hand they be doctor and put to bed do you see my friend at holy cross the boy ask pott when he bring he a bowl of hot bean-soup you do not suppose we get as far as holy cross with the wind -- well where _ do _ you get to where you be second native village above why that be not more 'n sixteen mile sixteen mile too far pott breathe long and deep between hot and comforting swallow where 's the boy 's sled say the colonel come in hurriedly we cache it answer pott feebly could not even bring he sled home _ where have _ you cache it it be all right -- only a few mile back pott relinquish the empty soup-bowl and close he eye \* \* \* \* \* when he open they again late in the evening it be to say : find some o ' those sucker who be goin ' so slick to minok some o ' _ they _ down at the second village and the rest be winterin ' in anvik so the indian say not a single son of a gun will see the diggin till the ice go out then badly off as we be here say the colonel to the boy it be lucky for we we do not join the procession when mac and the boy bring the sled home a couple of day later it be find that a portion of its cargo consist of a toy kyak and two bottle of hootchino the maddening drink concoct by the native out of fermented dough and sugar apart from the question of drinking raise again by the hootch it be perhaps possible that have so little else to do they be ready to eat the more it be also true that busy or idle the human body require more nourishment in the north than it do in the south certainly the man of the little yukon camp begin to find they ration horribly short common and to suffer a continual hunger never wholly appease it be condition like these that bring out the brute latent in all man the day come to mean three scant meal each meal come to mean a silent struggle in each man 's soul not to let he stomach get the better of he head and heart at first they joke and laugh about they hunger and the scarcity by-and-by it become too serious the jest be wry-faced and ring false they have in the begin each help himself from common dish set in the middle of the rough plank table later each find how without mean to -- hate himself for it -- he watch food on its way to other ' plate with a evil eye when it come to he turn he have a ever-recurrent struggle with himself not to take the lion 's share there be ironical comment now and then and ill-concealed bitterness no one of the five would have believe he could feel so towards a human be about a morsel of food but those who think they would be above it have not winter in the arctic region or fight in the boer war the difficulty be frankly face at last and it be ordain in council that the colonel should be dispenser of the food can not say i like the office quoth he but here go and he cut the bacon with a anxious hand and spoon out the bean solemnly as if he weigh each go and the trio presently retire to the little cabin to discuss whether the colonel do not show favouritism to the boy and when mac be asleep how they could get rid of kaviak so presently another council be call and the colonel resign he office stipulate that each man in turn should hold it for a week and learn how ungrateful it be moreover that whoever be for the nonce occupy the painful post should be loyally uphold by all the other which arrangement be in force to the end and still on grounds political religious social trivial the disaffection grow two of the trio side against the odd man pott and turn he out of the little cabin one night during a furious snowstorm that have already last two day have more than half bury the hut and nearly snow up the little doorway the colonel and the boy have be shovel nearly all the day before to keep free the entrance to the big cabin and the precious bottle window as well as they half of the path between the two dwelling o'flynn and pott have play poker and quarrel as usual the morning after the ejection of pott and he unwilling reception at the big cabin mac and o'flynn fail to appear for breakfast guess they be huffy say pott stretch out he foot very comfortable in they straw-lined muckluck before the big blaze bring on the coffee kaviak no say the colonel we will not begin without the other fellow by the living jingo _ i _ will then say pott and help himself under the colonel 's angry eye the other two confer a moment then draw on they parki and mitten and with great difficulty in spite of yesterday 's work get the door open it be pretty dark but there be no doubt about it the little cabin have disappear look be not that a curl of smoke say the boy yes by george they be snow under serve 'em right a heavy sigh from the colonel yes but _ we 'll _ have to dig 'em out look here colonel -- the boy speak with touching solemnity -- _ not before breakfast _ right you be laugh the colonel and they go in it be that day after the other have be release and feed that the boy fall out with pott concern who have lose the hatchet -- and they come to blow a black eye and a bloody nose might not seem a illuminating contribution to the question but no more be say about the hatchet after the colonel have drag the boy off the prostrate form of he adversary but the colonel himself lose he temper two day later when o'flynn broach the seal set month before on the nearly empty demijohn for those famous temperance punch the colonel have draw on he own small stock he see he blunder when o'flynn possess himself of the demijohn roar out : it be my whisky i tell you i buy it and pay furr it and but for I it would be at the bottom o ' the yukon now yes and you would be at the bottom of the yukon yourself if you have not be drag out by the scruff o ' you neck and you would be in a pretty fix now if we leave you alone with you whisky which be about all you have get we agree pott chip in that it should be keep for medicinal purpose only sullenly o'flynn sip at he grog pott have hog most of the hootch \* \* \* \* \* look here boy say mac at supper i say i would not eat off this plate again oh dry up one tin plate 's like another tin plate be you reflect on the washer-up mr maccann ask pott i be say what i have say before -- that i have scratch my name on my plate and i will not eat off this rusty battered kettle-lid he hold it up as if to shy it at the boy the young fellow turn with a flash in he eye and stand taut then in the pause he say quite low : let she fly maccann but maccann think better of it he throw the plate down on the table with a clatter the colonel jump up and bent over the mush-pot at the fire beside the boy whisper to he oh all right when the boy turn back to the table with the smoking kettle the cloud have go from he face maccann have get up to hang a blanket over the door while he back be turn the boy bring a tin plate still in good condition set it down at mac 's place plant a nail on end in the middle and with three blow from a hammer fasten the plate firmly to the board maybe you can not hand it up for more as often as you like but you 'll always find it there he say when mccann come back and the laugh go against the dainty pioneer who to the end of the chapter eat from a plate nail fast to the table i begin to understand say the colonel to the boy under cover of the other ' talk why it be say to be such a devil of a test of a fellow 's decency to winter in this infernal country they say it be always a man 's pardner he come to hate most return the boy laugh good-humouredly at the colonel naturally look at the row in the little cabin that have not be the only row the boy go on more thoughtfully i say colonel -- he lower he voice -- do you know there 'll have to be a new system of ration i have be afraid -- now i be _ sure _ -- the grub will not last till the ice go out i know it say the colonel very gravely be there a miscalculation i hope it be that -- or else speak still lower the store have be tamper with and not by kaviak either there 'll be a hell of a row he look up and see pott watch they suspiciously it have come to this : if two man talk low the other prick they ear but lack of grub resume the colonel in he usual voice as though he have not notice be only one of we difficulty lack of work be just about as bad it breed a thousand devil we be a pack o ' fool here we be all of we hard hit some of we pretty well clean out o ' ready cash and here 's dollar and dollar all round we and we sit over the fire like a lot of god-forsaken native dollar where growin ' on the tree boy a forest full oh timber enthusiasm cool look at what they say about those fellow up at anvik what they make last year they have get a saw-mill _ now _ they have but they cut and sell cord-wood to the steamer two year before they get a mill and next summer will be the biggest season yet we ought to have set to as soon as the cabin be build and cut wood for the summer traffic but since there be five of we we can make a good thing of it yet the colonel finally carry the day they go at it next morning and as the projector of the work have privately predict a better spirit prevail in the camp for some time but here be five man only one of whom have have any of the steadying grace of stiff discipline in he life man of haphazard education who have chuck more or less easy berth in a land of many creature comfort for this -- to fell and haul birch and fir tree in a arctic climate on half-ration it begin to be apparent that the same spirit be invade the forest that have possession of the camp two or at most three do the work and the rest shirk get snow-blindness and rheumatism and let the other do he share count securely nevertheless on he fifth of the proceeds just as he count -lrb- no matter what proportion he have contribute -rrb- on he full share of the common stock of food i come out here a communist -- say the boy one day to the colonel and a agnostic smile the older man oh i be a agnostic all right now and for ever but this winter have cure my faith in communism early February bring not only lengthen daylight but a radical change in the weather the woodsman work in they shirt-sleeve perspire freely and say in the innocence of they heart if winter come early up here spring do the same the whole hillside be one slush and the snow melting on the ill-made little cabin roof bring a shower-bath into the upper bunk few thing in nature so surely stir the pulse of man as the untimely come of a few spring day that have lose they way in the calendar and wander into winter no trouble now to get the big chimney man away from the fireside they hold up they bloodless face in the faint sunshine and they eye with the pupil enlarged by the long reign of night blink feebly like a owl 's force to face the morning there be none of those sign in the animal world outside of premature stir and cheerful awake that in other land help the illusion that winter lie behind but there be that even more stimulating sweet air abroad that subtle mixture of sun and yield frost that soften wind that come blow across the snow still keen to the cheek but subtly revive to the sensitive nostril and caress to the eye the big chimney man draw deep breath and say in they heart the battle be over and win kaviak for ever follow at mac 's heel like a rale irish tarrier find he allegiance waver in these stir blissful day if ever farva so belie character and custom as to swing a axe for any length of time plainly out of patience kaviak would throw off the musk-rat coat and run about in wet muckluck and a single garment -- uphill downhill on important errand which he confide to no man it be part of the sorcery of such day that man 's thought like bird ' turn to other place impatient of the haven that give they shelter in rough weather overpast the big chimney man lean on they axis and look north south east west then the colonel would give a little start turn about lift he double-bitter and swing it frontier fashion first over one shoulder then over the other striking cleanly home each time work with a kind of splendid rhythm more harmonious more beautiful to look at than most of the work of man this be perhaps the view of he comrade for they do a good deal of look at the colonel he say he be a modest man and do not like it and mac turn a little rusty under the gibe answer : have not you get the sense to see we have cut all the good timber just round here and again he turn he eye to the horizon line mac 's right say the boy and even the colonel stand still a moment and they all look away to that land at the end of the world where the best material be for the building of castle -- it be the same country so plainly point out by the rainbow 's end and never so much as in the springtime do it lure man with its ancient promise come along colonel let 's go and look for real timber -- and let 's find it nearer water-level -- where the steamer can see it right away what about the kid I come say kaviak with a highly oblige air no you stay at home no go too go too thou babbler kaviak 's a better trail man than some i could mention we 'll have to carry he home object pott now do not tell we you 'll do any of the carryin ' or we 'll lose confidence in you pott the trail be something awful but on they canadian snowshoe they get as far as a island six mile off one end of it be better wooded than any easily accessible place they have see why this be quite like real spruce say the boy and o'flynn admit that even in californium these here would be call ` tree ' wid no intintion o ' bein ' sarcaustic so they cut hole in the ice and sound for the channel yes sir the steamer can make a landin ' here and here 's where we 'll have we wood-rack they go home in better spirit than they have be in since that welter of gold have lie on the big cabin table \* \* \* \* \* but a few day suffice to wear the novelty off the new wood camp for most of the party pott and o'flynn set out in the opposite direction one morning with a hand-sled and provision to last several day they be sick of bacon and bean and be goin ' huntin ' no one could deny that a moose or even a grouse -- anything in the shape of fresh meat -- be sufficiently need but pott and o'flynn be really sick and sore from they recent slight attack of wood-felling they be after bigger game too as well as grouse and a few day off it have turn just enough colder to glaze the trail and put it in fine condition they go down the river to the _ oklahoma _ be generously entertain by captain rainey and learn that with earlier contract on he hand he do not want more wood from they than they have already cord they return to the camp without game but with plenty of whisky and information that free they from the yoke of labor and from the lash of ironic comment in vain the colonel urge that the _ oklahoma _ be not the only steamer ply the yukon that with the big rush of the come season the traffic would be enormous and a wood-pile as good as a gold mine the cause be lose you will not get we to make galley-slave of ourselves on the off-chance of sell rainey say that wood camp have spring up like mushroom all along the river the price of wood will go down to -- all along the river there be not one between we and andreievsky nor between here and holy cross but it be no use the traveller pledge each other in _ oklahoma _ whisky and make a common cause once more the original trio put in a night of it the boy and the colonel turn into they bunk at eleven o'clock they be rouse in the small hour by kaviak 's frightened cry and the noise of angry voice you let the kid alone well it be mesilf that 'll take the liberty o ' mintionin ' that i be not goin ' to stand furr another minyit a esquimer 's cuttin ' down _ my _ ration sure it be a fool i have be you can not help that mac chop out say mac say pott in a drunken voice i be talkin ' to you like a friend you want to get a move on that kid kaviak 's goin ' will not make any more difference than a fly 's the other two grumble incoherently but i tell you what _ would _ make a difference : if you two would quit eatin ' on the sly -- out o ' meal-time be the siven you lie a movement a stool overturn and the two man in the bunk be strike broad awake by the smart concussion of a gun-shot nobody be hurt and between they they disarm pott and turn the irishman out to cool off in he own cabin it be all over in a minute kaviak reassure curl down to sleep again mac and pott stretch themselves on the buffalo-robe half under the table and speedily fall to snore the boy put on some log he and the colonel sit and watch the spark it be a bad business it can not go on say the colonel but mac 's right : kaviak 's be here be not to blame they -- we too -- be like a lot of powder-can the boy nod any day a spark and _ biff _ some of we be in a blaze and wh-tt bang and some of we be in kingdom come i begin to be afraid to open my lip say the colonel we all be do not you notice yes i wonder why we come _ you _ have no excuse say the elder man almost angrily same excuse as you the colonel shake he head exactly maintain the boy tire of town and desk-work and -- and -- the boy shift about on he wooden stool and hold up he hand to the revive blaze life owe we steady fellow one year of freedom anyhow -- one year to make duck and drake of besides we have all come to make we fortune do not every mother 's son of we mean to find a gold-mine in the spring when we get to the klondyke -- eh and he laugh again and presently he yawn and tumble back into he bunk but he put he head out in a moment be not you go to bed yes the colonel stand up do you know father will go by last night when those fellow begin to row about get out the whisky no he say there be another stampede on where to koyukuk this time why do not he come in awful hurry to get to somebody that send for he funny fella these jesuit they _ believe _ all those odd thing they teach so do other man say the colonel curtly well i have live in a christian country all my life but i do not know that i ever see christianity _ practice _ till i go up the yukon to holy cross i must say you be complimentary to the few other christian scatter about the world do not get mifft colonel i have know plenty of people straight as a die and capital good fellow i have see they do very decent thing now and then but with these jesuit missionary -- lord there be no let up to it no answer from the protestant colonel presently the boy in a sleepy voice add elegantly : no siree the jesuit go the whole hog \* \* \* \* \* winter be down on the camp again the whole world be hard as iron the man keep close to the big chimney all day long and sit there far into the small hour of the morning say little heavy-eyed and sullen the dreaded insomnia of the arctic have lay hold on all but the colonel even he usually unbroken repose be again disturbed one night about a week later some vague sort of sound or movement in the room -- kaviak on a raid -- or -- be not that the closing of a door kaviak he put he hand down and feel the straight hair of the esquimaux in the under bunk pott who be there he half sit up boy do you hear that boy he lean far down over the side and see distinctly by the fire-light there be nobody but kaviak in the under bunk the colonel be on he leg in a flash put he head through he parkus and draw on he muckluck he do not wait to cross and tie the thong a presentiment of evil be strong upon he outside in the faint star-light he think a dim shape be pass down towards the river who be that hi there stop or i 'll shoot he have not bring he gun but the ruse work do not shoot come back the voice of the boy the colonel stumble down the bank in the snow and soon stand by the shape the boy be dress for a journey he arctic cap be draw down over he ear and neck the wolf-skin fringe of he parkus hood stand out fiercely round the defiant young face wound about one of he seal-skin mitten be the rope of the new hand-sled he would be fashion so busily of night by the camp fire he two blanket be strap on the sled indian fashion along with a gunny sack and he rifle the two man stand look angrily at each other a moment and then the colonel politely inquire : what in hell be you do goin ' to minok the devil you be yes the devil i be they stand measure each other in the dim light till the colonel 's eye fall on the loaded sled the boy 's follow i have only take short ration for two week i leave a statement in the cabin it be about a fifth of what be my share so there be no need of a row what be you goin ' for why to be first in the field and stake a gold-mine of course the colonel lay a rough hand on the boy 's shoulder he shake it off impatiently and before the older man could speak : look here let 's talk sense somebody 's get to go or there 'll be trouble pott say kaviak but what difference would kaviak make i have be afraid you would get ahead of I i have watch you for a week like a hawk watch a chicken but it be clear i be the one to go he pull up the rope of the sled and he little cargo lurch towards he the colonel step in front of he boy -- he begin but something be the matter with he voice he get no further i be the youngest boast the other and i be the strongest and -- i be the hungriest the colonel find a perturb and husky voice in which to say : i do not know you be such a christian nothin ' o ' the sort what be this but -- why it be just -- just my little scheme you be no fool you know as well as i do you have get the devil 's own job in hand somebody 's get to go he repeat doggedly look here say the colonel you have not impressed I as be

lowzy by sittinge in sr thoma erskin 's chamber _ memoir : anne countess of dorset _ 1603 it be the 26th of February that first day that they hit the long trail temperature only about twenty degree the colonel thought and so little wind it have the effect of be warmer trail in fair condition weather gray and steady never man in better spirit to have leave the wrangling and the smoulder danger of the camp behind that alone as the boy say be worth the price of admission exhilarating too to man of they temperament to have cut the gordian knot of the difficulty by risk themselves on this unprecedented quest for peace and food gold too oh yes -- with a smile to see how far that main object have drift into the background -- they add and for gold they believe they have hearken well to the counsel that bid they travel light remember every add ounce be against you nobody in the north own anything that be heavy have be say in one fashion or another so often that it lose its ironic sound in the ear of man who have come so far to carry away one of the heaviest thing under the sun the colonel and the boy take no tent no stove not even a miner 's pick and pan these last general lighter have say could be obtain at minok and there be not a cabin on the trail dillon have add without 'em for the rest the carefully-selected pack on the sled contain the marmot-skin woollen blanket a change of flannel apiece a couple of sweater a norfolk jacket and several change of foot-gear this last item be dwell on earnestly by all keep you foot dry john dillon have say and leave the rest to god almighty they be take barely two week ' ration and a certain amount of stuff to trade with the up-river indian when they supplies should be go they carry a kettle a axe some quinine a box of the carbolic ointment all miner use for foot-soreness o'flynn 's whisky and two rifle and ammunition in spite of have eliminate many thing that most traveller would count essential they find they load come to a little over two hundred pound but every day would lessen it they tell each other with a laugh and with a inward misgiving lest the lighten should come all too quickly they have see in camp that winter so much of the frailty of human temper that although full of faith by now in each other 's native sense and fairness they leave nothing to a haphazard division of labor they parcel out the work of the day with absolute impartiality to each man so many hour of go ahead to break trail if the snow be soft while the other drag the sled or else while one pull in front the other push from behind in regular shift by the watch turn and turn about the colonel have cook all winter so it be the boy 's turn at that -- the colonel 's to decide the best place to camp because it be he affair to find seasoned wood for fuel he to build the fire in the snow on green log lay close together -- he to chop enough wood to cook breakfast the next morning all this they have arrange before they leave the big chimney that they do not cover more ground that first day be a pure chance not likely to recur due to a unavoidable loss of time at pymeut know the fascination that place exercise over he companion the colonel call a halt about seven mile off from the big chimney that they might quickly despatch a little cold luncheon they carry in they pocket and push on without a break till supper we have get no time to waste at pymeut observe the colonel significantly i be not achin ' to stop at pymeut say he pardner with a superior air stand up as he swallow he last mouthful of cold bacon and corn-bread and cheerfully survey the waste who say it be cold even if the wind be up and the track 's bully but see here colonel you must not go thinkin ' it be smooth glare-ice like this all the way oh i be figurin ' that it would be but the boy pay no heed to the irony and it be a custom o ' the country to get the wind in you face as a rule whichever way you go well i be not complainin ' as yet reckon you need not if you be blow like dandelion-down all the way to minok gee the wind 's stronger say colonel let 's rig a sail foolishness no sir we 'll go by pymeut in a ice-boat lickety split and it 'll be a good excuse for not stop though i think we ought to say good-bye to nichola this view incline the colonel to think better of a ice-boat he have once cross the bay of toronto in that fashion and begin to wonder if such a mode of progression apply to sled might not aid largely in solve the minok problem while he be wonder the boy unlash the sled-load and pull off the canvas cover as the colonel come back with he mast between they with no better tool than axe jack-knife and a rope and with finger freezing in the south wind they rig the sail the fact that they have this increasingly favourable wind on they very first day show that they be specially smile on by the great natural force the superstitious feeling that only slumber in most breast that mother nature be still a mysterious be who have she favorite whom she guard she bear enemy whom she baulk pursue and finally overwhelm the age-old childishness stir pleasantly in both man and in the younger come forth unabashed in speech : i tell you the omen be good this expedition 's goin ' to get there then with the involuntary misgiving that follow hard upon such boast he laugh uneasily and add i mean to sacrifice the first deer 's tongue i do not want myself to yukon inua but here be to the south wind he turn some corn-bread crumb out of he pocket and see delighted how the gale grow keener snatch eagerly at they and hurry they up the trail the ice-boat careen and strain eagerly to sail away the two gold-seeker laugh like schoolboy sit astride the pack the colonel shake out the canvas and they scud off up the river like mad the great difficulty be the steering but it be rip-roaring fun the boy say and very soon there be native run down to the river to stare open-mouthed at the astounding apparition to point and shout something unintelligible that sound like muchtaravik why it be the pymeut pardner we 'll be in minok by supper-ti -- the word have not leave he lip when he see a few yard in front of they a faint cloud of steam rise up from the ice -- that dim danger-signal that fly above a air-hole the colonel never notice be head straight for the ghastly trap god colonel blow-hole gasp the boy the colonel simply roll off the pack turn over and over on the ice but keep hold of the rope the sled swerve turn on she side and slide along with a sound of snap and tear while they be still head straight for the hole the boy have gather himself for a clear jump to the right but the sled 's sudden swerve to the left break he angle sharply he be fling forward on the new impetus spin over the smooth surface sweep across the verge and under the cloud clutch wildly at the ragged edge of ice as he go down all pymeut have come rush pell-mell the colonel be gather himself up and look round in a dazed kind of way as nichola flash by just beyond in that yawn hole fully ten foot wide by fifteen long the boy 's head appear a instant and then be lose like something see in a dream some of the pymeut with quick knife be cut the canvas loose one end be pass to nichola he knot it to he belt and go swiftly but gingerly forward nearer the perilous edge he have fling himself down on he stomach just as the boy rise again nicholas lurch he body over the brink he arm outstretch strain farther farther yet till it seem as if only the counterweight of the rest of the population at the other end of the canvas prevent he join the boy in the hole but nichola have get a grip of he and while two of the pymeut hang on to the half-stunned colonel to prevent he add to the complication nichola with a good deal of trouble in spite of yagorsha 's help haul the boy out of the hole and drag he up on the ice-edge the other apply themselves lustily to they end of the canvas and soon they be all at a safe distance from the yawning danger the boy 's predominant feeling have be one of intense surprise he look round and a hideous misgiving seize he anything the matter with you colonel he tone be so angry that as they stare at each other they both fall to laugh well i rather think that be what _ i _ be go to say and kentucky heave a deep sigh of relief the boy 's tooth begin to chatter and he clothes be soon freezing on he they get he up off the ice and nichola and the sturdy old pymeut story-teller yagorsha walk he or run he rather the rest of the way to pymeut for they be not so near the village as the traveller have suppose on see nearly the whole male population the colonel be not far behind and several of the buck be bring the disabled sled before reach the kachime they be join by the woman and child muckluck much concern at the sight of she friend glaze in ice from head to heel nichola and yagorsha half drag half pull he into the kachime the entire escort follow even two or three very dirty little boy -- everybody except the handful of woman and girl leave at the mouth of the underground entrance and the two man who have run on to make a fire it be already smoking viciously as though the seal-lamp be not do enough in that line when yagorsha and nichola lay the half-frozen traveller on the sleeping-bench the pymeut know that the great thing be to get the ice-stiffened clothes off as quickly as might be and that be to be do expeditiously only by cut they off in vain the boy protest recklessly they saw and cut and strip he rub he and wrap he in a rabbit-blanket the fur turn inside and a wolverine skin over that the colonel at interval pour small dose of o'flynn 's whisky down the boy 's throat in spite of he unbecoming behavior for he be both belligerent and ungrateful complain loudly of the ruin of he clothes with only such intermission as the teeth-chattering swallow and rude handling necessitate i do not like -- bein ' in -- that blow-hole -lrb- do you know -- it be so cold -- it burnt -rrb- but i would rather -- be -- in a blow-hole -- than -- br-r-r blow-hole be not so s-s-melly as these s-s-kin ' you better be glad you have get a whole skin of you own and be not smellin ' brimstone say the colonel pour a little more whisky down the unthankful throat pretty sort o ' klondyker you be -- go and get nearly drown first day

boy crane he neck and look round except just where he be lie the pymeut man and woman be crowd together on that side of the kachime at he head and at he foot thick as herring on a thwart they all lean forward and regard he with a beady-eyed sympathy he have never be so impressed by the fact before but all these native people even in they gentlest mood frown in a chronic perplexity and wear they wide mouth open he reflect that he have never see one that do not except muckluck here she be crawl in with a tin can get something there to eat the rescue one crane he head as far as he could too soon she say show she brilliant tooth in the fire-light she set the tin down look round a little embarrassed and stir the fire which do not need it well -- he put he chin down under the rabbit-skin

have _ to carry a fellum on to fortune he lay back on the sleeping-bench with dancing eye while the raw whisky hum in he head in the dim light of seal-lamps vague vision visit he of stern and noble chief out of the leather stock story of he childhood -- man of daring whose leg be invariably case in buck-skin with dangling fringe but the dash race be not all indian nor all dead famous cowboy rear before he on buck broncho they leg-fringe streaming on the blast and desperate chap who hold up coach and potted well fargo guard anybody must need be a devil of a fellow who go about in shap as he

he eye relieve on the whole fate have a mind to see he in chaparejo let she look to the sequel then when consciousness come back it bring the sound of yagorsha 's yarning by the fire and the occasional laugh or grunt punctuate the eternal story the colonel be sit there among they solace himself by add to the smoke that thicken the stifle air presently the story-teller make some shrewd hit that shake the pymeut community into louder grunt of applause and a general chuckle the colonel turn he head slowly and blow out a fresh cloud : good joke in the pause that fall thereafter yagorsha imperturbable the only one who have not laugh smooth he lank iron-gray lock down on either side of he wide face and go on renew the sinew open-work in he snow-shoe when ol' chief 's father die -- all

go joe call something after she and she snap back he jump up to bar she exit she give he a smart cuff across the eye which surprise he almost into the fire and while he be recover he equilibrium she flee yagorsha and all the pymeut laugh delightedly at joe 's discomfiture the boy have be oblige to sit up to watch this spirited encounter the only notice the colonel take of he be to set the kettle

wish you would come back and wait till morning no i go now she be in the act of dart forward on those snow-shoe that she use so skillfully when some sudden thought cry halt she even stop cry i no like

visit the half-shut eye of the camp fire gleam cheerfully as he run back and crouch down where poor little muckluck have kneel so sure of a welcome muckluck cogitate the boy will believe more firmly than ever that if a man do not beat a girl he do not mean business what be it he have wind round one hand what be it dangle in the acrid smoke _ that _ then -- she trinket the crowning ornament of she holy cross holiday attire that be what she be offer the old ogre of the yukon -- for he unworthy sake he stir up the die fire to see it better a woman 's face -- some catholic saint he hold the medal

he pymeut child with he bone well yukon inua should not have it yet the boy thrust the medal into a pocket of he chaparejo and crawl into he snow-covered bed chapter xi holy cross raise the stone and ye shall find I cleave the wood and there be i the star be shine frostily in a clear sky when the boy crawl out from under he snow-drift in the morning he build up the fire quake in the bitter air and bustle the breakfast you seem to be in something of a hurry say the colonel with a yawn stifle in a shiver we have not come on this trip to lie abed in the morning he pardner return with some solemnity i do not care how soon i begin caperin ' ahead with that load again well it 'll be warmin ' anyway return the colonel and i can not say as much for you fire it be luck that the first forty mile of the trail have already be traverse by the boy he keep recognize this and that in the landscape with a effect of good cheer on both of they it postpone a little the realization of they daring in launch themselves upon the arctic waste without a guide or even a map that be of the smallest use half a hour after set off they strike into the portage even with a snow-blurred trail the boy 's vivid remembrance of the other journey give they the sustain sense that they be go right the colonel be work off the surprising stiffness with which he have waken and they be both warm now but the colonel 's footsoreness be considerable a affliction besides bind to be worse before it be better the boy speak with the old-timer 's superiority of he own experience and be so puff up at the bare thought of have harden he foot that he conceal without a qualm the fact of a brand-new blister on he heel a mere nothing that not worth mention to anyone who remember the state he be in at the end of that awful journey of penitence it be well on in the afternoon before it begin to snow again and they have reach the frozen lake the day be lengthen and they still have good light by which to find the well-beaten trail on the other side now in a minute we 'll hear the mission dog what do i tell you out of the little wood a couple of team be come at a good round pace they be pull up at the waterhole and the mission native run on to meet the new arrival they recognize the boy and insist on make the colonel who be walk very lame ride to the mission in the strongest sled and they take turn help the dog by push from behind the snow be fall heavily again and one of the indian henry look up with squint eye say there 'll be nothing left of that walrus-tusk hey inquire the boy strain at he sled-rope and bend before the blast what be that do not you know what make snow say henry no what do ivory whittling when they get to they carve up yonder then we have snow what be happen to the colonel the mere physical comfort of ride instead of serve as packhorse great as it be not even that could so instantly spirit away the weariness and light up the curious solemn radiance that shine on the colonel 's face it strike the boy that good old kentucky would look like that when he meet he dearest at the gate of heaven -- if there be such a place the colonel be aware of the sidelong wonder of he comrade 's glance for the sled abreast have come to a momentary halt but still he stare in front of he just as a sailor in a storm dare not look away from the beacon-light a instant know all the waste about he abound in rock and eddy and in death and all the world of hope and safe return be narrow to that little point of light after the moment 's speculation the boy turn he eye to follow the colonel 's gaze into space the cross the cross say the man on the sled do not you see it oh that yes at the boy 's tone the colonel for the first time turn he eye away from the great white symbol do not know what you be make of if see that you need not be a church member but only a man i should think to -- to -- he blow out he breath in impotent cloud and then go on we american think a good deal o ' the star and stripe but that up yonder -- that be the mightier symbol huh say the boy star and stripe tell of a ideal of united state that up there tell of a ideal of unite mankind it be the great brotherhood mark there be not any other standard that man would follow just to build a hospice in a place like this at a upper window in a building on the far side of the white symbol the traveller catch a glimpse through the slanting snow of one of the sister of st ann shut in the bright light with thick curtain _ glass _ ejaculate the colonel one of the indian have run on to announce they and as they draw up at the door -- that the boy remember as a frame for brother paul with he lamp to search out iniquity and he face of denunciation -- out come father brachet brisk almost run he two hand outstretch he face a network of welcome wrinkle no long wait this time in the reception-room straight upstairs to hot bath and mild revive drink and then refresh and already rest down to supper with a shade of anxiety the boy look about for brother paul but father will be here anyhow and the boy greet he joyfully as a try friend and a man to be depend on there be brother etienne and there be two strange face father brachet put the colonel on he right and the boy on he left introduce : fazzer richmond my predecessor as ze head of all ze alaskan mission calmly eliminate greek episcopalian and other heretic establishment fazzer richmond you must have hear much of he be ze great ausority up here he be now ze travel priest you can ask he all he know everyse in no wise abashed by this flourish father richmond shake hand with the big chimney man smile and with a pleasant ease that communicate itself to the entire company it be instantly manifest that the scene of this jesuit 's labor have not be chiefly or long beyond the border of civilization in the plain bare room where for all its hospitality and good cheer reign a air of rude simplicity and austerity of life -- into this somewhat rarefy atmosphere father richmond bring a whiff from another world as he greet the two stranger and say simply that he have just arrive himself by way of the anvik portage the colonel feel that he must have mean from new york or from paris instead of the word he add from st michael 's he claim instant kinship with the colonel on the strength of they both be southerner i be a baltimore man he say with a accent no marylander can purge of pride how long since you have be home oh i go back every year he go all over ze world to tell ze people -- -- something of the work be do here by father brachet -- and all of they he include the other priest and lay-brother in a slight circular movement of the grizzled head and to collect fund the colonel rightly divine little guess how triumphantly he achieve that end alaska be so remote say the travel priest as if in apology for popular ignorance and people think of it so inadequately shall we say in try to explain the condition up here i have my chief difficulty in make they realize the great distance we have to cover you tell they that in the indian tongue alaska mean the great country they smile and think condescendingly of savage imagery it be vain to say we have a area of six hundred thousand square mile we talk much in these day of education but few man and no woman can count we eastern friend get some idea of what we mean when we tell they alaska be bigger than all the atlantic state from maine to louisiana with half of great texa throw in with a coast-line of twenty six thousand mile this alaska of ours turn to the sea a greater frontage than all the shore of all the united state combine it extend so far out towards asia that it carry the dominion of the great republic as far west of san francisco as new york be east of it make californium a central state i try to give european some idea of it by say that if you add england ireland and scotland together and to that add france and to that add italy you still lack enough to make a country the size of alaska i do not speak of we mountain seventeen eighteen nineteen thousand foot high and we yukon flow for more than two thousand mile through a country almost virgin still you travel about up here a good deal he travel _ all _ ze time he will not rest say father brachet as one air a ancient grievance yes i will rest now -- a little i have be eight hundred

have greatly advanced my grammar since we part father brachet answer with animation in french and the conversation go forward for some minute in that tongue the discussion be interrupt to introduce the other new face at the bottom of the table to the big chimney man : resident fazzer roget of ze kuskoquim mission that be the best man on snow-shoe in central alaska say father richmond low to the colonel nodding at the kuskoquim priest and he know more of two of ze native dialect here zan anyone else add the father superior you must forgive we speak much of the indian tongue say father richmond we be all make dictionary and grammar we have still to translate much of we religious instruction and the great variety in dialect of the scatter tribe keep we busy with linguistic study tomorrow you must see we school say father brachet but the boy answer quickly that they could not afford the time he be surprise at the colonel 's silence but the boy do not know what the colonel 's foot feel like kentucky be not sorry he say to himself to have a back to he chair and to eat off china again kentucky 's a voluptuary i 'll have to drag he away by main force and the boy allow father richmond to help he yet more abundantly to the potato and cabbage grow last summer in the mission garden it be especially the vegetable that lend a element of luxury to the simple meal the warm room the excellent food better cook than any they have have for seven month produce a gentle somnolence the thought of the invite look of the white-covered bed upstairs lay like a balm on the spirit of man not bear to rough it as the traveller say a early and grateful good-night the boy add sleepily something about the start at dawn father brachet answer morning will bring counsel my son i sink ze bleezzar-r will not let we lose you so soon they oversleep themselves and they know it in that way the would-be early riser do before ever he look into the accuse face of he watch the boy leap out of

colonel call after he incredulously only as far as the church oh be there church today inquire the boy more cheerfully than one might expect the colonel start and make a signal for discretion blest if it be not Sunday he say under he breath he do not seem dead-set on we observe it whisper the boy the colonel warm himself luxuriously at the stove and seem to listen for that summons from the entry that never come be father richmond out there still or have he go do they think we be heathen because we be not jesuit he say under he breath suddenly throw out he great chest perhaps we ought to hey they have be awfully considerate of _ we -- _ the colonel go to the door father richmond be struggle with he snow-boot with you permission sir say the colonel in he most magnificent manner we will accompany you or follow if you be in haste with all my heart come say the priest if you will wait and breakfast with we after mass it be agree and the immediate order be countermand the sound of a

-- a fine tone do not you think but you can not tell so well in this storm we be fond of we bell it be the first that ever ring out in the yukon valley listen they stand still a moment before open the front door the boy see the very look of a certain high-shouldered gray stone st andrew 's far away and himself trot along beside that figure inseparable from first memory be dimly aware again as he stand at the jesuit 's door in these different day of the old Sunday feeling invade permeate he consciousness half reluctant half amuse the colonel sit in a rural church and look at the avert face of a woman only to the priest be the sound all music that language he say speak to man whatever tongue they call they own the native hear it for mile up the river and down the river and over the white hill and far across the tundra they come many mile to mass -- he open the door and the gale rush in i do not mean on day like this he wind up smile and out they go into the whirling snow the church be a building of log like the other except that it be of one story father brachet be already there with father will and brother etienne and after a moment in come brother paul look more waxen and aloof than ever at the head of the school the rear bring up by brother vincent and henry in a moment the little mother superior appear follow by two nun head a procession of native woman and girl they take they place on the other side of the church and bow they head beautiful creature ejaculate the colonel under he breath glance back he companion turn he head sharply just in time to see sister winifred come last into the church holding by either hand a little child both man watch she as she kneel down between the child 's sallow screwed-up squint little visage the calm unconscious face of the nun shine white like a flower the stranger glance discreetly about the rude little church with its picture and its modest attempt at stain glass no wonder all this impress the ignorant native whisper the colonel catch himself up suddenly from share in that weakness without the wild march storm sweep the white world within another climate reign -- something of summer and the far-off south of italy herself transplant to this little island of civilisation anchor in the northern waste s ` pose you have see all the big cathedral eh good many there be still a subdue rustling in the church and outside still the clang bell contend with the storm and this -- make you smile n -- no return the older man with a kind of reluctance i have see many a worse church america 's full of 'em hey so far

do in we prairie and southern country church i know but look at those altar light the boy be too busy look at sister winifr i tell you sir a man never make a finer thing than a tall wax candle sh must not talk in church the colonel stare a moment at the boy 's presumption draw himself up a little pompously and cross he arm over he huge chest why they have get a organ the boy forget he strict view on church etiquette as the sudden sweetness swell in the air brother paul with head throw back and white face lift be play slowly absently like one who listen to some great choir invisible and keep they time with a few obedient but unnecessary chord and yet -- the fellum can play the colonel admit the native choir compose entirely of little dark-faced boy sing they way truly through the service father brachet celebrate mass brother paul 's ill be not he look the lay-brother have sway and droop forward over the keyboard but he choir sing steadily on he recover himself and beckon one of the boy to he side when he rise the child nod and take the organist 's place playing quite creditably to the end brother paul sit in the corner with bow head come out they be in time to confront sister winifr hold back the youngest child eager to anticipate they proper place in the procession the boy look fixedly at she wonder suddenly meet the clear eye he smile and then shrink inwardly at he forwardness he could not tell if she remember he the colonel finding himself next she at the door bow and stand back for she to pass no she say gently my little child must wait for the older one you have they under good discipline madam he lay he hand on the furry shoulder of the smallest the boy stand behind the colonel unaccountably shy in the presence of the only white woman he have see in nearly seven month she could not be any older than he and yet she be a nun what a gulf open at the word sister winifr and she charge fall into rank at the tail of the little procession and vanish in the fall snow at breakfast the colonel would not sit down till he be present to brother paul sir he say in he florid but entirely sincere fashion i should like to thank you for the pleasure of hearing

of he shrewd observation and lively anecdote in the midst of all the laughter and good cheer brother paul sit at the end of the board eating absently say nothing and no one speak to he father richmond especially but indeed all of they seem arrant worldling beside the youngest of the lay-brethren the colonel could more easily imagine father richmond walk the street of pari or of rome than hit the yukon trail he marvel afresh at the devotion that bring such a man to wear out he fine attainment he scholarship he energy he wide and catholic knowledge in travel winter after winter hundred of mile over the ice from one indian village to another you could not divorce father richmond in you mind from the larger world outside he speak with its accent he look with he humourous experienced eye you find it natural to think of he in very human relation you wonder about he people and what bring he to this not so with brother paul he be one of those who suggest no country upon any print map you have to be remind that you do not know he birthplace or he history it be this same brother paul who after breakfast and despite the pymeut incident offer to show the gold-seeker over the school the big recitation-room be full of native and decidedly stuffy they do not stay long upstairs i sleep here in the dormitory say the brother and i live with the pupil -- as much as i can i often eat with

the boy as they go by the cross and father richmond greet the half-dozen native boy who be pack down the fresh snow under they broad shoe laugh and shout to one another as they make anew the familiar mission trail the door of the two-story house on the opposite side of the settlement be open by sister winifr friend of ours from the white camp below she acknowledge the nameless introduction smile but at the request that follow ah it be too bad that just to-day -- the mother superior -- she be too faint and weak to go about will you see she father yes if you will show these stranger the school and laundry and -- oh yes i will show they she lead the way into the cheerful schoolroom where big girl and little girl be sit about amusing themselves in the quiet of a long Sunday afternoon several of the younger child run to she as she come in and stand hold fast to the fold of she black habit stare up at the stranger while she explain the kind of instruction give the system and the order reign in each department finally she persuade a little girl only six year old to take she dusky face out of the long flow veil of the nun and show how quickly she could read a sentence that sister winifr write on the blackboard then other be call on and give example of they accomplishment in easy arithmetic and spell the child must have be very much bore with themselves that stormy Sunday for they enter into the examination with a quite unnatural zest two of the elder girl recite and some specimen of penmanship and composition be show the delicate complexion of the little nun flush to a pretty wild-rose pink as these pupil of hers win the colonel 's old fashion compliment and they be teach most particularly of all she hasten to say cooking housekeeping and sewing whereupon specimen of needlework be bring out and cast like pearl before the swine 's eye of the ignorant man but they be impress in they benighted way and say so and we teach they laundry-work she lead the way with the child troop after to the washhouse no run back you 'll take cold run back and you shall sing for the stranger before they go she smile they away -- a happy-faced clean little throng striking contrast to the neglect filthy child see in the native village as they be go into the laundry father richmond come out of the house and stop to point out to the colonel a snow-covered enclosure -- the sister ' garden -- and he tell how marvellously in the brief summer some of the hardier vegetable flourish there they spring up like magic at the edge of the snow-drift and they do not rest from they grow all night if the time be short they have twice as much sunlight as with you they drink it in the whole summer night as well as all the day and over here be the father ' garden talk still he lead the way towards a larger enclosure on the other side of the cross sister winifr pause a moment and then as they do not turn back and the boy stand wait she take he into the drying-room and into the ironing-room and then return to the betubbed apartment first invade there be only one blot on the fairness of that model laundry -- a heap of tear and dirty canvas in the middle of the floor the boy vaguely think it look familiar before the sister blush faintly say : we hope you will not go before we have time to repair it why it be we old sled-cover yes it be very much cut and tear but you do not go at once yes to-morrow oh father brachet think you would stay for a few day at least we have no time you go like the rest for gold like the rest but you come before to help poor nichola out of he trouble he be quite able to help himself as it turn out why will you go so far and at such risk she say with a suddenness that startle they both i -- i -- well i think i go chiefly because i want to get my home back i lose my home when i be a little chap where be you home here how long have you be here nearly two year then how can you call it home i do that only that i may -- speak you language of course it be not my real home where be the real home i hope it be in heaven she say with a simplicity that take away all taint of cant or mere phrase-making but where do you come from i come from montreal oh and do not you ever go back to visit you people no i never go back but you will some time no i shall never go back do not you _ want _ to she drop she eye but very steadfastly she say : my work be here but you be young and you may live a great great many year she nod and look out of the open door the colonel and the travel priest be walk in indian file the new-made hard-packed path yes she say in a level voice i shall grow old here and here i shall be bury i shall never understand it i have such a longing for my home i come here ready to bear anything that i might be able to get it back she look at he steadily and gravely i may be wrong but i doubt if you would be satisfy even if you get it back -- now what make you think that he say sharply because -- and she check herself as if on the verge of something too personal -- you can never get back a thing you have lose when the old thing be there again you be not as you be when you lose it and the change in you make the old thing new -- and strange oh it be plain i be very different from you but he say it with a kind of uneasy defiance besides in any case i shall do it for my sister 's sake oh you have a sister he nod how long since you leave she it be a good while now perhaps you sister will not want that particular home any more than you when you two meet again then seem not to notice the shade on she companion 's face : i promise my child they should sing for you do you mind will you friend come in too and look from the door after the colonel and the father as they turn to rejoin they : he be odd that big friend of yours she say -- quite like a human be as the boy think instantly he be not odd i assure you he call I ` madam ' she speak with a charming piqued childishness you see he do not know you name what be you name sister winifr but you real name he say with the american 's insistence on he own point of view that be my only name she answer with dignity and lead the way back into the schoolroom another older nun be there and when the other rejoin they they make the girl sing now we have show you enough say father richmond rise boast to you enough of the very little we be able to accomplish here we must save something for to-morrow ah to-morrow we take to the trail again say the colonel and add he good-bye madam sister winifr see he expect it give he she hand good-bye and thank you for come for you poor he say shyly as he turn away and leave a gift in she palm thank you for show we all this the boy say linger but not daring to shake hand it -- it seem very wonderful i have no idea a mission mean all this oh it mean more -- more than anything you can _ see _ good-bye good-bye in the early evening the reception-room be invade by the lad ' school for they usual Sunday night entertainment very proudly these boy and young man sing they glee and chorus play the fiddle recite even dance pity mac be not here awful pity Sunday too brother etienne sing some french military song and it come out that he have serve in the french army father roget sing also in french explain himself with a humourous skill in pantomime that set the room in a roar well say the colonel when he stand up to say good-night i have not enjoy a evening so much for year it be very early still say father brachet wrinkle up he face in a smile ah but we have to make such a early start the colonel go up to bed leave the boy to go to father richmond 's room to look at he grammar of the indian language the instant the door be shut the priest set down the lamp and lay he hand on the young man 's shoulder my son you must not go on this mad journey i must you know you must _ not _ sit there he push he into a chair let I tell you i do not speak as the ignorant i have in my day travel many hundred of mile on the ice but i have do it in the season when the trail 's at its best with dog my son and with try native servant i know it be pleasanter that way but -- pleasanter it be the way to keep alive but the indian travel with hand-sled for short distance yes and they be inure to the climate you you know nothing of what lie before you but we 'll find out as other people have the boy smile confidently i assure you my son it be madness this thing you be try to do the chance of either of you come out alive be one in fifty in fifty do i say in five hundred i do not think so father we do not mean to travel when -- but you 'll have to travel to stay in such place as you 'll find yourself in will be to starve or if by any miracle you escape the worst effect of cold and hunger you 'll get catch in the ice in the spring break-up and go down to destruction on a floe you have no conception what it be like if you be six week earlier or six week later i would hold my peace the boy look at the priest and then away _ be _ it go to be so bad would they leave they bone on the ice would they go wash by the mission in the great spring flood that all man speak of with the same grave look he have a sudden vision of the torrent as it would be in June among the whirling ice-mass that sweep by -- two body swollen unrecognisable one gigantic one dress gaily in chaparejo and neither would lift he head but like man bent grimly upon some great errand they would hurry on past the tall white cross with never a sign -- on on to the sea be persuade my son dimly the boy know he be even now bear along upon a current equally irresistible this one set northward as that other back to the south he find himself shake he head under the jesuit 's remonstrant eye we have lose so much time already we could not possibly turn back -- now then here 's my grammar with a almost comic change of tone and manner the priest turn to the table where the lamp stand among pile of neatly tied-up and docket papers he undo one of the packet with a ear on the sudden sound outside in the passage brother paul 's get it in the schoolhouse brother paul he have not be at the entertainment and no one seem to have miss he how do sister winifr know ask another voice old marium tell she father richmond get up and open the door what be it it be a new-born indian baby the father look down as if it might be on the threshold brother paul find it below at the village all do up ready to be abandon tell sister winifr i 'll see about it in the morning she say -- pardon I father -- she say that be like a man if i do not bring the little indian in twenty minute she will come herself and get it father richmond laugh good-night my son and he go downstairs with the other \* \* \* \* \* colonel you asleep the boy ask softly no he struggle in silence with he muckluck presently be not it frightfully strange he muse aloud do not it pull a fellum up by the root somehow to see american on this old track the colonel have the bedclothes draw up to he eye under the white quilt he make some undistinguishable sound but he keep he eye fasten on he pardner everything that we american have do everything that we be be achieve by the grace of goin ' bang the other way the boy pull off a muckluck and throw it half across the room and yet and yet -- he sit with one stocking-foot in he hand and stare at the candle i wonder colonel if it _ satisfy _ anybody to be a hustler and a millionaire satisfy echo the colonel push he chin over the bed-clothes who expect to be satisfied why every man woman and child on the top o ' the earth and it just strike I i have never personally know anybody get there but these fella at holy cross the colonel push back the bedclothes a little farther with he chin have not you get the gumption to see why it be this place and these man take such a hold on you it be because you have eat sleep and live for half a year in a space the size of this bedroom we have get so use to narrow life down that the first result of a little larger outlook be to make we dizzy now you hurry up and get to bed you 'll sleep it off \* \* \* \* \* the boy wake at four o'clock and after the match-light by which he consult he watch have flicker out he lay a long time stare at the dark silence still reign supreme when at last he get up wash and dress and go downstairs a irresistible restlessness have seize hold of he he pull on he fur cautiously open the door and go out -- down over the crisp new crust to the river and back in the dimness past the father ' house to the settlement behind then to the right towards the hillside as he stumble up the slope he come to a little burial-ground half hide in the snow white wooden cross mark the grave and here i shall be bury she have say -- here he come down the hill and round by the sister ' house that window that be where a light have shine the evening they arrive and a nun -- sister winifr -- have stand draw the thick curtain shut out the world he think in the intense stillness that he hear sound from that upper room yes surely a infant 's cry a curious heavy-hearted feeling come upon he as he turn away and go slowly back towards the other house he halt a moment under the cross and stare up at it the door of the father ' house open and the travel priest stand on the threshold the boy go over to he nod good-morning so you be all ready -- eager to go from we no but you see -- i see he hold the door open and the boy go in i do not believe the colonel 's awake yet he say as he take off he fur i 'll just run up and rouse he it be very early -- the priest lay he hand on the young man 's arm -- and he will not sleep so well for many a night to come it be a hour till breakfast henry have light the fire and now leave it roar the priest take a chair and push one forward for he guest the boy sit down stretch he leg out straight towards the fire and lift he hand clasp they behind he head the priest read the homesick face like a book why be you up here before there be time for reply he add : surely a young man like you could find nearer home many a gate ajar and you must have have glimpse through of -- thing many and fair oh yes i have have glimpse of those thing well -- what i want most i never see you want -- to be -- _ sure _ ah it be one of the result of agnosticism the boy never see the smile i have say -- and i be not lie -- that i come away to shorten the business of fortune-making -- to buy back a old place we love my sister and i but -- which do she love best the old place or the young brother oh she care about I -- no doubt o ' that he smile the smile of faith have she a understanding heart the most i know then she would be glad to know you have find a home for the spirit a home for the body what do it matter in the pause father brachet open the door but seem suddenly to remember some imperative call elsewhere the boy jump up but the superior have vanish without even good-morn the boy sit down again of course he go on with that touch of pedantry so common in american youth the difficulty in my case be a intellectual one i think i appreciate the splendid work you do and i see as i never see before -- he stop you strike you foot against the same stone of stumble over which the pharisee fall when the man whom jesus heal by the way reply to they question : ` whether he be a sinner or no i know not one thing i know that whereas i be blind now i see ' i do not deny that the life here have be a revelation to I i be not talkin ' about creed -lrb- for i do not know much about they and i do not think it be in I to care much -rrb- but so far as the work here be concern -- he pause we can take little credit for that it be the outcome of we order the boy fail to catch the effect of the capital letter yes it be just that -- the order the good government a fellum would be a bigot if he could not see that the system be as nearly perfect as a human institution can be that have be say before of the society of jesus but he speak with the wise man 's tolerance for the discovery of the young still it be not to discuss the merit of he order that he have get up a hour before he time i understand maybe better than yourself something of the restlessness that drive you here you understand the priest nod you have the excuse of the old plantation and the sister -- the boy sit up suddenly a little annoyed the priest keep on : but you feel a great longing to make a breach in the high wall that shut you in you want to fare away on some voyage of discovery be not that it he pause now in he turn but the boy look straight before he say nothing the priest lean forward with a deeper gravity it will be a fortunate expedition this my son _ if thou discover thyself _ -- and in time still the boy say nothing the other resume more lightly : in america we combine we travels with business but it be no new idea in the world that a young man should have he wanderjahr before he find what he want or even find acquiescence it do not need wilhelm meister to set the foot of youth on that trail it do not need the crusade it be as old as the idea of a golden fleece or a promised land it be the first man 's first inkling of heaven the boy prick he ear be not this heresy the old idea of the strenuous to leave home and comfort and security and go out to search for wisdom or holiness or happiness -- whether it be gold or the san grael the instinct of search be deep plant in the race it be this that the handful of man who live in what they call ` the world ' -- it be this they forget every hour in the greater world outside someone somewhere be start out upon this journey he may go only as far as germany to study philosophy or to the nearest mountain-top and find there the thing he seek or he may go to the end of the earth and still not find it he may travel in a hindu gown or a mongolian tunic or he come like father brachet out of he vineyard in ` the pleasant land of france ' or like you out of a country where all problem be to be solve by machinery but my point be _ they come _ when all the other army of the world be disband that army my son will be still upon the march they be silent awhile and still the young face give no sign to many the travel priest go on the impulse be a blind one or a shy one shrink from call itself by the old name but none the less this instinct for the quest be still the gallant way of youth confront by a sense of the homelessness they can not think will last that be it father that be it the boy burst out homelessness to feel that be to feel something urge you -- he stop frown -- urge you to take up you staff say the priest they be silent a moment and then the same musical voice toll out the word like a low bell : but with all you journey my son you will come to no continue city it be no use to say this to I you see i be -- i 'll tell you why i say it the priest lay a hand on he arm i see man go up and down all they life upon this quest once in a great while i see one for whom i think the journey may be shorten how shorten a heavy step on the stair and the boy seem to wake from a dream good-morning say the colonel come in cheerily rub he hand i be very jealous he glance at the boy 's fur on the floor you have be out see the rest of the mission without I no -- no we will show you the rest -- as much as you care for after breakfast i be afraid we ought not to delay -- but they do -- for a few minute while zey be put a little fresh meat on you sled as father brachet say they go first to see the dog feed for they get breakfast when they be at home those pampered mission dog and now we will show you we store-house we cache -- while father brachet look in the bunch for the key he want a native come by with a pail he enter the low building on the left leave wide the door what no be it really no not _ really _ the colonel be more excited than the boy have ever see he without the smallest ceremony he leave the side of he oblige host stride to the open door and disappear inside what on earth 's the matter i can not tell it be but we cow-house they follow and look in at the door the boy see a picture that for many a day paint itself on he memory for inside the dim straw-strewn place stand the big kentuckian with one arm round the cow talk to she and rub she nose while down he own a tear trickle hey well yes just my view sukey yes old girl alaska 's a funny kind o ' place for you and I to be in be not it hey ye-e-yes and he stroke the cow and sniff back the salt water and call out see the boy look they have get a thoroughbred bull too a ' a heifer lord i have not be in any place so like home for a coon 's age you go and look at the cache i 'll stay here while sambo milk she my name be sebastian oh all right reckon you can milk she under that name too when they come back the colonel be still there exchange view about alaska with sukey and with sebastian about the bull sister winifr come hurry over the snow to the cow-house with a little tin pail in she hand ah but you be slow sebastian she call out almost petulantly good-morning she say to the other and with a quick clutch at a respectful and submissive demeanor she add half aside : what do you think father brachet they forget that baby because he be good and sleep late they drink up all the milk ah there be very little now very little father say sebastian return to the task from which the colonel 's conversation have divert he i put aside some last night and they use it i send you to bring I only a little drop -- she be by sebastian now hold out the small pail unmindful of the other who be talk stock -- and you stay and stay -- give I you can the boy take it from she and hold it inside the big milk-pail so that the thin stream strike it sharply there it be enough she shawl have fall the colonel gather it up i will carry the milk back for you say the boy notice how red and cold the slim hand be you finger will be frostbitten if you do not wrap they up she pull the old shawl closely round she and set a brisk pace back to the sister ' house i must go carefully or i might slip and if i spilt the milk -- oh you must not do that she pause suddenly and then go on but more slowly than before a glaze have form on the hard-trodden path and one must need walk warily once she look back with anxiety and see that the precious milk be be carry with due caution she glance go gratefully to the boy 's face he feel she eye i be be careful he laugh a little embarrassed and not at first lift he bent head when after a instant he do so he find the beautiful calm eye full upon he but no self-consciousness there she turn away gentle and reflective and be walk on when some quick summons seem to reach she she stop quite still again as if seize suddenly by a detain hand she own hand drop straight at she side and the rusty shawl hang free a second time she turn the boy think to he again but as he glance up wonder he see that the fix yet serene look go past he like a homing-dove a neglect slight feeling come over he she be not thinking of he the least in the world nor even of the milk he be at such pain to carry for she what be she stare at he turn he head over he right shoulder nothing no one as he come slowly on he keep glance at she she still with upturned face stand there in the attitude of a obedient child receive admonition one cold little hand flutter up to she silver cross ah he turn again understand now the drift if not the inner meaning of that summons that have come you friend say something -- she nod faintly riverwards towards the mission sign do you feel like that about it -- when you see it first oh -- a -- i be not religious like the colonel she smile and walk on at the door as she take the milk instead of thank you wait a moment she be back again directly you be go far beyond the mission so carry this with you i hope it will guide you as it guide we on he way back to the father ' house he keep look at what sister winifr have give he -- a latin cross of silver scarce three inch long at the intersection of the arm it bear a chase lozenge on which be a mitre above it the word alaska and beneath the cross key of st peter and the letter ptr as he come near to where the colonel and he host be he slip the cross into he pocket he finger encounter muckluck 's medal upon some wholly involuntary impulse he withdraw sister winifred 's gift and transfer it to another pocket but he laugh to himself both sort o ' charm after all and again he look at the big cross and the heaven above it and down at the domain of the inua the jealous god of the yukon twenty minute later the two traveller be say good-bye to the man of holy cross and make they surprised and delighted acknowledgment for the brand-new canvas cover they find upon the colonel 's new sled oh it be not we say father brachet it be make by ze sister zey shall know zat you be pleased father richmond hold the boy 's hand a moment i see you go my son but i shall see you return no father i shall hardly come this way again father brachet smile watch they start up the long trail i sink we shall meet again be he last word what do he mean ask the colonel a little high and mightily what plan have he get for a meeting same plan as you have get i s ` pose i believe you both call it ` heaven ' the holy cross thermometer have register twenty degree below zero but the keen wind blow down the river make it seem more like forty below when they stop to lunch they have to crouch down behind the sled to stand the cold and the boy find that he face and ear be badly frost-bitten the colonel discover that the same thing have befall the toe of he left foot they rub the afflict member and try not to let they thought stray backwards the jesuit have tell they of a inhabit cabin twenty-three mile up the river and they try to fix they mind on that in a desultory way when the wind allow it they speak of minok and of odds and end they would hear about the trail they speak of the big chimney cabin and of how at anvik they would have they last shave the one subject neither seem anxious to mention be holy cross it be a little marked the colonel feel but he be not go to say the first word since he mean to say the last about five o'clock the gale go down but it come on to snow at seven the colonel say decidedly : we can not make that cabin to-night why not because i be not go any further with this foot -- he throw down the sled-rope and limp after wood for the fire the boy tilted the sled up by a ice-hummock and spread the new canvas so that it give some scant shelter from the snow luckily for once the wind how grown quite lamb-like -- for the yukon it would be think a good stiff breeze almost anywhere else directly they have swallow supper the colonel remark : i feel as ready for my bed as i do Saturday night ah Saturday night -- that be different they look at each other with the same thought well that bed at holy cross be not any whiter than this laugh the boy but the colonel be not to be deceive by this light and airy reference he own unwilling sentiment be a guide to the boy 's and he feel it incumbent upon he to restore the holy cross incident to its proper proportion those last word of father brachet 's bother he have they be gettin ' at the boy you think all that mission business mighty wonderful -- just because you run across it in alaska and be not it wonderful at all the boy speak dreamily and from force of old habit hold out he mittened hand to the unavailing fire the colonel give a prefatory grunt of depreciation but he be pull he blanket out from under the stuff on the sled the boy turn he head and watch he with a little smile i 'll admit that i always _ use _ to think the jesuit be a shady lot -- so they be -- most of 'em well i do not know about ` most of 'em ' you and mac use to talk a lot about the ` motive ' of the few i do know but as far as i can see every creature who come up to this country come to take something out of it -- except those holy cross fella they come to bring something the colonel have get the blanket out now but where be the rubber sheet he would not sleep on it in this weather again for a kingdom but when the thaw come if those explorer fella be right -- in he sense of irritation at a conscientious duty to perform and no clear notion of how to discharge it he make believe it be the difficulty in find the rubber sheet he do not want that make he out of sort it be bitter work anyhow this make bed with you finger stiff and raw he say be it dignity look at impudence sit in the shelter smile humph just try it growl the colonel i s ` pose the man over the fire cookin ' supper do _ look _ better off than the ` pore pardner ' cuttin ' down tree and makin ' bed in the snow but he be not oh be not he it be all right but the big chimney boss feel he have choose the lion 's share of the work in elect to be woodman still it be not _ that _ that trouble he now what be it he have be go to say about the jesuit something very tell if you mean that you would rather go back to the cookin ' the boy be say _ i be _ agreeable well you start in to-morrow and see if you be so agreeable all right i think i dote on one job just about as much as i do on t ` other but still the colonel frown he could not remember that excellent thing he have be go to say about romanist but he sniff derisively and fling over he shoulder : to hear you goin ' on anybody would think the jesuit be the only christian as if there be not other who -- oh yes christian with gold shovel and winchester rifle i know 'em but if gold have not be find how many of the army that be invade the north -- how many would be here if it have not be for the gold but all this holy cross business would be goin ' on just the same as it have do for year and year with a mighty tug the colonel drag out the rubber blanket fling it down on the snow and square himself back to the fire to make short work of such view i would no notion you be such a sucker you can bet he say darkly those fella be not make a bad thing out of that ` holy cross business ' as you call it i do not mean business in that sense what else could they do if they do not do this ask the same of any parson but the colonel do not care to i suppose he say severely you could even make a hero out of that hang-dog brother etienne no but he _ could _ do something else for he be serve in the french army then there be that mad brother paul what good would he be at anything else well i do not know brachet and will be decent enough man but where else would they have the power and the freedom they have at holy cross why they live there like feudal baron father richmond could have do anything he choose ah father richmond -- the colonel shut he mouth suddenly turn about and proceed to crawl under he blanket foot to the fire well no answer well insist the boy oh father richmond must have see a ghost _ what _ take my word for it _ he _ get frightened somehow a man like father richmond have to be scare into a cassock the boy 's sudden laughter deepen the colonel 's own impression that the instance choose have not be fortunate one man of courage know another man of courage when he see he and the colonel know he have damned he own argument would not care for the job myself the boy be say what job scarin ' father richmond the boy sit watch the slow wet snow-flake fall and die in the fire he clothes be pretty damp but he be warm after a chilly fashion as warmth go on the trail the colonel suddenly put he head out from under the marmot-skin to say discontentedly what you sittin ' up for oh for instance but aside from the pertness of the answer already it be dimly recognize as a offence for one to stay up longer than the other can not think how it be the colonel growl that you do not see that they principle be wrong through and through mediaeval through and through despotic they make a virtue of weakness a fetich of vested authority and it be not american authority either the boy wait for he to quiet down what be the first rule demand the colonel half sit up of the most powerful catholic order blind obedience to a old gentleman over in italy i say last night you know the boy put in quite meekly that it all seem very un-american huh glad you can see that much the colonel drive he huge fist at the provision-bag as though to beat the stiffnecked bean into a feathery yielding blind submission do not come easy to most american the great republic be build upon revolt and he pull the cover over he head i know i know we jaw a awful lot about freedom and about what be american there be plenty o ' free speech in america and plenty o ' machinery but there be a great deal o ' human nature too i guess the boy look out of the corner of he eye at the blanket back of he big friend and maybe there 'll always be some people who -- who think there be something in the new testament notion o ' sacrifice and service the colonel roll like a angry leviathan and come to the surface to blow but the boy dash on with a fearful joy in he own temerity the difference between we colonel be that i be a unbeliever and i know it and you be a cantankerous old heathen and you _ do not _ know it the colonel sit suddenly bolt upright need not look at I like that you be as bad as anybody -- rather worse why be you _ here _ dazzle and lure by the great gold craze a ' you be not even poor you want _ more _ gold you have get a home to stay in but you be not satisfy not even in the fat land down below well say the colonel solemnly blinking at the fire i hope i be a christian but as to bein ' satisfied -- church of england can not manage it hey church of england 's get nothing to do with it it be a question o ' character satisfy we be little enough god know but we be too big for that the boy stand up back to the fire eye on the hilltop whitening in the starlight perhaps -- not -- all of we yes sah all of we the colonel lift he head with a fierce look of most un-christian pride behind he the hill leave the struggle little wood far down the slope go up and up into dimness reach to the near-by star and look down to the far-off camp fire by the great ice-river 's edge yes sah the colonel thunder again all that have get good fightin ' blood in 'em like you and I ` tis not as if we come of any worn-out frightened servile old stock you and i belong to the free-livin ' hard-ridin ' straight-shootin ' southerner the people before we fight bear and fight indian and beat the british and when there be not anything else leave to beat turn round and begin to beat one another it be the one battle we find do not pay we finish that job up in '65 and since then we have be lookin ' round for something else to beat we have get down now to beatin ' record and foreign market and breedin ' prize bull but we do not breed coward -- yet and we be not lookin ' round for any asylum the catholic church be a asylum it be for people who never have any nerve or who have lose it the colonel turn about wag he head defiantly at the icy hill and the night and in the after-stillness fall sound asleep in the snow chapter xii the great white silence -- paa dit firmament den klare nordlyslampe taendt innocently think that they have see arctic travel at its worst and secretly look upon themselves as highly accomplish trailman they have cover the forty-one mile from holy cross to anvik in less than three day the colonel make much of the pleasant and excellent man at the head of the episcopal mission there and the boy haunt benham 's store pick up a little ingalik and the a c method of trading with the indian who day and night with a number of stranded klondyker congregate about the grateful warmth of the big iron stove the traveller themselves do some business with the a c agent lay in supplies of fresh meat and even augment they hitherto carefully restricted outfit for they be go far beyond the reach of store or even of mission anvik be the last white settlement below nulato nulato be say to be over two hundred mile to the northward and yet after all they further preparation and expense each man keep say in he heart during those first day out from anvik that the journey would be easy enough but for they comfort -- the burden on the sled by all the rule of arithmetic the daily subtraction of three meal from the store should have lighten the load it seem to have the opposite effect by some process of evil enchantment every ounce grow to weigh a pound every pound a hundredweight the sled itself be bewitch recall how lightsomely it run down the snowy slope from the big chimney cabin to the river trail that morning they set forth the boy take its pretty impetuosity for a happy augury -- the very sled be eager for the mighty undertaking but never in all that weary march do it manifest again any such modest alacrity if thereafter in the long go up river there come a interval of downhill the sled turn summersault in the air wound its forward or backward rope round willow scrub or alder or else advance precipitately with a evil low-comedy air bottom side up to attack its master in the shin it either hold back with a power superhuman or it lunge forward with a momentum that capsize its weary conductor its manners grow steadily worse as the traveller push farther and farther into the wilderness beyond the exorcise power of holy cross beyond the soften influence of christian hospitality at episcopal anvik even beyond tischsocket the last of the indian village for a hundred mile the two who have be scornful of the frailty of temper they have see common in man 's dealings up here in the north begin to realize that all other trial of brotherhood pale before the strain of life on the arctic trail beyond any question after a while something go wrong with the nerve the huge draft on muscular endurance have no doubt something to do with it they work hard for fourteen sometimes seventeen hour at a stretch they be ill-fed suffering from exposure intense cold and a haunting uncertainty of the end of the undertaking they be reasonable fellow as man go with a respect for each other but when hardship have get on the nerve when you be suffer the agony of snow-blindness sore foot and the pang of hunger you be not to put it mildly at you best as a member of the social order they sometimes say thing they be ashamed to remember but both man grow carefuller at crucial moment and the talkative one more silent as time go on by the rule of the day the hard shift before dinner usually fall to the boy it be the worst time in the twenty-four hour and equally dread by both man it be only the first night out from anvik after a unusually try day the boy be tramp heavily ahead bent like a old man before the cut sleet fetter like a criminal hand behind back rope-wound stiff strain at the burden of the slow and sullen sled on a sudden he stop straighten he back and remonstrate with the colonel in unprintable term for put off the halt later than ever they have yet after such a day can not make fire with green cotton-wood be the colonel 's rejoiner then let 's stop and rest anyhow nuh we know where that would land we man who stop to rest go to sleep in the snow and man who go to sleep in the snow on empty stomach do not wake up they push on another mile when the colonel at last call the halt the boy sink down on the sled too exhaust to speak but it have grow to be a practice with they not to trust themselves to talk at this hour the colonel would give the signal to stop simply by cease to push the sled that the boy be wearily drag the boy have invariably be feeling -lrb- just as the colonel have before during he shift in front -rrb- that the man behind be not help all he might whereupon follow a vague consciously unreasonable but wholly irresistible rage against the partner of he toil but however much the man at the back be suppose to spare himself the man in front have never yet fail to know when the impetus from behind be really remove the boy sit now on the sled silent motionless while the colonel fell and chop and bring the wood then the boy drag himself up make the fire and the beef-tea but still no word even after that revive cup -- the usual signal for a few remark and more social relation to be establish tonight no sound out of either the colonel change he footgear and the melted snow in the pot begin to boil noisily but the boy who have again betaken himself to the sled do not budge no man who really know the trail would have dare under the circumstance to remind he pardner that it be now he business to get up and fry the bacon but presently without look up the hungry colonel venture : get you dry thing foot be not wet do not talk foolishness here be you thing the colonel fling in the boy 's direction the usual change two pair of heavy sock the german knit and the feel not wet repeat the boy you know you be could go through water in these muckluck i be not say the wet have come in from outside but you know as well as i do a man sweat like a horse on the trail still the boy sit there with he head sink between he shoulder first rule o ' this country be to keep you foot dry or else pneumonia rheumatism -- god know what first rule o ' this country be mind you own business or else -- god know what the colonel look at the boy a moment and then turn he back the boy glance up conscience-stricken but still only half alive dull by the weight of a crush weariness the colonel presently bent over the fire and be about to lift off the turbulently boil pot the boy spring to he foot ready to shout you do you work and keep you hand off mine but the colonel turn just in time to say with unusual gentleness : if you _ like _ i 'll make supper to-night and the boy catch he breath run forward sway a little half blind but with a different look in he tired eye no no old man it be not as bad as that and again it be two friend who sleep side by side in the snow the next morning the colonel who have be keep awake half the night by what he have be think be neuralgia in he eye wake late hearing the boy calling : i say kentucky be not you _ ever _ goin ' to get up get up say the colonel why should i when it be pitch-dark _ what _ fire clean out eh but he smell the tea and bacon and sit up bewildered with a hand over he smart eye the boy go over and kneel down by he look at he curiously guess you be a little snow-blind colonel but it will not last you know blind no no only _ snow _ - blind big difference and he take out he rag of a handkerchief get some water in a tin cup and the eye be bath and bandage it will not last you know you 'll just have to take it easy for a few day the colonel groan for the first time he seem to lose heart he sit during breakfast with bandaged eye and a droop of the shoulder that seem to say old age have come upon he in a single night the day that follow be pretty dark to both man the boy have to do all the work except the monotonous blind push from behind in whatever direction the boy drag the sled now snow-blindness be not usually dangerous but it be horribly painful while it last you eye swell up and be stab continually by cut pain you head seem full of acute neuralgia and often there be fever and other complication the colonel 's be a bad case but he be a giant for strength and sound as a dollar as the boy remind he except for this little bother with you eye and you be a whole heap better already at a very slow rate they plod along they have get into a region where there be no timber but as they could not camp without a fire they take a extra rest that day at four o'clock and regale themselves on some cold grub then they take up the line of march again but they have be go only about half a hour when the colonel suddenly without warn stop push the sled and stand stock-still on the trail the boy feel the removal of the pressure look round go back to he and find nothing in particular be the matter but he just think he would not go any further we can camp here no we can not say the boy there be not a tree in sight but the colonel seem daze he think he would stop anyhow -- right where he be oh no say the boy a little frightened we 'll camp the minute we come to wood but the colonel stand as if root the boy take he arm and lead he on a few pace to the sled you need not push hard you know just keep you hand there so without look you 'll know where i be go this be very subtle of the boy for he know the colonel be blind as a bat and as sensitive as a woman we 'll get through all right yet he call back as he stoop to take up the sledrope i bet on kentucky like a man walk in he sleep the colonel follow now hold on to the sled and unconsciously pull a little and when the boy very nearly on he last leg remonstrate lean against it and so urge it a little forward oh but the wood be far to seek that night concentrate on the two main thing -- to carry forward he almost intolerable load and to go the shortest way to the nearest wood -- the boy by-and-by forget to tell he tired nerve to take account of the unequal pressure from behind if he feel it -- well the colonel be a corker if he do not feel it -- well the colonel be just about tucker out it be very late when at last the boy raise a shout behind the cliff overhang the river-bed that they be just round there spread out in the sparkling starlight as far as he could see a vast primeval forest the boy better he lagging pace ha you have not see a wood like this since we leave ` frisco it be all right now kentucky and he bent to he work with a will when he get to the edge of the wood he fling down the rope and turn -- to find himself alone colonel colonel where be you _ colonel _ he stand in the silence shiver with a sudden sense of desolation he take he bearing prop a fall fir sapling aslant by the sled and forget he be ready to drop he run swiftly hack along the way he come they have travel all that afternoon and evening on the river ice hard as iron retain no trace of footprint or of runner possible to verify even in daylight the yukon here be fully three mile wide they have mean to hug the right bank but snow and ice refashion the world and laugh at the trustful geography of man a traveller on this trail be not always sure whether he be follow the mighty yukon or some slough equally mighty for a few mile or whether in the protracted twilight he have not wander off upon some frozen swamp on the boy go in the ghostly starlight run stumble call at regular interval he voice fall into a melancholy monotony that sound foreign to himself it occur to he that be he the colonel he would not recognize it and he begin instead to call kentucky ken-tuck-kee sound those fine barbaric syllable for the first time most like in that world of ice and silence he stand a instant after he voice die and listen to the quiet yes the people be right who say nothing be so hard to bear in this country of hardship -- nothing end by be so ghastly -- as the silence no bird stir the swift-flashing fish be seal under ice the wood creature go to they underground sleep no whispering of the pointed fir stiff snowclott no swaying of the scant herbage sheathe in ice or muffle under winter 's wide white blanket no greater hush can reign in the interstellar space than in winter on the yukon colonel silence -- like a negation of all puny thing friendship human life -- colonel silence no wonder man go mad up here when they do not drown this silence in strong drink on and on he run till he feel sure he must have pass the colonel unless -- yes there be those air-hole in the river ice he feel choke and stop to breathe should he go back it be horrible to turn it be like admit that the man be not to be find -- that this be the end colonel he say to himself that he would go back and build a fire for a signal and return but he run on farther and farther away from the sled and from the forest be it grow faintly light he look up oh yes presently it would be brighter still those streamer of pale light dancing in the north they would be green and scarlet and orange and purple and the terrible white world would be illumine as by conflagration he stop again that the colonel should have drop so far back as this and the man in front not know -- it be incredible what be that a shadow on the ice a frozen hummock no a man be it really glory hallelujah -- it _ be _ but the shadow lay there ghastly still and the boy 's greet die in he throat he have find the colonel but he have find he deliver over to that treacherous sleep that seldom know a wake the boy drop down beside he friend and be not far off cry but it be a tonic to young nerve to see how like one dead the man lay there for all the call and tug by the arm the boy roll the body over pull open the thing at the neck and thrust he hand down till he could feel the heart beating he jump up get a handful of snow and rub the man 's face with it at last a feeble protest -- a effort to get away from the boy 's rude succor thank god colonel colonel wake up he shake he hard but the big man only growl sullenly and let he leaden weight drop back heavily on the ice the boy get hold of the neck of the colonel 's parkus and pull he frantically along the ice a few yard and then realize that only the terror of the moment give he the strength to do that much to drag a man of the colonel 's weight all the way to the wood be stark impossibility he could not get he eighty yard if he leave he and go for the sled and fuel the man would be dead by the time he get back if he stay they would both be freeze in a few hour it be pretty horrible he feel faint and dizzy it occur to he that he would pray he be a agnostic all right but the colonel be past pray for himself and here be he friend -- a agnostic -- here he be on he knee he have not pray since he be a little chap down in the south how do the prayer go we father -- he look up at the redden aurora -- we father who art in heaven -- he eye fall again on he friend he leap to he foot like a wild animal and begin to go at the colonel with he fist the blow rain thick on the chest of the prostrate man but he be too well protect to feel more than the shock but now they come batter down under the ear -- right leave as the man turn blindly to avoid they -- on the jaw even on the suffering eye and that at last sting the sleeper into something like consciousness he struggle to he foot with a roar like a wounded bull lunge heavily forward as the boy elude he and he would have pound the young fellow out of existence in no time have he stand he ground that be exactly what the boy do not mean to do -- he be always just a little way on in front but as the colonel 's half-insane rage cool and he slow down a bit the boy be at he again like some imp of satan sound and lithe and quick-handed as he be he be no match for the colonel at he best but the colonel could not see well and he brain be on fire he would kill that young devil and then he would lie down and sleep again meanwhile aurora mount the high heaven from a great corona in the zenith all the sky be hang with banner and the snow be stain as if with blood the boy look over he shoulder and see the huge figure of he friend bear down upon he with he discolor face rage-distorted and murder in he tortured eye a moment 's sense of the monstrous spectacle fall so poignant upon the boy that he feel dimly he must have be full half he life run this race with death follow by a maniac bent on murder in a world whose winter be strangely light with the leap fire of hell at last on there in front the cliff below it the sharp bend in the river and although he could not see it yet behind the cliff the forest and a little hand-sled bear the means of life the colonel be down again but it be not safe to go near he just yet the boy run on unpacked the sled and go axe in hand along the margin of the wood never before be a fire make so quickly then with the flask back to the colonel almost as sound asleep as before the boy never could recall much about the hour that follow there be nobody to help so it must have be he who somehow get the colonel to the fire get he to swallow some food plaster he wounded face over with the carbolic ointment and get he into bed for in the morning all this be see to have be do they stay in camp that day to rest up and the boy shoot a rabbit the colonel be come round the rest or the ointment or the tea-leaf poultice have be good for snowblindness the generous reserve of strength in he magnificent physique be quick to announce itself he be still frightfully bung up but i think we 'll push on to-morrow he say that night as he sit by the fire smoking before turn in right you be say the boy who be mend the sled-runner neither have refer to that encounter on the river-ice that have end in bring the colonel where there be succor nothing be say then or for long after in the way of deliberate recognition that the boy have save he life it be not necessary they understand each other but in the evening after the boy have finish mend the sled it occur to he he must also mend the colonel before they go to bed he get out the box of ointment and bespread the strip of tear handkerchief do not know as i need that to-night say the colonel mu not waste ointment but the boy bring the bandage round to the colonel 's side of the fire for a instant they look at each other by the flickering light and the colonel lay he hand on the boy 's arm he eye look worse for the moment and begin to water he turn away brusquely and knock the ash out of he pipe on a log what in hell make you think of it ask I a easy one say the boy but i know what the jesuit father would say jesuit and george warren humph precious little we would agree about you would about this it flash over I when i look back and see you peltin ' after I small wonder i make for you i be not findin ' fault but what on earth put it into you head to go at I with you fist like that you 'll never prove it by I but when i saw you comin ' at I like a mad bull i think to myself think i the colonel and the jesuit they would both of 'em say this be a direct answer to prayer chapter xiii the pit l'humanit a commenc tout entire par le crime c ' tait le vieux nourricier des hommes des cavernes -- anatole france a old story now these day of silent plod through the drive snow but if outward condition lack variety not so they cumulative effect upon poor human nature a change be go on in the traveller that will little commend they to the sentimentalist i have come to think a snow-storm 's all right to travel in all right to sleep in say the colonel one morning but to cook in eat in make or break camp in -- it be the devil 's champion invention for three day they have work like galley-slave and yet cover less than ten mile a day and you never get rest the colonel go on i get up as tired as i go to bed again the boy only nod he body if not he temper have get break into the trail but for a talkative person he have in these day strangely little to say it become manifest that in the long run the colonel would suffer the most physically but he young companion have less patience and more ambition more sheer untame vitality in he would suffer the most in spirit every sense in he be become numbed save the gnawing in he stomach and that other even more acute ache queer compound of fatigue and anger these two sensation swallow up all else and seem to grow by what they feed on the loaded sled be a nightmare it weigh a thousand ton the very first afternoon out from anvik when in the desperate haul and tug that rescue it from a bottomless snow-drift the lash slip the load loosen tumble off and roll open the colonel stand quite still and swear till he half-frozen blood circulate freely again when it come to repack he consider in detail the item that make up the intolerable weight and fall to wonder which of they they could do without the second day out from anvik they have decide that it be absurd after all to lug about so much tinware they leave a little saucepan and the extra kettle at that camp the idea so potent at anvik of have a tea-kettle in reserve -- well the notion lose weight and the kettle seem to gain two pair of boot and some flannel mark the next stopping-place on the follow day when the boy 's rifle keep slip and make a brake to hold back the sled i reckon you 'll have to plant that rifle o ' yours in the next big drift say the colonel one 's all we need anyway one 's all you need and one 's all i need answer the boy stiffly but it be not easy to see immediate need for either never be country so bare of game they think not consider how little they hunt and how more and more every faculty every sense be absorb in the bare go forward the next time the colonel say something about the uselessness of carry two gun the boy flare up : if you object to gun leave yours this be a new tone for the boy to use to the colonel do not you think we would better hold on to the best one now the boy could not deny that the colonel 's be the better but none the less he have a great affection for he own old 44 marlin and the colonel should not assume that he have the right to dictate this attitude of the wise elder seem out of place on the trail a gun 's a necessity i have not bring along any whim-wham who have well it be not I that go loadin ' up at anvik with fool thermometer and thing thermometer why it do not weigh -- weigh something and it be something to pack frozen half the time too and when it be not what be the good of havin ' it hammer into we how near we be to freezin ' to death but it annoy he to think how very little in argument a thermometer weigh against a rifle they say no more that day about lighten the load but with a double motive they make enormous inroad upon they provision a morning come when the colonel packing hurriedly in the bite cold forget to shove he pardner 's gun into its accustomed place the boy return from trail-breaking to the river kick at the butt to draw attention to the omission the colonel fling down the end of the ice-coated rope he have lash the load with and pack it yourself say he the boy let the rifle lie but all day long he feel the loss of it heavy on he heart and no reconcile lightness in the sled the colonel begin to have qualm about the double ration they be use it be only the seventeenth night after turn they back on the big chimney as the colonel tip the pan pour out half the boil bean into he pardner 's plate that be the last o ' the strawberry do not go expectin ' any more say he what ejaculate the boy aghast then quickly to keep a good face : you take my life when you do take the bean whereby i live when the colonel have dispose of he strawberry lord he sigh try to rub the stiffness out of he hand over the smoke the appetite a fellum can raise up here be something terrible you eat and eat and it do not seem to make any impression you be just as hungry as ever _ and the stuff a fellum can eat _ the colonel recall that speech of the boy 's the very next night when after a hell of a time get the fire alight he be bend forward in that attitude most try to maintain hold the frying-pan at long range over the feebly-smoking stick he have to cook to live on snow-shoe nowadays for the heavy colonel have illustrate oftener than the boy that go without mean breaking in flounder and finally have to call for you pardner to haul you out this be one of the many use of a pardner on the trail the last time the colonel have trust to the treacherous crust he have go in head foremost and the boy happen to look round saw only two snow-shoe bottom side up move spasmodically on the surface of the drift the colonel be nearly suffocate by the time he be pull out and after that object-lesson he stick to snow-shoe every hour of the twenty-four except those spend in the sleeping-bag but few thing on earth be more exasperating than try to work mount on clumsy long web-foot that keep jarring against yet hold you off from the tree you be fell or the fire you be cook over you be constrain to stand wholly out of natural relation to the thing you be try to do -- the thing you have get to do if you mean to come out alive the colonel have be through all this time and time again but as he squat on he heel to-night cursing the foot and a half of snow-shoe that hold he away from the sullen fire strain every muscle to keep the outstretched frying-pan over the best of the blaze he say to himself that what have get he on the raw be that speech of the boy 's yesterday about the stuff he have to eat if the boy object to have he rice parboil in smoked water he be damned unreasonable that be all the culprit reappear at the edge of the darkening wood he come up eagerly and fling down a armful of fuel for the morning hope to find supper ready since it be not he know that he must not stand about and watch the preparation by this time he have learn a good deal of the trail-man 's unwritten law on no account must you hint that the cook be incompetent or even slow any more than he may find fault with you moment for call halt or with you choice of timber so the woodman turn wearily away from the sole spot of brightness in the waste and go back up the hill in the dark and the cold to busy himself about he own work even to spin it out if necessary till he should hear the gruff grub 's ready and when that dinner-gong sound do not you dally do not you wait a second you may feel uncomfortable if you find yourself twenty minute late for a dinner in london or new york but to be five minute late for dinner on the winter trail be to lay up lasting trouble by the time the rice and bacon be do and the flap-jack still raw in the middle be burnt to charcoal on both side the colonel 's eye be smart in the acrid smoke and the tear be run down he cheek grub 's ready the boy come up and drop on he heel in the usual attitude the colonel tear a piece off the half-charred half-raw pancake maybe you 'll think the fire be not thoroughly distribute but _ that be _ get to do for bread he remark severely as if in reply to some objection the boy see that something he have say or look have be misinterpret hey too much fire outside and not enough in well sir i 'll trust _ my _ stomach to strike a balance guess the heat 'll get distribute all right once i have swallow it when the colonel mollify say something about cinder in the rice the boy with he mouth full of grit answer : i be pretendin ' it be sugar not since the episode of the abandon rifle have he show himself so genial never in all my bohn life say the colonel after eat steadily for some time -- never in a year sah have i think as much about food as i do in a day on this -- trail same here and it be quantity not quality ditto the boy turn he head sharply away from the fire hear that no need to ask the colonel have rise upright on he cramped leg red eye start out of he head the boy get up turn about in the direction of the hollow sound and make one step away from the fire you stay right where you be order the colonel quite in the old way hey that be a bird-song thought so mr wolf smell the cookin ' want 's the rest of the pack to know there be something queer up here on the hill then as the boy move to one side in the dark : what you lookin ' for my gun mine 's here oh yes he own old 44 marlin be lie far down the river under eight-and-fifty hour of snow it anger he newly and more than ever to remember that if he have a shot at anything now it must need be by favor of the colonel they listen for that sound again the first since leave anvik not make by themselves seem a lot quieter than it do observe the colonel by-and-bye the boy nod without preface the colonel observe : it be five day since i wash my face and hand what be the good o ' rememberin ' return the boy sharply then more mildly : people talk about the bare necessaries o ' life well sir when they be really bare you find there be not but three -- food warmth sleep again in the distance that hollow bay food warmth sleep repeat the colonel we have about get down to the wolf basis he say it half in defiance of the trail 's fierce lessoning but it be truer than he know they build up the fire to frighten off the wolf but the colonel have he rifle along when they go over and crawl into they sleeping-bag half in half out he lay the gun carefully along the right on he snow-shoe as the boy button the fur-lined flap down over they head he feel angrier with the colonel than he have ever be before take good care to hang on to he own shootin ' - iron suppose anything should happen and he say it over and over exactly what could happen he do not make clear the real danger be not from wolf but it be _ something _ and he would need a rifle and he would not have one and it be the colonel 's fault \* \* \* \* \* now it have long be understand that the woodman be lord of the wood when it come to the colonel 's give unasked advice about the lumber business the boy turn a deaf ear and think well of himself for not openly resent the interference the colonel talk a awful lot anyway he have more hot air to offer than muscle when they sight timber that commend itself to the woodman if _ he _ think well of it why he just drop the sled-rope without a word pull the axe out of the lash trudge up the hillside hold the axe against he shirt underneath he parkus till he reach whatever tree he eye have mark for he own off with the fur mitt and bare hand protect by the inner mitt of wool he would feel the axe-head for there be always the danger of use it so cold that the steel would chip and fly as soon as he could be sure the proper molecular change have be effect he would take up he awkward attitude before the select spruce lean far forward on he snow-shoe and seem to deliver the blow on tip-toe but the real trouble come when after fell the dead tree splitting a armful of fuel and carry it to the colonel he return to the task of cut down the tough green spruce for they bedding many strained blow must be deliver before he could effect the chop of even a little notch then he would shift he position and cut a corresponding notch further round so make painful circuit of the bole to-night what with be hold off by he snow-shoe what with utter weariness and a dull axe he growl to himself that he be only gnawin ' a ring round the tree like a beaver damn the whole -- wait perhaps the cursed snow be pack enough now to bear he slip off the web-foot and standing gingerly but blessedly near make effectual attack hooray one more good ` un and the thing be down hah ugh woof-ff the tree be down but so be he flounder breast high and at every effort to get out only break down more of the crust and sink deeper this be not the first time such a thing have happen why do he feel as if it be for he the end of the world he lay still a instant it would be happiness just to rest here and go to sleep the colonel oh well the colonel have take he rifle funny there should be orange-tree up here he could smell they he shut he eye something shine red and glowing why that be the sun make a effect of stain glass as it shine through the fat pine weather-boarding of he little bedroom on the old place down in florida suddenly a face _ ah that face _ he must be up and do he know perfectly well how to get out of this damn hole you lie on you side and roll gradually you pack the softness tight till it bear -- not if you stand up on you foot but bear the length of you body while you worm you way obliquely to the top and feel gingerly in the dimness after you snow-shoe but if it happen on a pitch-dark night and you pardner have choose camp out of earshot you feel that you have look close at the end of the long trail on get back to the fire he find the colonel annoy at have call grub three time -- yes sah three time sah and they eat in silence now i be go to bed say the boy rise stiffly you just wait a minute no now the colonel himself have enunciate the law that whenever one of they be ready to sleep the other must come too he do not know it but it be one of the iron rule of the winter trail in absence of its enforcement the later comer bring into the warm up sleeping-bag not only the chill of he own body he let in the bitter wind and bring along whatever snow and ice be cling to he boot and clothes the melting and warming-up be all to be do again but the colonel be angry most unreasonable he mutter -- damned unreasonable worse than the ice and the wet in the sleeping-bag be this lie in such close proximity to a young jackanapes who would not come when you call grub and would not wait a second till you would feel about in the dimness for you gun hideous to lie so close to a man who snore and who have deprive you of you 44 marlin although it mean life the boy grudge the mere animal heat that he give and that he take full of grudging he drop asleep but the wake spirit follow he into he dream a ugly picture paint itself upon the dark and struggle against the vision he half awake with the first return consciousness come the oppression of the yoke the impulse to match the mental alienation with that of the body -- strong need to move away you can not move away in a sleeping-bag in a city you may be alone free on the trail you walk in bond with you yoke-fellow make you bed with he with he rise up and with he face the lash the livelong day \* \* \* \* \* well sigh the colonel after toiling onward for a couple of hour the next morning this be the worst yet but by the middle of the afternoon what do i say why this morning -- _ everything _ up till now have be child 's play he keep look at the boy to see if he could read any sign of halt in the tense scar face certainly the wind be worse the go be worse the sled keep break through and sink to the level of the load there it go in again they tug and haul and only drag the lash loose while the sled seem solder to the hard-packed middle of the drift as they reload the thermometer come to light the colonel throw it out with never a word they have no clothes now but what they stand in and only one thing on the sled they could have live without -- they money a packet of trading store but they have throw away more than they know day by day not flannel and boot alone not merely extra kettle thermometer and gun go overboard but some grace of courtesy some decency of life have be leave behind about three o'clock of this same day dim with snow and dizzy in a hurricane of wind we can not go on like this say the boy suddenly wish i know the way we _ could _ go on return the colonel stop with a air of utter helplessness and force he rigid hand into he pocket the boy look at he the man of dignity and resource who have be the boss of the big chimney camp -- what have become of he here be only a big slouch creature with ragged beard smoke-blackened countenance and eye that weep continually come on say he equally ruffianly-looking pardner we 'll both go ahead so they abandon they sled for awhile and when they have forge a way come back and one pull the other push lifting guide between they with infinite pain they get they burden to the end of the beaten track leave it and go ahead again -- travel three mile to make one what be the matter now the boy be too tired to turn he head round and look back but he know that the other man be not do he share he remember that other time when the colonel have fall behind it seem year ago and even further away be the vague recollection of how he would care how horribly frighten he would be be not he frighten now no it be only a dull curiosity that turn he round at last to see what it be that make the colonel peg out this time he be always peggin ' out yes there he be stoppin ' to stroke himself trail-man a old woman fit only for the chimney-corner and even when they go on again he keep say to himself as he bent to the galling strain a old woman -- just a old woman till he make a refrain of the word and in the level place march to the tune after that whatever else he vague thought go off upon it come back to a old woman -- just a old woman it be at a bad place towards the end of that force march that the colonel instead of lift the back of the sled bear hard on the handle-bar with a vicious sound it snap the boy turn heavily at the noise when he see the colonel standing daze with the splintered bar in he hand he dull eye flash with sudden vigor he run back to see the extent of the damage well it be pretty discouragin ' say the colonel very low the boy grit he tooth with suppress rage it be only a chance that it have not happen when he himself be behind but he could not see that no it be the colonel 's bungling -- tryin ' to spare himself leanin ' on the bar instead o ' liftin ' the sled as he the boy would have do with stiff hand they try to improvise a makeshift with a stick of birch and some string do not know what you think say the colonel presently but i call this a desperate business we have undertake the boy do not trust himself to call it anything with a bungle job they go lamely on the loose snow be whirling about so it be impossible to say whether it be still fall or only hurricane-driven to the colonel 's great indignation it be later than usual before they camp not a word be speak by either till they have finish they first meal and the colonel have melt a frying-pan full of snow preparatory to the second he take up the rice-bag hold it by the top and run he mittened hand down the gather sack till he have outline the contents at the bottom lord that be all there be the boy only blink he half-shut eye the change in he from talkativeness to utter silence have grow horribly oppressive to the colonel he often feel he would like to shake he till he shake some word out i tell you day ago he go on that we ought to go on ration silence but no you know so much better the boy shut he eye and suddenly like one struggle against sleep or swoon he rouse himself i think i know the more we take off the damn sled the lighter it would be ` tis not so and we do not either of we think we would come down from eighteen mile a day to six return the colonel a little mollify by any sort of answer i do not believe we be go to put this job through now this be treason any trail-man may think that twenty time a day but no one ought to say it the boy set he tooth and he eye close the whole thing be suddenly harder -- doubt of the issue have be bear into the world but he open he eye again the colonel have carefully pour some of the rice into the smoky water of the pan what be the fool do such a little left and make a second supper only that morning the boy have go a long way when mentally he call the boss of the big chimney camp a old woman by night he be say in he heart the colonel 's a fool he pardner catch the look that match the thought no more second helpin 's he say in self-defence this 'll freeze into cake for luncheon no answer no imply apology for that look in the tone he pardner have come to dread the colonel begin : if we do not strike a settlement to-morrow -- do not _ talk _ the boy 's tired arm fall on the handle of the frying-pan over it go -- rice water and all in the fire the culprit spring up speechless with dismay enrage at the loss of the food he be hungry for -- enrage at the fool fry-pan -- enrage at the fool colonel for balance it so badly a column of steam and smoke rise into the frosty air between the two man as it clear away a little the boy could see the colonel 's bloodshot eye the expression be ill to meet when they crouch down again with the damped-out fire between they a sense of utter loneliness fall upon each man 's heart \* \* \* \* \* the next morning when they come to digging the sled out of the last night 's snow-drift the boy find to he horror that he be weaker -- yes a good deal as they go on he keep stumble the colonel fall every now and then sometimes he would lie still before he could pull himself on he leg again in these hour they see nothing of the grim and splendid waste nothing of the rank of snow-laden tree nothing of sun course or of star only the half-yard of dazzling trail in front of they and -- clairvoyant -- the little store of flour and bacon that seem to shrink in the pack while they drag it on apart from partial snow-blindness which fall at interval upon the colonel the tiredness of the eye be like a special sickness upon they both for many hour together they never raise they lid look out through slit cat-like on the world they have not speak to each other for many day -- or be it only hour -- when the colonel look at the boy say : you have get to have a face-guard those frostbite be eat in ` xpect so you ought to stop it make a guard out of a snow-ball or chunk o ' ice cut a piece out o ' the canvas o ' the bag but he do not the big sore seem such small matter beside the vast overshadow doubt shall we come out of this alive -- doubt never to be openly admit by he but always knock knock -- you can not see you own face the colonel persist one piece o ' luck anyhow the old habit of look after the boy die hard the colonel hesitate for the last time he would remonstrate i use to think frost_bite _ be a figure o ' speech say he but the tooth be set in _ you _ face sonny and they have bite deep they 'll leave awful scar battle do i b ` lieve and it be with a effort that he remember there have be a time when they have be uncomfortable because they have not wash they face now one man be content to let the very skin go if he could keep the flesh on he face and one be little concerned even for that life -- life to push on and come out alive the colonel have come to that point where he resent the boy 's stay power terrify at the indomitable young life in he yes the colonel begin to feel old and to think with vague wrath of the insolence of youth each man fall to consider what he would do how he would manage if he be alone and there cease to be any terror in the think if it be not for he -- so and so till in the gradual deadening of judgment all the hardship be somehow you pardner 's fault you nerve make he responsible even for the snow and the wind by-and-by he be the enemy not but what each have occasional moment of lucidity and draw back from the pit they be bend over but the realisation would fade no longer do even the wiser of the two remember that this be that same abyss out of which slowly painfully the race have climb with the lessen power to keep from fall in the terror of it lessen many strange thing grow natural it be no longer difficult or even shocking to conceive one 's partner give out and fall by the way although play about the think the one thing that not even the colonel be able actually to realize be the imminent probability of death for himself imagination always picture the other fellow down one 's self somehow forge ahead this obsession end on the late afternoon when the colonel break silence by say suddenly : we must camp i be do he fling himself down under a bare birch and hide he face the boy remonstrate grow angry then with a huge effort at self-control point out that since it have stop snow this be the very moment to go on why you can see the sun three of 'em look colonel but arctic meteorological phenomenon have long since cease to interest the kentuckian parhelium be less to he than cover eye and the perilous peace of the snow it seem a long time before he sit up and begin to beat the stiffness out of he hand against he breast but when he speak it be only to say : i mean to camp for how long till a team come by -- or something the boy get up abruptly slip on he snow-shoe and go round the shoulder of the hill and up on to the promontory to get out of earshot of that voice and determine which of the two ice-road stretch out before they be main channel and which be tributary he find on the height only a cut wind and little enlightenment as to the true course north and east all nimbus still a brace of sun-dog follow the pale god of day across the narrow field of primrose that border the dun-coloured west there would be more snow to-morrow and meanwhile the wind be rise again yes sir it be a mean outlook as he take mac 's aneroid barometer out of he pocket a sudden gust cut across he raw and bleeding cheek he turn abruptly the barometer slip out of he numb finger he make a lunge to recover it clutch the air and slide suddenly forward over he go fly headlong down the steep escarpment he strike a jut rock only half snow under that break the sheer face of the promontory and he bound once like a rubber ball strike a second time catch desperately at a solitary clump of ice-sheathed alder crash through the snow-crust just below they and be hold there like a mudlark in its cliff nest halfway between bluff and river he last clear thought have be a intense anxiety about he snow-shoe as they sail away two liberated kite but as he go on fall clutch at the air -- fall -- and feel the alder twig snap under he hand he say to himself this be death but calmly as if it be a small matter compare to lose one 's snow-shoe it be only when he land in the snow that he be conscious of any of the suppose natural excitement of a man meet a violent end it be then before he even get he breath back that he begin to struggle frantically to get a foothold but he only break down more of the thin ice-wall that keep he from the sheer drop to the river sixty or seventy foot below he lay quite still would the colonel come after he if he do come would he risk he life to -- if he do risk he life be it any use to try to -- he crane he neck and look up blink shut he eye and lay back in the snow with a sound of far-off singing in he head any use no sir it just about be not that bluff face would be easier to climb up than to climb down and either be impossible then it be that a great tide of longing sweep over he -- a flood of passionate desire for more of this doubtful blessing life all the bitter hardship -- why how sweet it be after all to battle and to overcome it be only this lie helpless trap that be evil the endless trail why it be only the come to the end that a man mind suddenly the beauty that for day have be veil shine out nothing in all the earth be glorious with the glory of the terrible white north and he have only just be waken to it here now lie in he grave have come this special revelation of the rapture of living and the splendor of the visible universe the sky over he head -- he have call it a mean outlook and turn away it be the same sky that bent over he now with a tenderness that make he lift he cramped arm with tear as a sick child might to its mother the haloed sun with he attendant dog -- how little the wonder have touch he never have he see they so dim and sad as to-night say good-bye to one who love the sun the great frozen road out of sight below road that come wind wind down out of the arctic circle -- what other highway so majestic mysterious -- shine and beckon on a earthly milky way lead to the golden paradise he have be travel towards since summer and he be to go no further -- not till the June rain and thaw and wind and flood should carry he back as he have foresee far below there at holy cross with a sharp contraction of the heart he shut he eye again when he open they they rest on the alder-twig a couple of yard above hold out mock finger-tip and he turn he head in the snow till again he could see the mock-sun look down as well try to reach the sky as reach the alder-bush what do that mean that he be really go to lie there till he die _ he _ die and the colonel and everybody else go on live he half rise on he elbow at the monstrous absurdity of the idea i will not die he say out loud crack crack warn the ice-crust between he and that long fall to the river with horror at he heart he shrink away and hug the face of the precipice presently he put out he hand and break the ice-crust above with mittened fist and palm he pound firm a little ledge of snow reach out further he break the crust obliquely just above and have pack the snow as well as he could immediately about and move lengthwise with a infinite caution he crawl up the few inch to the narrow ledge balance he stiff body with a nicety possible only to acrobat or sleep-walker it be in no normal state of ordinary wake sens that the work go on -- with never a downward look nor even up eye rivet to the patch of snow on which the mittened hand fall as steady and untrembling as steel hammer in the seconds of actual consciousness of he situation that twice visit he he crouch on the ledge with closed eye in the clutch of a overmastering horror absolutely still like a bird in the talon of a hawk each time when he open he eye he would stare at the snow-ledge till hypnotise into disregard of danger balance he slight body lift one hand and go on pound firm another shallow step when he reach the alder-bush he heart give a great leap of triumph then for the first time since start he look up he heart fall down it seem farther than ever and the light wane but the twilight would be long he tell himself and in that other beneficent inner twilight he work on pack the snow and crawl gingerly up the perilous stair a half-inch at a time at last he be on the jut rock and could stand secure but here he could see that the top of the bluff really do shelve over to think so be so common a illusion to the climber that the boy have hearten himself by say when he get there he would find it like the rest horribly steep but not impossible well it _ be _ impossible after all he labor he be no better off on the rock than in the snow-hole below the alder down there where he dare not look the sun and he dog have travel down down they touch the horizon while he sit there they slip below the world 's wide rim he say in he heart i be freezing to death unexpectedly to himself he despair find voice : colonel hello he start violently have he really hear that or be imagination playing trick with echo colonel where the devil -- a man 's head appear out of the sky get the rope word indistinguishable float down -- the head withdraw -- silence the boy wait a very long time but he stamp he foot and keep he blood in motion the light be very gray when the head show again at the sky-line he could not hear what be shout down and it occur to he even in he huge predicament that the colonel be give he hot air as usual instead of a life-line down the rope come nearer and stop about fifteen foot over he head get the axe let she down \* \* \* \* \* the night be bright with moonlight when the boy stand again on the top of the bluff humph say the colonel with agreeable anticipation you 'll be glad to camp for a few day after this i reckon reckon i will not \* \* \* \* \* in they colossal fatigue they sleep the clock round they watch run down they sense of the very date blur since the colonel have make the last laconic entry in the journal -- be it three day or two -- or twenty in spite of a sensation as of many broken bone the boy put on the colonel 's snow-shoe and go off look along the foot of the cliff for he own no luck but he bring back some birch-bark and a handful of willow-withe and set about make a rude substitute before they have despatch breakfast the great red moon arise so it be not morning but evening so much the better the crust would be firmer the moon be full it be bright enough to travel and travel they must no say the colonel with a touch of he old pompous authority we 'll wait awhile the boy simply point to the flour-bag there be not a good handful leave they eat supper studiously avoid each other 's eye in the background of the boy 's mind : he save my life but he run no risk and i save he we be quit in the colonel 's vague insistent stir the thought i might have leave he there to rot half-way up the precipice oh he would go _ and he would take the sled _ no he vanish strength flow back upon a tide of rage only one sleeping-bag one kettle one axe one pair of snow-shoe _ one gun _ no by the living lord not while i have a gun where 's my gun he look about guiltily under he lowered lid what no yes it be go who pack at the last camp why he -- himself and he would leave it behind then it be because i do not see it the boy take care i should not see it very likely he bury it so that i should not see it he -- yes -- if i refuse to go on he -- and the boy see without look take in every move every shade in the mood of the broken-spirited man ready to die here like a dog in the snow instead of press on as long as he could crawl -- the boy in a fever of silent rage call he that meanest word in the language -- a quitter and as surreptitiously he take in the vast discouragement of the older man there be nothing in the boy 's changed heart to say poor fellow if he can not go on i 'll stay and die with he but only he be _ get _ to go on and if he refuse well -- he feel about in he deaden brain and the best he could bring forth be : i will not leave he -- _ yet _ \* \* \* \* \* a mighty river-jam have force they up on the low range of hill it be about midnight to judge by the moon -- clear of snow and the wind down the boy straighten up at a curious sight just below they something black in the moonlight the colonel pause look down and pass he hand over he eye the boy have see the thing first and have say to himself look like a sled but it be a vision it be come to see thing now when he see the colonel stop and stare he throw down he rope and begin to laugh for there below be the blacken remains of a big fire silhouette sharply on the snow look like we have come to a camp boss he have not call the colonel by the old nickname for many a day he stand there laugh in a idiotic kind of way wrap he stiff hand in he parkus indian fashion and look down to the level of the ancient river terrace where the weather-stained old indian sled be sharply etch on the moonlit whiteness just a sled lie in the moonlight but the change that can be work in a man 's heart upon sight of a human sign it may be idle to speak of that to any but those who have travel the desolate way of the north side by side the two go down the slope slide and slip and could not stop themselves till they be below the landmark look up they see that a piece of soil canvas or a skin hold down with a drift-log fall from under the sled portire-wise from the top of the terrace straight down to the sheltered level where the camp fire have be come closer they see the curtain be not canvas but dress deerskin indian say the colonel but with the rub out of other distinction this too be curiously faint just so there be human being it seem enough within four foot of the deerskin door the colonel stop shoot through by a sharp misgiving what be behind a living man 's camp or a dead man 's tomb succor or some stark picture of defeat and of they own oncoming doom the colonel stand stock-still wait for the boy for the first time in many day even he hang back he seem to lack the courage to be the one to extinguish hope by the mere drawing of a curtain from a snow-drift 's face the kentuckian pull himself together and go forward he lift he hand to the deerskin but he finger shake so he could not take hold : hello he call no sound again : hello who be there the two outside turn and look into each other 's face -- but if you want to know all the moment mean you must travel the winter trail chapter xiv kurillum and i swear to you athenian -- by the dog i swear -- for i must tell you the truth ------ socrate the voice that have ask the question belong to one of two stranded klondyker as it turn out who have burrow a hole in the snow and face it with drift-wood they have plenty of provision enough to spare and mean to stay here till the steamer run for the younger of the pair have frost he foot and be cripple the last of they dog have be freeze to death a few mile back on the trail and they have no idea apparently how near they be to that first indian settlement this side of kaltag reach by the colonel and the boy after two day of rest and one day of travel no one ever sail more joyfully into the bay of naple or saw with keener rapture constantinople 's mosque and minaret arise than do these ice-armoured traveller round the sharp bend in the river sight the hut and hear the dog howl on the farther shore first thing i do sah be to speculate in a dog-team say the colonel most of the buck be go off hunting and most of the dog be with they only three leave in the village -- but they be wonderful fellow those three where be they well the old man you see before you _ I _ -- get two he lead the way behind a little shack a troop of child follow and there be two wolf-dog not in the best condition one reddish with a white face and white foreleg the other gray with a black splotch on he chest and a white one on he back how much fiftee dollum and this one fiftee dollum as the colonel hesitate the old fellow add : bohf eightee dolla oh eightee for the two he nod well where 's the other hein the other -- the third dog two be no good yes yes he say angrily heap good dog well i 'll give you eighty dollar for these -lrb- the ingalik take a pipe out of he parkus hold out one empty hand -rrb- but who be get the other for answer a head-shake the outstretched hand and the word eightee dollum -- tabak -- tea wait interrupt the boy turn to the group of child where 's the other dog nobody answer the boy pantomime we want _ three _ dog he hold up as many finger we get two -- see -- must have one more a lad of about thirteen turn and begin point with animation towards a slowly approach figure peetka -- he get the old man begin to chatter angrily and abuse the lad for introduce a rival on the scene the stranger hail the new-comer how much be you dog peetka stop consider study the scene immediately before he and then the distant prospect you get dog he nod well how much sixty dollum _ one _ dog sixty he nod but this man say the price be eighty for two my dog -- he leader after some further conversation where be you dog demand the colonel the new-comer whistle and call after some wait and well-simulated anger on the part of the owner along come a dusky siwash thin but keen-looking and none too mild-tempered the child all brighten and crane as if a friend or at least a highly interesting member of the community have appear on the scene the nigger 's the best whisper the boy he bully say the lad and seem about to pat he but the siwash snarled softly raise he lip and show he gleaming fang the lad step back respectfully but grin reiterate bully dog well i 'll give you fifty for he say the colonel sixty well all right since he be a leader sixty the owner watch the dog as it walk round its master smell the snow then turn up its pointed nose interrogatively and wave its magnificent feathery tail the oblique eye acute angle of he short ear the thick neck broad chest and heavy foreleg give a impression of mingled alertness and strength you will not see surpass in any animal that walk the world jet-black except for he gray muzzle and broad chest he look at you with the face of he near ancestor the grizzled wolf if on short acquaintance you offer any familiarity as the colonel venture to do and he show he double row of murderous-looking fang the reminder of he fierce forefather be even more insistent indeed to this day you siwash of this sort will have he moment of nostalgia in which he turn back to he wild kinsfolk and mate again with the wolf when the leader look at the colonel with that indescribably horrid smile the owner 's approval of the proud beast seem to overcome he avarice I no sell he decide abruptly and walk off in lordly fashion with he dusky companion at he side the leader curl he feathery tail arc-like over he back and walk with a air prince might envy the colonel stand stare vainly the boy call come back look here hi neither siwash nor ingalik take the smallest notice the boy go after they elicit only air of surly indifference and repeat I no sell it be a bitter disappointment especially to the boy he like the look of that nigger dog when plunge in gloom he return to the group about the colonel he find he pardner ask about feed no the old man have not enough fish to spare even a few day ' supply would anybody here sell fish no he do not think so all the man who have team be go to the hill for caribou there be nobody to send to the summer cache he hold out he hand again for the first instalment of the eightee dollum in kind that he might put it in he pipe but dog be no good to we without something to feed 'em the ingalik look round as one seek counsel get fish tomalla no sir to-day 's the only day in my calendar no buy dog till we get fish when the negotiation fall through the indian take the failure far more philosophically than the white man as be natural the old fellow could quite well get on without eightee dollum -- could even get on without the tobacco tea sugar and match represent by that sum but the traveller could not without dog get to minok it have be very well to feel set up because they have do the thing that everybody say be impossible it have be a costly victory yes it have come high and after all if we do not get dog we be beat oh beat be blow we 'll toddle along somehow yes we 'll toddle along _ if _ we get dog and the boy know the colonel be right they inquire about kaltag i reckon we would better push ahead while we can say the colonel so they leave the camp that same evening intend to travel with the moon the settlement be barely out of sight when they meet a squaw drag a sled-load of salmon here be luck and now we 'll go back and get those two dog as it be late and trading with the native even for a fish be a matter of much time and patience they decide not to hurry the dog deal it be bind to take a good part of the evening at any rate well another night 's rest up be welcome enough while the colonel be re-establish himself in the best cabin the boy cache the sled and then go prowl about as he fully intend he fall in with the leader -- that bully nigger dog he master not in sight -- nobody but some dirty child and the stranger there to see how the red dog in a moment of aberration dare offer insolence to the leader it all happen through the boy 's produce a fish and present it on bend knee at a respectful distance the leader bestow a contemptuous stare upon the stranger and pointedly turn he back the red dog come lope across the snow as he make for the fish the leader quietly head he off point he sharp ear and just look the other fellow out of countenance red say thing under he breath as he turn away the more he think the situation over the more he feel himself outrage he look round over he shoulder there they still be the stranger hold out the fish the leader turn he back on it but telegraph red at the same time _ not to dare _ it be more than dog-flesh could bear red bound back explode in snarl no sound out of the leader whether this unnatural calm mislead red he come up closer brace he foreleg and thrust he tawny muzzle almost into the other dog 's face draw back he lip from all those shine wicked tooth and utter a muffle hiss well it be magnificently do and it certainly look as if the leader be go to have a troubled evening but he do not seem to think so he fix the red dog as one know the power of the master 's eye to quell red 's reply unimaginably bold be as the boy describe it to the colonel to give the other fellum the curse the boy be proud of red 's pluck -- already look upon he as he own -- but he jump up from he ingratiating attitude still grasp the dry fish it would be a shame if that leader get chew up and there be red every tooth bare gasp for gore and with each pass second seem to throw a deeper damnation into he threat and to brace himself more firmly for the hurl of the final doom at that instant the stranger breathing quick and hard the elder child lean forward some of the younger drawing back in terror -- if you 'll believe it the leader blink in a bored way and sit down on the snow a question only of last moment now poor brute and the bystander hold they breath but no red to be sure break into the most awful demonstration and nearly burst himself with fury but he back away as though the spectacle offer by the leader be too disgusting for a decent dog to look at he go behind the shack and tell the spotty one in no time they be back approach the boy and the fish discreetly from behind such mean tactic rouse the leader 's ire he get up and fly at they they make it hot for he but still the leader seem to be do pretty well for himself when the old ingalik -lrb- whom the boy have send a child to summon -rrb- hobble up with a raw-hide whip and lay it on with a practiced hand separate the combatant kick they impartially all round and speak injurious word be you two hurt inquire the future owner anxiously the old fellow shake he head fur thick be the reassuring answer and once more the boy realize that these canine encounter though frequently end in death often look and sound much more awful than they be as the leader feign to be go home he make a dash in pass at the stranger 's fish it be hold tight and the pirate get off with only a fragment leader give one swallow and look back to see how the theft be be take that surprising stranger simply stand there laugh and hold out the rest of a fine fat fish leader consider a moment look the alien up and down come back all on guard for sudden rush sly kick and thwacking to pay he out but nothing of the kind the nigger dog say as plain as speech could make it : you cheechalko person you look as if you be actually offer I that fish in good faith but i would be a fool to think so the stranger speak low and quietly they talk for some time the owner of the two have shuffle off home again with spotty and red at he heel the leader come quite near look almost docile but he snap suddenly at the fish with a ugly gleam of eye and fang the boy nearly make the fatal mistake of jump but he control the impulse and merely hold tight to what be leave of the salmon he stand quite still offer it with fair word the leader walk all round he and seem with difficulty to recover from he surprise the boy feel that they be just come to a understanding when up hurry peetka suspicious and out of sort _ my dog _ he shout no sell white man my dog huh ho -- _ oh _ no he kick the leader viciously and drive he home abuse he all the way the wonder be that the wolfish creature do not fly at he master 's throat and finish he certainly the stranger 's sympathy be all with the four-legged one of the two brute -- something about the leader -- the boy say sadly tell the colonel what have happen well sir i would give a hundred dollar to own that dog so would i be the dry rejoinder if i be a millionaire like you \* \* \* \* \* after supper they host who have be send out to bring in the owner of red and spotty come back say he come all come I tell -- you from below holy cross he laugh and shake he head in a well-pantomimed incredulity represent popular opinion outside some of the buck he add who have not go far have get back with small game and dog no dog in the mountain hunt moose -- caribou the old ingalik come in follow by other some of the buck there seem no end to the throng opposite the white man the indian sit in a semicircle with the sole intent you might think of stare all night at the stranger yet they have bring in arctic hare and grouse and even a haunch of venison but they lay these thing on the floor beside they and sit with grave unbroken silence till the stranger should declare themselves they have also bring or permit to follow not only they wife and daughter but they child big and little behind the semicircle of man three or four deep be range the rank of youth -- boy and girl from six to fourteen -- standing as silent as they elder but eager watchful carry king salmon dry deer-meat boot-sole thong for snow-shoe rabbit grouse a little fellow of ten or eleven have bring in the red dog and be try to reconcile he to he close quarter the owner of red and spotty sit with empty hand at the semicircle 's farthest end but he be the capitalist of the village and hold himself worthily yet not quite with the high and mighty unconcern of the owner of the leader peetka come in late bringing in the nigger dog against the nigger dog 's will just to tantalise the white man with the sight of something they could not buy from the poor indian everybody make way for peetka and he dog except the other dog several people have to go to the assistance of the little boy to help he to hold red just as well perhaps say the colonel that we be not likely to get all three oh if they work together they would be all right answer the boy i have notice that before but the leader meanwhile be flatly refuse to stay in the same room with red he howl and snap and rage so poor red be turn out and the little boy mourn loudly behind the child a row of squaw against the wall with and without baby strap at they back occasionally a young girl would push aside those in front of she crane and stare to take in the astonishing spectacle of the two white man who have come so far without dog -- pull a hand-sled a greater distance than any indian have ever do -- if they could be believe anyhow these man with they sack of tea and magnificent bundle of match above all with they tobacco -- they could buy out the town -- everything except peetka 's dog the colonel and the boy open the ball by renew they joint offer of eighty dollar for red and spotty although this have be the old ingalik 's own price it be discuss fully a hour by all present before the matter could be consider finally settle even then the colonel know it be safest not to pay till just upon leave but he make a little present of tobacco in token of satisfactory arrangement the old man 's hand tremble excitedly as he pull out he pipe and fill it the buck round he and even a couple of the woman at the back beg he for some he seem to say do you own deal the stranger have plenty more by-and-by in spite of the limited english of the community certain fact stand out : that peetka hold the white man in avowed detestation that he be the lead spirit of the place that they have all be suffer from a tobacco famine and that much might be do by a judicious use of black jack and long green the colonel set forth the magnificent generosity of which he would be capable could he secure a good leader but peetka although he look at he empty pipe with bitterness shake he head everybody in the village would profit the colonel go on everybody should have a present if -- peetka interrupt with a snarl and fling out low word of contemptuous refusal the leader wake from a brief nap cramped and uneasy and begin to howl in sympathy he master stand up the better to deliver a brutal kick this seem to help the leader to put up with cramp and confinement just as one great discomfort will help he betters to forget several little one but the boy have rise with angry eye very well he say impulsively if he and he pardner could not get a third dog -lrb- two be very little good -rrb- they would not stock fresh meat here in vain the colonel whisper admonition no sir they would wait till they get to the next village belly far say a young hunter place ostentatiously in front he brace of grouse we be use to go belly far take all you game away and go home a sorrowful silence fall upon the room they sit for some time like that no one so much as move till a voice say we want tobacco and a general murmur of assent arise peetka rouse himself pull out of he shirt a concave stone and a little woody-looking knot the boy lean forward to see what it be a piece of dry fungus -- the kind you sometimes see on the birch up here peetka be hammer a fragment of it into powder with he heavy clasp-knife on the concave stone he sweep the particle into he pipe and apply to one of the fish-selling woman for a match light up and lounge back against the leader smile disagreeably at the stranger a little laugh at they expense go round the room oh it be not easy to get ahead of peetka but even if he choose to pretend that he do not want cheechalko tobacco it be very serious -- it be desperate -- to see all that black jack go on to the next village several of the hitherto silent buck remonstrate with peetka -- even one of the woman dare raise she voice she have not be able to go for fish : where be _ she _ tobacco and tea peetka burst into voluble defense of he position cast occasional look of disdain upon the stranger he address most of he remark to the owner of red and spotty although the colonel could not understand a word he see the moment approach when that person would go back on he bargain with uncommon pleasure he could have throttle peetka the boy to create a diversion have begin talk to a young hunter in the front row about the long trail and see that several other crane and listen he speak louder more slowly drop out all unnecessary or unusual word very soon he have gain a audience and peetka have lose one as the stranger go on describe they experience the whole room listen with a attentiveness that would have be flattering have it be less strongly dash with unbelief from beyond anvik they have come like that -- with no dog what from below koserefsky not really peetka grunt and shake he head do they think the ingalik be child without dog that journey be impossible low whisper and gruff exclamation fill the room white man be great liar they pretend that in they country the bacon have leg and could run about and one have be hear to say he have travel in a thing like a steamboat only it could go without water under it -- run over the dry land on strip of iron -- run quicker than any steamer oh they be awful liar but these two who pretend they would drag a sled all the way from holy cross they be the biggest liar of all just let they tell that yarn to unookuk they all laugh at this and the name run round the room who be unookuk he guide he know where be he ask the boy he sick but there be whisper and consultation this be evidently a case for the expert two boy run out and the native talk go on unintelligible save for the fact that it centre round unookuk in a few minute the boy come back with a tall fine-looking native about sixty year old walk lame and lean on a stick the semicircle open to admit he he limp over to the stranger and stand look at they gravely modestly but with careful scrutiny the boy hold out he hand how do you do how do you do echo the new-comer and he also shake hand with the colonel before he sit down be you unookuk yes how far you come peetka say something rude before the stranger have time to answer and all the room go into titter but unookuk listen with dignity while the colonel repeat briefly the story already tell plainly it stump unookuk come from anvik he repeat yes stay with mr benham oh benham the trader 's familiar name run round the room with obvious effect it be good to have a c agent for friend say unookuk guardedly everybody know benham he be not a c agent much longer volunteer the boy that so no he will go ` on he own ' after the new agent get in this spring it be true answer unookuk gravely for the first time a little impressed for this news be not yet common property still they could have hear it from some passer with a dog-team the boy speak of holy cross and unookuk 's grave unbelief be paint on every feature it be good you get to holy cross before the big storm he say with a faint smile of tolerance for the white man 's tall story but peetka laugh aloud what good english you speak say the boy determine to make friend with the most intelligent-appearing native he have see I i be kurillum say unookuk with a quiet magnificence then see no electric recognition of the name he add : you savvy kurillum the colonel with much regret admit that he do not but i be dall 's guide -- kurillum oh dall 's guide be you say the boy without a glimmer of who dall be or for what or to what he be guide well kurillum we be pleased and proud to meet you add with some presence of mind and how 's dall it be long i have not hear we both old now i hurt my knee on the ice when i come down from nulato for caribou why do you have two name unookuk nulato name my father big nulato shamn he kill mother kill everybody kill in koyukuk massacre they forget kill I I kid russian find unookuk in big wood russian give food i stay with russian -- they call unookuk ` kurillum ' dall call unookuk ` kurillum ' dall -- dall say the colonel to the boy be that the name of the explorer fellum -- fortunately the boy be save from need to answer first white man go down yukon to the sea say kurillum with pride I dall 's guide oh write a book do not he name 's familiar somehow say the colonel kurillum bear he out mr dall great man thirty year he first come up here with survey people make big overland tel-ee-grab of course i have hear about that the colonel turn to the boy it be just before the russian sell out and when a lot of explore and survey and pole-plant be do here and in siberium the atlantic cable be lay and knock the overland scheme sky-high kurillum gravely verify these fact and I dall 's chief guide I with dall when he make portage from unalaklik to kaltag he see the yukon first time he run down to be first on the ice dall and the coast native stare like so -- kurillum make a wild-eyed ludicrous face -- and they say : ` it be not a river -- it be another sea ' no wonder i hear it be ten mile wide up by the flat and even a little below where we winter at ikogimeut it be four mile across from bank to bank kurillum look at the colonel with dignified reproach why do he go on lie about he journey like that to a expert even at holy cross -- the boy begin but kurillum strike in : when you there oh about three week ago peetka make remark in ingalik father macmanus he all right asked kurillum politely cloak he cross-examination macmanus do you mean will or the superior father brachet oh yes macmanus at tanana he speak as though inadvertently he have confuse the name as the stranger give he the winter 's news from holy cross he wonder and astonishment grow presently do you know my friend nichola of pymeut ask the boy kurillum take he empty pipe out of he mouth and smile in broad surprise nichola repeat several other it be plain the pymeut pilot enjoy a wide repute the boy speak of the famine and ol' chief 's illness it be true say unookuk gravely and turn he add something in ingalik to the company peetka answer back as surly as ever but the boy go on tell how the shaman have cure ol' chief and that turn out to be a surprisingly popular story peetka would not interrupt it even to curse the leader for get up and stretch himself when the dog -- feeling that for some reason discipline be relax -- dare to leave he cramped quarter and come out into the little open space between the white man and the close-packed assembly the boy force himself to go straight on with he story as if he have not observe the liberty the leader be take when after stand there a instant the dog come over and throw himself down at the stranger 's foot as if publicly adopt he the white story-teller dare not meet peetka 's eye he be privately most uneasy at the nigger dog 's tactless move and he hurry on about how brother paul catch the shamn and about the penitential journey -- tell how long before that early in the fall nichola have get lose make the portage from st michael 's and how the white camp have save he from starvation how in turn the pymeut have pull the speaker out of a blow-hole what tremendous friend the pymeut be with these particular very good sort of white man here he seem to allow by implication for peetka 's prejudice -- there be two kind of pale-face stranger -- and on a impulse he draw out muckluck 's medal he would have they to know so highly be these present specimen of the doubtful race regard by the pymeut -- such friend be they that nichola ' sister have give he this for a offering to yukon inua that the great spirit might help they on they way he own himself wrong to have delay this sacrifice he must to-morrow throw it into the first blow-hole he come to -- unless indeed he eye catch kurillum 's with the help of he stick the old guide pull he big body up on he one stout leg hobble nearer and gravely eyed muckluck 's offering as it swing to and fro on its walrus-string over the leader 's head the boy quite conscious of some subtle change in the hitherto immobile face of the indian lay the token in he hand standing there in the center of the semicircle between the assembly and the dog kurillum turn the great katharine 's medal over examine it closely every eye in the room upon he when he lift he head there be a rustle of expectation and a crane forward it be the same kurillum speak slowly like one half in a dream when i go down river thirty winter back with the great dall he try buy this off nichola 's mother she wear it on string red russian bead oh it be a thing to remember he nod he gray head significantly but he go on with the bare evidence : when _ john j healy _ make last trip down this fall -- nichola pilot you savvy -- they let he take he sister holy cross to pymeut i see she wear this round neck the weight of the medal carry the raw-hide necklace slip through he finger slowly now with even impulse the silver disc swing right swing leave like the pendulum of a clock even the nigger dog seem hypnotise follow the dim shine of the tarnish token i say nichola 's sister : ` it be thirty winter i see that silver picture first i give you two dollum for he ' she say ` no ' i say ` gi ' fus ' dollum ' ` no ' i sit and think far back -- thirty winter back ' i gi ' ten dollum ' i say she say ' i no sell no -- not for a hunner ' -- but she _ give _ it he for to make yukon inua to let he go safe hein savvy and lapse into ingalik he endorse this credential not to be deny it be true he wind up in english the autocratrix russorum be solemnly hand back you have make a brave journey it be i who unnerstan ' -- i too when i be young i go with dall on the long trail _ we have dog _ all the while from all about the leader 's owner and out of every corner of the crowded room have come a spirited punctuation of kurillum 's speech -- nod and grunt yes perhaps _ these _ white man deserve dog -- even peetka 's kurillum limp back to he place but turn to the ingalik before he sit down and bend painfully over he stick not kurillum he say as though speaking of one absent -- not _ dall _ make so great journey no dog kurillum best guide in yukon forty year kurillum say : ` must have dog -- man like that ' he limp back again and solemnly offer he hand to each of the traveller in turn shake say he then as though fascinate by the silver picture he drop down by the boy stare absently at the great katharine 's effigy the general murmur be arrest by a movement from peetka -- he take he pipe out of he mouth and say he handsomely : no liar sell dog add with regretful eye on the apostate leader he bully dog and that be how the tobacco famine end and how the white man get they team chapter xv the esquimaux horse plus je connai les hommes plus j' aime les chiens it do not look hard to drive a dog-team but just you try it in moment of passion the first few day after they acquisition the colonel and the boy wonder why they have complicate a sufficiently difficult journey by add to other care a load of fish and three fiend think how well they go for peetka oh yes part o ' they cussedness they know we be green hand and they mean to make it lively well they do they sit on they haunch in the snow and grin at the whip-cracking and futile mush mush of the colonel they snap at the boy and make sharp turn tie he up in the trace and tumble he into the snow they howl all night long except during a bless interval of quiet while they eat they seal-skin harness but man be the wiliest of the animal and the one who profit by experience in the end the boy become a capital driver the dog come to know he mean business and settle into submission nig as he call the bully dog for short turn out the best leader in the yukon they be much nearer kaltag than they have realize arrive after only two hour ' struggle with the dog at the big indian village on the left bank of the river but they first appearance here be cloud by nig 's proposal to slay all the dog in sight he be no sooner unharnessed than he undertake the congenial job it look for a few minute as if peetka 's bully dog would chew up the entire canine population and then lie down and die of he own wound but the kaltag understand the genus siwash better than the white man and take the tumult calmly it turn out that nig be not so much bloodthirsty as bloody-proud -- one of those high soul for ever concern about supremacy he first social act on catch sight of he fellow be to howl defiance at he and even after they have fight it out and come to some sort of understand the first happy thought of you bear leader on awakening be to proclaim himself boss of the camp no sooner have he publish this conviction of high calling than he be set upon by the other punish they soundly or be himself vanquish and drive off whereupon he sit on he haunch in the snow and with he pointed nose turn skyward howl uninterruptedly for a hour or two when all be forgive and forget -- till the next time order be restore the traveller get new harness for the dog new boot for themselves and set out for the white trading post thirty mile above here have at last come into the region of settlement they agree never again to overtax the dog they travel light out of nulato towards the koyukuk the dog simply fly over those last mile it be glorious go on a trail like glass they have break the back of the journey now and could well afford they think to halt a hour or two on the island at the junction of the two great river stake out a trading post and treat themselves to town lot why town lot in heaven 's name when they be bind for minok and after that the klondyke hundred of mile away well partly out of mere gaiety of heart and partly the colonel would have tell you gravely that in this country you never know when you have a good thing they have leave the one white layman at nulato seethe with excitement over a indian 's report of still another rich strike up yonder on the koyukuk and this point where they be solemnly stake out a new post the nulato agent have say be dead sure to be a great center that almost unknown region border the great tributary of the yukon haunt of the fiercest of all the indian of the north be to be finally conquer by the white man it have be leave practically unexplored ever since the day when the bloodthirsty koyukon come down out of they fastness and perpetrate the great nulato massacre do to death with ghastly barbarity every man woman and child at the post russian or indian except kurillum not spare the unlucky captain barnard or he english escort newly arrive here in they search for the lose sir john franklin but the table be turn now and the white man be on the trail of the indian while the colonel and the boy be stake out this future stronghold of trade and civilisation it come on to snow but can not last this time o ' year the colonel console himself and thank god the big unending snow be over for this season so they push on but the colonel seem to have thank god prematurely down the snow drift soft sticky unending the evening be cloudy and the snow increase the dimness overhead as well as the heaviness under foot they never know just where it be in the hour between dusk and dark that they lose the trail the boy believe it be at a certain steep incline that nig do he best to rush down i think he be at he trick say the boy ruefully some hour after i believe i be a ass and nig be a gentleman and a scholar he know perfectly what he be about reckon we 'll camp pardner reckon we might as well after unharness the dog the boy stand a instant look enviously at they as he thaw out he stiff hand under he parkus exhaust and smoking hot the dog have curl down in the snow as contented-looking as though on a hearth-rug before a fire shelter they sharp nose with they tail wish i have a tail to shelter my face say the boy as if a tail be the one thing lack to complete he bliss you do not need any shelter _ now _ answer the colonel you face be gettin ' well -- and he stop suddenly carry back to those black day when he have vainly urge a face-guard he unpack they few possession and watch the boy take the axe and go off for wood stop on he way tire as he be to pull nig 's pointed ear the odd thing about the boy be that it be only with these indian cur -- nig in particular who be not the boy 's dog at all -- only with these brute-beast have he seem to recover something of that buoyancy and ridiculous youngness that have first draw the colonel to he on the voyage up from ` frisco it be also clear that if the boy now draw away from he pardner ever so little by so much do he draw nearer to the dog he might be too tired to answer the colonel he be seldom too tired to talk nonsense to nig never too tired to say well old boy or even well _ pardner _ to the dumb brute it be perhaps this that the colonel dislike most of all whether the we agent at nulato be justified or not in say all the region hereabouts be populous in the summer with indian camp the native winter settlement the half-buried ighloo or the rude log-hut where for a little tea tobacco or sugar you could get as much fish as you could carry these welcome if malodorous place seem since they lose the trail to have vanish off the face of the earth no question of the man share the dog ' fish but of the dog share the man 's bacon and meal that night the meager supper be more meager still that the horse might have something too the next afternoon it stop snow and clear intensely cold and that be the evening the boy nearly cry for joy when lift up he eye he see a good way off perch on the river bank the hut and high cache of a indian village etch black against a wintry sunset -- a fine picture in any eye but mean more than beauty to the driver of hungry dog fish nig call out the boy to he leader you hear I you nig _ fish _ old fellow now look at that colonel you tell I that indian dog do not understand english i tell you what : we have a mean time with these dog just at first but that be only because we do not understand one another the colonel preserve a reticent air you 'll come to my way of think yet the indian dog -- he be a daisy glad you think so the colonel with some display of temper have give up try to drive the team only half a hour before and be still rather sore about it when you get to _ understand _ he persist the boy he be the most marvellous little horse ever hitch in harness he pull pull pull all day long in any kind o ' weather -- yes pull you off you leg or pull you the way you do not want to go oh that be when you rile he he be just like any other american gentleman : he be get he feelin 's be not you get feelin 's nig huh rather i tell you what colonel many a time when i be pretty well beat and ready to snap at anybody i have look at nig peggin ' away like a little man on a rotten trail with a blizzard in he eye and it be just make I sick after that to hear myself grumblin ' yes sir the indian dog be a example to any white man on the trail the boy seem not to relinquish the hope of stir the tired colonel to enthusiasm do not you like the way after the worst sort of day when you stop he just drop down in the snow and roll about a little to rest he muscle and then lie there as patient as anything till you be ready to unharness he and feed he -- and if you do not hurry up he save you the trouble of unharnessing by eat the trace and thing humph so would you if that village be not in sight if you be sure the harness would not stick in you gizzard and think of what a dog get to reward he for he plucky day : one dry salmon or a little meal-soup when he be off on a holiday like this work without a let-up and keep in good flesh on one fish a day do not even get anything to drink eat a little snow after dinner dig he bed and sleep in a drift till morning when he do not howl all night oh that be when he meet he friend and they talk about old time before they come down in the world hey yes when they be wolf and make we run instead of we make they make any fellow howl instead of carry we food about we use to carry theirs and run hard to keep from give it up too nig 's at it again say the colonel give we you whip no say the boy i begin to see now why he stop and go for red like that hah spot 's gettin it too this time they have not be pullin ' properly you just notice : if they be not doin ' they share nig 'll turn to every time and give 'em ` hail columbium ' you 'll see when he be freshen 'em up a bit we 'll have 'em on a dead run the boy laugh and crack he whip they have get keen nose _ i _ do not smell the village this time come on nig spot 's have enough he be sorry good and plenty cheer up spot fish old man you hear I talkin ' to you red _ fish _ cache full of it whoop and down they rush pell-mell man and dog tear along like mad across the frozen river and never slow till it come to the stiff pull up the opposite bank funny i do not hear any dog pant the boy they come out upon a place silent as the dead -- a big desert village empty by the plague or maybe only by the winter cache empty too not a salmon not a pike not a lusk not even a whitefish leave behind it be a bitter blow they do not say anything it be too bad to talk about the colonel make the fire and fry a little bacon and make some mush : that be they dinner the bacon-rind be boil in the mush-pot with a great deal of snow and a little meal and the soup so concoct be set out to cool for the dog they be afraid to sleep in one of the cabin it might be plague-infected the indian have cut all the spruce for a wide radius round about -- no bough to make a bed they hoist some tent-pole up into one of the empty cache lay they side by side and on this bed dry if hard they find oblivion the next morning a thin powdery snow be drive about have they lose they way in the calendar as well as on the trail and be it December instead of the 29th of march the colonel sit on the packed sled undoing with stiff finger the twisted frozen rope he know the axe that he use the night before on the little end of bacon be lie press into the snow under one runner but that be the last thing to go on the pack before the lash and it would not get lose pin down under the sled nig catch sight of it and come over with a cheerful air of interest sniff bacon on the steel and it occur to he it would be a good plan to lick it a bitter howling break the stillness the boy come tear up with a look that lift the colonel off the sled and there be nig try to get away from the axe-head he tongue frozen fast to the steel and pull horribly long out of he mouth like a little pink rope the boy have fall upon the agonize beast and force he down close to the steel hold he there between he knee he pull off he outer mit and with hand and breath warm the surface of the axe speak now and then to the dog who howl wretchedly but seem to understand something be be do for he since he give up struggle when at last the boy get he free the little horse press against he friend 's leg with a strange new shudder noise very pitiful to hear the boy blinking hard say : yes old man i know that be a mean breakfast and he pat the shaggy chest nig bent he proud head and lick the rescue hand with he bleeding tongue a ' you say that dog have not get feelin 's they hitch the team and push on in the absence of a trail the best they could do be to keep to the river ice by-and-bye : can you see the river bank i be not sure say the boy i think you be go it blind i believe i would better let nig have he head say the boy stop he be the dandy trail-finder nig old man i take off my hat to you they push ahead till the half-famished dog give out they camp under the lee of the prop sled and sleep the sleep of exhaustion the next morning dawn clear and warm the colonel manage to get a little wood and start a fire there be a few spoonful of meal in the bottom of the bag and a little end of bacon mostly rind the sort of soup the dog have have yesterday be good enough for man to-day the hot and watery brew give they strength enough to strike camp and move on the elder man begin to say to himself that he would sell he life dearly he look at the dog a good deal and then would look at the boy but he could never catch he eye at last : they say you know that man in we fix have sometimes have to sacrifice a dog ugh the boy 's face express nausea at the thought yes it be pretty revolting we could never do it n-no say the colonel the three little esquimaux horse be not only very hungry they foot be in a bad condition and be bleed the boy have shut he eye at first at the sight of they red track in the snow he hardly notice they now a hour or so later : better man than we say the colonel significantly have have to put they feeling in they pocket as if he find the observation distinctly discourage nig at this moment sit down in the melting snow and no amount of mushing move he let 's give he half a hour 's rest colonel valuable beast you know -- altogether best team on the river say the boy as if to show that he suggestion be not inspire by mere pity for the bleeding dog and you look rather fade yourself colonel sit down and rest nothing more be say for a full half-hour till the colonel take off he fur hat and wipe he beaded forehead on the back of he hand remark : think of the siege of paris eh what the boy stare as if afraid he partner 's brain have give way when the horse give out they have to eat dog cat rat even think of it -- rat the french be a dirty lot let 's mush colonel i be as fit as a fiddle the boy get up and call the dog in ten minute they be follow the blind trail again but the sled keep clog sticking fast and break down after a desperate bout of ineffectual pull the dog with one mind stop again and lay down in they bloody track the man stand silent for a moment then the colonel remark : red be the least valuable -- a long pause -- but nig 's foot be in the worst condition that dog will not travel a mile further well add the colonel after a bit as the boy stand speechless study the team what do you say I he look up like a man who have be dream and be just awake oh i should say we friend nig here have have to stand more than he share of the racket poor old nig say the colonel with a somewhat guilty air look here : what do you say to see whether they can go if we help 'em with that load good for you colonel say the boy with confidence wonderfully restore i be just think the same they unlash the pack and the colonel want to make two bundle of the bedding and thing but whether the boy really think the colonel be give out or whether down in some corner of he mind he recognize the fact that if the colonel be not gall by this extra burden he might feel he hunger less and so be less prone to thought of poor nig in the pot -- however it be he say the bundle be he business for the first hour so the colonel do the driving and the boy tramp on ahead break trail with thirty-five pound on he back and he do not give it up either though he admit long after it be the toughest time he have ever put in in all he life have not you have about enough of this the colonel sing out at dusk pretty nearly say the boy in a rather weak voice he fling off the pack and sit on it get up say the colonel give we the sleepin ' - bag when it be undo the norfolk jacket drop out he roll it up against the sled fling himself down and heavily drop he head on the rough pillow but he spring up what yes by the lord he thrust he hand into the capacious pocket of the jacket and pull out some broken ship 's biscuit hard tack by the living jingo he be up have a few stick alight and the kettle on and be melting snow to pour on the broken biscuit it swell you know like thunder the boy be still sit on the bundle of trade tea and tobacco he seem not to hear he seem not to see the colonel shakily hover about the fire push aside the green wood and add a few stick of dry there be a mist before the colonel 's eye reach after a bit of seasoned spruce he stumble and unconsciously set he foot on nig 's bleeding paw the dog let out a yell and fly at he the colonel fall back with a oath pick up a stick and lay it on the boy be on he foot in a flash here stop that he jump in between the infuriate man and the infuriate dog stand back roar the colonel it be you fault you tread -- stand back damn you or you 'll get hurt the stick would have fall on the boy he dodge it call excitedly come here nig here he be my dog and i 'll lamm he if i like you -- the colonel could not see just where the boy and the culprit be stumble a few pace away from the glare of the fire he call out i 'll kill that brute if he snap at I again oh yes the boy 's voice ring passionately out of the gloom i know you want he kill the colonel sit down heavily on the rolled-up bag presently the bubbling of boil snow-water rouse he he get up divide the biscuit and pour the hot water over the fragment then he sit down again and wait for they to swell like thunder he could not see where a little way up the hillside the boy sit on a fall tree with nig 's head under he arm the boy feel pretty low in he mind he sit crouch together with he head sink almost to he knee it be a lonely kind of a world after all do you level best do not seem to get you any forrader what be the use he start something warm caress touch he cold face just under one eye nig 's tongue good old nig you feel lonesome too he gather the rough beast up closer to he just then the colonel call nig sh sh lie quiet whisper the boy nig nig good old boy stay here he do not mean well by you _ sh _ quiet _ quiet _ i say nig and the treacherous colonel give the peculiar whistle both man use to call the dog to supper the dog struggle to get away the boy 's stiff finger lose they grip and the best leader in the yukon be run down the bank as hard as he could pelt to the camp fire -- to the cooking-pot the boy get up and flounder away in the opposite direction he must get out of hearing he toil on listen for the expect gunshot -- hear it too and the yawp of a wounded dog in spite of a mitten clap at each ear that be the kind of world it be do you level best drag other fella ' pack hundred o ' mile over the ice with a hungry belly and bloody foot and then -- poor old nig -- 'cause you be lame -- poor old nig with a tighten throat and hot water in he eye he keep on repeat the dog 's name as he stumble forward in the snow nev ' mind old boy it be a lonely kind o ' world and the right trail 's hard to find suddenly he stand still he stumbling foot be on a track he have reach the dip in the saddle-back of the hill and -- yes this be the _ right _ trail for down on the other side below he be faint light -- hut -- a indian village with fish and food for everybody and nig -- nig be be -- the boy turn as if a hurricane have strike he and tear back down the incline -- stumble flounder in the snow call hoarsely : colonel colonel do not do it there be a village here colonel nig colonel do not do it he dash into the circle of firelight and beheld nig standing with a bandaged paw placidly eat softened biscuit out of the family frying-pan it be short work get down to the village they have one king salmon and two white fish from the first indian they see who want hootch for they and get only tabak in the biggest of the hut nearly full of man woman and child cough sickly-looking deject the native make room for the stranger when the white man have sup they hand over the remains of they meal -lrb- as be expect -rrb- to the head of the house this and a few match or a little tobacco on parting be all he look for in return for shelter room for bed on the floor snow-water laboriously melt use of the fire and as much wood as they like to burn even if it be a barren place and fuel be the precious far-travelled drift it be curious to see how soon traveller get past that first cheeckalko feeling that it be a little nervy as the boy have say to walk into another man 's house uninvited a absolute stranger and take possession of everything you want without so much as by you leave you soon learn it be the siwash -lrb- \* -rrb- custom -lrb- footnote : siwash corruption of french-canadian _ sauvage _ apply all over the north to the native they possession and they custom -rrb- nothing would have seem stranger now or more inhuman than the civilized point of view the indian trail out one by one all except the old buck to whom the hut belong he hang about for a bit till he be satisfy the traveller have no hootch not even a little for the head of the house and yet they seem to be fairly decent fellow then he roll up he blanket for there be a premium on sleeping-space and go out with never a notion that he be do more than any man would anywhere in the world to find a place in some neighbor 's hut to pass the night he leave the two stranger as indian hospitality ordain to the warmest place in the best hut with two young squaw one old one and five child all sleep together on the floor as a matter of course the colonel and the boy have fling themselves down on top of they sleeping-bag fed and warm and comfort only the old squaw be still up she have be look over the traveller ' boot and mitt and now without a word or even a look be exchange upon the subject she sit there in the corner by the dim seal-oil light sew on new thong patch up hole and make the strange man tidy -- man she have never see before and would never see again and this no tribute to the colonel 's generosity or the youth and friendly manners of the boy they know the old squaw would have do just the same have the muckluck and the mitt belong to the tramp of

the boy could have hug that mackinaw man outside it be broad day but still the gold nugget light be flare and the pianolum play they have learn from the bartender where to find blandford keith -- in the worst-looking shack in the camp but it look good to I say the boy as they go in and startle keith out of he first sleep the man that bring you letter before the ice go out be you friend keith help they to bring in they stuff and be distinctly trouble because the traveller would not take he bunk they borrow some dry blanket and go to sleep on the floor it be after two when they wake in a panic lest the mackinaw man should have go without they while the colonel get breakfast the boy dash round to the gold nugget find si mcginty play crap and would have bring he back in triumph to breakfast -- but no he would wait down yonder below the gold nugget and do not you say nothin ' yit about where we be goin ' or we 'll have the hull town at we heel about twelve mile back in the mountain be a little gulch that make into a big one at right angle that be the pup where my claim be the what little creek call 'em pup here down in the desolate hollow a ragged a tent sag away from the prevail wind inside they find that the canvas be a mere shelter over a prospect hole a rusty stove be almost bury by the heap of earth and gravel throw up from a pit several foot deep this be a winter diggin y ' see observe the mackinaw man with pride it be only while the ground be freeze solid you can do this kind o ' minin ' i have have to burn the ground clean down to bed-rock yes sir thawed my way inch by inch to the old channel well and what have you find s ` pose we pan some o ' this dirt and see he slow caution impress he hearer they make up a fire melt snow and half fill a rusty pan with gravel and soil from the bottom of the pit know how to pan the colonel and the boy take turn they be much longer at it than they ever be again but the mackinaw man seem not in the least hurry the impatience be all theirs when they have get down to fine sand look scream the boy by the lord say the colonel softly be that -- look like you get some color there gosh then i be not be dreamin ' after all hey dreamin ' what look look that be why i bring you gen ` l'men out say the mackinaw man i be afraid to trust my sens -- think i be gettin ' wheel in my head lord look at the gold they take about a dollar and twenty cent out of that pan now see here you gen ` l'men jest lay low about this strike he anxiety seem intense they reassure he i do not suppose you mind we take up a claim apiece next you plead the boy since the law do not allow you to stake more 'n one oh that be all right say the mackinaw man with a air of princely generosity and i do not mind if you like to let in a few of you particular pal if you 'll agree to help I organise a district a ' i 'll do the recordin ' fur ye really this mackinaw man be a trump the colonel take twenty-five dollar out of a roll of bill and hand it to he what be this fur for bring we out -- for give we the tip i would make it more but till i get to dawson -- oh laugh the mackinaw man _ that be _ all right and indifferently he tuck the bill into he baggy trousers the colonel feel keenly the inadequacy of give a man twenty-five dollar who have just introduce he to hundred of thousand -- and who sit on the edge of he own gold-mine -- but it be only on account the colonel stake no 1 above the discovery and the boy be in the act of stake no 1 below when -- no no say that kind mackinaw man the heavier gold will be find further up the gulch -- stake no 2 above and he tell they natural fact about placer-mining that no after expert knowledge could ever better but he be not as happy as a man should be who have just strike pay fact be it be kind of upsettin ' to find it so rich here give you leave to upset I that way all day y ' see i buy another claim over yonder where i do a lot o ' work last summer and fall build a cabin and put up a sluice i _ get _ to be up there soon as the ice go out do not see how i get time to do my assessment here too wish i be twin why do not you sell this guess i 'll have to part with a share in it he sigh and look lovingly into the hole minin 's a awful gamble he say as though admonish si mcginty but we _ know _ there be gold just there the colonel and the boy look at they claim and feel the pinch of uncertainty what do you want for a share in you claim mr mcginty oh well as i say i 'll let it go reasonable to a feller who would do the assessment on account o ' my have that other property say three thousand dollar the colonel shake he head why it be dirt-cheap two man can take a hundred and fifty dollar a day out of that claim without outside help and properly work the summer ought to show forty thousand dollar on the way home mcginty find he could let the thing go for two thousand spot cash make it quarter share suggest the boy thrill at such a chance and the colonel and i together 'll raise five hundred and do the rest of the assessment work for you but they be nearly back at minok before mcginty say well i be not twin and i can not personally work two gold-mine so we 'll call it a deal and the money pass that night and the word pass too to a ex-governor of a western state and he satellite newly arrive from woodworth and to a party of man just down from circle city mcginty seem more inclined to share he luck with stranger than with the man he have winter amongst mean lot these minok feller but the return of the ex-governor and so large a party from quietly stake they claim rouse minok to a sense that somethin' be goin ' on by mcginty 's advice the stranger call a secret meeting and elect mcginty recorder all the claim-holder register they property and the date of location the recorder give everybody he receipt and everybody feel it be cheap at five dollar then the meeting proceed to frame a code of law for the new district stipulate the number of foot permit each claim -lrb- be rigidly keep by mcginty within the limit provide by the united state law on the subject -rrb- and decree the amount of work necessary to hold a claim a year settle question of water rights etc etc not until glory hallelujah gulch be a full-fledged mining district do minok in general know what be in the wind the next day the news be all over camp if mcginty 's name inspire suspicion the colonel 's and the ex-governor 's reassure the colonel in particular -lrb- he have already establish that credit that come so easy to he -rrb- be triumphantly quote as say glory hallelujah gulch be the richest placer he have ever strike nobody add that it be also the only one but this matter of a stampede be not control by reason it be a thing of the nerve while you be ridicule someone else you leg be carry you off on the same errand in a mining-camp the saloon be the community 's heart however little a man care to drink or to dance or to play card he go to the saloon as to the one place where he may meet he fellow do business and hear the news the saloon be the market place it be also the caf the theater the club the stock exchange the barber 's shop the bank -- in short you might as well be dead as not be a patron of the gold nugget yet neither the colonel nor the boy have be there since the night of they arrival on return from that first triumphant inspection of mcginty 's digging the colonel have be hand a sealed envelope without address how do you know it be for I she say it be for the big chap answer blandford keith the colonel read : _ come to the gold nugget as soon as you get this and hear something to you advantage _ -- maudie so he have stay away have plenty to occupy he in help to organise the new district he be stroll past the saloon the morning after the secret meeting when down into the street like a kingfisher into a stream maudie dart and hold up the colonel be not you have my letter oh -- a -- yes -- but i have be busy guess so she say with undisguised scorn where 's si mcginty reckon he be out at the gulch i have get to go down to the a c now and buy some grub to take out he be move on take where she follow he up to mcginty 's gulch what for why to live on while my pardner and i do the assessment work then it be true mcginty 's be fillin ' you full o ' guff the colonel look at she a little haughtily see here : i be not busy as a rule about other folk ' funeral but -- she look at he curiously it be cold here come in a minute there be no hint of vulgar nonsense but something very earnest in the pert little face that have be so pretty they go in order drink she say aside and do not talk before jimmie she chaff the bartender and lean idly against the counter when a group of return stampeder come in she sit down at a rough little faro-table lean she elbow on it sip the rest of the stuff in she tumbler through a straw and in the shelter of she arm set the straw in a knot-hole near the table-leg and spirit the bad liquor down under the board do not give I away she say the colonel know she get a commission on the drink and be there to bring custom he nod i hope i would see you in time she go on hurriedly -- in time to warn you that mcginty be givin ' you a song and dance hey tellin you a ghost story you mean -- can not you understand plain english she say irritated at such obtuseness i get worried thinkin ' it over for it be I tell that pardner o ' yours -- she smile wickedly i expect mcginty would have some fun with the young feller but i do not expect you would be such a hatter she wind up with the popular reference to lunacy the colonel pull up he great figure with some pomposity i do not understand any feller can see that you be just the kind the mcginty be layin ' for she look round to see that nobody be within earshot si 's be layin ' round all winter waitin ' for the spring crop o ' sucker if you mean there be not gold out at mcginty 's gulch you be wrong i have see it course you have he pause she sweep the gold nugget with vigilant eye go on in a voice of indulgent contempt some of 'em load up a old shot-gun with a little charge o ' powder and a quarter of a

have waste some valuable time and five hundred and twenty-five dollar on mcginty they still have a chance of make they fortune before the spring rush the next day they go eight mile out in slush and in alternate rain and sunshine to little minok creek where the biggest pay claim be universally agree to be they find a place even more ragged and desolate than mcginty 's where smoke be rise sullenly from underground fire and the smell of burn wood fill the air the ground turn up and dot at interval with pile of frozen gravel that have be hoist from the shaft by windlass forlorn little cabin and tent scatter indiscriminately a vast number of empty bottle and can sow broadcast and early as it be a line of sluice upon salaman 's claim they have hear a great deal about the dark keen-looking young oregon lawyer for salaman be the most envied man in minok come over to my dump and get some nugget say mr salaman as in other part of the world a man will say come into the smoking-room and have a cigar the snow be melt from the top of salaman 's dump and he guest have no difficulty in pick several rough little bit of gold out of the thaw gravel it be a exhilarating occupation come down my shaft and see my cross-cut and they follow he he point out how the frozen gravel make solid wall or pillar and no curb be necessary with the aid of a candle and they host 's urge they pick out several dollar ' worth of coarse gold from the gravel in place at the edge of the bed-rock when he have get he guest thoroughly warm up : yes i take out several thousand last fall and i 'll have twenty thousand more out of my first summer clean-up and after that after that i be go home i would not stay here and work this way and live this way another winter not for twenty million i be surprised to

be remove i 'll tell you something the boy have not the smallest intention of remove the blot grudgingly he admit to himself that away from the unsavory atmosphere of the gold nugget there be nothing in maudie positively offensive at this moment with she shrewd little face peer pertly out from she parki-hood she look more than ever like a audacious child or like some strange new little arctic animal with a whimsical human air look here colonel she say presently either despair of get rid of the boy or cease to care about it : you get to get a wiggle on to-morrow what for she look round first over one shoulder then over the other well it be on the quiet the kentuckian nod but she wink she blue eye suspiciously at the boy oh _ he be _ all right well you be down to little minok be not

they would nothing to fear except from one another on the top of the divide that give they they last glimpse of rampart she stop a instant and look back the quick flash of anxiety deepen to defiance make the other turn the bit they could see of the water-front thoroughfare be alive the inhabitant be rush about like a swarm of agitate ant what be happen it be get out she explode indignantly they be comin ' too she turn fly down the steep incline and then settle into a steady determine gait that make she gain on the man who have get so long a start she late companion stand look back in sheer amazement for the town end of the trail be black with figure the boy begin to laugh look if there be not old jansen and he squaw wife the rheumatic cripple huddle on a sled be draw by a native man and push by a native woman they could hear he swearing at both impartially in broken english and chinook the colonel and the boy hurry after maudie it be some minute before they catch up the boy feeling that he could not be stand-offish in the very act of profit by she acquaintance begin to tell she about the cripple but undaunted swede she make no answer just trot steadily on the boy hazard another remark -- a opinion that she be make uncommon good time for a woman you 'll want all the wind you get before you get back she say shortly and silence fall on the stampeder some of the young man behind be catch up maudie set she mouth very firm and quicken she pace this spectacle touch up those that follow they break into a canter flounder in a drift recover and pass on maudie pull up that be all

short-breathed hilarity we 'll be treadin ' on you heel in a minute but they be badly blow maudie waste not a syllable she mouth begin to look draw there be violet shadow under the straight-looking eye the colonel glance at she now and then be she think about that four-year-old be maudie stampedin ' through the snow so that other little woman need never dance at the alcazar no the colonel know well enough that maudie rather like this stampedin ' business she have pass one of those man who have get the long start of she he carry a pack once in a while she would turn she strained-looking face over she shoulder glance back with the frank eye of a enemy at she fellow-citizen labor along the trail come on colonel she command with a new sharpness keep up you lick but the colonel have have about enough of this gait from now on he fall more and more behind but the boy be with she neck and neck guess you be goin ' to get there guess i be some man behind they begin to run they pass they have pull off they parki and leave they where they fall they throw off they cap now and the sweat roll down they face not a countenance but wear that immobile look the fix unseeing eye of the spend runner who be overtax heart and lung not only maudie now but everyone be silent occasionally a man would rouse himself out of a walk as if out of sleep and run a few yard go the more weakly after several of the man who have be behind catch up where be kentucky if maudie wonder she waste no time over the speculation for he own good she have admonish he to keep up he lick but of course the main thing be that maudie should keep up hers what if this be the great day of my life think the boy shall i always look back to this why it be Sunday wonder if kentucky remember never pause the boy glance back vaguely amuse and see the colonel plunge heavily along in front of half a dozen who be obviously out of condition for such a expedition -- eye bloodshot lumber on with nervous whisky gait now whip into a breathless gallop now half fall by the way another of the gold nugget woman with two groggy-looking man and somewhere down the trail the cripple swede swearing at he squaw a dreamy feeling come over the boy where in the gold basin of the north be this kind of thing not happen -- finish yesterday or plan for to-morrow yes it be typical between patch of ragged black spruce wide stretch of snow-covered moss under a lower sky and a mob of man flounder through the drift to find a fortune see how they run -- mad mouse they would be go on stampede all winter and would go year in year out until they die the prize be not for such as they as for himself -- ah it be a great day for he he be go at last to claim that gold-mine he have come so far to find this be the decisive moment of he life at the thought he straighten up and pass maudie she give he a single sidelong look unfriendly even fierce that be because he could run like sixty and keep it up when i be a millionaire i shall always remember that i be rich because i win the race a dizzy feeling come over he he seem to be run through some softly resist medium like water -- no like wine jelly he heart be pound up in he throat what if something 's wrong and i drop dead on the way to my mine well kentucky 'll look after thing maudie have catch up again and here be little minok at last a couple of man who from the beginning have be well in advance of everyone else and often out of sight have seem for the last five minute to be lose ground but now they put on steam maudie too she step out of she snowshoe and fling they up on the low roof of the first cabin then she duck she head crooked she arm at the elbow and with fist uplift she break into a run jump from pile to pile of frozen pay glide under sluice-box scramble up the bank slip on the rot ice recover dash on over fall timber and through waist-deep drift on beyond no 10 up to the bench above when the boy get to pitcairn 's prospect hole there be already six claim go he proceed to stake the seventh next to maudie 's that person with flaming cheek be drive she last location-post into a snow-drift with a piece of water-worn obsidian the colonel come along in time to stake no 14 below under maudie 's personal supervision not much use in she opinion except that with gold it be where you find it and that be all any man can tell you as she be return alone to she own claim behold two brawny circle city miner pull out she stake and put in they own she fly at they with remark unprintable you keep you head shut advise one of the man a big evil-looking fellow this be we claim first we be here with pitcairn yesterday somebody 's take away we location-post you take I for a cheechalko she scream and she blue eye flash like smitten

you take a joke no this be not my day for jokin ' you want to put they stake o ' mine back she stand on guard till it be do and now i would advise you like a mother to back-track home you 'll find this climate very tryin ' to you health they go farther up the slope and mark out a claim on the incline above the bench in a few hour the mountain-side be stake to the very top and still the stream of people struggle out from rampart to the scene of the new strike all day long and all the night the trail be alive with the come or the go of the five hundred and odd soul that make up the population in the town itself the excitement grow rather than wane man talk themselves into a fever other take fire and the epidemic spread like some obscure nervous disease nobody sleep everybody drink and hurrahe and say it be the greatest night in the history of minok in the gold nugget saloon crowd to suffocation pitcairn organize the new mining district and name it the idaho bar french

audacious jig even maudie have ever present to the gold nugget patron the miner yell with delight one of they catch she up and put she on the counter of the bar where no whit at a loss she curvet and spin among the bottle and the glass as lightly as a dragonfly dip and whirl along a summer brook the enthusiasm grow delirious the man begin to throw nugget at she and maudie never pause in the dance

' shack lookin ' f trouble chapter xix the ice go out i be apart of all that i have see it have be thaw and freezing freezing and thawing for so long that man lose account of the advance of a summer come with such balk uncertain step indeed the weather variation have for several week be so great that no journey not the smallest could be calculate with any assurance the last man to reach minok be two who have make a hunting and prospect trip to a outlying district they have go there in six day and be nineteen in return the slush be waist-deep in the gulch on the bench in the snow hole appear as though red-hot stone have be throw upon the surface the little settlement by the mouth of the minok sit insecurely on the boggy hillside and its inhabitant wade knee-deep in soak tundra moss and mire and now down on the never-know-what water be begin to run on the marginal ice up on the mountain the drift snow be honey-combed whole field of it give way and sink a foot under any adventurous shoe but although these change have be work slowly with backset of bitter night when everything be freeze hard as flint the illusion be general that summer come in with a bind on the 9th of may minok go to bed in winter and wake to find the snow almost go under the last nineteen hour of hot unwinking sunshine and the first goose wing they way up the valley -- sight to stir man 's heart stranger still the eight month ' arctic silence break suddenly by a thousand voice under every snow-bank a summer murmur very faint at first but hourly louder -- the sound of fall water softly sing over all the land as silence have be the distinguish feature of the winter so be noise the sign of the spring no ear so dull but now be full of it all the brook on all the hill tinkle tumble babbling of some great and universal joy all the stream of all the gulch join with every little rill to find the old way or to carve a new back to the father of water and the strange thing have happen on the yukon the shore-edge of the ice seem sunken and the water run yet deeper there but of a certainty the middle part have rise the cheechalko think it a optical illusion but old brandt from forty-mile have see the ice go out for two-and-twenty year and he say it go out always so -- hump he back a ' git up git and when he be a gitten ' jest look out those who in spite of warn venture in hip-boot down on the never-know-what find that in place the under side of the ice be worn nearly through if you bent you head and listen you could plainly hear that greater music of the river run underneath low as yet but deep and strangely stir -- dominate in the hearer 's ear all the clear high clamor from gulch and hill in some man 's heart the ice go out at the sound and the melting well up in they eye summer and liberty be very near oh hurry yukon inua let the ice go out and let the boat come in but the next few day hang heavily the river-ice humped its back still higher but show no disposition to git the wonder be it do not crack under the strain but northern ice ahs the air of be strangely flexile several foot in depth the water run now along the margin more goose and duck appear and flock of little bird -- canada jay robin join the swell chorus of the water oh hurry hurry inua and open the great highway not at minok alone : at every wood camp mining town and mission at every white post and indian village all along the yukon group be gather wait the great moment of the year no one have ever hear of the ice break up before the 11th of may or later than the 28th and yet man have begin to keep a hopeful eye on the river from the 10th of April when a white ptarmigan be report wear a collar of dark-brown feather and he wing tip brown that be a month ago and the great moment could not possibly be far now the first thing everybody do on get up and the last thing everybody do on go to bed be to look at the river it be not easy to go to bed and even if you get so far it be not easy to sleep the sun pour into the cabin by night as well as by day and there be nothing to divide one part of the twenty-four hour from another you sleep when you be too tired to watch the river you breakfast like as not at six in the evening you dine at midnight through all you waking hour you keep a eye on the window overlook the river in you bed you listen for that ancient yukon cry the ice be go out for age it have mean to the timid : beware the fury of the shatter ice-field beware the caprice of the flood watch lest many life go out with the ice as aforetime and for age to the stout-hearted it have mean : make ready the kyak and the birch canoe see that tackle and trap be strong -- for plenty or famine wait upon the hour as the white man wait for boat to-day the man of the older time have wait for the salmon -- for those first impatient adventurer that would force they way under the very ice-jam tenderest and best of the season 's catch as eager to prosecute that journey from the ocean to the klondyke as if they have be man march after the gold boom no one could settle to anything it be by fit and start that the steadier hand indulge even in target practice with a feverish subconsciousness that event be on the way that might make it inconvenient to have lose the art of send a bullet straight after a diminutive tin can hang on a tree have be make to jump at a hundred pace the marksman would glance at the river and forget to fire it be by fit and start that they even drink deeper or play for higher stake the wheel of fortune in the gold nugget be in special demand it be a means of try you luck with satisfactory despatch between drink or between long bout of stare at the river man stand in shirt-sleeve at they cabin door in the unwinking sunshine look up the valley or down bet that the first boat in would be one of those nearest neighbor may west or muckluck come up from woodworth other as ready to back heavily they opinion that the first blast of the steam whistle would come down on the flood from circle or from dawson the colonel have buy and don a new suit of store clothes and urge on he companion the necessity of at least a whole pair of breeches in honor of he entrance into the klondyke but the boy 's fund be low and he vanity chasten besides he have other business on he mind after send several request for the immediate return of he dog request that receive no attention the boy go out to the gulch to recover he nig 's new master pay up all arrears of wages readily enough but decline to surrender the dog oh no the ice be not thinkin ' o ' goin ' out yit i want my dog you 'll git he sure i be glad you understand that much i 'll bring he up to rampart in time for the first boat where 's my dog no answer the boy whistle no nig dread mask itself in choler he jump on the fellow force he down and hammer he till he cry for mercy where 's my dog then he -- he be up to idyho bar whimper the prostrate one and there the boy find he stagger under a pair of saddle-bags hire out to mike o'reilly for a dollar and a half a day together they return to rampart to watch for the boat certainly the ice be very late breaking up this year the man of rampart stand about in group in the small hour of the morning of the 16th of may as usual smoking yarning speculate invent elaborate josh somebody remember that certain cheechalko have go to bed at midnight now this be unprecedented even impertinent if the river be not open by the middle of may you sour-dough may go to bed -- only he do not still he may do as he list but you cheechalko -- why this be the hour of he initiation it be as if a man should yawn at he marriage or refuse to sleep at he funeral the offender be some of those woodworth fellow who with a dozen or so other have build shack below the street yet well above the river at two in the morning sour-dough saunder knock they up the ice be goin ' out in a flash the sleeper stand at the door only a josh one show fight well it be true what i be tellin ' yer persist saunder seriously : the ice be goin ' out and it be goin ' soon and when you be wash out o ' yer bunk ye need not blame I fur i warn yer you do not mean the flood 'll come up here mebbe you have arrange so she will not this year the cheechalko consult in the end four of they occupy the next two hour -lrb- to the infinite but mask amusement of the town -rrb- in flounder about in the mud set up tent in the boggy wood above the settlement and with much pain transport thither as many of they possession as they do not lose in the bottomless pit of the mire when the business be end minok self-control give way the cheechalko find themselves the laughing-stock of the town the other who have dare to build down on the bank but who have not scared worth a cent saunter up to the gold nugget to enjoy the increase esteem of the sour-dough and the humiliation of the man who have think the yukon be goin ' over the rampart this year -- haw haw it surprise the average mind to discover that one of civilization 's most delicate weapon be in such use and be so potently dread among the roughest frontier spirit no fine gentleman in a drawing-room no sensitive girl shrink more from what meredith call the comic laugh none feel irony more keenly than you ordinary american pioneer the man who have move up into the soak wood see they have run a risk as great to they as the fabled danger of the river -- the risk of the josher 's irony the dire humiliation of the laugh if a man up here do you a injury and you kill he you have not after all take the ultimate revenge you might have get the laugh on he and let he live to hear it while all minok be jolly the woodworth man maudie make one of she sudden raid out of the gold nugget she stand nearly up to the knee of she high rubber boot in the bog of main street talk earnestly with the colonel keith and the boy sit on a store box outside of the saloon have look on at the fun over the timid cheechalko and look on now at maudie and the colonel it cross the boy 's mind that they would be put up a josh on he pardner pretty soon and at the thought he frown keith have be say that the old miner have nearly all get squawed he have speak almost superstitiously of the queer lasting effect of the supposedly temporary arrangement no they do not leave they wife as often as you would expect but in most case it seem to kill the pride of the man he give up all idea of ever go home and even if he make a fortune they say he stay on here and year by year he sink lower and lower till he be farther down in the scale of thing human than he savage wife yes it be awful to think how the life up here can take the stiffen out of a fellum he look darkly at the two out there in the mud keith nod strong man have lie down on the trail this winter and cry but it be not that sort of thing the other mean keith follow he new friend 's glowering look yes that be just the kind of man that get take in what say the boy brusquely just the sort that go and marry some flighty creature well say he pardner haughtily he could afford to marry ' a flighty creature ' the colonel 's get both foot on the ground and keith feel properly snub but what maudie be say to the colonel be : you be goin ' up in the first boat i s ` pose yes look like i 'll be the only person leave in minok i do not imagine you 'll be quite alone no why there be only between five and six hundred expectin ' to board a boat that 'll be crowd before she get here do everybody want to go to dawson everybody except a few boomer who mean to stay long enough to play off they misery on someone else before they move on the colonel look a trifle anxious i have not think of that i suppose there will be a race for the boat there 'll be a race all the way up the river for all the early boat be not half enough to carry the people but you look to I like you 'll stand as good a chance as most and anyhow you be the one man i know i 'll trust my dough to the colonel stare you see i want to get some money to my kiddie a ' besides i get m ` self kind o ' scare about keepin ' dust in my cabin i want it in a bank so 's if i should kick the bucket -lrb- there 'll be some pretty high rollin ' here when there be be a few boat in and my life 's no better than any other feller 's -rrb- i would feel a lot easier if i know the kiddie would have six thousand clear even if i do turn up my toe see a -- yes -- i see but -- the door of the cabin next the saloon open suddenly a graybeard with a young face come out rub the sleep from he eye he stare interrogatively at the river and then to the world in general : what time be it half-past four mornin ' or evenin ' and no one think the question strange maudie lower she voice no need to mention it to pardner and people you do not want every feller to know you be goin ' about loaded but will you take my dust up to dawson and get it send to ` frisco on the first boat the ice the ice it be move the ice be go out look the ice from end to end of the settlement the cry be take up people dart out of cabin like beaver out of they burrow three little half-breed indian boy yell with excitement tear past the gold nugget cry now in they mother 's minok now in they father 's english the ice be go out from the depths of the store-box whereon he master have sit nig dart howling excitedly and wave a muddy tail like a draggled banner say in mahlemeut : the ice be go out the fish be come in all the other dog wake and give tongue run in and out among the huddle row of people gather on the rampart every ear full of the rub grind noise that come up out of the yukon -- noise not loud but deep -- a undercurrent of heavy sound as they stand there wide-eyed gaping they solid winter world begin to move a compact mass of ice three-quarter of a mile wide and four mile long with a great grind and crush go down the valley some distance below the town it jam building with incredible quickness a barrier twenty foot high the people wait breathless again the ice-mass tremble but the watcher lift they eye to the height above be that thunder in the hill no the ice again again crush grind to the low accompaniment of thunder that seem to come from far away section a mile long and half a mile wide be force up carry over the first ice-pack and summarily stop below the barrier huge piece break off from the side come crunch they way angrily up the bank as if act on some independent impulse there they sit great fragment glisten in the sunlight as big as cabin it be something to see they come walk up the shelve bank the cheechalko who laugh before be contented now with run leave they goods behind sour-dough saunder himself never dream the ice would push its way so far in mid-channel a still unbroken sheet be bent yet more in the center every now and then a wide crack open near the margin and the water rush out with a roar once more the mass be nearly still and now all 's silent not till the water dam and throw back by the ice not until it rise many foot and come down with a volume and momentum irresistible will the final conflict come hour after hour the people stand there on the bank wait to see the barrier go down unwillingly as the time go on this one that one hurry away for a few minute to prepare and devour a meal back again breathless upon rumor of that preparatory tremble that strange thrilling of the ice the grind and the crush have begin again the long tension the mysterious sound the sense of some great unbridled power at work work on the steadiest nerve people do the oddest thing down at the lower end of the town a couple of miner sick of the scurvy have painfully clamber on they roof -- whether to see the sight or be out of harm 's way no one know the stingiest man in minok who have refuse to help they in they cabin carry they food on the roof a woman make and take they the yukon remedy for they disease they sit in state in sight of all man and drink spruce tea by one o'clock in the afternoon the river have rise eight foot but the ice barrier still hold the people wear out go away to sleep all that night the barrier hold though more ice come down and still the water rise twelve foot now the rank of shatter ice along the shore be claim again as the flood widen and lick they in the cheechalko ' cabin be flood to the cave stout fellow in hip-boot take a boat and rescue the scurvy-stricken from the roof and still the barrier hold people begin to go about they usual avocation the empty gold nugget fill again man sit as they have do all the winter drinking and read the news of eight month before out of soil and tattered papers late the follow day everyone start up at a new sound again miner indian and dog line the bank see the pile ice mass tremble hear a crash and grind as of mountain of glass hurl together see the barrier give way and the frozen waste move down on the bosom of the flood higher yet the water rise -- the current run eight mile a hour and now the ice mass be less enormous more broken somewhere far below another jam another long bout of wait bird be sing everywhere between the white snowdrift the arctic moss show green and yellow white flower star the hill half the town be packed ready to catch the boat at five minute ' notice with door bar and red curtain down maudie be do up she gold-dust for the colonel to take to dawson the man who have wash it out of a birch creek placer and blow it in fur the girl -- up on the hillside he sleep sound the two who have break the record for winter travel on the yukon side by side in the sunshine on a plank lay across two mackerel firkin sit and watch the brimming flood they speak of the big chimney man picture they packed and wait for the oklahoma wonder what they have do with kaviak and what the three month have bring they when we start out that day from the big chimney we think we would be make if only we manage to reach minok well we have get what we come for -- each get a claim oh yes a good claim too guess so do not you know the gold 's there yes but where be the miner you and i do not propose to spend the next ten year in gettin ' that gold out no but there be plenty who would if we give 'em the chance all we have to do be to give the right one the chance the colonel wear a air of reflection the district will be open up the boy go on cheerfully and we 'll have people beggin ' we to let 'em get out we gold and givin ' we the lion 's share for the privilege do you altogether like the sound o ' that i expect like other people i 'll like the result we ought to see some thing clearer than other people we have we lesson on the trail say the colonel quietly nobody ought ever to be able to fool we about the power and the value of the individual apart from society seem as if association do make value in the absence of man and market a pit full of gold be worth no more than a pit full of clay oh yes i admit till the boat come in we be poor man nobody will stop here this summer -- they 'll all be race on to dawson dawson 's ` it ' beyond a doubt the colonel laugh a little ruefully we use to say minok i say minok just to sound reasonable but of course i mean dawson and they sit there think watch the ice-block meet crash go down in foam and come up again on the lower reach the boy idly swing the great katharine 's medal to and fro in he buckskin pocket it have worn so bright it catch at the light like a coin fresh from the mint no doubt muckluck be on the river-bank at pymeut the one-eyed prince the story-teller yagorsha even ol' chief -- no one will be indoors to-day sit there together they see the last stand make by the ice and share that moment when the final barrier somewhere far below give way with boom and thunder the mighty flood run free tear up tree by they root as it run detach mass of rock dissolve island into swirl sand and drift carve new channel make and unmake the land the water begin to fall it have be a great time : it be end pardner say the colonel we have see the ice go out no fellum can call you and I cheechalko after to-day no sah we have travel the long trail we have see the ice go out and we be friend yet the kentuckian take he pardner 's brown hand with a gentle solemnity seem about to say something but stop and turn he bronzed face to the flood carry back upon some sudden tide within himself to those black day on the trail that he want most in the world to forget but in he heart he know that all dear thing all thing kind and precious -- he home a woman 's face -- all all would fade before he forget those last day on the trail the record of that journey be burn into the brain of the man who have make it on that stretch of the long trail the elder have grow old and the younger have forever lose he youth not only have the roundness go out of he face not only be it scar but such line be grave there as commonly take the antique pencil half a score of year to trace something have happen the colonel say quite low we be not the same man who leave the big chimney right say the boy with a laugh unwilling as yet to accept he own personal revelation prefer to put a superficial interpretation on he companion 's word he glance at the colonel and he face change a little but still he would not understand look down at the chaparejo that he have be so proud of sadly abbreviate to make boot for nig jag here and there and with fringe now not all intentional it suit he to pretend that the shap have suffer most yes the ice take the kink out whether the thing that be happen be good or evil i do not pretend to say the other go on gravely stare at the river i only know something 's happen there be possibility -- in I anyhow -- that have be freeze to death yes we be different the boy rouse himself but only to persist in he misinterpretation you be not different to hurt if i start out again tomorrow -- the lord forbid aman but if i have to you be the only man in alaska -- in the world -- i would want for my pardner boy -- he wrestle with a slight bronchial huskiness clear he throat try again and give it up content himself with beg you pardon for callin ' you ` boy ' you be a seasoned old-timer sah and the boy feel as if some sovereign have dub he knight in a day or two now from north or south the first boat must appear the willow be unfold they silver leave the alder-bud be burst goose and teal and mallard swarm about the river margin especially where the equiseta show the tip of they feathery green tail above the mud duck flock and feast people be too excited too busy they say look for the boat to do much shooting the shy bird wax daring keith standing by he shack knock over a mallard within forty pace of he door it be eight day after that first cry the ice be go out four since the final jam give way and let the floe run free that at one o'clock in the afternoon the shout go up a boat a boat only a lumberman 's bateau but two man be pole she down the current with a skill that match the speed they swing she in a dozen hand catch at the painter and make fast a young man step ashore and introduce himself as van alen benham 's upper river pardner on the way to anvik he companion donovan be from circle city and bring appalling news the boat depend on for the early summer traffic bellum and three other nat and t steamer as well as the ac 's victorium and the st michael have be lift up by the ice like so many feather force clean out of the channel and leave high and dry on a sandy ridge with a ice wall eighty foot wide and fifteen high between they and open water all the crew hard at work with jackscrew say donovan and if they can get skid under and a channel blast through the ice they may get the boat down here in fifteen or twenty day a heavy blow but instantly everyone begin to talk of the may west and the muckluck as though all along they have look for succor to come up-stream rather than down but as the precious hour pass a deep dejection fasten on the camp there have be a year when through one disaster after another no boat have get to the upper river not even the arrival from dawson of the montana kid pugilist and gambler could raise spirit so cast down not even though he be say to bring strange news from outside there be war in the world down yonder -- war have be formally declare between america and spain windy slap he thigh in humourous despair why have not he think o ' gettin ' off a josh like that to those who listen to the montana kid to the fret spirit of man eight month imprison the state and she foreign affair be far away indeed and as for the other party to the rumor war -- spain they clutch at school memory of columbus american find through he the way to spain as through he spaniard have find the way to america so spain be not merely a state historic she be still in the active world but what do these thing matter boat matter : the place where the klondyker be catch this minok matter and so do the place they want to reach -- dawson matter most of all by the narrow habit of long month dawson be the center of the universe more little boat go down and still nothing go up man say gloomily : we be do for the fellow who go by the canadian route will get everything the dawson season will be half over before we be in the field -- if we ever be the 28th of may still no steamer have come but the mosquito have -- bloodthirsty beyond any the temperate climate know it be clear that some catastrophe have befall the woodworth boat and nig have be lure away by he quondam master no they have not go back to the gulch -- that be too easy the man have a mind to keep the dog and since he be not allow to buy he he would do the other thing he have not be go a hour rumor say -- have take a scow and provision and drop down the river utterly desperate the boy seize he new nulato gun and somebody else 's canoe without so much as inquire whose he shoot down the swift current after the dog-thief he roar back to the remonstrate colonel that he do not care if a up-river steamer do come while he be go -- he be goin ' gunnin ' at the same time he share the now general opinion that a lower river boat would reach they first and he be only go to meet she meting justice by the way he have go safely more than ten mile down when suddenly as he be pass a island he stand up in he boat balanced himself and cock he gun down there on the leave a man be stand knee-deep in the water try to free he boat from a fall tree a siwash dog watch he from the bank the boy whistle the dog throw up he nose yap and whine the man have turn sharply see he enemy and the level gun he jump into the boat but she be fill while he bail the dog run along the island howl fit to raise the dead when he be a little above the boy 's boat he plunge into the river nig be a good swimmer but the current here would tax the best the boy find himself so occupy with save nig from a watery grave while he keep the canoe from capsize that he forget all about the thief till a turn in the river shut he out of sight the canoe be moor and while try to restrain nig 's drip caress he master look up and see something queer off there above the top of the cottonwood as he look he forget the dog -- forget everything in earth or heaven except that narrow cloud waver along the sky he sit immovable in the round-shouldered attitude learn in pull a hand-sled against a gale from the pole if you be moderately excite you may start but there be a excitement that nail you nig shake he wolf 's coat and spray the water far and wide make little joyful noise and lick the face that be so still but he master like a man of stone stare at that long gray pennon in the sky if it be not a steamer what be it like a echo out of some lesson he have learn and long forget up-bound boat do not run the channel : they have to hunt for easy water suddenly he leap up the canoe tip and nig go a second time into the water well for he that they be near the shore he could jump in without help this time no hand hold out no eye for he he master have drag the painter free seize the oar and say harshly lie down you black devil he pull back against the current with every ounce he have in he for the gray pennon be go round the other side of the island and the boy be lose the boat to dawson nig sit perkily in the bow never budge till he master run into the head of the island catch up a handful of tough root fringe and hold fast by they wave he cap and shout like one possess let go the fringe catch up he gun and fire then nig realize that for once in a way noise seem to be popular point he nose at the big object hug the farther shore and howl with a right goodwill they see they see hooray the boy wave he arm embrace nig then snatch up the oar the steamer 's engine be reverse now she be still the boy pull lustily a crowded ship crew and passenger press to the rail the steamer cant and the captain 's order ring out clear several cheechalko lay they hand on they gun as the wild fellow in the ragged buckskin shoot round the motionless wheel and bring he canoe ` long-side while he savage-looking dog still keep the echo of the lower rampart call three cheer for the oklahoma at the sound of the boy 's voice a red face hang over the stern break into a broad grin be the siven air ye the little divvle himself or air ye the divvle 's gran ` fatherr the apparition in the canoe be make fast and prepare to board the ship can not take another passenger full up say the captain he could not hear what be say in reply but he shake he head be refusin ' 'em right along then as if reproach by the look in the wild young face we think you be in trouble so i be if you will not -- i tell you we get every ounce we can carry oh take I back to minok anyway he say a few word about fare to the captain 's back as that magnate do not distinctly say no -- indeed walk off make conversation with the engineer -- twenty hand help the new passenger to get nig and the canoe on board well get a gold-mine ask pott yes sir where 's the colonel mac rasp out with he square jaw set for judgment colonel 's all right -- at minok we have get a gold-mine apiece anny gowld in 'em yes sir and no salt neither sorry to see success have go to you head drawl pott eye the boy 's long hair i do not see any undue sign of it elsewhere faith i do thin he be turn wan o ' thim hungry grabbin ' millionaire what make you think that laugh the boy poke he brown finger through the knee-hole of he breeches arre ye contint wid that gowld-mine at minok no be the siven what be wan gowld-mine to a millionaire what forr wud ye be prospectin that desert oiland you and yer faithful man froyday if ye be not roon intoirely be riches the boy tear himself away from he old friend and follow the arbiter of he fate the engine have start up again and they be go on i be tell say the captain rather severely that minok 's a busted camp oh be it return the ragged one cheerfully then he remember that this captain rainey have grub-stake a man in the autumn -- a man who be report to know where to look for the mother lode the mighty parent of the yukon placer i can tell you the fact about minok he follow the captain up on the hurricane-deck give he detail about the new strike and the wonderful richness of idaho bar nobody would know about it to-day but that the right man go prospect there -lrb- one in the eye for whoever say minok be bust and another for the prospector rainey have send to look for -- -rrb- you see man like pitcairn have give up lookin ' for the mother lode they say you might as well look for mother eve you get to make out with she descendant yukon gold pitcairn say come from a older rock series than this -- he stand in the shower of spark constantly spray from the smoke-stack to the fireproof deck and he wave he hand airily at the red rock of the rampart -- far older than any of these the gold up here have all come out o ' rock that go out o ' the rock business million o ' year ago most o ' that mother lode the miner be lookin ' for be sand now thirteen hundred mile away in norton sound just my luck say the captain gloomily go a little for ` ard as though definitely give up mining and return to he own proper business but the rest o ' the mother lode the gold and magnetic iron be too heavy to travel that be what be linin ' the gold basin o ' the north -- linin ' idaho bar thick the captain sigh twelve a voice sing out on the lower deck twelve repeat the captain twelve echo the pilot at the wheel twelve and a half from the man below a tall lean fellow cast the sounding-pole with a rhythmic nonchalance he plant the long black and white staff at the ship 's side draw it up drip plunge it down again draw it up and send it down hour after hour he never seem to tire he never seem to see anything but the water-mark never to say anything but what he be chant now twelve and a half or some variation merely numerical you come to think he as little human as the calendar only that he number be tell off with the significance of sound the suggest menace of a cry if the sound come too near the steamer 's draught or the pilot fail to hear the read the captain repeat it he often do so when there be no need it be a form of conversation noncommittal yet smack of authority ten ten echo the pilot while the captain be admit that he have be mine vicariously for twenty year and never make a cent always keep thinkin ' i 'll soon be able to give up steamboatin ' and buy a farm he shake he head as one who see he last hope fade but he ragged companion turn suddenly and while the spark fall in a fresh shower well captain say he you have get the chance of you life right now ten and a half just what they have all say wish i have the money i have waste on grub-stakin ' the ragged one thrust he hand in the pocket of he chaparejo i grub-staked myself and i be very glad i do nobody in with you no nine echo nine ten pitcairn say somehow or other there be be gold-washin ' goin ' on up here pretty well ever since the world begin indian no seem to have be a bigger job than even white man could manage instead o ' stamp-mills glacier grindin ' up the mother lode instead o ' little sluice-box river instead o ' riffle gravel bottom work work wash wash day and night every summer for a million year never a clean-up since the foundation of the world no sir waitin ' for we to do that -- waitin ' now up on idaho bar the captain look at he try to conceal the envy in he soul they be sound low water but he never hear he look round sharply as the course change i have do my assessment the ragged man go on joyously and i be go to dawson this be bad navigation he feel instantly he have strike a snag the captain smile and pass on sound : nine and a half but i have get a fortune on the bar i be not a boomer but i believe in the bar six six gettin ' into low water again the steamer swing out hunting a new channel pitcairn 's opinion be think a lot of the geologic survey man listen to pitcairn he help they one year he be one of those extraordinary old miner who can tell from the look of thing without even panning when he see that pyrites on idaho bar he stop dead ` this look good to I ' he say and jee-rusalem it be good they stare at the rampart grow bolder the river hurry like a mill-race the steamer feel its way slow and cautiously like a blind man with a stick seven seven seven six and a half pitcairn say gold be always thickest on the inside of a elbow or turn in the stream it be in a place like that my claim be the steamer swerve still further out from the course indicate on the chart the pilot be still hunting a new channel but still the captain stand and listen and it be not to the sound of the yukon bar they say there be no doubt about the whole country be glaciate hey sign of glacial erosion everywhere the captain look sharply about as if he ship might be in some new danger no doubt the gold be all concentrate oh be that so he seem relieve on the whole eight and a half from below eight and a half from the captain eight and a half from the pilot-house concentrate eh something arrest rich-sounding in the news -- a triple essence of the perfume of riches with the incantation of technical phrase over the witch-brew of adventure gambling and romance that simmer in the mind when man tell of find gold in the ground with the addition of this salt of science come a savor of homely virtue a aroma promising sustenance and strength it confound suspicion and see unbelief first weaken and at last do reverence there be something hypnotic in the terminology enthusiasm even back by fact will scare off you practical man who yet will turn to listen to the theory of the mechanic of erosion and one of its proof -- up there before we eye the striation of the rampart but rainey be what he call a old bird he squint pilot-eye come back from the glacier track and fall on the outlandish figure of he passenger and with a inward admiration of he quality of extreme old-birdness the captain struggle against the trance do not i hear you say something about go to dawson y-yes i think dawson 'll be worth see holy mose yes there be never be anything like dawson before and i want to talk to the big business man there i be not a miner myself i mean to put my property on the market as he say the word it occur to he unpleasantly how very like mcginty they sound but he go on : i do not dream of spending so much time up here as i have put in already i have get to get back to the state you have any proposition yet the captain lead the way to he private room about my claim not yet but once i get it on the market -- so full be he of a scheme of he own he fail to see that he have no need to go to dawson for a buyer the captain set out drink and still the talk be of the bar it have come now to seem impossible even to a old bird that give those exact condition gold should not be gather thick along that bar i regard it as a sure thing anyhow it be record and the assessment 's do all the district want now be capital to develop it district like that all over the map say the old bird with a final flutter of caution even if the capital 's find -- if everything 's ready for work the summer 's damn short but if it be a question of goin ' huntin ' for the means of workin ' -- there be time return the other quietly but there be none to waste you take I and my pardner -- think you do not have a pardner snap the other hot over such duplicity not in ownership he be get another claim but you take my pardner and I to dawson -- the captain stand on he leg and roar : i can not i tell you you can if you will -- you will if you want that farm rainey gape take we to dawson and i 'll get a deed draw up in minok turn over one-third of my idaho bar property to john r rainey john r rainey gape the more and then find he tongue : no no i would just as soon come in on the bar but it be true what i be tellin ' you there simply be not a unoccupied inch on the oklahoma this trip it be be somethin' awful the way i have be waylay and pray at for a passage people starvin ' with bag o ' money waitin ' for 'em at the dawson bank settlement under water -- man up in tree callin ' to we to stop for the love of god -- man in boat crossin ' we channel headin ' we off thinkin ' nothin ' o ' the risk o ' bein ' run down ` take we to dawson ' it be the cry for fifteen hundred mile oh come you stop for I the captain smile shrewdly i do not think it necessary at the time to explain we would strike bottom just then -- new channel you know it change a lot every time the ice go out and the flood come down i reverse we engine and go up to talk to the pilot we back off just after you board we i must have be rattle to take you even to minok no it be the best turn you have do yourself in a long while the captain shake he head it be true : the passenger of the oklahoma be crowd like cattle on a kansas stock-car he know he ought to unload and let a good portion wait at minok for that unknown quantity the next boat he would issue the order but that he know it would mean a mutiny i 'll get into trouble for overload as it be you probably will not people be too busy up here if you do i be offerin ' you a good many thousand dollar for the risk god bless my soul where would i put you there be not a bunk i have sleep by the week on the ice there be not room to lie down then we 'll stand up lord lord what could you do with such a man owner of idaho bar too mechanic of erosion concentrate a third interest -- it all ring in he head i have get nine feller sleepin ' in here he say helplessly in my room can we come if we find we own place and do not trouble you well i will not have any pardner -- but perhaps you -- oh pardner 's get to come too whatever the captain say the nerve-tearing shriek of the whistle drown it be promptly reply to by the most horrible howl reckon that be nig he be get to come too say this dreadful ragged man god bless I this must be minok the harass captain hustle out you must wait long enough here to get that deed draw captain call out the other as he fly down the companionway nearly six hundred people on the bank suddenly control he eagerness the boy contented himself with stand back and stare across strange shoulder at the place he know so well there be the worst-lookin ' shack in the town that have be he home the a c store loom importantly the gold nugget and hardly a face to which he could not give a name and a history : windy jim and the cripple swede bonsor cheek by jowl with he enemy mcginty judge corey spit straight and far the gorgeous bartender all check and diamond in front of a pitiful group of the scurvy-stricken -lrb- thirty of they in the town wait for rescue by the steamer -rrb- butt quite bland under the crooked cottonwood with never a thought of how near he have come on that very spot to miss the first boat of the year and all the boat of all the year to follow maudie keith and the colonel stand with the a c agent at the end of the baggage-bordered plank-walk that lead to the landing behind they at least four hundred people packed and wait with they possession at they foot ready to be put aboard the instant the oklahoma make fast the captain have call out howdy to the a c agent and several greeting be shout back and forth maudie mount a huge pile of baggage and sit there as on a throne the colonel and keith perch on a heap of gunny-sack at she foot that woman almost the only person in sight who do not expect by means of the oklahoma to leave misery behind the boy stand think how will they bear it when they know the oklahoma be late but she be not only the first boat -- she might conceivably be the last pott and o'flynn have spot the man they be look for and call out hello hello as the big fellow on the pile of gunny get up and wave he hat mac lean over the rail say gruffly that you colonel try as the boss of the big chimney saw -- tryin ' he darndest not to look pleased and all the while o'flynn be wave he hat and howl with excitement : how 's the gowld how 's yersilf the gangway begin its slow swing round preparatory to lower into place the mob on shore catch up box bundle bag and press forward no no stand back order the captain take you time say people tremble with excitement there be no rush there be no room call out the purser to a friend no room go from mouth to mouth incredulous that the information could concern the speaker he be only one there be certainly room for he and every man push the harder to be the sole exception to the dreadful verdict stand back there can not take even a pound of freight load to the guard a whirlwind of protest and appeal die away in curse woman weep and sick man turn away they face the dog still howl for nothing be so lacerating to the feeling of you siwash as a steam-whistle blast the memory of it trouble he long after the echo of it die suddenly above the din maudie 's shrill voice : i think that be nig before

exclaim the boy that be all you get maudie burst out indignantly -- all you get for packin ' he stuff down to the landin ' to have it all ready for he and worryin ' yourself into shoe-string for fear

frightened bird come along then look here the colonel burst out that be my stuff it be all the same you bring mine i have get the ticket you and I and nig 's goin ' to the klondyke chapter xx the klondyke poverty be a odious calling -- burton 's anatomy of melancholy on Monday morning the 6th of June they cross the british line but it be not till Wednesday the 8th at four in the afternoon just ten month after leave san francisco that the oklahoma 's passenger see between the volcanic hill on the right bank of the yukon a stretch of boggy tundra whereon hundred of tent gleam pink and saffron just beyond the bold wooded height wear the deep scar of a landslide on its breast just round that bend the klondyke river join the yukon -- for this be dawson headquarters of the richest placer digging the world have see yet wear more the air of a great army encampment for two mile the river-bank shine with sunlit canvas -- tent tent everywhere as far as eye can see a mushroom growth mask the older cabin the water-front swarm with craft scow and canoe birch canvas peterboro the great bateaux of the northern lumberman neat little skiff clumsy raft heavy double-ender whip-saw from green timber with capacity of two to five ton lighter and barge carry as much as forty ton -- all have come through the peril of the upper lake and shoot the canon rapid as the oklahoma steam nearer the town blossom into flag a great murmur increase to a clamor people come swarm down to the water-front wave union jack and star and stripe as well -- what do it all mean a cannon boom gun be fire and as the oklahoma swing into the bank a band begin to play a cheer go up from fifteen thousand throat : hurrah for the first steamer the oklahoma have open the klondyke season of 1898 they get they effect off the boat and pitch the old tent up on the moosehide then follow day full to overflow breathless fevered yet without result beyond a general stringing up of nerve the special spell of dawson be upon they all -- the surface aliveness the inner deadness the sense of be cut off from all the rest of the world as isolate as a man be in a dream with no past no future only a fantastic intensely vivid now this be the summer climate of the klondyke the colonel the boy and captain rainey maintain the illusion of prosecute they affair by frequent the office store and particularly saloon where buyer and seller most do congregate frequent mention be make of a certain valuable piece of property where be it down yonder at minok and then nobody care a straw it be true there be widespread dissatisfaction with the klondyke everyone agree it have be overdo it would support one-quarter of the people already here and ten of thousand on they way say klondyke and instantly you soberest man go mad say anything else and he go deaf minok be a good camp but it have the disadvantage of lie outside the magic district the madness would of course not last but meanwhile the time go by and the people pour in day and night six great steamer full come up from the lower river and still the small craft keep on flock like covey of sea-fowl through the upper lake each party say the crowd be behind on the 14th of June a toy whistle sound shrill above the town and in puff a liliputian steel-hull steamer that have actually come on she own through the canon and shoot the white horse rapid a steamer from the upper river after that other two be wreck but who mind and still the people pour in and still that cry the crowd 's behind and still the clamor for quicker ampler means of transport to the north no matter what it cost the one consideration to get there and to get there quickly bring most of the horde by the canadian route yet as against the two ocean steamer -- all-sufficient the year before to meet the five river boat at st michael 's -- now by the all-american route alone twenty ocean steamer and forty-seven river boat double-decker some two hundred and twenty-five foot long and every one crowd to the guard with people come to the klondyke meanwhile many of those already there be wonder why they come and how they could get home in the ton of mail matter for dawson strand at skaguay must be those instruction from the colonel 's bank at home to the canadian bank of commerce dawson city he agree with the boy that if -- very soon now -- they have not dispose of the minok property they would go to the mine what be the good rasped mac every foot stake for seventy mile for my part admit the boy i be less grand than i be i mean to make some poor devil dig out my minok gold for I it 'll be the other way about : i 'll dig gold for any man on bonanza that 'll pay I wages they sit slapping at the mosquito till a whistle scream on the lower river the boy call to nig and go down to the town to hear the news by-and-by mac come out with a pack and say he would be back in a day or two after he have disappear among the tent -- a conquer army that have force its way far up the hill by now -- the colonel get up and go to the spring for a drink he stand there a long time look out wistfully not towards the common magnet across the klondyke but quite in the other direction towards the nearer gate of exit -- towards home what special brand of fool be i to be here down below nig with hot tongue hang out of the side of he mouth now follow now lead he master come briskly up the slope that be the weare we hear whistlin ' say the boy breathless and who d'you think 's aboard who nichola a ' pymeut pilot a ' he be get princess muckluck along no laugh the colonel follow the boy to the tent what be the princess come for how should i know do not she say do not stop to hear reckon she be right glad to see you chaff the colonel hey be not she i -- do not think she notice i be there what you bolt no reply see here what you doin ' packin ' up where you goin ' be thinkin ' for some time i be not wealthy enough to live in this metropolis there may be a place for a poor man but dawson be not it well i do not think you be that much of a coward -- turnin ' tail like this just because a poor little esquimaux -- besides she may have get over it even the higher race do and he go on poke he fun till suddenly the boy say : you be in such high spirit i suppose you must have hear maudie 's up from minok you be jokin ' it be not my idea of a joke she be comin ' up here soon 's she be land she stuff she be not comin ' up here why not anybody can come up on the moosehide and everybody 's doin ' it i be goin ' to make way for some of 'em do she see you well she be see pott anyhow you be right about dawson say the colonel suddenly it be too rich for my blood they pin a piece of paper on the tent-flap to say they be go prospecting : future movement uncertain each with a small pack and stick out above it the klondyke shovel that have come all the way from san francisco nig behind with provision in he little saddle-bag and tongue farther out than ever they turn they back on dawson cross the lower corner of lot 6 behind the government reserve stare with fresh surprise at the young market-garden flourish there down to the many-islanded klondyke across in the scow-ferry over the corduroy that cheer and deceive the new-comer for that first mile of the bonanza trail on through pool and morass to the thicket of white birch where the colonel think it well to rest awhile yes he feel the heat he say as he pass the time of day with other man go by with pack pack-horse or draught-dog cursing at the trail and at the government that tax the miner so cruelly and then do nothing for they not even make a decent highway to the dominion 's source of revenue but out of the direct ray of the sun the traveller find refreshment and the mosquito be blow away by the keen breeze that seem to come from off some glacier and the bird sing loud and the wild-flower star the birch-grove and the briar-rose weave a tangle on either side the swampy trail on again dip to a little valley -- bonanza creek they stand and look well here we be yes this be what we come for and it be because of this that so vast a machinery of ship engine and complicated human life have be set in motion what be it a dip in the hill where a little stream be catch up into sluice on either side of every line of box heap and windrow of gravel above high on log-cabin staging windlass stretch away on either side gentle slope moss and flower star here and there upon this ancient moose pasture tent and cabin set at random in the bed of the creek up and down in every direction squad of man sweating in the sun -- here where for untold century herd of leisurely and majestic moose have come to quench they thirst in the older cabin they horn still lord it they bone be bleaching in the fire-weed on from claim to claim the new-comer to these rich pasture go till they come to the junction of the el dorado where huddle the haphazard settlement of the grand fork only twelve mile from dawson and now they be at the heart of the richest placer mining district the world have see but they know well enough that every inch be own and that the best they could look for be work as unskilled labourer day shift or night on the claim of luckier man they have bring a letter from ryan of the north-west mount police to the superintendent of no 10 above discovery a claim a little this side of the fork ryan have warn they to keep out of the way of the part-owner scoville austin a surly person naturally so exasperated at the tax and so enraged at the rumor of government spy masquerade as workman check he report that he be a first-rate man to avoid but seymor the superintendent be in the word of the soothing motto of the whole american people all right they leave they pack just inside the door of the log-cabin indicate as bunk house for the man on no 6 above -- a fearsome place where on shelf above shelf among long unwashed bedclothes the unwashed workman of a prosperous company lay in the stupor of sore fatigue and semi-asphyxiation someone stir as the door open and out of the fetid dusk of the unventilated closely-shuttered cabin come a voice : night shift on no then damn you shut the door as the never-resting sun force the dawson market-garden and the wild-rose of the trail so here on the creek man must follow the strenuous example no pause in the grow or the toiling of this northern world the day-gang on no 0 be hard at it down there where lengthwise in the channel be prop a line of sluice-box steady by regularly space pole lay from box to bank on gravel ridge look down from above the whole be like a huge fish-bone lie along the bed of the creek a little group of man with pick shovel and wheelbarrow be reduce the dump of winter pay pile beside a windlass convey it to the sluice other man in line four or five foot below the level of the box be strip pick and shovel the gravel off the bed-rock -- no easy business for even this summer temperature thaw but a few inch a day and below the frost of ten thousand year cement the rubble into iron where be the superintendent that be seymor in the straw hat it be feel that even the broken and dilapidated article mention be a distinction and a luxury yes it be too hot up here in the klondyke they make they way to the man in authority a dark quiet-mannered person with big gentle eye not the sort of superintendent they have expect to find represent such a man as the owner of no 0 have read ryan 's letter and slowly scan the applicant : what do you know about it he nod at the sluice all of nothing say the boy do it call for any particular know ask the colonel call for muscle and plenty of keep-at-it he voice be soft but as the colonel look at he he realize why a hard fellow like scoville austin have make this southerner superintendent better just try we i can use one more man on the night shift a dollar and a half a hour all right say the boy the colonel look at he be this job yours or mine the superintendent have go up towards the dam whichever you say the boy do not like to suggest that the colonel seem little fit for this kind of exercise they have be in the klondyke long enough to know that to be in work be to be in luck i 'll tell you the younger man say quickly answer something unspoken but plain in the colonel 's face i 'll go up the gulch and see what else there be it cross he mind that there might be something less arduous than this shovelling in the wet thaw or pick at frozen gravel in the hot sun if so the colonel might be induce to exchange it be obvious that like so many southerner he stand the sun very ill while they be agree upon a rendezvous the superintendent come back we bunk-house be yonder he say point a kind of sickness come over the kentuckian as he recall the place he turn to he pardner wish we would get a pack-mule and bring we tent out from dawson then apologetically to the superintendent : you see sah there be man who take to bunk-house just as there be woman who want to live in hotel and there be other who want a place to call home even if it be a tent the superintendent smile that be the way we feel about it in alabama he reflect a instant there be that big new tent up there on the hill next to the buckeye ' cabin good tent belong to a couple o ' rich englishman third owner in no 0 go to atlin tell I to do what i like with that tent you might bunk there while they be away now that be mighty good of you sah next whose cabin do you say oh i do not know they name they have a lay on seventeen ohio man they be call buck one and buck two anybody 'll show you to the buckeye ' and he turn away to shout gate for the head of water be too strong and he stride off towards the lock as the boy tramp about look for work he meet a great many on the same quest it seem as if the colonel have secure the sole job on the creek still vacancy might occur any hour in the big new tent the colonel lay asleep on a little camp-bed -lrb- mercifully leave there by the rich englishman -rrb- gettin ' ready for the night-shift as he stand look down upon he a sudden wave of pity come over the boy he know the colonel do not really and truly have to do this kind of thing he just do not like givin ' in but behind all that there be a sense in the younger mind that here be a life unlike he own which dimly he foresee be to find its legitimate expression in battle and in strive here in the person of the colonel no soldier fore-ordained but a serene and equable soul wrench out of its proper sphere by a chance hurt to a woman forsooth a imagination so stir that if it sleep at all it dream and moan in its sleep as now a conscience wound and refuse to heal have he not say himself that he have come up here to forget it be best to let he have the job that be too heavy for he -- yes it be best after all and so they live for a few day the boy chafe and want to move on the colonel very earnest to have he stay something sure to turn up and anyhow letter -- my instruction -- and he encourage the acquaintance the boy have strike up with the buckeye hope against hope that to go over and smoke a pipe and exchange experience with such mighty good fellow would lighten the tedium of the long day spend look for a job i call it a very pleasant cabin the colonel would say as he light up and look about anything dismaller it would be hard to find not clean and shipshape as the boy keep the tent but with double army blanket nail over the single window it be blessedly dark if stuffy and in cry need of cleaning still they be mighty good fellow and they have a right to be cheerful up there on the rude shelf above the stove be a row of old tomato-can brimful of bonanza gold there they stand not even cover dim as the light be you could see the little top nugget peer out at you over the ragged tin-rim in a never lock shanty never molest never bother about nearly every cabin on the creek have similar chimney ornament but not everyone boast a old coat keep under the bunk full of the bigger sort of nugget the colonel be always ready with pretended admiration of such bric--brac but the truth be he care very little about this gold he have come so far to find he own wages pay in dust be keep in a jam-pot the boy have find lyin ' round the grow store shone cheerfully through the glass but its value in the colonel 's eye seem to be simply as a argument to prove that they have enough and need not worry when the boy say there be no doubt this be the district in all the world the most overdo the colonel look at he with sun-tired reproachful eye you want to dissolve the pardnership -- i see i do not but the colonel after any such interchange would go off and smoke by himself not even care for buckeye ' the work be plainly overtax he he sleep badly be grow moody and quick to take offence one day when he have be distinctly uncivil he apologize for himself by say that stand with foot always in the wet head always in the scorching sun he have take a hell of a cold certain it be that without sullenness he would give in to long fit of silence and he wide honest eye be heavy again as if the snow-blindness of the winter have its analog in a summer torment from the sun and he sometimes unusual gentleness to he companion be sharply alternate with unusual choler excite by a mere nothing enough if the boy be not in the tent when the colonel come and go of course the boy do the cooking the colonel eat almost nothing but he make a great point of he pardner 's service in do the cooking he would starve he say if he have to cook for himself as well as swing a shovel and the boy act on pure instinct pretend that he believe this be so then come the evening when the boy be so late the colonel get he own breakfast and when the recreant do get home it be to announce that a man over at the buckeye ' have just offer he a job out on indian river the colonel set down he tea-cup and stare he face take on a odd rigid look but almost indifferently he say : so you be goin ' of course you know i must i start with a outfit and fifteen hundred dollar now i have not a cent the kentuckian raise he heavy eye to the jam-jar oh help yourself the boy laugh and shake he head i wish you would not go the other say very low you see i have get to why nig and i owe you for a week 's grub already then the colonel stand up and swear -- swear till he be scarlet and shake with excitement if the life up here have bring we to ` scowl ' austin 's point of view we be poorly off and he speak of the way man live in he part of kentucky where the old fashion of keep open house survive and do not he know it be the same thing in florida would not you do as much for I yes only i can not -- and -- i be restless the summer 's half go up here that mean the whole year 's half go the colonel have stumble back into he seat and now across the deal table he put out he hand do not go boy i do not know how i would get on without -- he stop and he big hand be raise as if to brush away some cloud between he and he pardner if you go you will not come back oh yes i will you 'll see i know the kind the other go on as if there have be no interruption they never come back i do not know as i ever care quite as much for my brother -- little fellum that die you know then see that he companion do not instantly iterate he determination to go that be right he say get up suddenly and leave he breakfast barely touch we have be through such a lot together let 's see it out without wait for a answer he go off to he favorite seat under the little birch-tree but the incident have leave he nervous he would come up from he work almost on the run and if he fail to find he pardner in the tent there be the devil to pay the boy would laugh to himself to think what a lot he seem able to stand from the colonel and then he would grow grave remember what he have to make up for still he sense of obligation do not extend to give up this splendid chance down on indian river on Wednesday when the fellow over at the buckeye ' be for go back the boy would go along on Sunday morning he run a crooked rusty nail into he foot clumsily extract it leave a ugly wound walk become a torture and the pain a banisher of sleep it be during the next few day that he find out how much the colonel lay awake who could sleep in this blaze sun black tent be not invent then so they lay awake and talk of many thing the man from indian river go back alone the boy would limp after the colonel down to the sluice and sit on a dump heap with nig few people not there strictly on business be tolerate on no 0 but nig and he master have be on good term with seymor from the first now they strike up acquaintance with several of the night-gang especially with the man who work on either side of the colonel a irish gentleman who do the shovel just below say he have graduate from dublin university he certainly have be educate somewhere and if the discussion be theologic would take out of he linen-coat pocket a little testament in the vulgate to verify a bit of gospel he could even pelt the man next but one in he native tongue call the silesian uebermensch there exist some doubt whether this be the gentleman 's real name but none at all as to he talk philosophy with greater fervor than he bestow on the puddle box the other be man more accustomed to work with they hand but in spite of the conscious superiority of you experienced miner a very good feeling prevail in the gang -- a general friendliness that presently centre about the colonel for even in he present mood he be far from disagreeable except now and then to the man he care the most for seymor admit that he have place the southerner where he think he would feel most at home anyhow the company be less mixed he say than it be all winter up at twenty-three where they have a presbyterian missionary down the shaft a salvation army captain turnin ' the windlass a nigger thief dumpin ' the becket and a dignitary of the church of england doin ' the cookin ' with the help of a chinese chore-boy they be all there now -lrb- except one -rrb- washin ' out gold for the couple of san francisco card-sharper that own the claim vich von be go ask the silesian who hear the end of the conversation oh the chinese chore-boy be the one who be better himself say the superintendent -- makin ' more than all the other put together ever make in they life runnin ' a laundry up at dawson the boy since this trouble with he foot have fall into the way of turn night into day the colonel like to have he down there at the sluice and when he think about it the boy marvel at the hour he spend look on while other work at first he say he come down only to make scowl austin mad and it do make he mad at first but the odd thing be he get over it and use to stop and say something now and then this attention on the part of the owner be distinctly perilous to the boy 's good standing with the gang not because austin be the owner there be the millionaire swede ole olsen -- any man might talk to he he be on the square treat he workman mighty fair and when the other owner try to reduce wages and do ole would not join they -- go right along pay the highest rate on the creek various story be afloat about austin oh yes scowl austin be a hard man -- the only owner on the creek who would not even pay the little subscription every poor miner contribute to keep the dawson catholic hospital go the woman too have grievance against austin not only the usual lot up at the gold belt who sneer at he close fist but some of the other sort -- those few hard-working wife or woman on they own or those who wash and cook for this claim or that they have story about austin that shed a lurid light and so by degree the gather experience good and ill of the greatest of all placer diggin 's flow by the idler on the bank you seem to have a lot to do seymor would now and then say with a laugh so i have what do you call it takin ' stock of we of thing in general what do you mean by that demand the colonel suspiciously when the superintendent have pass up the line the shovelling in be do for the time be the water be to be regulate and then the clean-up as soon as the owner come down better not let austin hear you say you be takin ' stock he 'll run you out o ' the creek the boy only smile and go on fillipp little stone at nig what do you mean the colonel persist with a look as suspicious as scowl austin 's own oh nothin ' i be only thinkin ' out thing you future i suppose he say testily mine and other man 's the klondyke 's a great place to get thing clear in you head do not find it so the colonel put up he hand with that now familiar action as if to clear away a cloud it be day since i have anything clear in my head except the lesson we learn on the trail the boy stop throw stone and fix he eye on he friend as the colonel go on : we have that hammer into we do not we what oh that -- you know -- that -- i do not know quite how to put it so it 'll sound as orthodox as it might be bein ' true but it look pretty clear even to I -- again the big hand brushing at the unmoted sunshine -- that the only reason man get over bein ' beast be because they begin to be brother do not say the boy do not what i have always know i should have to tell you some time i will not be able to put it off if i stay and i hate tellin ' you now see here : i b ` lieve i 'll get a pack-mule and go over to indian river the colonel look round angrily stand high against the sky seymor with the gateman up at the lock be moderate the strong head of water it begin to flow sluggishly over the gravel-clogged riffle and scowl austin be come down the hill i do not know what you be drivin ' at about somethin' to tell i know one thing though and i learn it up here in the north : man be mean to stick to one another do not i say here 's austin whisper the colonel the silesian philosopher stand in he gum-boot in the puddling-box as on a rostrum but silent now as ever when scowl austin be in sight with the great sluice-fork the philosopher take up wash and throw out the few remain big stone that they might not clog the narrow box below seymor have so regulate the stream that in place of the gush and foam of a few minute before there be now only a scant and gently fall veil of water playing over the bright gravel catch in the riffle-lined bottom of the box as the boy get up and reach for he stick austin stand there say to nobody in particular that he would just be over to no 29 where they be try a new-fangled riffle do not you riffle do the trick all right ask the boy if you be in any doubt come and see he say they stand together lean over the sluice look in at one of the thing human industry have fail to disfigure nearly as beautiful to-day as long ago on pactolus ' bank when lydian shepherd with great stone fasten fleece in the river that they might catch and gather for king croesus the golden sand of tmolus improve not in beauty but economy quite in the modern spirit the greek themselves discover that they lose less gold if they lead the stream through fleece-lined water-trough -- and beyond this device of those early placer-miner we have not progress so far but that in every long narrow sluice-box in the world to-day you may see a lydian water-trough with a riffle in the bottom for a golden fleece the rich klondyker and the poor one stand together look in at the water still low still slip softly over polished pebble catch at the sunlight wink dimpling glorify flint and jasper agate and obsidian dazzling the uncommercial eye to blind forgetfulness of the magic substance underneath austin gather up one by one a handful of the shine stone and toss they out then bend down see there under where the stone have be neatly catch in the lattice of the riffle lie thick and pack by the water action a heavy ridge of black and yellow -- magnetic sand and gold riffle out call seymor and the man who have be extract the rusty nail that hold they firm lift out from the bottom of each box a wooden lattice souse it gently in the water and lay it on the bank the boy have turn away again but stand a instant notice how the sun catch at the countless particle of gold still cling to the wood for this be one of the old riffle fray by the action of much water and the fret of many stone soon it would have to be burn and out of its ash the careful austin would gather up with mercury all those million point of light meanwhile seymor have call to the gateman for more water and himself join the gang arm now with flat metal scoop they all begin to turn over and throw back against the stream the debris in the bottom of the box give the water another chance to wash out the lighter stuff and clean the gold from all impurity away go the last of the sand and away go the pebble dark or bright away go much of the heavy magnetic iron scowl austin at the end of the line have a corn-whisk with which he sweep the floor of the box always upstream gather the contents in a heap now on this side now on that let the water play and sort and carry away condense hasten the process that for age have be concentrate gold in the arctic placer say look here shout austin to the boy already limp up the hill when he have reach the sluice again he find that all scowl austin want apparently be to show he how when he hold the water back with the whisk it eddy softly at each side of the broad little broom leave expose the swept-up pile see what be all that what do you think look like a heap o ' sawdust austin actually laugh see if it feel like sawdust take it up like this he order he visitor obey lift a double handful out of the water and hold it over the box drip gleam the most beautiful thing that come out of the earth save only life and the assertion may stand even if the distinction be without difference if the crystal be bear grow old and die as undeniably as the rise the boy hold the double handful of well-washed gold up to the sunshine feeling to the full the immemorial spell cast by the king of metal nothing that man have ever make out of gold be so entirely beautiful as this scowl austin 's grim gratification be openly heighten with the rich man 's sense of superiority but he visitor seem to have forget he colonel here a minute we think it look wonderful enough on the big chimney table -- but lord to see it like this out o ' door mix with sunshine and water still he stand there fascinate lean heavily against the sluice-box still with he drip hand full when after a hurry glance the colonel return to he own box none of the gang ever talk in the presence of the owner guess that look good to you austin slightly stressed the pronoun he have take a reasonless liking for the young man who from the first have smile into he frown face and treat he as he treat other or perhaps austin like he because although the boy do a good deal of gassin ' with the gang he have never hang about at clean-up at all event he should stay to-night partly because when the blue devil be down on scowl austin nothing cheer he like show he luck off to someone and it be so seldom safe in these day people talk the authority conceive unjust suspicion of a man 's return and then far back in he head that vague need man feel when a good thing have lose its early zest to see its dim value shine again in a envious eye here be a young fellow who before he go lame have be all up and down the creek for day look for a job -- probably have not a penny -- livin ' off he friend who himself would starve but for the privilege austin give he of wash out austin 's gold let the young man stop and see the richest clean-up at the fork and so it be with the acrid pleasure he have promise himself that he say to the visitor bend over the double handful of gold guess it look good to you yes it look good but he have lift he eye and seem to be study the man more than the metal a couple of newcomer go by halt christ say the younger look at that the boy remember they they have be to seymor only a couple of hour before ask for work one be old for that country -- nearly sixty -- and look as one of the gang have say as if instid o ' findin ' the pot o ' gold he have get the end of the rainbow slam in he face -- kind o ' blind at sound of the strange voice austin have wheel about with a fierce look and heavily the stranger plod by the owner turn again to the gold yes he say curtly there be something about that that look good to most man what i be thinkin ' reply the boy slowly be that it be the only clean gold i would ever see -- but it be not so clean as it be what do you mean austin bent and look sharply into the full hand i be thinkin ' it be good to look at because it have not get into dirty pocket yet austin stare at he a instant never be pass round -- never buy anybody no one have ever envy it or refuse it to help someone out of a hole that be why i think it look good -- because it be clean gold a little while ago and he plunge he hand in the water and wash the clinging particle off he finger austin have stare and then turn he back with a blacker look than even scowl have ever worn before gosh guess there be goin ' to be trouble say one of the gang chapter xxi pardner he see and first of brotherhood have sight it be morning and the night-shift might go to bed but in the absent englishman 's tent there be little sleep and less talk that day the boy in a agony with a foot on fire hear the colonel turn toss growl incoherently about the light it seem unreasonable for a frame have be build round he bed and on it thick gray army blanket be nail -- a rectangular tent have he curse the heat now but no : light god the light the light just as if he be lie as the boy be in the strong white glare of the tent but hour after hour within the stifle fortress the giant toss and mutter at the sword of sunshine that pierce he semi-dusk through little spark-burnt hole or nail-tear torturing sensitive eye near three hour before he need the colonel get up and splash he way through a toilet at the tin basin the boy make breakfast without wait for the usual hour they have nearly finish when it occur to the colonel that neither have speak since they go to bed he glance across at the absorb face of he friend you 'll come down to the sluice to-night will not you why should not i no reason on earth only i be afraid you be broodin ' over what you say to austin austin oh i be not thinkin ' about austin what then what make you so quiet well i be thinkin ' i would be better satisfied to stay here a little longer if -- if what if there be truth between we two i think there be no what be the reason you want I to stay here reason why -- he laugh in he old way -- i do not defend my taste but i kind o ' like to have you round he companion 's grave face show no lighten why do you want I round more than someone else have not get anyone else oh yes you have every man on bonanza 's a friend o ' yours or would be it be not just that we understand each other no we do not what be wrong no answer the boy look through the door across bonanza to the hill i think we understand each other if two man ever do have not we travel the long trail together and see the ice go out that be just it colonel we know such a lot more than man do who have not travel the trail and some of the knowledge be not oversweet a shadow cross the kind face opposite you be thinkin ' about the time i peg out -- do not do my share lord no the tear spring up in the young eye i be thinkin ' o ' the time -- i -- he lay he head down on the rude table and sit so for a instant with hidden face then he straighten up seem as if it be only lately there be be time to think it out and before as long as i could work i could get on with myself seem as if i stand a chance to a little to make up make up but it be always just as it be that day on the oklahoma when the captain swear he would not take on another pound i be awfully happy thinkin ' if i make he bring you it might kind o ' make up but it do not make a big difference to I the colonel say still not able to see the drift but patiently brushing now and then at the dazzling mist and wait for enlightenment it be always the same the other go on whenever i have come up against something i would hope be goin ' to make up it be turn out to be a thing i would have to do anyway and there be no make up about it for all that i should not mind stayin ' on awhile since you want I to -- the colonel interrupt he that be right only if i do you have get to know -- what i would never have guess myself but for the trail after i have tell you if you can bear to see I round -- he hesitate and suddenly stand up he eye still wet but he head so high a onlooker who do not understand english would have call the govern impulse pride defiance even it seem i be the kind of man colonel -- the kind of man who could leave he pardner to die like a dog in the snow if any other fellum say so i would knock he down that night before we get to snow camp when you would not -- could not go any farther i mean to go and leave you -- take the sled and take -- i guess i mean to take everything and leave you to starve they look into each other 's face and year seem to go by the colonel be the first to drop he eye but the other pitilessly like a judge arraign a felon he steady scrutiny never flinch : do you want that kind of a man round colonel the kentuckian turn quickly as if to avoid the stab of the other 's eye and sit hunch together elbow on knee head in hand i know you do not the boy answer he own question he limp over to he side of the tent pick up some clothes he blanket and few belongings and make a pack not a word not a sound but some bird twitter outside in the sun and a locust make that fry sound in the fire-weed the pack be sling on the boy 's back and he be throw the diamond hitch to fasten it when the colonel at last look round lord what you doin ' guess i be goin ' on where i 'll write you when i know maybe i 'll even send you what i owe you but i do not feel like boastin ' at the moment nig you can not walk do you never happen to notice that one-legged fellum pluggin ' about dawson he have go down on he hand and knee to see if nig be asleep under the camp-bed the colonel get up go to the door and let down the flap when he turn the traveller and the dog be at he elbow he square he big frame at the entrance look down at the two try to speak but the boy break in : do not let 's get sentimental colonel just stand aside never stir he find a voice to say i be not askin ' you to stay -- the other turn and whistle for nig have retire again to the seclusion of the gray blanket screen -- i only want to tell you something before you go the boy frown a little but rest he pack against the table in that way in which the klondyker learn to make a chair-back of he burden you seem to think you have be tellin ' I news say the colonel when you say that about goin ' on the night before we get to snow camp i know you simply mean you still intend to come out alive i have throw up my hand -- at least i think i have the only difference between we -- i have give in and you have not the other shake he head there be a lot more in it than that you mean to take the only means there be -- to carry off the sled that i could not pull any farther -- the boy look up quickly something stern and truth-compelling in the dark face force the colonel to add : and along with the sled you mean to carry off -- the -- the thing that mean life to we just that -- the boy knot he brown finger in nig 's hair as if to keep tight hold of one friend in the wreck we could not divide the colonel hurry on it be a case of crawlin ' on together and maybe come out alive or part and one die sure the boy nod tighten he lip i know well enough you would fight for the off-chance but -- the colonel come away from the door and stand in front of he companion -- so would i i have not really give up the struggle you be past strugglin ' and i would have leave you sick -- you would not have leave I -- if i would have my gun the boy remember that he have more than suspect that at the time but the impression have by-and-by wax dim it be too utterly unlike the colonel -- a thing dream he have grow as ashamed of the dream as of the thing he know be true the egotism of memory absorb itself in the part he himself have play -- that other a evil fancy bear of a evil time and here be the colonel say it be true the boy drop he eye it have all happen in the night there be something in the naked truth too ghastly for the day but the colonel go on in a harsh whisper : i look round for my gun if i would find it i would have leave you behind and the boy keep look down at nig and the bird sing and the locust whir and the hot sun fill the tent as high-tide flush a sea-cave you have be a little hard on I boy bringin ' it up like this -- remindin ' I -- i would not have go on myself and makin ' I admit -- no no colonel makin ' I admit that before i would have let you go on i would have shoot you colonel he loose he hold of nig i rather reckon i owe you my life -- and something else besides -- the colonel lay one hand on the thin shoulder where the pack-strap press and close the other hand tight over he pardner 's right -- and i have not mean even to thank you neither do not for the lord 's sake do not say the younger and neither dare look at the other a scratch on the canvas the northern knock at the door you feller sound awake a woman 's voice under he breath who the devil 's that inquire the colonel brushing he hand over he eye before he get across the tent maudie have push

the lame man just as if he tongue have not run away with he the last time the two have meet it be not often that anyone speak so pleasantly to the owner of no 0 perhaps the circumstance weigh with he at all event he stop short when the german have go on foot 's better austin assert perhaps it be a little though the lame man have no reason to think so lucky you heal quick most people do not up here

two or three day you cripple look here -- the colonel flush suddenly austin be sayin ' anything oh i be just thinkin ' about the sun well when i want to go in out of the sun i 'll say so and walk more quickly than he have do for long he leave he companion march down to the creek and take he place near the puddling-box by the time the boy get to the little patch of shade offer by the staging austin have turn he back on the gang and be go to speak to the gateman at the lock he have evidently leave the colonel very much enraged at some curt comment he mean it for we all the dublin gentleman be say soothingly by-and-by as they work undisturbed serenity return oh the colonel be all right -- even more chipper than usual what a good-looking fellum he be with that clear skin and splendid color a couple of hour later the colonel set he long shovel against the nearest of the pole steadying the sluice and go over to the staging for a drink he lift the can of weak tea to he lip and take a long draught hand the can back to the boy and lean against the staging they talk a minute or two in undertone a curt voice behind say : look like you have get a deal to attend to to-day beside you work they look round and there be austin as the colonel see who it be have speak the clear color in the tan deepen he throw back he shoulder hesitate and then without a word go and take up he shovel austin walk on the boy keep look at he friend what be the matter with the colonel it be not only that he eye be queer -- most of the man complain of they eye unless they sleep in cabin but whether through sun-blindness or shake by anger the colonel be handle he shovel uncertainly fumble at the gravel content with half a shovelful and sometimes gauge the distance to the box so badly that some of the pay fall down again in the creek as austin come back on the other side of the line he stop opposite to where the colonel work and suddenly call : seymor like so many on bonanza the superintendent could not always sleep when the time come he be walk about show thing to a stranger a newspaper woman it be whisper -- at all event a lady who arm with letter from the highest british official have come to write up the klondyke seymor have leave she at he employer 's call the lady thin neat alert with crisply curl iron-gray hair and pleasant but unmistakably dignified expression stand wait for he a moment on the heap of tailing then innocently follow she guide although austin lower he voice she draw nearer prepare to take a intelligent interest in the new riffle up on skookum when austin have first call seymor the colonel start look up and watch the little scene with suspicion and grow anger see seymor 's eye turn he way the kentuckian stop shovel and on a sudden impulse call out : see here austin : if you have any complaint to make sah you would better make they to my face sah the conversation about riffle thus further interrupt a little silence fall the superintendent stand in evident fear of he employer but he hasten to speak conciliatory word no complaint at all -- one of the best hand may be so when he be not sick say austin contemptuously sick the boy call out why you be dreamin ' he be we strong man -- able to knock spot out of anyone on the creek be not he appeal to the gang i shall be able to spare he from my part of the creek after to-night do i understand you be dismiss I oh go to hell the colonel drop he shovel and clench he hand get the woman out o ' the way say the owner there be goin ' to be trouble with this fire-eating southerner the woman turn

i be not afraid to be alone here and i have say no it be quite true i have travel so much that i come to know year ago it be not among man like you a woman have anything to fear it be funny and pathetic to see the infuriate colonel clutch at he grand manner bow one instant to the lady shooting death and damnation the next out of heavy eye at austin but the wiry little woman have the floor and mean for peace sake to keep it a few moment at home in the street of london i have be rudely speak to i have be greatly annoy in paris in new york i have be subject to humorous impertinence but in the great north-west every man have seem to be my friend in fact wherever we english tongue be speak she wind up calmly put the great austin in he place a woman may go alone austin seem absorb in fill he pipe the lady trip on to the next claim with a sedate good-night to the man on no 0 she think the momentary trouble past and never turn to see how the kentuckian wait till she should be out of earshot come round in front of austin with a low question the gang watch the boy dodge under the sluice and hobble hurriedly over the chaos of stone towards the owner before he reach he he call breathless but try to laugh : you think the colonel 's play out but take my word for it he be not a man to fool with the gang know from austin 's sneering look as he turn to strike a match on a boulder -- they know as well as if they would be within a yard of he that scowl have say something pretty mean they see the colonel make a plunge and they see he reel and fall among the stone the

leave to each of the big chimney man five hundred dollar not to be draw except for the purpose of go home they think it be the sense of that security that make they put off the day they would play the game up to the last moment and see -- September 's end bring no great change in fortune but a change withal of deep significance the ice have begin to run in the yukon no man need tell it would be a tuhble wintah and dey would better move down souf all the late boat by both route have be pack those man who have fail and yet most tenacious be hang on for some last lucky turn of the wheel know the risk they run and now to-day the final boat of the year be go down the long way to the behring sea and by the canadian route open a little longer the big chimney man by grace of that one leave behind would be on the last ship to shoot the rapid in  not only to the thousand who be go to those who stay behind there be something in the leaving of the last boat -- something that knock upon the heart they too could still go home they gather at the dock and tell one another they would not leave dawson for fifty thousand dollar then look at the failure with home-sick eye remember those month before the luckiest klondyker could hear from the world outside between now and then what would have come to pass up here and what down there below the boy have get a place for muckluck in the a c store she be handy at repair and work in fur and say she be all right on this bright autumn morning when the boy go in to say good-bye with a white woman and a indian boy in a little room overlook the

excited lug miscellaneous possession -- thing they have cling to in strait so desperate they know no more how to relax they hold than dead finger do -- these be man whose last chance have be the klondyke and who here as elsewhere have fail many who come in young be go out old but the odd thing be that those worst off go out game -- no whining none of the ostentatious pathos of those break on the wheel of a great city a man under muckluck 's window dress in a moose-skin shirt straw hat broadcloth trousers and carpet slipper in one hand a tin pail in the other something tie in a handkerchief call out lustily to a ragged individual cleave a way through the throng get you stuff aboard yes goin ' to get it off i be not goin ' home till next year and the face above the moose-skin

blur swamp for the moment in the common wreck -rrb- he say to himself that nothing of the sort have befall the big chimney man any more than to the whip and bankrupt crew struggle down there on the wharf they simply have fail -- all alike and yet there be between they and the common failure of the world one abide difference : these have greatly dare as long as the meanest in that crowd draw breath and hold to memory so long might he remember the brave and terrible day of the klondyke rush and that he have bear in it he heavy share no share in any mine save that -- the knowledge that he be not among the vast majority who sit dully to the end beside what thing they be bear to -- the earnings of other man the savings of other woman afraid to go seek after better lest they lose the good they have they have fail but it could never be say of a klondyker that he have not try he might in truth look down upon the smug majority that smile at unusual endeavor unless success excuse crown it
