produce by david starner tam and pg distribute proofreader the folk-lore of plant by tf thiselton-dyer 1889 preface apart from botanical science there be perhaps no subject of inquiry connect with plant of wider interest than that suggest by the study of folk-lore this field of research have be largely work of late year and have obtain considerable popularity in this country and on the continent much have already be write on the folk-lore of plant a fact which have induce I to give in the present volume a brief systematic summary -- with a few illustration in each case -- of the many branch into which the subject naturally subdivide itself it be hope therefore that this little work will serve as a useful handbook for those desirous of gain some information in a brief concise form of the folk-lore which in one form or another have cluster round the vegetable kingdom tf thiselton-dyer November 19 1888 contents i plant life ii primitive and savage notion respect plant iii

in folk-medicine xxii plant and they legendary history xxiii mystic plant chapter i plant life the fact that plant in common with man and the lower animal possess the phenomenon of life and death naturally suggest in primitive time the notion of they have a similar kind of existence in both case there be a gradual development which be only reach by certain progressive stage of growth a circumstance which be not without its practical lesson to the early naturalist this similarity too be hold all the more striking when it be observe how the life of plant like that of the higher organism be subject to disease accident and other hostile influence and so liable at any moment to be cut off by a untimely end -lrb- 1 -rrb- on this account a personality be ascribe to the product of the vegetable kingdom survival of which be still of frequent occurrence at the present day it be partly this conception which invest tree with that mystic or sacred character whereby they be regard with a superstitious fear which find expression in sundry act of sacrifice and worship accord to mr tylor -lrb- 2 -rrb- there be reason to believe that the doctrine of the spirit of plant lay deep in the intellectual history of south-east asia but be in great measure supersede under buddhist influence the buddhist book show that in the early day of they religion it be matter of controversy whether tree have soul and therefore whether they might lawfully be injure orthodox buddhism decide against the tree soul and consequently against the scruple to harm they declare tree to have no mind nor sentient principle though admit that certain dewa or spirit do reside in the body of tree and speak from within they anyhow the notion of its be wrong to injure or mutilate a tree for fear of put it to unnecessary pain be a widespread belief thus the ojibway imagine that tree have soul and seldom cut they down think that if they do so they would hear the wail of the tree when they suffer in this way -lrb- 3 -rrb- in sumatra -lrb- 4 -rrb- certain tree have special honor pay to they as be the embodiment of the spirit of the wood and the fijian -lrb- 5 -rrb- believe that if a animal or a plant die its soul immediately go to bolotoo the dayak of borneo -lrb- 6 -rrb- assert that rice have a living principle or spirit and hold feast to retain its soul lest the crop should decay and the karen affirm -lrb- 7 -rrb- too that plant as well as man and animal have they la or spirit the iroquois acknowledge the existence of spirit in tree and plant and say that the spirit of corn the spirit of bean and the spirit of squash be suppose to have the form of three beautiful maiden accord to a tradition current among the miami one year when there be a unusual abundance of corn the spirit of the corn be very angry because the child have throw corn-cob at each other in play pretend to have suffer serious bodily injury in consequence of they sport -lrb- 8 -rrb- similarly when the wind blow the long grass or wave corn the german peasant will say the grass-wolf or the corn-wolf be abroad accord to mr ralston in some place the last sheaf of rye be leave as a shelter to the _ roggenwolf _ or rye-wolf during the winter 's cold and in many a summer or autumn festive rite that be be represent by a rustic who assume a wolf-like appearance the corn spirit be however often symbolise under a human form indeed under a variety of form this animistic conception be find among the lower race and in certain case explain the strong prejudice to certain herb as article of food the society islander ascribe a varua or survive soul to plant and the negro of congo adore a sacred tree call mirrone one be generally plant near the house as if it be the tutelar god of the dwelling it be customary also to place calabash of palm wine at the foot of these tree in case they should be thirsty in modern folk-lore there be many curious survival of this tree-soul doctrine in westphalium -lrb- 9 -rrb- the peasantry announce formally to the nearest oak any death that may have occur in the family and occasionally this formulum be employ -- the master be dead the master be dead even recently write sir john lubbock -lrb- 10 -rrb- a oak copse at loch siant in the isle of skye be hold so sacred that no person would venture to cut the smallest branch from it the wallachian have a superstition that every flower have a soul and that the water-lily be the sinless and scentless flower of the lake which blossom at the gate of paradise to judge the rest and that she will inquire strictly what they have do with they odour -lrb- 11 -rrb- it be noteworthy also that the indian belief which describe the hole in tree as door through which the special spirit of those tree pass reappear in the german superstition that the hole in the oak be the pathway for elf -lrb- 12 -rrb- and that various disease may be cure by contact with these hole hence some tree be regard with special veneration -- particularly the lime and pine -lrb- 13 -rrb- -- and person of a superstitious turn of mind may often be see carry sickly child to a forest for the purpose of drag they through such hole this practice formerly prevail in we own country a well-known illustration of which we may quote from white 's history of selborne : in a farmyard near the middle of the village he write stand at this day a row of pollard ash which by the seam and long cicatrix down they side manifestly show that in former time they have be cleft asunder these tree when young and flexible be sever and hold open by wedge while rupture child strip naked be push through the aperture -lrb- 14 -rrb- in somersetshire the superstition still linger on and in cornwall the ceremony to be of value must be perform before sunrise but the practice do not seem to have be confine to any special locality it should also be add as mr conway -lrb- 15 -rrb- have point out that in all saxon country in the middle age a hole form by two branch of a tree grow together be esteem of highly efficacious value on the other hand we must not confound the spiritual vitality ascribe to tree with the animistic conception of they be inhabit by certain spirit although as mr tylor -lrb- 16 -rrb- remark it be difficult at time to distinguish between the two notion instance of these tree spirit lie thickly scatter throughout the folk-lore of most country survival of which remain even amongst culture race it be interesting moreover to trace the same idea in greek and roman mythology thus ovid -lrb- 17 -rrb- tell a beautiful story of erisicthon 's impious attack on the grove of cere and it may be remember how the greek dryad and hamadryad have they life link to a tree and as this withers and die they themselves fall away and cease to be any injury to bough or twig be feel as a wound and a wholesale hew down put a end to they at once -- a cry of anguish escape they when the cruel axe come near in apollonius rhodius we find one of these hamadryad implore a woodman to spare a tree to which she existence be attach : loud through the air resound the woodman 's stroke when lo a voice break from the groan oak ` spare spare my life a tremble virgin spare oh listen to the hamadryad 's prayer no longer let that fearful axe resound preserve the tree to which my life be bind see from the bark my blood in torrent flow i faint i sink i perish from you blow ' aubrey refer to this old superstition say : i can not omit take notice of the great misfortune in the family of the earl of winchelsea who at eastwell in kent fell down a most curious grove of oak near he own noble seat and give the first blow with he own hand shortly after he countess die in she bed suddenly and he eldest son the lord maidstone be kill at sea by a cannon bullet modern european folk-lore still provide we with a curious variety of these spirit-haunted tree and hence when the alder be hew it bleed weep and begin to speak -lrb- 18 -rrb- a old tree in the rugaard forest must not be fell for a elf dwell within and another on the heinzenberg near zell utter a complaint when the woodman cut it down for in it be we lady whose chapel now stand upon the spot -lrb- 19 -rrb- a austrian märchen tell of a stately fir in which there sit a fairy maiden wait on by dwarf reward the innocent and plague the guilty and there be the german song of the maiden in the pine whose bark the boy split with a gold and silver horn story again be circulate in sweden among the peasantry of person who by cut a branch from a habitation tree have be strike with death such a tree be the klinta tall in westmanland under which a mermaid be say to dwell to this tree might occasionally be see snow-white cattle drive up from the neighbouring lake across the meadow another swedish legend tell we how when a man be on the point of cut down a juniper tree in a wood a voice be hear from the ground say friend hew I not but he give another stroke when to he horror blood gush from the root -lrb- 20 -rrb- then there be the danish tradition -lrb- 21 -rrb- relate to the lonely thorn occasionally see in a field but which never grow larger tree of this kind be always bewitch and care should be take not to approach they in the night time as there come a fiery wheel forth from the bush which if a person can not escape from will destroy he in modern greece certain tree have they stichio a being which have be describe as a spectre a wander soul a vague phantom sometimes invisible at other assume the most widely varied form it be further add that when a tree be stichimonious it be dangerous for a man to sleep beneath its shade and the woodcutter employ to cut it down will lie upon the ground and hide themselves motionless and hold they breath at the moment when it be about to fall dread lest the stichio at whose life the blow be aim with each stroke of the axe should avenge itself at the precise moment when it be dislodge -lrb- 22 -rrb- turn to primitive idea on this subject mr schoolcraft mention a indian tradition of a hollow tree from the recess of which there issue on a calm day a sound like the voice of a spirit hence it be consider to be the residence of some powerful spirit and be accordingly deem sacred among rude tribe tree of this kind be hold sacred it be forbid to cut they some of the siamese in the same way offer cake and rice to the tree before fell they and the talein of burmah will pray to the spirit of the tree before they begin to cut the tree down -lrb- 23 -rrb- likewise in the australian bush demon whistle in the branch and in a variety of other eccentric way make they presence manifest -- remind we of ariel 's imprisonment : -lrb- 24 -rrb- into a cloven pine within which rift imprison would thou didst painfully remain a dozen year where thou didst vent thy groan as fast as mill-wheels strike similarly miss emerson in she indian myth -lrb- 1884 p 134 -rrb- quote the story of the two branch : one day there be a great noise in a tree under which manabozho be take a nap it grow louder and at length exasperate he leap into the tree catch the two branch whose war be the occasion of the din and pull they asunder but with a spring on either hand the two branch catch and pinion manabozho between they three day the god remain imprison during which he outcry and lamentation be the subject of derision from every quarter -- from the bird of the air and from the animal of the wood and plain to complete he sad case the wolf eat the breakfast he have leave beneath the tree at length a good bear come to he rescue and release he when the god disclose he divine intuition for he return home and without delay beat he two wife furthermore we be tell of the west indian tribe how if any person go through a wood perceive a motion in the tree which he regard as supernatural frightened at the prodigy he would address himself to that tree which shake the most but such tree however do not condescend to converse but order he to go to a boie or priest who would order he to sacrifice to they new deity -lrb- 25 -rrb- from the same source we also learn -lrb- 26 -rrb- how among savage tribe those plant that produce great terror excitement or a lethargic state be suppose to contain a supernatural be hence in peru tobacco be know as the sacred herb and from its invigorating effect superstitious veneration be pay to the weed many other plant have similar respect show to they and be use as talisman poisonous plant again from they deadly property have be hold in the same repute -lrb- 27 -rrb- and it be a very common practice among american indian to hang a small bag contain poisonous herb around the neck of a child as a talisman against disease or attack from wild beast it be commonly suppose that a child so protected be proof against every hurtful influence from the fact of its be under the protection of the special spirit associate with the plant it wear again closely ally to belief of this kind be the notion of plant as the habitation of the depart soul found on the old doctrine of transmigration hence refer to bygone time we be tell by empedocle that there be two destiny for the soul of highest virtue -- to pass either into tree or into the body of lion -lrb- 28 -rrb- amongst the numerous illustration of this mythological conception may be notice the story tell by ovid -lrb- 29 -rrb- who relate how bauci and philemon be reward in this manner for they charity to zeus who come a poor wanderer to they home it appear that they not only live to a extreme old age but at the last be transform into tree ovid also tell how the god listen to the prayer of penitent myrrha and eventually turn she into a tree although as mr keary remark she have lose understand with she former shape she still weep and the drop which fall from she bark -lrb- _ ie _ the myrrh -rrb- preserve the story of they mistress so that she will be forget in no age to come the sister of phaëthon bewail he death on the shore of eridanus be change into poplar we may too compare the story of daphne and syrinx who when they could no longer elude the pursuit of apollo and pan change themselves into a laurel and a reed in modern time tasso and spenser have give we graphic picture base on this primitive phase of belief and it may be remember how dante pass through that leafless wood in the bark of every tree of which be imprison a suicide in german folk-lore -lrb- 30 -rrb- the soul be suppose to take the form of a flower as a lily or white rise and accord to a popular belief one of these flower appear on the chair of those about to die in the same way from the grave of one unjustly execute white lily be say to spring as a token of the person 's innocence and from that of a maiden three lily which no one save she lover must gather the sex moreover it may be note be keep up even in this species of metempsychosis -lrb- 31 -rrb- thus in a servian folk-song there grow out of the youth 's body a green fir out of the maiden 's a red rise which entwine together amongst further instance quote by grimm we be tell how a child carry home a bud which the angel have give he in the wood when the rise bloom the child be dead the lay of eunzifal make a blackthorn shoot out of the body of slay heathen a white flower by the head of fall christian it be to this notion that shakespeare allude in hamlet where laerte wish that violet may spring from the grave of ophelium -lrb- v i -rrb- : lay she in the earth and from she fair and unpolluted flesh may violet spring a passage which be almost identical to one in the satire of persius -lrb- i 39 -rrb- : e tumulo fortunataque favillum nascentur viola and a idea too which tennyson seem to have borrow : and from he ash may be make the violet of he native land again in the well-known story of tristram and ysonde a further reference occur : from he grave there grow a eglantine which twine about the statue a marvel for all man to see and though three time they cut it down it grow again and ever wind its arm about the image of the fair ysonde -lrb- 32 -rrb- in the scottish ballad of fair margaret and sweet william it be related -- out of she breast there spring a rose and out of he a briar they grow till they grow unto the church top and there they tie in a true lover ' knot the same idea have prevail to a large extent among savage race thus some of the north-western indian believe that those who die a natural death would be compel to dwell among the branch of tall tree the brazilian have a mythological character call manus -- a child who die and be bury in the house of she mother soon a plant spring out of the grave which grow flourish and bear fruit this plant say mr dorman -lrb- 33 -rrb- be the mandioca name from _ mani _ and _ oca _ house by the mexican marigold be know as death-flower from a legend that they spring up on the ground stain by the life-blood of those who fall victim to the love of gold and cruelty of the early spanish settler in america among the virginian tribe too red clover be suppose to have spring from and to be color by the blood of the red man slay in battle with which may be compare the well-known legend connect with the lily of the valley formerly current in st leonard 's forest sussex it be report to have spring from the blood of st leonard who once encounter a mighty worm or fire-drake in the forest engage with it for three successive day eventually the saint come off victorious but not without be seriously wounded and wherever he blood be shed there spring up lily of the valley in profusion after the battle of towton a certain kind of wild rose be report to have spring up in the field where the yorkist and lancastrian fall only there to be find : there still wild rose grow frail token of the fray and the hedgerow green bear witness of towton field that day -lrb- 33 -rrb- in fact there be numerous legend of this kind and it may be remembered how defoe in he tour through great britain speak of a certain camp call barrow hill add they say this be a danish camp and everything hereabout be attribute to the dane because of the neighbouring daventry which they suppose to be build by they the road hereabouts too be overgrow with dane-weed they fancy it spring from the blood of dane slay in battle and that if cut upon a certain day in the year it bleed -lrb- 34 -rrb- similarly the red poppy which follow the ploughing of the field of waterloo after the duke of wellington 's victory be say to have spring from the blood of the troops who fall during the engagement -lrb- 35 -rrb- and the fruit of the mulberry which be originally white tradition tell we become empurple through human blood a notion which in germany explain the color of the heather once more the mandrake accord to a superstition current in france and germany spring up where the presence of a criminal have polluted the ground and hence the old belief that it be generally find near a gallows in iceland it be commonly say that when innocent person be put to death the sorb or mountain ash will spring up over they grave similar tradition cluster round numerous other plant which apart from be a revival of a very early primitive belief form one of the prettiest chapter of we legendary tale although find under a variety of form and in some case sadly corrupt from the dress they originally wear yet in they main feature they have not lose they individuality but still retain they distinctive character in connection with the myth of plant life may be notice that curious species of exotic plant commonly know as sensitive plant and which have generally attract considerable interest from they irritability when touch shelley have immortalise this curious freak of plant life in he charming poem wherein he relate how the sensitive plant be the earliest up-gathered into the bosom of rest a sweet child weary of its delight the feeblest and yet the favorite cradle within the embrace of night who can wonder on gaze at one of these wonderful plant that primitive and uncultured tribe should have regard such mysterious and inexplicable movement as indication of a distinct personal life hence as darwin in he movement of plant remark : why a touch slight pressure or any other irritant such as electricity heat or the absorption of animal matter should modify the turgescence of the affected cell in such a manner as to cause movement we do not know but a touch act in this manner so often and on such widely distinct plant that the tendency seem to be a very general one and if beneficial it might be increase to any extent if therefore one of the most eminent of recent scientific botanist confess he inability to explain this strange peculiarity we may excuse the savage if he regard it as another proof of a distinct personality in plant life thus some year ago a correspondent of the _ botanical register _ describe the toad orchi -lrb- _ megaclinium bufo _ -rrb- amusingly speak as follow of its eccentric movement : let the reader imagine a green snake to be press flat like a dry flower and then to have a road of toad or some such speckled reptile draw up along the middle in single file they back set up they foreleg sprawl right and left and they mouth wide open with a large purple tongue wag about convulsively and a pretty considerable approach will be gain to a idea of this plant which if pythagora have but know of it would have render all argument about the transmigration of soul superfluous but apart from the vein of jocularity run through these remark such striking vegetable phenomenon be scientifically as great a puzzle to the botanist as they movement be to the savage the latter regard they as the outward visible expression of a real inward personal existence but to quote another kind of sympathy between human being and certain plant the cingalese have a notion that the cocoa-nut plant withers away when beyond the reach of a human voice and that the vervain and borage will only thrive near man 's dwelling once more the south sea islander affirm that the scent be the spirit of a flower and that the dead may be sustain by they fragrance they cover they newly-made grave with many a sweet smell blossom footnote : 1 see tylor 's primitive culture 1873 i 474-5 also

from a tree -- however whimsical such a notion may seem -- be a belief once receive as sober fact and even now-a-day can be trace amongst the tradition of many race -lrb- 1 -rrb- this primitive idea of man 's creation probably originate in the myth of yggdrasil the tree of the universe -lrb- 2 -rrb- around which so much legendary lore have cluster and for a full explanation of which a immense amount of learning have be expend although the student of mythology have never yet be able to arrive at any definite solution on this deeply intricate subject without enter into the many theory propose in connection with this mythical tree it no doubt represent the life-giving force of nature it be generally suppose to have be a ash tree but as mr conway -lrb- 3 -rrb- point out there be reason to think that through the confluence of tradition other sacred tree blended with it thus while the ash bear no fruit the edda describe the star as the fruit of yggdrasil mr thorpe -lrb- 4 -rrb- again consider it identical with the robur jovi or sacred oak of geismar destroy by boniface and the irminsul of the saxon the _ columna universali _ the terrestrial tree of offering a emblem of the whole world at any rate the tree of the world and the greatest of all tree have long be identify in the northern mythology as the ash tree -lrb- 5 -rrb- a fact which account for the weird character assign to it amongst all the teutonic and scandinavian nation frequent illustration of which will occur in the present volume refer to the descent of man from the tree we may quote the edda accord to which all mankind be descend from the ash and the elm the story run that as odhinn and he two brother be journey over the earth they discover these two stock void of future and breathe into they the power of life -lrb- 6 -rrb- : spirit they own not sense they have not blood nor vigor nor color fair spirit give odhinn thought give hoenir blood give lodr and color fair this notion of tree-descent appear to have be popularly believe in olden day in italy and greece illustration of which occur in the literature of that period thus virgil write in the _ aeneid _ -lrb- 7 -rrb- : these wood be first the seat of sylvan power of nymph and faun and savage man who take they birth from trunk of tree and stubborn oak romulus and remus have be find under the famous _ ficus ruminali _ which seem to suggest a connection with a tree parentage it be true as mr keary remark -lrb- 8 -rrb- that in the legend which we have receive it be in this instance only a case of finding but if we could go back to a earlier tradition we should probably see that the relation between the mythical time and the tree have be more intimate juvenal it may be remembered give a further allusion to tree descent in he sixth satire -lrb- 9 -rrb- : for when the world be new the race that break unfathered from the soil or open oak live most unlike the man of later time in greece the oak as well as the ash be account a tree whence man have spring hence in the odyssey the disguised hero be ask to state he pedigree since he must necessarily have one for say the interrogator belike you be not come of the oak tell of in old time nor of the rock -lrb- 10 -rrb- hesiod tell we how jove make the third or brazen race out of ash tree and hesychius speak of the fruit of the ash the race of man phoroneus again accord to the grecian legend be bear of the ash and we know too how among the greek certain family keep up the idea of a tree parentage the pelopida have be say to be descend from the plane among the persian the achaemenida have the same tradition respect the origin of they house -lrb- 11 -rrb- from the numerous instance illustrative of tree-descent it be evident as mr keary point out that there be once a fuller meaning than metaphor in the language which speak of the root and branch of a family or in such expression as the pathetic ah woe beloved shoot of euripide -lrb- 12 -rrb- furthermore as he add even when the literal notion of the descent from a tree have be lose sight of the close connection between the prosperity of the tribe and the life of its fetish be often strictly hold the village tree of the german race be originally a tribal tree with whose existence the life of the village be involve and when we read of christian saint and confessor that they make a point of cut down these half idol we can not wonder at the rage they call forth nor that they often pay the penalty of they courage similarly we can understand the veneration bestow on the forest tree from association of this kind consequently as it have be remark -lrb- 13 -rrb- at a time when rude beginning be all that be of the builder 's art the human mind must have be rouse to a higher devotion by the sight of lofty tree under a open sky than it could feel inside the stunt structure rear by unskilled hand when long afterwards the architecture peculiar to the teutonic reach its perfection do it not in its boldest creation still aim at reproduce the soar tree of the forest would not the abortion of miserably carve or chisel image lag far behind the form of the god which the youthful imagination of antiquity picture to itself thron on the bowery summit of a sacred tree it have be ask whether the idea of the yggdrasil and the tree-descent may not be connect with the tree of life of genesis without however enter into a discussion on this complex point it be worthy of note that in several of the primitive mythology we find distinct counterpart of the biblical account of the tree of life and it seem quite possible that these corrupt form of the mosaic history of creation may in a measure have suggest the conception of the world tree and the descent of mankind from a tree on this subject the late mr rj king -lrb- 14 -rrb- have give we the follow interesting remark in he paper on sacred tree and flower : how far the religious system of the great nation of antiquity be affect by the record of the creation and fall preserve in the opening chapter of genesis it be not perhaps possible to determine there be certain point of resemblance which be at least remarkable but which we may assign if we please either to independent tradition or to a natural development of the earliest or primeval period the tree of life and of knowledge be at once suggest by the mysterious sacred tree which appear in the most ancient sculpture and painting of egypt and assyrium and in those of the remoter east in the symbolism of these nation the sacred tree sometimes figure as a type of the universe and represent the whole system of create thing but more frequently as a tree of life by whose fruit the votary of the god -lrb- and in some case the god themselves -rrb- be nourish with divine strength and be prepare for the joy of immortality the most ancient type of this mystical tree of life be the date palm the fig and the pine or cedar by way of illustration it may be note that the ancient egyptian have they legend of the tree of life it be mention in they sacred book that osiri order the name of soul to be write on this tree of life the fruit of which make those who eat it become as god -lrb- 15 -rrb- among the most ancient tradition of the hindoo be that of the tree of life -- call soma in sanskrit -- the juice of which impart immortality this marvellous tree be guard by spirit come down to later time virgil speak of a sacred tree in a manner which grimm -lrb- 16 -rrb- consider highly suggestive of the yggdrasil : jove 's own tree high as he topmost bough to heaven ascend so low he root to hell 's dominion tend as already mention numerous legendary story have become interwoven with the myth of the yggdrasil the follow sacred one combine the idea of tree-descent accord to a _ trouvere _ of the thirteenth century -lrb- 17 -rrb- the tree of life be a thousand year after the sin of the first man transplant from the garden of eden to the garden of abraham and a angel come from heaven to tell the patriarch that upon this tree should hang the freedom of mankind but first from the same tree of life jesus should be bear and in the follow wise first be to be bear a knight fanouel who through the scent merely of the flower of that live tree should be engender in the womb of a virgin and this knight again without know woman should give birth to st anne the mother of the virgin mary both these wonder fall out as they be foretell a virgin bear fanouel by smell the tree and fanouel have once come unawares to that tree of life and cut a fruit from it wipe he knife against he thigh in which he inflict a slight wound and thus let in some of the juice presently he thigh begin to swell and eventually st anne be bear therefrom but turn to survival of this form of animism among uncultured tribe we may quote the damaras a south african race with whom a tree be suppose to be the universal progenitor two of which divide the honor -lrb- 18 -rrb- accord to they creed in the beginning of thing there be a tree and out of this tree come damaras bushmen ox and zebra the damaras light a fire which frighten away the bushman and the ox but the zebra remain

stage of they mental culture be plant-worship hence it hold a prominent place in the history of primitive belief and at the present day prevail largely among rude and uncivilised race survival of which even linger on in we own country to trace back the history of plant-worship would necessitate a inquiry into the origin and development of the nature-worshipping phase of religious belief such a subject of research would introduce we to those pre-historic day when human intelligence have succeed only in select for worship the grand and impose object of sight and sense hence as mr keary observe -lrb- 1 -rrb- the god of the early world be the rock and the mountain the tree the river the sea and mr fergusson -lrb- 2 -rrb- be of opinion that tree-worship in association with serpent-worship must be reckon as the primitive faith of mankind in the previous chapter we have already point out how the animistic theory which invest the tree and grove with a conscious personality account for much of the worship and homage originally ascribe to they -- identify too as they be later on with the habitation of certain spirit whether view therefore in the light of past or modern inquiry we find scatter throughout most country various phase of plant-worship a striking proof of its universality in day go by -lrb- 3 -rrb- accord to mr fergusson tree-worship have spring from a perception of the beauty and utility of tree with all they poetry he argue and all they usefulness we can hardly feel astonished that the primitive race of mankind should have consider tree as the choicest gift of the god to man and should have believe that they spirit still delighted to dwell among they branch or speak oracle through the rustling of they leaf but mr mclennan -lrb- 4 -rrb- do not consider that this be conclusive add that such a view of the subject do not at all meet the case of the shrub creeper marsh-plant and weed that have be worship he would rather connect it with totemism -lrb- 5 -rrb- urge that the primitive stage of religious evolution go to show that the ancient nation come in pre-historic time through the totem stage have animal and plant and the heavenly body conceive as animal for god before the anthropomorphic god appear while mr herbert spencer -lrb- 6 -rrb- again consider that plant-worship like the worship of idol and animal be a aberrant species of ancestor-worship -- a species somewhat more disguise externally but have the same internal nature anyhow the subject be one concern which the comparative mythologist have at different time draw opposite theory but of this there can be no doubt that plant-worship be a primitive faith of mankind a fact in connection with which we may quote sir john lubbock 's word -lrb- 7 -rrb- how by man in this stage of progress everything be regard as have life and be more or less a deity indeed sacred river appear in the very earliest mythology which have be recover and linger among the last vestige of heathenism long after the advent of a purer creed as too it have be remark -lrb- 8 -rrb- either as direct object of worship or as form the temple under whose solemn shadow other and remoter deity might be adore there be no part of the world in which tree have not be regard with especial reverence ` in such green palace the first king reign sleep in they shade and angel entertain with such old counsellor they do advise and by frequent sacred shades grow wise ' even paradise itself say evelyn be but a kind of ` nemorous temple or sacred grove ' plant by god himself and give to man _ tanquam primo sacerdotus _ and he go on to suggest that the grove which the patriarch be record to have plant in different part of palestine may have be memorial of that first tree-shaded paradise from which adam be expel briefly notice the antecedent history of plant-worship it would seem to have lie at the foundation of the old celtic creed although few record on this point have come down to we -lrb- 9 -rrb- at any rate we have abundant evidence that this form of belief hold a prominent place in the religion of these people allusion to which be give by many of the early classical writer thus the very name of druidism be a proof of the celtic addiction to tree-worship and de bross -lrb- 10 -rrb- as a further evidence that this be so would derive the word kirk now soften into church from _ quercus _ a oak that species have be peculiarly sacred similarly in review the old teutonic belief we come across the same reference to tree-worship in many respects display little or no distinction from that of the celt in explanation of this circumstance mr keary -lrb- 11 -rrb- suggest that the nature of the teutonic belief would apply with only some slight change to the creed of the predecessor of the german in northern and western europe undoubtedly in prehistoric day the german and celt merge so much one into the other that they history can not well be distinguish mr fergusson in he elaborate research have trace many indication of tree-adoration in germany notice they continuance in the christian period as prove by grimm whose opinion be that the festal universal religion of the people have its abode in wood while the christmas tree of present german celebration in all family be almost undoubtedly a remnant of the tree-worship of they ancestor accord to mr fergusson one of the last and best-known example of the veneration of grove and tree by the german after they conversion to christianity be that of the stock be eisen in vienna the sacred tree into which every apprentice down to recent time before set out on he wanderjahre drive a nail for luck it now stand in the center of that great capital the last remain vestige of the sacred grove round which the city have grow up and in sight of the proud cathedral which have supersede and replace its more venerable shade equally undoubted be the evidence of tree-worship in greece -- particular tree have be sacred to many of the god thus we have the oak tree or beech of jupiter the laurel of apollo the vine of bacchus the olive be the well-known tree of minerva the myrtle be sacred to aphrodite and the apple of the hesperide belong to juno -lrb- 12 -rrb- as a writer too in the _ edinburgh review _ -lrb- 13 -rrb- remark the oak grove at dodona be sufficiently evident to all classic reader to need no detailed mention of its oracle or its highly sacred character the sacrifice of agamemnon in auli as tell in the opening of the ` iliad ' connect the tree and serpent worship together and the wood of the sacred plane tree under which the sacrifice be make be preserve in the temple of diana as a holy relic so late accord to pausania as the second century of the christian era the same writer further add that in italy trace of tree-worship if not so distinct and prominent as in greece be nevertheless existent romulus for instance be describe as hang the arm and weapon of acron king of cenina upon a oak tree hold sacred by the people which become the site of the famous temple of jupiter then again turn to bible history -lrb- 14 -rrb- the denunciation of tree-worship be very frequent and minute not only in connection with the worship of baal but as mention in 2 king ix : and they -lrb- the child of israel -rrb- set themselves up image and grove in every high hill and under every green tree these act it have be remark may be attributable more to heretical idolatrous practice into which the jew have temporarily fall in imitation of the heathen around they but at the same time they furnish ample proof of the existence of tree and grove worship by the heathen nation of syrium as one of they most solemn rite but from the period of king hezekiah down to the christian era mr fergusson find no trace of tree-worship in judea in assyrium tree-worship be a common form of idolatrous veneration as prove by lord aberdeen 's black-stone and many of the plate in the work of layard and botta -lrb- 15 -rrb- turn to indium tree-worship probably have always belong to aryan hinduism and as tree-worship do not belong to the aboriginal race of indium and be not adopt from they it must have form part of the pantheistic worship of the vedic system which endow all create thing with a spirit and life -- a doctrine which modern hinduism largely extended -lrb- 16 -rrb- thus when food be cook a oblation be make by the hindu to tree with a appropriate invocation before the food be eat the bo tree be extensively worship in indium and the toolsee plant -lrb- basil -rrb- be hold sacred to all god -- no oblation be consider sacred without its leaf certain of the chittagong hill tribe worship the bamboo -lrb- 17 -rrb- and sir john lubbock quote from thompson 's travels in the himalaya tell we that in the simlum hill the _ cupressus toridosa _ be regard as a sacred tree further instance might be enumerate so general be this form of religious belief in a interesting and valuable paper by a bengal civilian -- intimately acquaint with the country and people -lrb- 18 -rrb- -- the writer say : -- the contrast between the acknowledged hatred of tree as a rule by the byga -lrb- 19 -rrb- and they deep veneration for certain other in particular be very curious i have see the hillside sweep clear of forest for mile with but here and there a solitary tree leave stand these remain now the object of the deepest veneration so far from be injure they be carefully preserve and receive offering of food clothes and flower from the pass byga who firmly believe that tree to be the home of a spirit to give another illustration -lrb- 20 -rrb- it appear that in beerbhoom once a year the whole capital repair to a shrine in the jungle and make simple offering to a ghost who dwell in the belum tree the shrine consist of three tree -- a belum tree on the leave in which the ghost reside and which be mark at the foot with blood in the middle be a kachmula tree and on the right a saura tree in spite of the tree be at least seventy year old the common people claim the greatest antiquity for the shrine and tradition say that the three tree that now mark the spot neither grow thicker nor increase in height but remain the same for ever a few year ago dr george birwood contribute to the _ athenaeum _ some interesting remark on persian flower-worship speaking of the victorium garden at bombay he say : -- a true persian in flow robe of blue and on he head he sheep-skin hat -- black glossy curl the fleece of kar-kal -- would saunter in and stand and meditate over every flower he see and always as if half in vision and when the vision be fulfil and the ideal flower he be seek find he would spread he mat and sit before it until the setting of the sun and then pray before it and fold up he mat again and go home and the next night and night after night until that particular flower fade away he would return to it and bring he friend in ever-increasing troops to it and sit and play the guitar or lute before it and they would all together pray there and after prayer still sit before it sip sherbet and talk the most hilarious and shocking scandal late into the moonlight and so again and again every evening until the flower die sometimes by way of a grand finale the whole company would suddenly rise before the flower and serenade it together with a ode from hafiz and depart tree-worship too have be more or less prevalent among the american indian abundant illustration of which have be give by traveller at different period in many case a striking similarity be noticeable show a common origin a circumstance which be important to the student of comparative mythology when trace the distribution of religious belief the dacotah worship the medicine-wood so call from a belief that it be a genius which protect or punish they accord to they merit or demerit -lrb- 21 -rrb- darwin -lrb- 22 -rrb- mention a tree near siena de la ventana to which the indian pay homage as the altar of walleechu offering of cigar bread and meat have be suspend upon it by thread the tree be surround by bleached bone of horse that have be sacrifice mr tylor -lrb- 23 -rrb- speak of a ancient cypress exist in mexico which he thus describe : -- all over its branch be fasten votive offering of the indian hundred of lock of coarse black hair tooth bit of color cloth rag and morsel of ribbon the tree be many century old and have probably have some mysterious influence ascribe to it and be decorate with such simple offering long before the discovery of america once more the calchaqui of brazil -lrb- 24 -rrb- have be in the habit of worship certain tree which be frequently decorate by the indian with feather and charlevoix narrate another interesting instance of tree-worship : -- formerly the indian in the neighborhood of acadium have in they country near the sea-shore a tree extremely ancient of which they relate many wonder and which be always laden with offering after the sea have lay open its whole root it then support itself a long time almost in the air against the violence of the wind and wave which confirm those indian in the notion that the tree must be the abode of some powerful spirit nor be its fall even capable of undeceive they so that as long as the smallest part of its branch appear above the water they pay it the same honor as whilst it stand in north america accord to franklin -lrb- 25 -rrb- the cree use to hang strip of buffalo flesh and piece of cloth on they sacred tree and in nicaragua maize and bean be worship by the native of carolina the tea-plant be formerly hold in veneration above all other plant and indeed similar phase of superstition be very numerous trace of tree-worship occur in africa and sir john lubbock -lrb- 26 -rrb- mention the sacred grove of the marghus -- a dense part of the forest surround with a ditch -- where in the most luxuriant and widest spread tree they god zumbrus be worship in he valuable work on ceylon sir j emerson tennent give some interesting detail about the consecration of tree to different demon to insure they safety and of the ceremony perform by the kattadia or devil-priest it appear that whenever the assistance of a devil-dancer be require in extreme case of sickness various formality be observe after the follow fashion a altar be erect profusely adorn with garland and flower within sight of the die man who be order to touch and dedicate to the evil spirit the wild flower rice and flesh lay upon it trace of plant-worship be still find in europe before sunrise on good Friday the bohemian be in the habit of go into they garden and after fall on they knee before a tree to say i pray o green tree that god may make thee good a formulum which mr ralston -lrb- 27 -rrb- consider have probably be alter under the influence of christianity from a direct prayer to the tree to a prayer for it at night they run about the garden exclaim bud o tree bud or i will flog you on the follow day they shake the tree and clank they key while the church bell be ring under the impression that the more noise they make the more fruit will they get trace too of tree-worship add mr ralston -lrb- 28 -rrb- may be find in the song which the russian girl sing as they go out into the wood to fetch the birch tree at whitsuntide and to gather flower for wreath and garland : rejoice not oak rejoice not green oak not to you go the maiden not to you do they bring pie cake omelette so so semik and troitsa -lrb- trinity -rrb- rejoice birch tree rejoice green one to you go the maiden to you they bring pie cake omelette the eatables here mention probably refer to the sacrifice offer in olden day to the birch -- the tree of the spring with this practice we may compare one long observe in we own country and know as wassailing at certain season it have long be customary in devonshire for the farmer on the eve of twelfth-day to go into the orchard after supper with a large milk pail of cider with roasted apple press into it out of this each person in the company take what be call a clome -- ie earthenware cup -- full of liquor and standing under the more fruitful apple tree address they in these word : health to thee good apple tree well to bear pocket full hat full peck full bushel bag full after the formulum have be repeat the contents of the cup be throw at the tree -lrb- 29 -rrb- there be numerous allusion to this form of tree-worship in the literature of the past and tusser among he many piece of advice to the husbandman have not omit to remind he that he should wassail the tree that they may bear you many a plum and many a pear for more or less fruit they will bring as you do they wassail survival of this kind show how tenaciously

ancient world few subject occupy a more prominent place than lightning associate as it be with those myth of the origin of fire which be of such wide distribution -lrb- 1 -rrb- in examine these survival of primitive culture we be confront with some of the most elaborate problem of primeval philosophy many of which be not only highly complicate but have give rise to various conjecture thus although it be easy to understand the reason which lead we ancestor in they childlike ignorance to speak of the lightning as a worm serpent trident arrow or fork wand yet the contrary be the case when we inquire why it be occasionally symbolise as a flower or leaf or when as mr fiske -lrb- 2 -rrb- remark we seek to ascertain why certain tree such as the ash hazel white thorn and mistletoe be suppose to be in a certain sense embodiment of it indeed however satisfactory we explanation may apparently seem in many case they can only be regard as ingenious theory base on the most probable theory which the science of comparative folk-lore may have suggest in analyze too the evidence for determine the possible association of idea which induce we primitive forefather to form those mythical conception that we find embody in the folk-tale of most race it be necessary to unravel from the relic of the past the one common notion that underlie they respect the origin of fire for instance the lead idea -- as hand down to we in myth of this kind -- would make we believe that it be originally steal story which point to this conclusion be not limit to any one country but be share by race widely remote from one another this circumstance be important as help to explain the relation of particular plant to lightning and account for the superstitious reverence so frequently pay to they by most aryan tribe hence the way by which the veda argue the existence of the palasa -- a mystic tree with the hindu -- be found on the follow tradition : -- the demon have steal the heavenly soma or drink of the god and cellare it in some mythical rock or cloud when the thirsty deity be pine for they much-prized liquor the falcon undertake to restore it to they although he succeed at the cost of a claw and a plume of which he be deprive by the graze of a arrow shoot by one of the demon both fall to the earth and take root the claw become a species of thorn which dr kuhn identify as the _ mimosa catechu _ and the feather a palasa tree which have a red sap and scarlet blossom with such a divine origin -- for the falcon be nothing less than a lightning god -lrb- 3 -rrb- -- the tree naturally be incorporation -lrb- 4 -rrb- not only of the heavenly fire but also of the soma with which the claw and feather be impregnate it be not surprising therefore that extraordinary virtue be ascribe to these lightning plant quality which in no small degree distinguish they representative at the present day thus we be tell how in indium the mimosa be know as the imperial tree on account of its remarkable property be credit as a efficacious charm against all sort of malignant influence such as the evil eye not unlike in color to the blossom of the indian palasa be the red berry of the rowan or mountain-ash -lrb- _ pyrus aucuparium _ -rrb- a tree which have acquire european renown from the aryan tradition of its be a embodiment of the lightning from which it be spring it have acquire therefore a mystic character evidence of which be numerously represent throughout europe where its leaf be reverence as be the most potent talisman against the darker power at the present day we still find the highland milkmaid carry with she a rowan-cross against unforeseen danger just as in many a german village twig be put over stable to keep out witch illustration of this kind support its widespread reputation for supernatural virtue besides show how closely ally be much of the folk-lore of we own with that of continental country at the same time we feel inclined to agree with mr farrer that the red berry of the mountain-ash probably single it out from among tree for worship long before we ancestor have arrive at any idea of abstract divinity the beauty of its berry add to they brilliant red color would naturally excite feeling of admiration and awe and hence it would in process of time become invest with a sacred significance it must be remember too that all over the world there be a regard for thing red this color have be once hold sacred to thor and grimm suggest that it be on this account the robin acquire its sacred character similarly the highland woman tie a piece of red worsted thread round they cow ' tail previous to turn they out to grass for the first time in spring for in accordance with a old adage : rowan-ash and red thread keep the devil from they speed in the same way the mother in esthonium put some red thread in they baby ' cradle as a preservative against danger and in china something red be tie round child 's wrist as a safeguard against evil spirit by the aid of comparative folk-lore it be interesting as in this case to trace the same notion in different country although it be by no means possible to account for such undesigned resemblance the common ash -lrb- _ fraxinus excelsior _ -rrb- too be a lightning plant and accord to a old couplet : avoid a ash it count the flash another tree hold sacred to thor be the hazel -lrb- _ corylus avellana _ -rrb- which like the mountain-ash be consider a actual embodiment of the lightning indeed so deep be the faith of the people in the relation of this tree to the thunder god say mr conway -lrb- 5 -rrb- that the catholic adopt and sanction it by a legend one may hear in bavarium that on they flight into egypt the holy family take refuge under it from a storm its suppose immunity from all damage by lightning have long cause special reverence to be attach to it and give rise to sundry superstitious usage thus in germany a twig be cut by the farm-labourer in spring and on the first thunderstorm a cross be make with it over every heap of grain whereby it be suppose the corn will remain good for many year occasionally too one may see hazel twig place in the window frame during a heavy shower and the tyrolean regard it as a excellent lightning conductor as a promoter of fruitfulness it have long be hold in high repute -- a character which it probably derive from its mythic association -- and hence the important part it play in love divination accord to a bohemian belief the presence of a large number of hazel-nut betoken the birth of many illegitimate child and in the black forest it be customary for the leader of a marriage procession to carry a hazel wand for the same reason in many part of germany a few nut be mingle with the seed corn to insure its be prolific but leave the hazel with its host of superstition we may notice the white-thorn which accord to aryan tradition be also originally spring from the lightning hence it have acquire a wide reverence and be invest with supernatural property like too the hazel it be associate with marriage rite thus the grecian bride be and be still deck with its blossom whereas its wood form the torch which light the roman bridal couple to they nuptial chamber on the wedding day it be evident therefore that the white-thorn be consider a sacred tree long before christian tradition identify it as form the crown of thorn a medieval belief which further enhance the sanctity attach to it it be not surprising therefore that the irish consider it unlucky to cut down this holy tree especially as it be say to be under the protection of the fairy who resent any injury do to it a legend current in county donegal for instance tell we how a fairy have try to steal one joe m ` donough 's baby but the poor mother argue that she have never affront the fairy tribe to she knowledge the only cause she could assign be that joe have help mr todd 's gardener to cut down the old hawthorn tree on the lawn and there be they that say that be a very bad thing to do add how she fleech he not to touch it but the master he offer he six shilling if he would help in the job for the other man refuse the same belief prevail in brittany where it be also hold unsafe to gather even a leaf from certain old and solitary thorn which grow in sheltered hollow of the moorland and be the fairy ' trysting-place -lrb- 6 -rrb- then there be the mistletoe which like the hazel and the white-thorn be also suppose to be the embodiment of lightning and in consequence of its mythical character hold a exalted place in the botanical world as a lightning-plant we seem to have the key to its symbolical nature in the circumstance that its branch be fork on the same principle it be worthy of note as mr fiske remark -lrb- 7 -rrb- that the hindu commentator of the veda certainly lay great stress on the fact that the palasa be trident-leaved we have already point out too how the red color of a flower as in the case of the berry of the mountain-ash be apparently sufficient to determine the association of idea the swiss name for mistletoe _ donnerbesen _ thunder besom illustrate its divine origin on account of which it be suppose to protect the homestead from fire and hence in sweden it have long be suspend in farm-house like the mountain-ash in scotland but its virtue be by no means limit for like all lightning-plant its potency be display in a variety of way its healing property have from a remote period be in the highest repute for purpose also of sorcery it have be reckon of considerable importance and as a preventive of nightmare and other night scare it be still in favor on the continent one reason which no doubt have obtain for it a marked degree of honor be its parasitical manner of growth which be in primitive time ascribe to the intervention of the god accord to one of its traditionary origin its seed be say to be deposit on certain tree by bird the messenger of the god if not the god themselves in disguise by which this plant establish itself in the branch of a tree the mode of procedure say the old botanist be through the mistletoe thrush this bird it be assert by feed on the berry surround its beak with the viscid mucus they contain to rid itself of which it rub its beak in the course of fly against the branch of tree and thereby insert the seed which give birth to the new plant when the mistletoe be find grow on the oak its presence be attribute specially to the god and as such be treat with the deepest reverence it be not too by accident that the oak be select as this tree be honor by aryan tradition with be of lightning origin hence when the mistletoe be find on its branch the occurrence be consider as deeply significant and all the more so as its existence in such a locality be hold to be very rare -lrb- 8 -rrb- speaking of the oak it may be note that as sacred to thor it be under he immediate protection and hence it be consider a act of sacrilege to mutilate it in ever so small a degree indeed it be a law of the ostrogoth that anybody might hew down what tree he please in the common wood except oak and hazel those tree have peace _ ie _ they be not to be fell -lrb- 9 -rrb- that profanity of this kind be not treat with immunity be formerly fully believe a illustration of which be give we by aubrey -lrb- 10 -rrb- who say that to cut oakwood be unfortunate there be at norwood one oak that have mistletoe a timber tree which be fell about 1657 some person cut this mistletoe for some apothecary in london and sell they a quantity for ten shilling each time and leave only one branch remain for more to sprout out one fall lame shortly after soon after each of the other lose a eye and he that fell the tree though warn of these misfortune of the other man would notwithstanding adventure to do it and shortly afterwards break he leg as if the hamadryad have resolve to take a ample revenge for the injury do to they venerable and sacred oak we can understand then how the custom originate of plant the oak on the boundary of land a survival of which still remain in the so-called gospel oak of many of we english parish with thor 's tree thus stand we forefather feel a sense of security which materially add to the peace and comfort of they daily life but its sacred attribute be not limit to this country many a legend on the continent testify to the safety afford by its shelter branch indeed so great be its virtue that accord to a westphalian tradition the wander jew can only rest where he shall happen to find two oak grow in the form of a cross a further proof of its exalted character may be gather from the fact that around its root scandinavian mythology have gather fairyland and hence in germany the hole in its trunk be the pathway for elf but the connection between lightning and plant extend over a wide area and germany be rich in legend relative to this species of folk-lore thus there be the magic springwort around which have cluster so many curious lightning myth and talismanic property by reason of its celestial origin this much-coveted plant when bury in the ground at the summit of a mountain have the reputation of draw down the lightning and divide the storm it be difficult however to procure especially as there be no certainty as to the exact species of plant to which it belong although grimm identify it with the _ euphorbium lathyri _ at any rate it be chiefly procurable by the woodpecker -- a lightning-bearer and to secure this much-prized treasure its nest must be stop up access to which it will quickly gain by touch it with the springwort but if one have in readiness a pan of water a fire or a red cloth the bird will let the plant fall which otherwise it would be a difficult work to obtain the notion no doubt be that the bird must return the mystic plant to the element from which it spring that be either the water of the cloud or the lightning fire enclose therein -lrb- 11 -rrb- professor gubernati refer to the symbolical nature of this tradition remark that this herb may be the moon itself which open the hiding-place of the night or the thunderbolt which open the hiding-place of the cloud accord to the swiss version of the story it be the hoopoe that bring the spring-wort a bird also endowed with mystic virtue -lrb- 12 -rrb- while in iceland normandy and ancient greece it be a eagle a swallow or a ostrich analogous to the talismanic property of the springwort be those of the famous luck or key-flower of german folk-lore by the discovery of which the fortunate possessor effect a entrance into otherwise inaccessible fairy haunt where unlimited treasure be offer for he acceptance there then again the luck-flower be no doubt intend to denote the lightning which reveal strange treasure give water to the parched and thirsty land and as mr fiske remark make plain what be do under cover of darkness -lrb- 13 -rrb- the lightning-flash too which now and then as a lesson of warn instantly strike dead those who either rashly or presumptuously essay to enter its awe-inspiring portal be exemplify in another version of the same legend a shepherd while lead he flock over the ilsentein pause to rest but immediately the mountain open by reason of the springwort or luck-flower in the staff on which he lean within the cavern a white lady appear who invite he to accept as much of she wealth as he chose thereupon he fill he pocket and hasten to quit she mysterious domain he heed not she enigmatical warning forget not the best the result be that as he pass through the door he be sever in twain amidst the crash of thunder story of this kind however be the exception legendary lore generally regard the lightning as a benefactor rather than a destroyer the lightning-flash to quote mr baring-gould 's word reach the barren dead and thirsty land forth gush the water of heaven and the parched vegetation burst once more into the vigor of life restore after suspend animation that this be the case we have ample proof in the myth relate to plant in many of which the life-giving property of the lightning be clearly depict hence also the extraordinary healing property which be ascribe to the various lightning plant ash rod for instance be still use in many part of england for the cure of diseased sheep cow and horse and in cornwall as a remedy for hernia child be pass through hole in ash tree the mistletoe have the reputation of be a antidote for poison and a specific against epilepsy culpepper speak of it as a sure panacea for

the burning of a thorn-bush have long be consider a sure preventive of mildew in wheat without multiply further illustration there can be no doubt that the therapeutic virtue of these so-called lightning plant may be trace to in very many case they mythical origin it be not surprising too that plant of this stamp should have be extensively use as charm against the influence of occult power

plant in most country in the nefarious trade carry on by the representative of this cruel system of sorcery certain plant be largely employ for work marvel hence the mystic character which they have ever since retain it be necessary however that these should be pluck at certain phase of the moon or season of the year or from some spot where the sun be suppose not to have shine on it -lrb- 1 -rrb- hence shakespeare make one of he witch speak of root of hemlock digg would i ' the dark and of slip of yew sliver would in the moon 's eclipse a practice which be long keep up the plant too which form the witch ' pharmacopoeia be generally select either from they legendary association or by reason of they poisonous and soporific quality thus two of those most frequently use as ingredient in the mystic cauldron be the vervain and the rue these plant have be specially credit with supernatural virtue the former probably derive its notoriety from the fact of its be sacred to thor a honor which mark it out like other lightning plant as peculiarly adapt for occult use it be moreover among the sacred plant of the druid and be only gather by they when the dog-star arise from unsunned spot at the same time it be noteworthy that many of the plant which be in repute with witch for work they marvel be reckon as counter-charm a fact which be not surprising as material use by wizard and other for magical purpose have generally be regard as equally efficacious if employ against they charm and spell -lrb- 2 -rrb- although vervain therefore as the enchanter ' plant be gather by witch to do mischief in they incantation yet as aubrey say it hinder witch from they will a circumstance to which drayton further refer when he speak of the vervain as ` gainst witchcraft much avayling rue likewise which enter so largely into magic rite be once much in request as a antidote against such practice and nowadays when wear on the person in conjunction with agrimony maiden-hair broom-straw and ground ivy it be say in the tyrol to confer fine vision and to point out the presence of witch it be still a undecided question as to why rue should out of all other plant have gain its widespread reputation with witch but m maury suppose that it be on account of its be a narcotic and cause hallucination at any rate it seem to have acquire at a early period in this country a superstitious reverence for as mr conway say -lrb- 3 -rrb- we find the missionary sprinkle holy water from brush make of it whence it be call ` herb of grace ' respect the rendezvous of witch it may be note that they very frequently resort to hill and mountain they meeting take place on the mead on the oak sward under the lime under the oak at the pear tree thus the fairy ring which be often to be meet with on the sussex downs be know as hag-track -lrb- 4 -rrb- from the belief that they be cause by hag and witch who dance there at midnight -lrb- 5 -rrb- they love for sequestered and romantic locality be widely illustrate on the continent instance of which have be collect together by grimm who remark how the fame of particular witch mountain extend over wide kingdom accord to a tradition current in friesland -lrb- 6 -rrb- no woman be to be find at home on a Friday because on that day they hold they meeting and have dance on a barren heath occasionally too they show a strong predilection for certain tree to approach which as night-time draw near be consider highly dangerous the juda tree -lrb- _ cerci siliquastrum _ -rrb- be one of they favorite retreat perhaps on account of its traditionary association with the apostle the neapolitan witch hold they tryst under a walnut tree near benevento -lrb- 7 -rrb- and at bologna the peasantry tell how these evil worker hold a midnight meeting beneath the walnut tree on st john 's eve the elder tree be another haunt under whose branch witch be fond of lurk and on this account caution must be take not to tamper with it after dark -lrb- 8 -rrb- again in the netherland experience shepherd be careful not to let they flock feed after sunset for there be wicked elf that prepare poison in certain plant -- nightwort be one of these nor do any man dare to sleep in a meadow or pasture after sunset for as the shepherd say he would have everything to fear a tyrolese legend -lrb- 9 -rrb- relate how a boy who have climb a tree overlook the ghastly doings of certain witch beneath its bough they tear in piece the corpse of a woman and throw the portion in the air the boy catch one and keep it by he but the witch on count the piece find that one be miss and so replace it by a scrap of alderwood when instantly the dead come to life again similarly also they have they favorite flower one have be the foxglove nickname witch ' bell from they decorate they finger with its blossom while in some locality the hare-bell be designate the witch ' thimble on the other hand flower of a yellow or greenish hue be distasteful to they -lrb- 10 -rrb- in the witchcraft movement it would seem that certain plant be in requisition for particular purpose these worker of darkness have utilise the property of herb to special end a plant be not indiscriminately select but on account of possess some virtue as to render it suitable for any design that the witch might have in view consider too how multitudinous and varied be they action they have constant need of apply to the vegetable world for material with which to carry out they plan but foremost amongst they requirement be the power of locomotion wherewith to enable they with supernatural rapidity to travel from one locality to another accordingly one of they most favorite vehicle be a besom or broom a implement which it have be suggest from its be a type of the wind be a appropriate utensil in the hand of the witch who be windmaker and worker in that element -lrb- 11 -rrb- accord to the _ asiatic register _ for 1801 the eastern as well as the european witch practice they spell by dancing at midnight and the principal instrument they use on such occasion be a broom hence in hamburg sailor after long toiling against a contrary wind on meeting another ship sailing in a opposite direction throw a old broom before the vessel believe thereby to reverse the wind -lrb- 12 -rrb- as too in the case of vervain and rue the besom although dearly love by witch be still extensively use as a counter-charm against they machination -- it be a well-known belief both in england and germany that no individual of this stamp can step over a besom lay inside the threshold hence also in westphalium at shrovetide white besom with white handle be tie to the cow ' horn and in the rite connect with the midsummer fire keep up in different part of the country the besom hold a prominent place in bohemia for instance the young man collect for some week beforehand as many worn-out broom as they can lay they hand on these after dip in tar they light -- run with they from one bonfire to another -- and when burn out they be place in the field as charm against blight -lrb- 13 -rrb- the large ragwort -- know in ireland as the fairy ' horse -- have long be seek for by witch when take they midnight journey burn in he address to the deil make he witch skim the muir and dizzy crag on rag-bred nag with wicked speed the same legendary belief prevail in cornwall in connection with the castle peak a high rock to the south of the logan stone here write mr hunt -lrb- 14 -rrb- many a man and woman too now quietly sleep in the churchyard of st levan would have they the power attest to have see the witch fly into the castle peak on moonlight night mount on the stem of the ragwort amongst other plant use for a similar purpose be the bulrush and reed in connection with-which may be quote the irish tale of the rush and cornstalk that turn into horse the moment you bestride they -lrb- 15 -rrb- in germany -lrb- 16 -rrb- witch be say to use hay for transport themselves through the air when engage in they various occupation they often consider it expedient to escape detection by assume invisibility and for this object seek the assistance of certain plant such as the fern-seed -lrb- 17 -rrb- in sweden hazel-nut be suppose to have the power of make invisible and it may be remember how in one of andersen 's story the elfin princess have the faculty of vanish at will by put a wand in she mouth -lrb- 18 -rrb- but these be not the only plant suppose to confer invisibility for german folk-lore tell we how the far-famed luck-flower be endowed with the same wonderful property and by the ancient the heliotrope be credit with a similar virtue but which boccaccio in he humorous tale of calandrino in the decameron apply to the so-called stone heliotrope be a stone of such extraordinary virtue that the bearer of it be effectually conceal from the sight of all present dante in he inferno xxiv 92 further allude to it : amid this dread exuberance of woe run naked spirit wing with horrid fear nor hope have they of crevice where to hide or heliotrope to charm they out of view in the same way the agate be say to render a person invisible and to turn the sword of foe against themselves -lrb- 19 -rrb- the swiss peasant affirm that the ascension day wreath of the amaranth make the wearer invisible and in the tyrol the mistletoe be credit with this property but some plant as we have already point out be credit with the magic property of reveal the presence of witch and of expose they engage in the pursuit of ply they nefarious call in this respect the st john 's wort be in great request and hence it be extensively worn as a amulet especially in germany on st john 's eve a time when not only witch by common report people the air but evil spirit wander about on no friendly errand thus the italian name of devil-chaser from the circumstance of its scare away the worker of darkness by bring they hidden deed to light this moreover account for the custom so prevalent in most european country of decorate doorway and window with its blossom on st john 's eve in we own country stowe -lrb- 20 -rrb- speak of it as its have be place over the door together with green birch fennel orpine and white lily whereas in france the peasantry still reverence it as disperse every kind of unseen evil influence the elder be invest with similar property which seem to have be more potent than even those attribute to the st john 's wort accord to a old tradition any baptize person whose eye be anoint with the green juice of its inner bark could see witch in any part of the world hence the tree be extremely obnoxious to witch a fact which probably account for its have be so often plant near cottage its magic influence have also cause it to be introduce into various rite as in styrium on bertha night -lrb- January 6th -rrb- when the devil go about in great force -lrb- 21 -rrb- as a safeguard person be recommend to make a magic circle in the center of which they should stand with elder-berry gather on st john 's night by so do the mystic fern seed may be obtain which possess the strength of thirty or forty man in germany too a species of wild radish be say to reveal witch as also be the ivy and saxifrage enable its bearer to see witch on walpurgi night but in spite of plant of this kind witch somehow or other contrived to escape detection by the employment of the most subtle charm and spell they generally too take the precaution of avoid such plant as be antagonistic to they display a cunning ingenuity in most of they design which it be by no means easy to forestall hence in the composition of they philtre and potion they infuse the juice of the most deadly herb such as that of the nightshade or monkshood and to add to the potency of these baleful draught they consider it necessary to add as many as seven or nine of the most poisonous plant they could obtain such for instance as those enumerate by one of the witch in ben jonson 's masque of queen who say : -- and i ha ' be pluck plant among hemlock henbane adder 's tongue nightshade moonwort libbard 's bane and twice by the dog be like to be ta'en another plant use by witch in they incantation be the sea or horn poppy know in mediaeval time as _ ficus infernoli _ hence it be further notice by ben jonson in the witch ' song : yes i have bring to help we vow horn poppy cypress bough the fig tree wild that grow on tomb and juice that from the larch tree come then of course there be the wondrous moonwort -lrb- _ botrychium lunarium _ -rrb- which be doubly valuable from its mystic virtue for as culpepper -lrb- 22 -rrb- tell we it be believe to open lock and possess other magic virtue the mullein popularly term the hag-taper be also in request and the honesty -lrb- _ lunarium bienni _ -rrb- in sorcery excel be equally employ by scotch witch the woodbine be a favorite plant -lrb- 23 -rrb- who in effect magical cure pass they patient nine time through a girth or garland of green woodbine again a popular means employ by witch of injure they enemy be by the briony cole in he art of simple for instance inform we how they take likewise the root of mandrake accord to some or as i rather suppose the root of briony which simple folk take for the true mandrake and make thereof a ugly image by which they represent the person on whom they intend to exercise they witchcraft and lord bacon speaking of the mandrake say -- some plant there be but rare that have a mossie or downy root and likewise that have a number of thread like beard as mandrake whereof witch and impostor make a ugly image give it the form of a face at the top of the root and leave those string to make a broad beard down to the foot the witchcraft literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth century contain numerous allusion to the diabolical practice -- a superstition immortalise by shakespeare the mandrake from its suppose mysterious character be intimately associate with witch and ben jonson in he masque of queen make one of the hag who have be gather this plant say i last night lay all alone on the ground to hear the mandrake groan and pluck he up though he grow full low and as i have do the cock do crow we have already incidentally speak of the vervain st john 's wort elder and rue as antagonistic to witchcraft but to these may be add many other well-known plant such as the juniper mistletoe and blackthorn indeed the list might be greatly extend -- the vegetable kingdom have supply in most part of the world almost countless charm to counteract the evil design of these malevolent being in we own country the little pimpernel herb-pari and cyclamen be formerly gather for this purpose and the angelica be think to be specially noisome to witch the snapdragon and the herb-betony have the reputation of avert the most subtle form of witchcraft and dill and flax be worn as talisman against sorcery holly be say to be antagonistic to witch for as mr folkard -lrb- 24 -rrb- say in its name they see but another form of the word ` holy ' and its thorny foliage and blood-red berry be suggestive of the most christian association then there be the rowan-tree or mountain-ash which have long be consider one of the most powerful antidote against work of darkness of every kind probably from its sacred association with the worship of the druid hence it be much value in scotland and the follow couplet of which there be several version still embody the popular faith : rowan-tree and red thread put the witch to they speed but its fame have not be confine to any one locality and as far south as cornwall the peasant when he suspect that he cow have be overlook twist a ashen twig round its horn indeed so potent be the ash as a counter charm to sorcery that even the smallest twig render they action impotent and hence in a old ballad entitle laidley wood in the northumberland garland it be say : the spell be vain the hag return to the queen in sorrowful mood cry that witch have no power where there be row ` n-tree wood hence person carry a ashen twig in they pocket and accord to a yorkshire proverb : if you whipstick make of row 'n you may ride you nag through any town but on the other hand woe to the lad without a rowan-tree gall possess of such virtue it be not surprising that the mystic ash should have be hold in the highest repute in illustration of which we find many a amusing anecdote thus accord to a herefordshire tradition some year ago two hogshead full of money be conceal in a underground cellar belong to the castle of penyard where they be keep by supernatural force a farmer however make up he mind to get they out and employ for the purpose twenty steer to draw down the iron door of the vault on the door be slightly open a jackdaw be see sit on one of the cask but the door immediately close with a bang -- a voice be hear to say have it not be for you quicken tree goad and you yew tree pin you and you cattle have all be draw in another anecdote current in yorkshire be interesting show how fully superstition of this kind be believe -lrb- 25 -rrb- : -- a woman be lately in my shop and in pull out she purse bring out also a piece of stick a few inch long i ask she why she carry that in she pocket ` oh ' she reply ' i must not lose that or i shall be do for ' ` why so ' i inquire ` well ' she answer ' i carry that to keep off the witch while i have that about I they can not hurt I ' on my add that there be no witch nowadays she instantly reply ` oh yes there be thirteen at this very time in the town but so long as i have my rowan-tree safe in my pocket they can not hurt I ' occasionally when the dairymaid churn for a long time without make butter she would stir the cream with a twig of mountain ash and beat the cow with another thus break the witch 's spell but to prevent accident of this kind it have long be customary in the northern country to make the churn-staff of ash for the same reason herd-boy employ a ash-twig for drive cattle and one may often see a mountain-ash grow near a house on the continent the tree be in equal repute and in norway and denmark rowan branch be usually put over stable door to keep out witch a similar notion prevail in germany no tree perhaps hold such a prominent place in witchcraft-lore as the mountain-ash its mystic power have rarely fail to render fruitless the evil influence of these enemy of mankind in we northern county witch be say to dislike the bracken fern because it bear on its root the initial c which may be see on cut the root horizontally -lrb- 26 -rrb- and in most place equally distasteful to they be the yew perhaps for no better reason than its have formerly be much plant in churchyard the herb-bennett -lrb- _ geum urbanum _ -rrb- like the clover from its trefoiled leaf render witch powerless and the hazel have similar virtue among some of the plant consider antagonistic to sorcery on the continent may be mention the water-lily which be gather in the rhine district with a certain formulum in tuscany the lavender counteract the evil eye and a german antidote against the hurtful effect of any malicious influence be a ointment make of the leaf of the marsh-mallow in italy a olive branch which have be bless keep the witch from the dwelling and in some part of the continent the plum-tree be use kolb write mr black -lrb- 27 -rrb- who become one of the first wonder-doctor of the tyrol when he be call to assist any bewitch person make exactly at midnight the smoke of five different sort of herb and while they be burn the bewitch be gently beat with a martyr-thorn birch which have to be get the same night this beat the patient with thorn be think to be really beat the hag who have cause the evil some season too have be suppose to be closely associate with the witch as in germany where all flax must be spin before twelfth night for one who spin afterwards be liable to be bewitch lastly to counteract the spell of the evil eye from which many innocent person be believe to suffer in the witchcraft period many flower have be in requisition among the numerous charm use thus the russian maiden still hang round the stem of the birch-tree red ribbon the brahman gather rice and in italy rue be in demand the scotch peasantry pluck twig of the ash the highland woman the groundsel and the german folk wear the radish in early time the ringwort be recommend by apuleius and later on the fern be regard as a preservative against this baneful influence the chinese put faith in the garlic and in short every country have its own special plant it would seem too that after a witch be dead and bury precautionary measure be take to frustrate she baneful influence thus in russium aspen be lay on

folk-lore and in many respects be closely connect with they mystic history it be by no means easy always to account for some of we most beautiful flower have satanic surroundings although frequently the explanation must be seek in they poisonous and deadly quality in some case too the student of comparative mythology may trace they evil reputation to those early tradition which be the expression of certain primitive belief the survival of which nowadays be find in many a apparently meaningless superstition anyhow the subject be a very wide one and be equally represent in most country it should be remembered moreover that rudimentary form of dualism -- the antagonism of a good and evil deity -lrb- 1 -rrb- -- have from a remote period occupy man 's mind a system of belief know even among the lower race of mankind hence just as some plant would in process of time acquire a sacred character other would do the reverse amongst the legendary story and folktale of most country we find frequent allusion to the devil as a active agent in utilise various flower for he mischievous pursuit and on the continent we be tell of a certain evil spirit name kleure who transform himself into a tree to escape notice a superstition which under a variety of form still linger here and there -lrb- 2 -rrb- it would seem too that in some of we old legend and superstition the term puck and devil be synonymous a circumstance which explain the meaning otherwise unintelligible of many item of plant-lore in we own and other country thus the word puck have be identify with _ pogge _ -- toad under which form the devil be suppose to be personify and hence probably originate such expression as toadstool paddock-stool & c the thorn of the eglantine be say to point downward because when the devil be exclude from heaven he try to regain he lost position by means of a ladder compose of its thorn but when the eglantine be only allow to grow as a bush out of spite he place its thorn in they

of make a large quantity of blackberry jam and finding that less fruit have be bring to she than she require she say to the charwoman i wish you would send some of you child to gather I three or four

one current in devonshire respect st dunstan who it be say buy up a quantity of barley for brewing beer the devil know how anxious the saint would be to get a good sale for he beer offer to blight the

this kind be find throughout the world every country have its own special plant in demand for this purpose however whimsical they may seem they at any rate have the sanction of antiquity and can claim a antecedent history certainly worthy of a better cause footnote : 1 thorpe 's northern mythology 2 _ fraser 's magazine _ 1870 p 720 chapter ix dream-plant the importance attach to dream in all primitive and savage culture account for the significance ascribe to certain plant find by visitor to dreamland at the outset it may be notice that various drug and narcotic potion have from time immemorial be employ for produce dream and vision -- a process still in force amongst uncivilised tribe thus the mundrucus of north brazil when desirous of gain information on any special subject would administer to they seer narcotic drink so that in they dream they might be favor with the knowledge require certain of the amazon tribe use narcotic plant for encouraging vision and the californian indian write mr tylor -lrb- 1 -rrb- would give child narcotic potion to gain from the ensue vision information about they enemy whilst he add the darien indian use the seed of the _ datura sanguinca _ to bring on in child prophetic delirium in which they reveal hidden treasure similarly the delaware medicine-man use to drink decoction of a intoxicating nature until they mind become wildered so that they see extraordinary vision -lrb- 2 -rrb- the north american indian also hold intoxication by tobacco to be supernatural ecstasy it be curious to find a survival of this source of superstition in modern european folk-lore thus on the continent many a lover put the four-leaved clover under he pillow to dream of he lady-love and in we own country daisy-root be use by the rustic maiden for the same purpose the russian be familiar with a certain herb know as the _ son-trava _ a dream herb which have be identify with the _ pulsatillum paten _ and be say to blossom in April and to have a azure-coloured flower when place under the pillow it will induce dream which be generally suppose to be fulfil it have be suggest that it be from its title of tree of dream that the elm become a prophetic tree have be select by virgil in the aeneid -lrb- vi -rrb- as the roosting-place of dream in gloomy orcus : full in the midst a spreading elm display he aged arm and cast a mighty shade each tremble leaf with some light vision teem and leave impregnate with airy dream at the present day the yarrow or milfoil be use by love-sick maiden who be direct to pluck the mystic plant from a young man 's grave repeat meanwhile this formulum : yarrow sweet yarrow the first that i have find in the name of jesus christ i pluck it from the ground as jesus love sweet mary and take she for he dear so in a dream this night i hope my true love will appear indeed many other plant be in demand for this species of love-divination some of which be associate with certain day and festival in sweden for instance if on midsummer night nine kind of flower be lay under the head a youth or maiden will dream of he or she sweetheart -lrb- 3 -rrb- hence in these simple and rustic love-charm may be trace similar belief as prevail among rude community again among many of the american indian tribe we find accord to mr dorman -lrb- 4 -rrb- a mythical tree or vine which have a sacredness connect with it of peculiar significance form a connecting-link and medium of communication between the world of the living and the dead it be generally use by the spirit as a ladder to pass downward and upward upon the ojibway have possess one of these vine the upper end of which be twine round a star he further add that many tradition be tell of attempt to climb these heavenly ladder and if a young man have be much favor with dream and the people believe he have the art of look into futurity the path be open to the highest honor the future prophet put down he dream in pictograph and when he have a collection of these if they prove true in any respect then this record of he revelation be appeal to as proof of he prophetic power but without enumerate further instance of these savage dream-tradition which be closely ally with the animistic theory of primitive culture we would turn to those plant which modern european folk-lore have connect with dreamland these be somewhat extensive but a brief survey of some of the most important one will suffice to indicate they general significance firstly to dream of white flower have be suppose to prognosticate death with which may be compare the popular belief that if a white rosebush put forth unexpectedly it be a sign of death to the nearest house dream-omen in many case reflect the superstition of daily life in scotch ballad the birch be associate with the dead a illustration of which we find in the subjoin line : -- i dream a dreary dream last nicht god keep we a ' frae sorrow i dream i pu would the birk sae green wus ' my true love on yarrow i 'll redde you dream my sister dear i 'll tell you a ' you sorrow you pu would the birk wus ' you true love he be kill -- he be kill on yarrow of the many plant which have be consider of good omen when see in dream may be mention the palm-tree olive jasmine lily laurel thistle thorn wormwood currant pear & c whereas the greatest luck attach to the rose on the other hand equally numerous be the plant which denote misfortune among these may be include the plum cherry wither rose walnut hemp cypress dandelion & c bean be still say to produce bad dream and to portend evil and accord to a leicestershire say if you wish for awful dream or desire to go crazy sleep in a bean-field all night some plant be say to foretell long life such as the oak apricot apple box grape and fig and sickness be suppose to be presage by such plant as the elder onion acorn and plum love and marriage be as might be expect well represent in the dream-flora a circumstance indeed which have not fail to impress the young at all time thus foremost amongst the flower which indicate success in love be the rise a fact which be not surprising when it be remembered how largely this favorite of we garden enter into love-divination then there be the clover to dream of which foretell not only a happy marriage but one productive of wealth and prosperity in this case too it must be remember the clover have long be reckon as a mystic plant have in most european country be much employ for the purpose of divination of further plant credit as augur well for love affair be the raspberry pomegranate cucumber currant and box but the walnut imply unfaithfulness and the act of cut parsley be a omen that the person so occupied will sooner or later be cross in love this ill-luck attach to parsley be in some measure explain from the fact that in many respects it be a unlucky plant it be a belief as we have notice elsewhere widely spread in devonshire that to transplant parsley be to commit a serious offence against the guardian genius who preside over parsley-bed certain to be punish either on the offender himself or some member of he family within the course of the year once more to dream of cut cabbage write mr folkard -lrb- 5 -rrb- denote jealousy on the part of wife husband or lover as the case may be to dream of any one else cut they portend a attempt by some person to create jealousy in the loved one 's mind to dream of eat cabbage imply sickness to loved one and loss of money the bramble a important plant in folk-lore be partly unlucky and to dream of pass through place cover with bramble portend trouble if they prick you secret enemy will do you a injury with you friend if they draw blood expect heavy loss in trade but to dream of pass through bramble unhurt denote a triumph over enemy to dream of be prick with briar say the royal dream book -lrb- 6 -rrb- show that the person dream have a ardent desire to something and that young folk dream thus be in love who prick themselves in strive to gather they rise some plant be say to denote riches such as the oak marigold pear and nut tree while the gathering of nut be say to presage the discovery of unexpected wealth again to dream of fruit or flower out of season be a bad omen a notion indeed with which we find various proverb current throughout the country thus the northamptonshire peasant consider the bloom of the apple-tree after the fruit be ripe as a certain omen of death -- a belief embody in the follow proverb : a bloom upon the apple-tree when the apple be ripe be a sure termination to somebody 's life and once more accord to a old sussex adage -- fruit out of season sound out of reason on the other hand to dream of fruit or any sort of crop during its proper season be still a indication of good luck -lrb- 7 -rrb- thus it be lucky to dream of daisy in spring-time or summer but just the reverse in autumn or winter without enumerate further instance of this kind we may quote the subjoin rhyme relate to the onion as a specimen of many similar one scatter here and there in various country : -lrb- 8 -rrb- to dream of eat onion mean much strife in thy domestic scene secret find out or else betray and many falsehood make and say many plant in dream-lore have more than one meaning attach to they thus from the royal dream book we learn that yellow flower predict love mixed with jealousy and that you will have more child to maintain than what justly belong to you to dream of garlic indicate the discovery of hidden treasure but the approach of some domestic quarrel cherry again indicate inconstancy but one would scarcely expect to find the thistle regard as lucky for accord to a old piece of folk-lore to dream of be surround by this plant be a propitious sign foretell that the person will before long have some pleasing intelligence in the same way a similar meaning in dream-lore attach to the thorn accord to old dream-book the dream of yew indicate the death of a aged person who will leave considerable wealth behind he while the violet be say to devote advancement in life similarly too the vine foretell prosperity for which say a dream interpreter we have the example of astyage king of the mede who dream that he daughter bring forth a vine which be a prognostic of the grandeur riches and felicity of the great cyrus who be bear of she after this dream pluck ear of corn signify the existence of secret enemy and mr folkard quote a old authority which tell we that the juniper be potent in dream thus it be unlucky to dream of the tree itself especially if the person be sick but to dream of gather the berry if it be in winter denote prosperity to dream of the actual berry signify that the dreamer will shortly arrive at great honor and become a important person to the marry it foretell the birth of a male child again eat almond signify a journey its success or otherwise be denote by they tasting sweet or the contrary dream of grass be a auspicious omen provide it be green and fresh but if it be wither and decay it be a sign of the approach of misfortune and sickness follow perhaps by death woe betide too the person who dream that he be cut grass certain plant produce dream on particular occasion the mugwort and plantain have long be associate with midsummer and accord to thoma hill in he natural and artificial conclusion a rare coal be to be find under these plant but one hour in the day and one day in the year when aubrey happen to be walk behind montague house at twelve o'clock on midsummer day he relate how he see about twenty-two young woman most of they well dress and apparently all very busy weed on make inquiry he be inform that they be look for a coal under the root of a plantain to put beneath they head that night when they would not fail to dream of they future husband but unfortunately for this credulity as a old author long ago point out the coal be nothing but a old dead root and that it may be find almost any day and hour when seek for by lover the holly have long be suppose to have mystic virtue as a dream-plant when use on the eve of any of the follow festival : christmas new

slumber by three yell as if from the throat of three bear succeed by as many hoarse laugh when these have die away the form of she future husband will appear who will show he attachment to she by change the position of the water-pail whereas if he have no particular affection he will disappear without even touch they then of course from time immemorial all kind of charm have be observe on st valentine 's day to produce prophetic dream a popular charm consist of place two bay leave after sprinkle they with rose-water across the pillow repeat this formulum : -- good valentine be kind to I in dream let I my true love see st luke 's day be in year go by a season for love-divination and among some of the many direction give we may quote the subjoin which be somewhat elaborate : -- take marigold flower a sprig of marjoram thyme and a little wormwood dry they before a fire rub they to powder then sift it through a fine piece of lawn simmer these with a small quantity of virgin honey in white vinegar over a slow fire with this anoint you stomach breast and lip lie down and repeat these word thrice : -- ` st luke st luke be kind to I in dream let I my true love see ' this say hasten to sleep and in the soft slumber of night 's repose the very man whom you shall marry shall appear before you lastly certain plant have be largely use by gipsy and fortune-teller for invoke

instance he meteorological notion be the result of observation although in some case the reason assign for certain piece of weather-lore be far from obvious incidental allusion have already be make to the astrological doctrine of the influence of the moon 's change on plant -- a belief which still retain its hold in most agricultural district it appear that in year go by neither sowing planting nor graft be ever undertake without a scrupulous attention to the increase or wane of the moon -lrb- 1 -rrb- and the advice give by tusser in he five hundred point of husbandry be not forget even at the present day : -- sow pea and bean in the wane of the moon who soweth they sooner he soweth too soon that they with the planet may rest and rise and flourish with bear most plentiful-wise many of the old gardening book give the same advice although by some it have be severely ridicule scott in he discoverie of witchcraft note how the poor husbandman perceiveth that the increase of the moon maketh plant fruitful so as in the full moone they be in best strength decay in the wane and in the conjunction do entirely wither and fade similarly the growth of mushroom be say to be affect by the weather and in devonshire apple shrump up if pick during a wane moon -lrb- 2 -rrb- one reason perhaps for the attention so universally pay to the moon 's change in agricultural pursuit be write mr farrer that they be far more remarkable than any of the sun 's and more calculate to inspire dread by the nocturnal darkness they contend with and hence be hold in popular fancy nearly everywhere to cause portend or accord with change in the lot of mortal and all thing terrestrial -lrb- 3 -rrb- on this assumption may be explain the idea that the moon 's wane make thing on earth to wane when it be new or full it be everywhere the proper season for new crop to be sow in the hervey island cocoa-nut be generally plant in the full of the moon the size of the latter be regard as symbolical of the ultimate fulness of the fruit in the same way the weather of certain season of the year be suppose to influence the vegetable world and in rutlandshire we be tell that a green christmas bring a heavy harvest but a full moon about christmas day be unlucky hence the adage : light christmas light wheatsheaf dark christmas heavy wheatsheaf if the weather be clear on candlema day corn and fruit will then be dear and whoever doth plant or sow on shrove Tuesday it will always remain green accord to a piece of weather-lore in sweden there be a say that to strew ash branch in a field on ash Wednesday be equivalent to three day ' rain and three day ' sun rain on easter day foretell a good harvest but poor hay crop while thunder on all fool 's day bring good crop of corn and hay accord to the shepherd 's calendar if midsummer day be never so little rainy the hazel and walnut will be scarce corn smitten in many place but apple pear and plum will not be hurt and we be further remind : -- till st jame 's day be come and go there may be hop or there may be none speaking of hop it be say plenty of ladybird plenty of hop it be also a popular notion among we peasantry that if a drop of rain hang on a oat at this season there will be a good crop another agricultural adage say : -- no tempest good July lest corn come off bluely then there be the old michaelma rhyme : -- at michaelma time or a little before half a apple go to the core at christmas time or a little after a crab in the hedge and thanks to the grafter on the other hand the blossoming of plant at certain time be say to be a indication of the come weather and so when the bramble bloom early in June a early harvest may be expect and in the northern county the peasant judge of the advance of the year by the appearance of the daisy affirm that spring have not arrive till you can set you foot on twelve daisy we be also tell that when many hawthorn blossom be see a severe winter will follow and accord to wilsford the broom have plenty of blossom be a sign of a fruitful year of corn a surrey proverb tell we that it be always cold when the blackthorn come into flower and there be the rhyme which remind we that : -- if the oak be out before the ash ` twill be a summer of wet and splash but if the ash be before the oak ` twill be a summer of fire and smoke there be several version of this piece of weather-lore a old kentish one be oak smoke ash quash and accord to a version give in note and query -lrb- 1st series v 71 -rrb- : -- if the oak 's before the ash then you 'll only get a splash if the ash precede the oak then you may expect a soak from the shepherd 's calendar we learn that if in the fall of the leaf in October many leaf wither on the bough and hang there it betoken a frosty winter and much snow with which may be compare a devonshire say : -- if good apple you would have the leaf must go into the grave or in other word you must plant you tree in the fall of the leaf and again apple pear hawthorn-quick oak set they at all-hallow-tide and command they to prosper set they at candlema and entreat they to grow in germany -lrb- 4 -rrb- too there be a rhyme which may be thus translate : -- when the hawthorn bloom too early show we shall have still many snow in the same way the fruit of tree and plant be regard as a prognostication of the ensue weather and wilsford tell we that great store of walnut and almond presage a plentiful year of corn especially filbert the notion that a abundance of haw betoken a hard winter be still much credit and have give rise to the familiar scotch proverb : -- mony haw mony snaw another variation of the same adage in kent be a plum year a dumb year and many nit many pit imply that the abundance of nut in the autumn indicate the pit or grave of those who shall succumb to the hard and inclement weather of winter but on the other hand a cherry year a merry year a further piece of weather-lore tell we : -- many rain many rowan many rowan many yawn the meaning be that a abundance of rowan -- the fruit of the mountain-ash -- denote a deficient harvest among further saying of this kind may be notice one relate to the onion which be thus : -- onion 's skin very thin mild-winter 's come in onion 's skin thick and tough come winter cold and rough again many of we peasantry have long be accustom to arrange they farming pursuit from the indication give

leaf be as big as a mouse 's ear then to sow barley never fear when the elman leaf be as big as a ox 's eye then say i ` hie boy hie ' a warwickshire variation be : -- when elm leaf be big as a shilling plant kidney bean if to plant 'em you be willing when elm leaf be as big as a penny you _ must _ plant kidney bean if you mean to have any but if the grass grow in January the husbandman be recommend to lock he grain in the granary while a further proverb inform we that : -- on candlema day if the thorn hang a drop you be sure of a good pea crop in bygone time the appearance of the berry of the elder be hold to indicate the proper season for sowing wheat : -- with purple fruit when elder branch bend and they high hue the hip and cornel lend ere yet chill hoar-frost come or sleety rain sow with choice wheat the neatly furrow plain the elder be not without its teaching and accord to a popular old proverb : -- when the elder be white brew and bake a peck when the elder be black brew and bake a sack accord to a old proverb you must look for grass on the top of the oak tree the meaning be say ray that the grass seldom spring well before the oak begin to put forth in the western county it be assert that frost cease as soon as the mulberry tree burst into leaf with which may be compare the word of autolycus in the winter 's tale -lrb- iv 3 -rrb- : -- when daffodil begin to peer with heigh the doxy over the dale why then cony in the sweet o ' the year the dairyman be recommend in autumn to notice the appearance of the fern because : -- when the fern be as high as a ladle you may sleep as long as you be able when the fern begin to look red then milk be good with brown bread formerly certain agricultural operation be regulate by the season and a old rule tell the farmer -- upon st david 's day put oats and barley in the clay another version being : -- sow pea and bean on david and chad be the weather good or bad a somersetshire piece of agricultural lore fix a earlier date and bid the farmer to sow or set bean in candlema waddle in connection with the inclement weather that often prevail throughout the spring month it be commonly say they that go to they corn in may may come weep away but they that go in June may come back with a merry tune then there be the follow familiar pretty couplet of which there be several version : -- the bee doth love the sweetest flower so doth the blossom the April shower in connection with bean there be a well-known adage which say : -- be it weal or be it woe bean should blow before may go of the numerous other item of plant weather-lore it be say that march wind wake the ether -lrb- _ i e _ adder -rrb- and bloom the whin and many of we peasantry maintain that : -- a peck of march dust and a shower in may make the corn green and the field gay it should also be note that many plant be consider good barometer chickweed for instance expand its leaf fully when fine weather be to follow but if it should shut up then the traveller be to put on he greatcoat -lrb- 5 -rrb- the same too be say to be the case with the pimpernel convolvulus and clover while if the marigold do not open its petal by seven o'clock in the morning either rain or thunder may be expect in the course of the day accord to wilsford tezil or fuller 's thistle be gather and hang up in the house where the air may come freely to it upon the alteration of cold and windy weather will grow smoother and against rain will close up its prickle once more accord to the shepherd 's calendar chaff leave thistle-down or such light thing whisk about and turn round foreshow tempestuous wind and cole in he introduction to the knowledge of plant inform we that if the down flieth off colt 's - foot dandelion and thistle when there be no wind it be a sign of rain some plant again have gain a notoriety from open or shut they flower at the sun 's bidding in allusion to which perdita remark in the winter 's tale -lrb- iv 3 -rrb- : -- the marigold that go to bed with the sun and with he rise weep it be also erroneously say like the sun-flower to turn its blossom to the sun the latter be thus describe by thomson : -- the lofty follower of the sun sad when he set shut up she yellow leaf droop all night and when he warm return point she enamor would bosom to he ray another plant of this kind be the endive which be say to open its petal at eight o'clock in the morning and to close they at four in the afternoon thus we be tell how : -- on upland slope the shepherd mark the hour when to the dial true cichorium to the towering lark lift she soft eye serenely blue and as another floral index of the time of day may be notice the goat 's - beard opening at sunrise and closing at noon -- hence one of its popular name of go to

amain to conjure lose hour back again among other flower possess a similar feature may be notice the wild succory creep mallow purple sandwort small bindweed common nipplewort and smooth sow-thistle then of course there be the pimpernel know as the shepherd 's clock and poor man 's weather-glass while the small purslane and the common garden lettuce be also include in the flower-clock -lrb- 6 -rrb- among further item of weather-lore associate with may we be tell how he that sow oats in may get little that way and he who mow in may will have neither fruit nor hay calm weather in June set corn in tune and a suffolk adage say : -- cut you thistle before st john you will have two instead of one but midsummer rain spoil hay and grain whereas it be commonly say that a leafy may and a warm June bring on the harvest very soon again boisterous wet weather during the month of July be to be deprecate for as the old adage run : -- no tempest good July lest the corn look surly flower of this kind be very numerous and under a variety of form prevail largely in we own and other country a interesting collection of which have be collect by mr swainson in he interesting little volume on weather folk-lore in which he have give the parallel in foreign country it must be remembered however that a great number of these plant-saying originate very many year ago -- long before the alteration in the style of the calendar -- which in numerous instance will account for they apparent contradictory character in notice too these proverb account must be take of the variation of climate in different country for what apply to one locality do not to another thus for instance accord to a basque proverb a wet may a fruitful year whereas it be say in corsica a rainy may bring little barley and no wheat instance of this kind be of frequent occurrence and of course be in many case explain by the difference of climate but in compare all branch of folk-lore similar variation as we have already observe be noticeable to account for which be often a task full of difficulty of the numerous other instance of weather-lore associate with agricultural operation it be say in relation to rain : -- sow bean in the mud and they 'll grow like wood and a say in east anglium be to this effect : -- sow in the slop -lrb- or sop -rrb- heavy at top a further admonition advise the farmer to sow wheat in dirt and rye in dust while accord to a piece of folk-lore current in east anglium wheat well-sown be half-grown the scotch have a proverb warn the farmer against premature sowing : -- nae hurry wus ' you corn nae hurry wus ' you harrow snaw lie ahint the dyke mair may come and fill the furrow and accord to another old adage we be tell how : -- when the aspen leaf be no bigger than you nail be the time to look out for truff and peel -lrb- 7 -rrb- in short it will be find that most of we county have they item of weather-lore many of which whilst vary in some respect be evidently modification of one and the same belief in many case too it must be admit that this species of weather-wisdom be not base altogether on idle fancy but in accordance with recognize habit of plant under certain condition of weather indeed it have be point out that so sensitive be various flower to any change in the temperature or the amount of light that it have be notice that there be as much as one hour 's difference between the time when the same flower open at pari and upsalum it be too a familiar fact to student of vegetable physiology that the leaf of _ porlerium hygrometrica _ fold down or rise up in accordance with the state of the atmosphere in short it be point out in the _ standard _ in illustration of the extreme sensitiveness of certain plant to surround influence how the _ haedysarum _ have be well know ever since the day of linnseus to suddenly begin to quiver without any apparent cause and just as suddenly to stop force can not initiate the movement though cold will stop it and heat will set in motion again the suspend animation of the leaf if artificially keep from move they will when release instantly begin they task anew and with redoubled energy similarly the leaf of the _ colocasium esculenta _ -- the tara of the sandwich island -- will often shiver at irregular time of the day and night and with such energy that little bell hang on the petal tinkle and yet curious to say we be tell that the keenest eye have not yet be able to detect any peculiarity in these plant to account for these strange motion it have be suggest that they be due to change in the weather of such a slight character that we nerve be incapable of appreciate they or the mercury of record they accompany oscillation footnote : 1 tylor 's primitive culture 1873 i

not surprising that flower the varied and lovely production of nature 's dainty handiwork should have be employ as symbolic emblem and most aptly indicative oftentimes of what word when even most wisely choose can ill convey for as tennyson remark : -- any man that walk the mead in bud or blade or bloom may find a meaning suit to he mind hence whether we turn to the page of the sacred volume or to the early greek writings we find the symbolism of flower most eloquently illustrate while persian poetry be rich in allusion of the same kind indeed as mr ingram have remark in he flora

thousand of year ago exist in the indian egyptian and chaldean civilisation which have long since pass away he further add how the chinese whose chronicle antedate the historic record of all other nation seem to have have a simple but complete mode of communicate idea by means of florigraphic sign whereas the monument of the old assyrian and egyptian race bear upon they venerable surface a code of floral telegraphy whose hieroglyphical meaning be veil or but dimly guess at in we day the subject be a extensive one and also enter largely into the ceremonial use of flower many of which be purposely select for certain rite from they long-established symbolical character at the same time it must be remember that many plant have have a meaning attach to they by poet and other who have by a license of they own make they to represent certain sentiment and idea for which there be no authority save they own fancy hence in numerous instance a meaning wholly misguide have be assign to various plant and have give rise to much confusion this too it may be add be the case in other country as well as we own furthermore as m de gubernati observe there exist a great number of book which pretend to explain the language of flower wherein one may occasionally find a popular or traditional symbol but as a rule these expression be generally the wild fancy of the author himself hence in deal with plant language one be confront with a host of handbook many of which be not only inaccurate but misleading but in enumerate the recognize and well-known plant that have acquire a figurative meaning it will be find that in a variety of case this may be trace to they connection with some particular event in year past and not to some chance or caprice as some would make we believe the amaranth for instance which be the emblem of immortality receive its name never-fading from the greek on account of the lasting nature of its blossom accordingly milton crown with amaranth the angelic

loveliness the sycamore imply curiosity from zacchaeus who climb up into this tree to witness the triumphal entry of christ into jerusalem and from time immemorial the violet have be the emblem of constancy : -- violet be for faithfulness which in I shall abide hope likewise that from you heart you will not let it hide in some case flower seem to have derive they symbolism from certain event associate with they thus the periwinkle signify early recollection or pleasure of memory in connection with which rousseau tell we how as madame warens and himself be proceed to charmatte she be strike by the appearance of some of these blue flower in the hedge and exclaim here be the periwinkle still in flower thirty year afterwards the sight of the periwinkle in flower carry he memory back to this occasion and he inadvertently cry ah there be the periwinkle incident of the kind have originate many of the symbol find in plant language and at the same time invest they with a peculiar historic interest once more plant language it have be remark be one of those bind link which connect the sentiment and feeling of one country with another although it may be in other respects these community have little in common thus as mr ingram remark in the introduction to he flora symbolica -lrb- p 12 -rrb- from the unlettered north american indian to the highly polished parisian from the day of dawn among the mighty asiatic race whose very name be bury in oblivion down to the present time the symbolism of flower be everywhere and in all age discover permeate all stratum of society it have be and still be the habit of many people to name the different portion of the year after the most prominent change of the vegetable kingdom in the united state the language of flower be say to have more votary than in any other part of the world many work relative to which have be publish in recent year indeed the subject will always be a popular one for further detail illustrative of which the reader would do well to consult mr hg adam 's useful work on the moral language and poetry of flower not to mention the constant allusion scatter throughout the work of we old poet such as shakespeare chaucer and drayton footnote : 1 introduction p 12 2 folkard 's plant legend p 389 3 see judith xv 13 4 flower-lore pp 197-8 5 plant-lore of shakespeare 6 flower-lore p 168 chapter xv fabulous plant the curious tradition of imaginary plant find amongst most nation have partly a purely mythological origin frequently too they may be attribute to the exaggerated account give by old traveller who influence by a desire to make themselves famous have go so far as to pretend that they see these fancied object anyhow from whatever source spring these production of ignorance and superstition have from a very early period be firmly credit but like the account give we of fabulous animal they have long ago be acknowledge as survival of popular error which owe they existence to the absence of botanical knowledge we have elsewhere refer to the great world tree and of the primitive idea of a human descent from tree indeed accord to the early and uncultured belief of certain community there be various kind of animal-producing tree account of which be very curious among these may be mention the vegetable lamb concern which olden writer have give the most marvellous description thus sir john maundeville who in he voyage and travel have record many marvellous sight which either come under he notice or be report to he during he travels have not omit to speak of this remarkable tree thus to quote he word : -- there groweth a manner of fruit as though it be gourde and when they be ripe man cut they in two and man find within a little beast in flesh in bone and blood -- as though it be a little lamb withouten wolle -- and man eat both the fruit and the beast and that be a great marvel of that fruit i have eat although it be wonderful but that i know well that god be marvellous in he work various account have be give of this wondrous plant and in parkinson 's paradisus it be represent as one of the plant which grow in the garden of eden its local name be the scythian or tartarian lamb and as it grow it might at a short distance be take for a animal rather than a vegetable production it be one of the genus polypodium root decumbent thickly clothe with a very soft close hoal of a deep yellow color it be also call by the tartar barometz and a chinese nickname be rufous dog mr bell in he journey to ispahan thus describe a specimen which he see : -- it seem to be make by art to imitate a lamb it be say to eat up and devour all the grass and weed within its reach though it may be think that a opinion so very absurd could never find credit with people of the meanest understanding yet i have converse with some who be much inclined to believe it so very prevalent be the prodigious and absurd with some part of mankind among the more sensible and experienced tartar i find they laugh at it as a ridiculous fable blood be say to flow from it when cut or injure a superstition which probably originate in the fact that the fresh root when cut yield a tenacious gum like the blood of animal dr darwin in he love of the plant adopt the fable thus : -- e ` en round the pole the flame of love aspire and icy bosom feel the sacred fire cradle in snow and fan by arctic air shine gentle barometz the golden hair rest in earth each cloven hoof descend and round and round she flexile neck she bend crop of the gray coral moss and hoary thyme or lap with rosy tongue the melting rime eye with mute tenderness she distant dam or seem to bleat a vegetable lamb another curious fiction prevalent in olden time be that of the barnacle-tree to which sir john maundeville also allude : -- in we country be tree that bear a fruit that become fly bird those that fall in the water live and those that fall on the earth die and these be right good for man 's meat as early as the twelfth century this idea be promulgate by giraldus cambrensis in he topographium hibernia and gerarde in he herball or general history of plant publish in the year 1597 narrate the following : -- there be find in the north part of scotland and the isle adjacent call orcade certain tree whereon do grow small fish of a white color tend to russet wherein be contain little living creature which shell in time of maturity do open and out of they grow those little living thing which fall into the water do become fowl whom we call barnacle in the north of england brant-goose and in lancashire tree-goose but the other that do fall upon the land perish and do come to nothing but like many other popular fiction this notion be found on truth and probably originate in mistake the fleshy peduncle of the barnacle -lrb- _ lepa analifera _ -rrb- for the neck of a goose the shell for its head and the tentaculum for a tuft of feather there be many version of this eccentric myth and accord to one modification give by boëce the oldest scottish historian these barnacle-goose be first produce in the form of worm in old tree and further add that such a tree be cast on shore in the year 1480 when there appear on its be sawn asunder a multitude of worm throw themselves out of sundry hole and pore of the tree some of they be nude as they be new shapen some have both head foot and wing but they have no feather some of they be perfect shapen fowl at last the people have this tree each day in more admiration bring it to the kirk of st andrew 's beside the town of tyre where it yet remain to we day du bartas thus describe the various transformation of this bird : -- so slowe boôtes underneath he see in th ' ycie ile those gosling hatcht of tree whose fruitful leaf fall into the water be turn would they say to live fowl soon after so rotten side of broken ship do change to barnacle o transformation change 'twa first a green tree then a gallant hull lately a mushroom now a fly gull meyer write a treatise on this strange bird without father or mother and sir robert murray in the philosophical transaction say that these shell be hang at the tree by a neck longer than the shell of a filmy substance round and hollow and crease not unlike the windpipe of a chicken spread out broadest where it be fasten to the tree from which it seem to draw and convey the matter which serve for the growth and vegetation of the shell and the little bird within it in every shell that i open he add i find a perfect sea-fowl the little bill like that of a goose the eye mark the head neck breast wing tail and foot form the feather everywhere perfectly shaped and the foot like those of other water-fowl the chinese have a tradition of certain tree the leaf of which be finally change into bird with this story may be compare that of the oyster-bearing tree which bishop fleetwood describe in he curiosity of agriculture and gardening write in the year 1707 the oyster as see he say by the dominican du tertre at guadaloupe grow on the branch of tree and be not larger than the little english oyster that be to say about the size of a crown-piece they stick to the branch that hang in the water of a tree call paretuvier no doubt the seed of the oyster which be shed in the tree when they spawn cleave to those branch so that the oyster form themselves there and grow bigger in process of time and by they weight bend down the branch into the sea and then be refresh twice a day by the flux and reflux of it kircher speak of a tree in chili the leaf of which bring forth a certain kind of worm which eventually become change into serpent and describe a plant which grow in the molucca island nickname catopa on account of its leaf when fall off be transform into butterfly among some of the many other equally wonderful plant may be mention the stony wood which be thus describe by gerarde : -- be at rugby about such time as we fantastic people do with great concourse and multitude repair and run headlong unto the sacred well of newnam regi in the edge of warwickshire as unto the water of life which could cure all disease he visit these healing-well where he find grow over the same a fair ash-tree whose bough do hang over the spring of water whereof some that be seare and rotten and some that of purpose be break off fall into the water and be all turn into stone of these bough or part of the tree i bring into london which when i have break into piece therein might be see that the pith and all the rest be turn into stone still remain the same shape and fashion that they be of before they be in the water similarly sir john maundeville notice the dead sea fruit -- fruit find on the apple-tree near the dead sea to quote he own word : -- there be full fair apple and fair of color to behold but whoso breaketh they or cutteth they in two he shall find within they coal and cinder in token that by the wrath of god the city and the land be burnt and sunken into hell speaking of the many legendary tale connect with the apple may be mention the golden apple which hera receive at she marriage with zeus and place under the guardianship of the dragon ladon in the garden of the hesperide the northern iduna keep guard the sacred apple which by a touch restore the aged god to youth and accord to sir j maundeville the apple of pyban feed the pigmy with they smell only this remind we of the singing apple in the fairy romance which would persuade by its smell alone and enable the possessor to write poetry or prose and to display the most accomplished wit and of the singing tree in the arabian night each leaf of which be musical all the leaf join together in a delightful harmony but peculiarity of this kind be very varied and form a extensive section in plant-lore -- very many curious example be find in old travels and related with every semblance of truth in some instance tree have obtain a fabulous character from be connect with certain event thus there be the bleeding tree -lrb- 1 -rrb- it appear that one of the indictment lay to the charge of the marquis of argyll be this : -- that a tree on which thirty-six of he enemy be hang be immediately blast and when hew down a copious stream of blood run from it saturating the earth and that blood for several year be emit from the root then there be the poet 's tree which grow over the tomb of tan-sein a musician at the court of mohammed akbar whoever chew a leaf of this tree be long say to be inspire with sweet melody of voice a allusion to which be make by moore in lallum kookh : : -- he voice be sweet as if he have chew the leaf of that enchanted tree which grow over the tomb of the musician tan-sein the rare but occasional occurrence of vegetation in certain tree and shrub happen to take place at the period of christ 's birth give rise to the belief that such tree throw out they leaf with a holy joy to commemorate that anniversary a oak of the early budding species for two century enjoy such a notoriety have be say to shoot forth its leaf on old christmas day no leaf be see either before or after that day during winter there be the famous glastonbury thorn and in the same locality a walnut tree be report never to put forth its leaf before the feast of st barnaba the 11th June the monkish legend run thus : joseph of arimathaea after landing at no great distance from glastonbury walk to a hill about a mile from the town be weary he sit down here with he companion the hill henceforth be nickname weary-all-hill locally abbreviate into werral whilst rest joseph strike he staff into the ground which take root grow and blossom every christmas day previous to the time of charle i a branch of this famous tree be carry in procession with much ceremony at christmas time but during the civil war the tree be cut down many plant again as the sesame of the arabian night have the power of open door and procure a entrance into cavern and mountain side -- a survival of which we find in the primrose or key-flower of german legend similarly other plant such as the golden-rod have be renown for point to hidden spring of water and reveal treasure of gold and silver such fabulous property have be also assign to the hazel-branch popularly designate the divining-rod : -- some sorcerer do boast they have a rod gather would with vow and sacrifice and bear aloft will strangely nod the hidden treasure where it lie with plant of the kind we may compare the wonder-working moonwort -lrb- _ botrychium lunarium _ -rrb- which be say to open lock and to unshoe horse that tread on it a notion which du barta thus mention in he divine weeke -- horse that feed on the grassy hill tread upon moonwort with they hollow heel though lately shod at night go barefoot home they maister muse where they shoe become o moonwort tell I where thou bid ` st the smith hammer and pincher thou unshodd ` st they with alas what lock or iron engine be ' t that can thy subtle secret strength resist still the best farrier can not set a shoe so sure but thou -lrb- so shortly -rrb- canst undo the blasting-root know in germany as spring-wurzel and by we as spring-wort possess similar virtue for whatever lock be touch by it must yield it be no easy matter to find this magic plant but accord to a piece of popular folk-lore it be obtain by means of the woodpecker when this bird visit its nest it must have be previously plug up with wood to remove which it go in search of the spring-wort on hold this before the nest the wood shoot out from the tree as if drive by the most violent force meanwhile a red cloth must be place near the nest which will so scare the woodpecker that it will let the fabulous root drop there be several version of this tradition accord to pliny the bird be the raven in swabium it be the hoopoe and in switzerland the swallow in russium there be a plant grow in marshy land know as the rasir-trava which when apply to lock cause they to open instantly in iceland similar property be ascribe to the herb-pari there know as lasa-grass accord to a piece of breton lore the selago or cloth of gold can not be cut with steel without the sky darken and some disaster take place : -- the herb of gold be cut a cloud across the sky have spread its shroud to war on the other hand if properly gather with due ceremony it confer the power of understand the language of beast or bird -lrb- 2 -rrb- as far back as the time of pliny we have direction for the gathering of this magic plant the person pluck it be to go barefoot with foot wash clothe in white after have offer a sacrifice of bread and wine another plant which have to be gather with special formality be the magic mandragora it be commonly report to shriek in such a hideous manner when pull out of the earth that live mortal hear they run mad hence various precaution be adopt accord to pliny when they intend to take up the root of this plant they take the wind thereof and with a sword describe three circle about it they dig it up look towards the west another old authority inform we that he who would take it up in common prudence should tie a dog to it to accomplish he purpose as if he do it himself he would shortly die moore give this warning : -- the phantom shape -- oh touch they not that appal the maiden 's sight look in the fleshy mandrake 's stem that shriek when pluck at night to quote one or two more illustration we may mention the famous lily at lauenberg which be say to have spring up when a poor and beautiful girl be spirited away out of the clutch of a dissolute baron it make its appearance annually a event which be await with much interest by the inhabitant of the hartz many of whom make a pilgrimage to behold it they return to they home it be say overpower by its dazzling beauty and assert that its splendor be so great that it shed beam of light on the valley below similarly we be tell how the common break-fern flower but once a year at midnight on michaelma eve when it display a small blue flower which vanish at the approach of dawn accord to a piece of folk-lore current in bohemia and the tyrol the fern-seed shine like glitter gold at the season so that there be no chance of miss its appearance especially as it have its sundry mystic property which be describe elsewhere professor mannhardt relate a strange legend current in mecklenburg to the effect that in a certain secluded and barren spot where a murder have be commit there grow up every day at noon a peculiarly-shaped thistle unlike any other of its kind on inspection there be to be see human arm hand and head and as soon as twelve head have appear the weird plant vanish it be further add that on one occasion a shepherd happen to pass the mysterious spot where the thistle be grow when instantly he arm be paralyse and he staff become tinder account of these fabulous tree and plant have in year go be very numerous and have not yet wholly die out survive in the legendary tale of most country in some instance too it would seem that certain tree like animal have gain a notoriety purely fabulous through trickery and credulity about the middle of the last century for instance there be the groaning-tree at badesly which create considerable sensation it appear that a cottager who live in the village of badesly two mile from lymington frequently hear a strange noise behind he house like a person in extreme agony for about twenty month this tree be a object of astonishment and at last the owner of the tree in order to discover the cause of its suppose suffering bore a hole in the trunk after this operation it cease to groan it be root up but nothing appear to account for its strange peculiarity story of this kind remind we of similar wonder record by sir john maundeville as have be see by he in the course of he eastern travels thus he describe a certain table of ebony or blackwood that once use to turn into flesh on certain occasion but whence now drop only oil which if keep above a year become good flesh and bone footnote : 1 laing 's history of scotland 1800 ii p ii 2 flower-lore p 46 chapter xvi doctrine of signature the old medical theory which suppose that plant by they external character indicate the particular disease for which nature have intend they as remedy be simply a development of the much older notion of a real connection between object and image thus on this principle it be assert that the property of substance be frequently denote by they color hence white be regard as refrigerant and red as hot in the same way for disorder of the blood burnt purple pomegranate seed mulberry and other red ingredient be dissolve in the patient 's drink and for liver complaint yellow substance be recommend but this fanciful and erroneous notion lead to serious error in practice -lrb- 1 -rrb- and be occasionally productive of the most fatal result although indeed pliny speak of the folly of the magician in use the catanance -lrb- greek : katanhankae compulsion -rrb- for love-potion on account of its shrink in dry into the shape of the claw of a dead kite -lrb- 2 -rrb- and so hold the patient fast yet this primitive idea after the lapse of century be as fully credit as in the early day when it be originally start throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth century for instance it be notice in most medical work and in many case treat with a seriousness characteristic of the backward state of medical science even at a period so comparatively recent crollius write a work on the subject and langham in he garden of health publish in the year 1578 accept the doctrine cole in he art of simpling -lrb- 1656 -rrb- thus describe it : -- though sin and satan have plunge mankind into a ocean of infirmity yet the mercy of god which be over all he worke maketh grasse to growe upon the mountain and herbe for the use of man and have not only stamped upon they a distinct forme but also give they particular signature whereby a man may read even in legible character the use of they john ray in he treatise on the wisdom of god in creation be among the first to express he disbelief of this idea and write : -- as for the signature of plant or the note impress upon they as notice of they virtue some lay great stress upon they account they strong argument to prove that some understanding principle be the highest original of the work of nature as indeed they be could it be certainly make to appear that there be such mark designedly set upon they because all that i find mention by author seem to be rather fancy by man than design by nature to signify or point out any such virtue or quality as they would make we believe he view however be somewhat contradictory inasmuch as he go on to say that the noxious and malignant plant do many of they discover something of they nature by the sad and melancholick visage of they leaf flower or fruit and that i may not leave that head wholly untouched one observation i shall add relate to the virtue of plant in which i think there be something of truth -- that be that there be of the wise dispensation of providence such species of plant produce in every country as be make proper and convenient for the meat and medicine of the man and animal that be breed and inhabit therein indeed however much many of the botanist of bygone century might try to discredit this popular delusion they do not seem to have be wholly free from its influence themselves some estimate also of the prominence which the doctrine of signature obtain may be gather from the frequent allusion to it in the literature of the period thus to take one illustration the euphrasium or eye-bright -lrb- _ euphrasium officinali _ -rrb- which be and be suppose to be good for the eye owe to a black pupil-like spot in its corolla be notice by milton who it may be remembered represent the archangel as clear the vision of we first parent by its means : -- then purge with euphrasy and rue he visual orb for he have much to see spenser speak of it in the same strain : -- yet euphrasie may not be leave unsung that give dim eye to wander league around and thomson say : -- if she whom i implore uranium deign with euphrasy to purge away the mist which humid dim the mirror of the mind with reference to its use in modern time anne pratt -lrb- 3 -rrb- tell we how on go into a small shop in dover she see a quantity of the plant suspend from the ceiling and be inform that it be gather and dry as be good for weak eye and in many of we rural district i learn that the same value be still attach to it by the peasantry again it be interesting to observe how under a variety of form this piece of superstition have prevail in different part of the world by virtue of a similar association of idea for instance the gin-seng -lrb- 4 -rrb- be say by the chinese and north american indian to possess certain virtue which be deduce from the shape of the root suppose to resemble the human body -lrb- 5 -rrb- -- a plant with which may be compare we mandrake the roman of old have they rock-breaking plant call saxifraga or _ sassafras _ -lrb- 6 -rrb- and we know in later time how the granulated root of we white meadow saxifrage -lrb- _ saxifraga granula _ -rrb- resemble small stone be suppose to indicate its efficacy in the cure of calculous complaint hence one of its name stonebreak the stony seed of the gromwell be also use in case of stone -- a plant formerly know as lichwale or as in a m of the fifteenth century lythewale stone-switch -lrb- 7 -rrb- in accordance also with the same principle it be once generally believe that the seed of fern be of a invisible sort and hence by a transference of property it come to be admit that the possessor of fern-seed could likewise be invisible -- a notion which obtain a extensive currency on the continent as special good-luck be say to attend the individual who succeed in obtain this mystic seed it be eagerly seek for -- midsummer eve be one of the occasion when it could be most easily procure thus grimm in he teutonic mythology -lrb- 8 -rrb- relate how a man in westphalium be look on midsummer night for a foal he have lose and happen to pass through a meadow just as the fern-seed be ripen so that it fall into he shoe in the morning he go home walk into the sitting-room and sit down but think it strange that neither he wife nor any of the family take the least notice of he i have not find the foal say he thereupon everybody in the room start and look alarm for they hear he voice but see he not he wife then call he think he must have hide himself but he only reply why do you call I here i be right before you at last he become aware that he be invisible and remember how he have walk in the meadow on the precede evening it strike he that he might possibly have fern-seed in he shoe so he take they off and as he shake they the fern-seed drop out and he be no longer invisible there be numerous story of this kind and accord to dr kuhn one method for obtain the fern-seed be at the summer solstice to shoot at the sun when it have attain its midday height if this be do three drop of blood would fall which be to be gather up and preserve -- this be the fern-seed in bohemia -lrb- 9 -rrb- on old st john 's night -lrb- July 8 -rrb- one must lay a communion chalice-cloth under the fern and collect the seed which will fall before sunrise among some of the scatter allusion to this piece of folk-lore in the literature of we own country may be mention one by shakespeare in i henry iv -lrb- ii 1 -rrb- : -- _ gadshill _ we have the receipt of fern-seed we walk invisible -- -lrb- 10 -rrb- _ chamberlain _ nay by my faith i think you be more behold to the night than to fern-seed for you walk invisible in ben jonson 's new inn -lrb- i 1 -rrb- it be thus notice : -- i have no medicine sir to go invisible no fern-seed in my pocket brand -lrb- 11 -rrb- be tell by a inhabitant of heston in middlesex that when he be a young man he be often present at the ceremony of catch the fern-seed at midnight on the eve of st john baptist the attempt be frequently unsuccessful for the seed be to fall into a plate of its own accord and that too without shake the plate it be unnecessary to add further illustration on this point as we have have occasion to speak elsewhere of the sundry other magical property ascribe to the fern-seed whereby it have be prominently class amongst the mystic plant but apart from the doctrine of signature it would seem that the fern-seed be also suppose to derive its power of make invisible from the cloud say mr kelly -lrb- 12 -rrb- that contain the heavenly fire from which the plant be spring whilst speak too of the fern-seed 's property of make people invisible it be of interest to note that in the icelandic and pomeranian myth the schamir or raven-stone render its possessor invisible and accord to a north german tradition the luck-flower be enbue with the same wonderful quality it be essential however that the flower be find by accident for he who seek it never find it in sweden hazel-nut be repute to have the power of make invisible and from they reputed magical property have be from time immemorial in great demand for divination all those plant whose leave bear a fancied resemblance to the moon be in day of old regard with superstitious reverence the moon-daisy the type of a class of plant resemble the picture of a full moon be exhibit say dr prior in uterine complaint and dedicate in pagan time to the goddess of the moon the moonwort -lrb- _ botrychium lunarium _ -rrb- often confound with the common honesty -lrb- _ lunarium bienni _ -rrb- of we garden so call from the semi-lunar shape of the segment of its frond be credit with the most curious property the old alchemist affirm that it be good among other thing for convert quicksilver into pure silver and unshoeing such horse as trod upon it a similar virtue be ascribe to the horse-shoe vetch -lrb- _ hippocrepi comosa _ -rrb- so call from the shape of the legume hence another of its mystic nickname be unshoe the horse but refer to the doctrine of signature in folk-medicine a favorite garden flower be solomon 's seal -lrb- _ polygonatum multiflorum _ -rrb- on cut the root transversely some mark be apparent not unlike the character of a seal which to the old herbalist indicate its use as a seal for wound -lrb- 13 -rrb- gerarde describe it tell we how the root of solomon 's seal stamp while it be fresh and greene and apply taketh away in one night or two at the most any bruise black or blue spot get by fall or woman 's wilfulness in stumble upon they hasty husband ' fist for the same reason it be call by the french herbalist l'herbe de la rupture the specific name of the tutsan -lrb- 14 -rrb- -lrb- _ hypericum androsoemum _ -rrb- derive from the two greek word signify man and blood in reference to the dark red juice which exude from the capsule when bruise be once apply to external wound and hence it be call balm of the warrior 's wound or all-heal gerarde say the leaf lay upon broken skin and scab leg heal they and many other hurt and grief whereof it take its name ` toute-saine ' of healing all thing the pretty plant herb-robert -lrb- _ geranium robertianum _ -rrb- be suppose to possess similar virtue its power to arrest bleeding be indicate by the beautiful red hue assume by the fading leaf on account of which property it be style a stauncher of blood the garden jerusalem cowslip -lrb- _ pulmonarium offinali _ -rrb- owe its english name lungwort to the spot of the leaf which be say to indicate that they would be efficacious in healing disease of the lung then there be the water-soldier -lrb- _ stratiote aloide _ -rrb- which from its sword-shaped leaf be reckon among the appliance for gun-shot wound another familiar plant which have long have a reputation as a vulnerary be the self-heal or carpenter 's herb -lrb- _ prunellum vulgari _ -rrb- on account of its corolla be shape like a bill-hook again presumably on the doctrine of signature the connection between rose and blood be very curious thus in france germany and italy it be a popular notion that if one be desirous of have ruddy cheek he must bury a drop of he blood under a rose-bush -lrb- 15 -rrb- as a charm against hemorrhage of every kind the rose have long be a favorite remedy in germany and in westphalium the follow formulum be employ : abek wabek fabek in christ 's garden stand three red rose -- one for the good god the other for god 's blood the third for the angel gabriel : blood i pray you cease to flow another version of this charm be the follow -lrb- 16 -rrb- : -- on the head of we lord god there bloom three rose : the first be he virtue the second be he youth the third be he will blood stand thou in the wound still so that thou neither sore nor abscess givest turn to some of the numerous plant which on the doctrine of signature be formerly use as specifics from a fancied resemblance in the shape of the root leaf or fruit to any particular part of the human body we be confront with a list adapt for most of the ill to which the flesh be heir -lrb- 17 -rrb- thus the walnut be regard as clearly good for mental case from its bear the signature of the whole head the outward green cortex answering to the pericranium the harder shell within represent the skull and the kernel in its figure resemble the cover of the brain on this account the outside shell be consider good for wound of the head whilst the bark of the tree be regard as a sovereign remedy for the ringworm -lrb- 18 -rrb- its leaf too when bruise and moisten with vinegar be use for ear-ache for scrofulous gland the knotty tuber attach to the kernel-wort -lrb- _ scrophularium nodosa _ -rrb- have be consider efficacious the pith of the elder when press with the finger doth pit and receive the impress of they thereon as the leg and foot of dropsical person do therefore the juice of this tree be reckon a cure for dropsy we lady 's thistle -lrb- _ cardmi marianus _ -rrb- from its numerous prickle be recommend for stitch of the side and nettle-tea be still a common remedy with many of we peasantry for nettle-rash the leaf of the wood-sorrel -lrb- _ oxali acetosellum _ -rrb- be believe to preserve the heart from many disease from they be broad at the end cut in the middle and sharp towards the stalk similarly the heart-trefoil or clover -lrb- _ medicago macula _ -rrb- be so call because say cole in he art of simple not only be the leaf triangular like the heart of a man but also because each leaf contain the perfect image of a heart and that in its proper color -- a flesh color it defendeth the heart against the noisome vapor of the spleen another plant which on the same principle be reckon as a curative for heart-disease be the heart 's - ease a term mean a _ cordial _ as in sir walter scott 's antiquary -lrb- chap xi -rrb- try a dram to be eilding and claise and a supper and heart 's - ease into the bargain the knot-grass -lrb- _ polygonum aviculare _ -rrb- with its reddish-white flower and trail pointed stem be probably so call from some unrecorded character by the doctrine of signature suggest mr ellacombe -lrb- 19 -rrb- that it would stop the growth of

the wesell knoweth well the virtue of herb-grace the dive the verven the dogge dischargeth he mawe with a kind of grasse & c in italy cumin be give to pigeon for the purpose of tame they and a curious superstition be that of the divining-rod with its versatile sensibility to water ore treasure and thief and one whose history be apparently as remote as it be widespread franci lenormant in he chaldean magic mention the divining-rod use by the magus wherewith they foretell the future by throw little stick of tamarisk-wood and add that divination by wand be know and practice in babylon and that this be even the most ancient mode of divination use in the time of the accadian among the hindu even in the vedic period magic wand be in use and the practice still survive in china where the peach-tree be in demand trace its antecedent history in this country it appear that the druid be in the habit of cut they divining-rod from the apple-tree and various notice of this once popular fallacy occur from time to time in the literature of bygone year the hazel be formerly famous for its power of discernment and it be still hold in repute by the italian occasionally too as already notice the divining-rod be employ for the purpose of detect the locality of water as be still the case in wiltshire a interesting case be quote some year ago in the _ quarterly review _ -lrb- xxii 273 -rrb- a certain lady n -- be here state to have convince dr hutton of she possession of this remarkable gift and by means of it to have indicate to he the existence of a spring of water in one of he field adjoining the woolwich college which in consequence of the discovery he be enable to sell to the college at a higher price this power lady n -- repeatedly exhibit before credible witness and the _ quarterly review _ of that day consider the fact indisputable the divining-rod have long be in repute among cornish miner and pryce in he mineralogium cornubiensis say that many mine have be discover by this mean but after give a minute account of cut tie and use it he reject it because cornwall be so plentifully store with tin and copper lode that some accident every week discover to we a fresh vein billingsley in he agricultural survey of the county of cornwall publish in the year 1797 speak of the belief of the mendip miner in the efficacy of the mystic rod : -- the general method of discover the situation and direction of those seam of ore -lrb- which lie at various depths from five to twenty fathom in a chasm between two inch of solid rock -rrb- be by the help of the divining-rod vulgarly call _ jose _ and a variety of strong testimony be adduce in support this doctrine so confident be the common miner of the efficacy that they scarcely ever sink a shaft but by its direction and those who be dexterous in the use of it will mark on the surface the course and breadth of the vein and after that with the assistance of the rod will follow the same course twenty time follow blindfold anecdote of the kind be very numerous for there be few subject in folk-lore concern which more have be write than on the divining-rod one of the most exhaustive be that of mr baring-gould in he curious myth of the middle age the literature too of the past be rich in allusion to this piece of superstition and swift in he virtue of sid hamet the magician 's rod -lrb- 1710 -rrb- thus refer to it : -- they tell we something strange and odd about a certain magic rod that bend down its top divine whene'er the soil have golden mine where there be none it stand erect scorn to show the least respect as ready be the wand of sid to bend where golden mine be hide in scottish hill find precious ore where none e'er look for it before and by a gentle bow divine how well a cully 's purse be line to a forlorn and broken rake stand without motion like a stake de quincey have several amusing allusion to this fallacy affirm that he have actually see on more than one occasion the process apply with success and declare that in spite of all science or scepticism might say most of the tea-kettle in the vale of wrington north somersetshire be fill by rhabdomancy but it must be admit that the phenomenon of the divining-rod and table-turning be of precisely the same character both be referable to a involuntary muscular action result from a fixedness of idea moreover it should be remember that experiment with the divining-rod be generally make in a district know to be metalliferous and therefore the chance be greatly in favor of its bend over or near a mineral lode on the other hand it be surprising how many people of culture have at different time in this and other country display a lamentable weakness in partially accept this piece of superstition of the many anecdote related respect it we may quote a amusing one in connection with the celebrated botanist linnaeus : -- when he be on one of he voyage hear he secretary highly extol the virtue of he divining-wand he be willing to convince he of its insufficiency and for that purpose conceal a purse of one hundred ducat under a ranunculus which grow up by itself in a meadow and bid the secretary find it if he could the wand discover nothing and linnaeus ' mark be soon trample down by the company who be present so that when he go to finish the experiment by fetch the gold himself he be utterly at a loss where to find it the man with the wand assist he and inform he that it could not lie in the way they be go but quite the contrary so pursue the direction of the wand and actually dig out the gold linnaeus thereupon add that such another experiment would be sufficient to make a proselyte of he -lrb- 1 -rrb- in 1659 the jesuit gaspard schott tell we that this magic rod be at this period use in every town in germany and that he have frequently have opportunity of see it use in the discovery of hidden treasure he further add : -- i search with the greatest care into the question whether the hazel rod have any sympathy with gold and silver and whether any natural property set it in motion in like manner i try whether a ring of metal hold suspend by a thread in the midst of a tumbler and which strike the hour be move by any similar force but many of the mysterious effect of these so-called divining-rod be no doubt due to clever imposture in the year 1790 plunet a native of dauphiné claim a power over the divining-rod which attract considerable attention in italy but when carefully test by scientific man in padua he attempt to discover bury metal completely fail and at florence he be detect try to find out by night what he have secrete to test he power on the morrow the astrologer lilly make sundry experiment with the divining-rod but be not always successful and the jesuit kircher try the power of certain rod which be say to have sympathetic influence for particular metal but they never turn on the approach of these once more in the shepherd 's calendar we find a receipt to make the mosaic wand to find hidden treasure without the intervention of a human operator : -- cut a hazel wand fork at the upper end like a y peel off the rind and dry it in a moderate heat then steep it in the juice of wake-robin or nightshade and cut the single lower end sharp and where you suppose any rich mine or hide treasure be near place a piece of the same metal you conceive be hide or in the earth to the top of one of the fork by a hair and do the like to the other end pitch the sharp single end lightly to the ground at the go down of the sun the moon be in the increase and in the morning at sunrise by a natural sympathy you will find the metal incline as it be point to the place where the other be hide accord to a tuscany belief the almond will discover treasure and the golden rod have long have the reputation in england of point to hidden spring of water as well as to treasure of gold and silver similarly the spring-wort and primrose -- the key-flower -- reveal the hidden recess in mountain where treasure be conceal and the mystic fern-seed term wish-seed be suppose in the tyrol to make known hidden gold and accord to a lithuanian form of this superstition one who secure treasure by this means will be pursue by adder the guardian of the gold plant of this kind remind we of the magic sesame which at the command of alus baba in the story of the forty thief give he immediate admission to the secret treasure-cave once more among further plant possess the same mystic property may be mention the sow-thistle which when invoke disclose hidden treasure in sicily a branch of the pomegranate tree be consider to be a most effectual means of ascertain the whereabouts of conceal wealth hence it have be invest with a almost reverential awe and have be generally employ when search have be make for some valuable lose property in silesium thuringium and bohemia the mandrake be in addition to its many mystic property connect with the idea of hidden treasure numerous plant be say to be either lucky or the reverse and hence have give rise to all kind of odd belief some of which still survive in we midst have come down from a remote period there be in many place a curious antipathy to uproot the house-leek some person even dislike to let it blossom and a similar prejudice seem to have exist against the cuckoo-flower for if find accidentally invert in a may garland it be at once destroy in prussium it be regard as ominous for a bride to plant myrtle although in this country it have the reputation of be a lucky plant accord to a somersetshire say the flowering myrtle be the luckiest plant to have in you window water it every morning and be proud of it we may note here that there be many odd belief connect with the myrtle speak to a lady say a correspondent of the _ athenaeum _ -lrb- feb 5 1848 -rrb- of the difficulty which i have always find in get a slip of myrtle to grow she directly account for my failure by observe that perhaps i have not spread the tail or skirt of my dress and look proud during the time i be plant it it be a popular belief in somersetshire that unless a slip of myrtle be so plant it will never take root the deadly nightshade be a plant of ill omen and gerarde describe it say if you will follow my counsel deal not with the same in any case and banish it from you garden and the use of it also be a plant so furious and deadly for it bringeth such as have eat thereof into a dead sleep wherein many have die there be a strong prejudice to sowing parsley and equally a great dislike to transplant it the latter notion be find in south america likewise accord to a devonshire belief it be highly unlucky to plant a bed of lily of the valley as the person do so will probably die in the course of the next twelve month the withering of plant have long be regard ominous and accord to a welsh superstition if there be fade leaf in a room where a baby be christen it will soon die of the many omen afford by the oak we be tell that the change of its leaf from they usual color give more than once fatal premonition of come misfortune during the great civil war and bacon mention a tradition that if the oak-apple broken be full of worm it be a sign of a pestilent year in olden time the decay of the bay-tree be consider a omen of disaster and it be state that previous to the death of nero though the winter be very mild all these tree wither to the root and that a great pestilence in padua be precede by the same phenomenon -lrb- 2 -rrb- shakespeare speak of this superstition : -- ` tis think the king be dead we will not stay the bay-tree in we county be all withered lupton in he notable thing tell we that if a fir-tree be touch withered or burn with lightning it signify that the master or mistress thereof shall shortly die it be difficult as we have already note in a previous chapter to discover why some of we sweetest and fairest spring-flower should be associate with ill-luck in the western county for instance one should never take less than a handful of primrose or violet into a farmer 's house as neglect of this rule be say to affect the success of the duckling and chicken a correspondent of _ note and query _ -lrb- i ser vii 201 -rrb- write : -- my gravity be sorely try by be call on to settle a quarrel between two old woman arise from one of they have give one primrose to she neighbor 's child for the purpose of make she hen hatch but one egg out of each set of egg and it be seriously maintained that the charm have be successful in the same way it be hold unlucky to introduce the first snowdrop of the year into a house for as a sussex woman once remark it look for all the world like a corpse in its shroud we may repeat too again the familiar adage : -- if you sweep the house with blossom broom in may you be sure to sweep the head of the house away and there be the common superstition that where rose and violet bloom in autumn it be indicative of some epidemic in the following year whereas if a white rise put forth unexpectedly it be believe in germany to be a sign of death in the nearest house and in some part of essex there be a current belief that sickness or death will inevitably ensue if blossom of the whitethorn be bring into a house the idea in norfolk be that no one will be marry from the house during the year another ominous sign be that of plant shed they leaf or of they blossom fall to piece thus the peasantry in some place affirm that the drop of the leaf of a peach-tree betoken a murrain and in italy it be hold unlucky for a rose to do so a well-known illustration of this superstition occur many year ago in the case of the unfortunate miss bay who be murder at the piazza entrance of covent garden by hackman -lrb- April 1779 -rrb- the follow account of which we quote from the life and correspondence of m g lewi : -- when the carriage be announce and she be adjust she dress mr lewi happen to make some remark on a beautiful rose which miss kay wear in she bosom just as the word be utter the flower fall to the ground she immediately stoop to regain it but as she pick it up the red leaf

trust i be not to consider this as a evil omen ' but soon rally she express to mr lewi in a cheerful tone she hope that they would meet again after the theater -- a hope alas which it be decree should not be realize accord to a german belief one who throw a rose into a grave will waste away there be a notion prevalent in dorsetshire that a house wherein the plant bergamot be keep will never be free from sickness and in norfolk it be say to be unlucky to take into a house a bunch of the grass call maiden-hair or as it be also term dudder-grass among further plant of ill omen may be mention the

four-leaved clover a double-leaved ash and a green-topped leave you may go before the queen 's daughter without ask leave but on the other hand the finder of the five-leaved clover it be say will have bad luck in scotland -lrb- 3 -rrb- it be formerly customary to carry on the person a piece of torch-fir for good luck -- a superstition which mr conway remark be find in the gold-mine of californium

they should become tainted -lrb- 4 -rrb- further superstition have be incidentally allude to throughout the present volume necessarily associate as they be with most section of plant folk-lore it should also be notice that in the various folk-tale which have be collect together in recent year many curious plant superstition be introduce although to suit the surroundings of the story they have only too frequently be modify or the reverse at the same time embellishment of the kind be interesting as show how familiar these traditionary belief be in olden time to the story-teller and how ready he be to avail himself of they footnote : 1 see baring-gerald 's curious myth of the middle age 2 ingram 's florica symbolica p 326 3 stewart 's popular superstition of the highlander 4 see ellacombe 's plant-lore of shakespeare p 319 chapter xxi plant in folk-medicine from the earliest time plant have be most extensively use in the cure of disease although in day of old it be not so much they inherent medicinal property which bring they into repute as they suppose magical virtue oftentimes in truth the only merit of a plant lay in the charm formulum attach to it the due utterance of which ensured relief to the patient originally there can be no doubt that such verbal form be prayer since dwindle into mystic sentence -lrb- 1 -rrb- again before a plant could work its healing power due regard have to be pay to the planet under whose influence it be suppose to be -lrb- 2 -rrb- for aubrey mention a old belief that if a plant be not gather accord to the rule of astrology it have little or no virtue in it hence in accordance with this notion we find numerous direction for the cutting and prepare of certain plant for medicinal purpose a curious list of which occur in culpepper 's british herbal and family physician this old herbalist who be a strong believer in astrology tell we that such as be of this way of thinking and none else be fit to be physician but he be not the only one who have strict view on this matter as the literature of he day prove -- astrology too have hold a prominent place in most of the gardening book of the same period michael drayton who have chronicle so many of the credulity of he time refer to the longevity of antediluvian man write : -- besides in medicine simple have the power that none need then the planetary hour to help they workinge they so juiceful be the adder 's - tongue if pluck during the wane of the moon be a cure for tumor and there be a swabian belief that one who on Friday of the full moon pull up the amaranth by the root and folding it in a white cloth wear it against he naked breast will be make bullet-proof -lrb- 3 -rrb- consumptive patient in olden time be three time pass through a circular wreath of woodbine cut during the increase of the march moon and let down over the body from head to foot -lrb- 4 -rrb- in france too at the present day the vervain be gather under the different change of the moon with secret incantation after which it be say to possess remarkable curative property in cornwall the club-moss if properly gather be consider good against all disease of the eye the mode of procedure be this : -- on the third day of the moon when the thin crescent be see for the first time show it the knife with which the moss be to be cut and repeat this formulum : -- ` as christ heal the issue of blood do thou cut what thou cuttest for good ' at sundown the operator after carefully wash he hand be to cut the club-moss kneel it be then to be wrap in a white cloth and subsequently boil in water take from the spring nearest to its place of growth this may be use as a fomentation or the club-moss may be make into a ointment with the butter from the milk of a new cow -lrb- 5 -rrb- some plant have from time immemorial be much in request from the season or period of they bloom beyond which fact it be difficult to account for the virtue ascribe to they thus among the roman the first anemone of the year when gather with this form of incantation i gather thee for a remedy against disease be regard as a preservative from fever a survival of which belief still prevail in we own country : -- the first spring-blown anemone she in he doublet wove to keep he safe from pestilence wherever he should reeve on the other hand in some country there be a very strong prejudice against the wild anemone the air being say to be so taint by they that they who inhale it often incur severe sickness -lrb- 6 -rrb- similarly we may compare the notion that flower bloom out of season have a fatal significance as we have note elsewhere the sacred association attach to many plant have invest they at all time with a scientific repute in the healing art instance of which may be trace up to a very early period thus the peony which from its mythical divine origin be a important flower in the primitive pharmacopoeia have even in modern time retain its reputation and to this day sussex mother put necklace of bead turn from the peony root around they child 's neck to prevent convulsion and to assist they in they teething when wear on the person it be long consider too a most effectual remedy for insanity and culpepper speak of its virtue in the cure of the fall sickness -lrb- 7 -rrb- the thistle sacred to thor be another plant of this kind and indeed instance be very numerous on the other hand some plant from they great virtue as all-heal it would seem have such name as angelica and archangel bestow on they -lrb- 8 -rrb- in later time many plant become connect with the name of christ and with the event of the crucifixion itself -- fact which occasionally explain they mysterious virtue thus the vervain know as the holy herb and which be one of the sacred plant of the druid have long be hold in repute the subjoin rhyme assign as the reason : -- all hail thou holy herb vervin grow on the ground on the mount of calvary there be thou find thou helpest many a grief and staunchest many a wound in the name of sweet jesu i lift thee from the ground to quote one or two further instance a popular recipe for prevent the prick of a thorn from fester be to repeat this formulum : -- christ be of a virgin bear and he be prick with a thorn and it do neither bell nor swell and i trust in jesus this never will in cornwall some year ago the follow charm be much used form of which may occasionally be hear at the present day : -- happy man that christ be bear he be crown with a thorn he be pierce through the skin for to let the poison in but he five wound so they say close before he pass away in with healing out with thorn happy man that christ be bear another version use in the north of england be this : -- unto the virgin mary we savior be horn and on he head he wear a crown of thorn if you believe this true and mind it well this hurt will never fester nor swell the _ angelica sylvestri _ be popularly know as holy ghost from the angel-like property therein have be consider good against poison pestilent ague or the pestilence cockayne in he saxon leechdom mention a old poem descriptive of the virtue of the mugwort : -- thou hast might for three and against thirty for venom availest for ply vile thing so too certain plant of the saint acquire a notoriety for specific virtue and hence st john 's wort with its leaf mark with blood-like spot which appear accord to tradition on the anniversary of he decollation be still the wonderful herb that cure all sort of wound herb-bennet popularly designate star of the earth a name apply to the avens hemlock and valerian should properly be say dr prior st benedict 's herb a name assign to such plant as be suppose to be antidote in allusion to a legend of this saint which represent that upon he blessing a cup of poison wine which a monk have give to destroy he the glass be shiver to piece in the same way herb-gerard be call from st gerard who be formerly invoke against gout a complaint for which this plant be once in high repute st jame 's wort be so call from its be use for the disease of horse of which this great pilgrim-saint be the patron it be curious in how many unexpected way these odd item of folk-lore in they association with the saint meet we show that in numerous instance it be entirely they association with certain saint that have make they of medical repute some tree and plant have gain a medical notoriety from the fact of they have a mystical history and from the supernatural quality ascribe to they but as bulwer-lytton have suggest in he strange story the wood of certain tree to which magical property be ascribe may in truth possess virtue little understood and deserving of careful investigation thus among these the rowan would take its place as would the
