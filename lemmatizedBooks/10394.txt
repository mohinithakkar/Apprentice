that gentleman 's sugar wharf a tall broad-shouldered strapping fellow with red cheek and thick red lip and roll blue eye and hair as red as any chestnut many know he for a bold gruff-spoken man but no one at that time suspect that he have it in he to become so famous and renowned as he afterwards grow to be the fame of he exploit have be the talk of those part for above a twelvemonth when in the

have not be make up before to be sure such a spectacle of glory would have determine it this figure of war we hero ask to step aside with he and when they have come into a corner propose to the other

the back swear roundly that he would make a man of he and that it be a pity to make a parson out of so good a piece of stuff -lrb- illustration : this figure of war we hero ask to step aside with he -rrb- nor be captain morgan less good than he word for when the _ good samaritan _ set sail with a favor wind for the island of jamaica master harry find himself establish as one of the adventurer aboard ii could you but have see the town of port royal as it appear in the year 1665 you would have behold a sight very well worth while look upon there be no fine house at that time and no great counting-house build of brick such as you may find nowadays but a crowd of board and wattled hut huddle along the street and all so gay with flag and bit of color that vanity fair itself could not have be gayer to this place come all the pirate and buccaneer that infested those part and man shout and swear and gamble and pour out money like water and then maybe wind up they merrymaking by die of fever for the sky in these torrid latitudes be all full of cloud overhead and as hot as any blanket and when the sun shine forth it stream down upon the smoking sand so that the house be oven and the street be furnace so it be little wonder that man die like rat in a hole but little they appear to care for that so that everywhere you might behold a multitude of paint woman and jew and merchant and pirate gaudy with red scarf and gold braid and all sort of odds and end of foolish finery all fight and gamble and bartering for that ill-gotten treasure of the be-robbed spaniard here arrive captain morgan find a hearty welcome and a message from the governor await he the message bidding he attend he excellency upon the earliest occasion that offer whereupon take we hero -lrb- of whom he have grow prodigiously fond -rrb- along with he we pirate go without any loss of time to visit sir thoma modiford who be then the royal governor of all this devil 's brew of wickedness they find he excellency seat in a great easy-chair under the shadow of a slatted veranda the floor whereof be pave with brick he be clothe for the sake of coolness only in he shirt breeches and stocking and he wear slipper on he foot he be smoke a great cigarro of tobacco and a goblet of lime-juice and water and rum stand at he elbow on a table here out of the glare of the heat it be all very cool and pleasant with a sea-breeze blowing violently in through the slat set they a-rattle now and then and stir sir thoma 's long hair which he have push back for the sake of coolness the purport of this interview i may tell you concern the rescue of one le sieur simon who together with he wife and daughter be hold captive by the spaniard this gentleman adventurer -lrb- le sieur simon -rrb- have a few year before be set up by the buccaneer as governor of the island of santa catherina this place though well fortify by the spaniard the buccaneer have seize upon establish themselves thereon and so infest the commerce of those sea that no spanish fleet be safe from they at last the spaniard no longer able to endure these assault against they commerce send a great force against the freebooter to drive they out of they island stronghold this they do retake santa catherina together with its governor he wife and daughter as well as the whole garrison of buccaneer this garrison be send by they conqueror some to the galley some to the mine some to no man know where the governor himself -- le sieur simon -- be to be send to spain there to stand he trial for piracy the news of all this i may tell you have only just be receive in jamaica have be bring thither by a spanish captain one don roderiguez sylvium who be besides the bearer of despatch to the spanish authority relate the whole affair such in fine be the purport of this interview and as we hero and he captain walk back together from the governor 's house to the ordinary where they have take up they inn the buccaneer assure he companion that he purpose to obtain those despatch from the spanish captain that very afternoon even if he have to use force to seize they all this you be to understand be undertake only because of the friendship that the governor and captain morgan entertain for le sieur simon and indeed it be wonderful how honest and how faithful be these wicked man in they dealings with one another for you must know that governor modiford and le sieur simon and the buccaneer be all of one kidney -- all take a share in the piracy of those time and all hold by one another as though they be the honestest man in the world hence it be they be all so determine to rescue le sieur simon from the spaniard iii have reach he ordinary after he interview with the governor captain morgan find there a number of he companion such as usually gather at that place to be in attendance upon he -- some those belong to the _ good samaritan _ other those who hope to obtain benefit from he other those ragamuffin who gather around he because he be famous and because it please they to be of he court and to be call he follower for nearly always you successful pirate have such a little court surround he find a dozen or more of these rascal gather there captain morgan inform they of he present purpose -- that he be go to find the spanish captain to demand he papers of he and call upon they to accompany he with this follow at he heel we buccaneer start off down the street he lieutenant a cornishman name bartholomew davi upon one hand and we hero upon the other so they parade the street for the best part of a hour before they find the spanish captain for whether he have get wind that captain morgan be search for he or whether find himself in a place so full of he enemy he have bury himself in some place of hide it be certain that the buccaneer have traverse pretty nearly the whole town before they discover that he be lie at a certain auberge keep by a portuguese jew thither they go and thither captain morgan enter with the utmost coolness and composure of demeanor he follower crowd noisily in at he heel the space within be very dark be light only by the doorway and by two large slatted window or opening in the front in this dark hot place -- not over-roomy at the best -- be gather twelve or fifteen villanous-appearing man sit at table and drinking together wait upon by the jew and he wife we hero have no trouble in discover which of this lot of man be captain sylvium for not only do captain morgan direct he glance full of war upon he but the spaniard be clothe with more particularity and with more show of finery than any of the other who be there he captain morgan approach and demand he papers whereunto the other reply with such a jabber of spanish and english that no man could have understand what he say to this captain morgan in turn reply that he must have those papers no matter what it might cost he to obtain they and thereupon draw a pistol from he sling and present it at the other 's head at this threatening action the innkeeper 's wife fall a-screaming and the jew as in a frenzy beseech they not to tear the house down about he ear we hero could hardly tell what follow only that all of a sudden there be a prodigious uproar of combat knife flash everywhere and then a pistol be fire so close to he head that he stand like one stunned hear some one cry out in a loud voice but not know whether it be a friend or a foe who have be shoot then another pistol-shot so deafen what be leave of master harry 's hearing that he ear ring for above a hour afterwards by this time the whole place be full of gunpowder smoke and there be the sound of blow and oath and outcrying and the clashing of knife as master harry who have no great stomach for such a combat and no very particular interest in the quarrel be make for the door a little portuguese as withered and as nimble as a ape come duck under the table and plunge at he stomach with a great long knife which have it effect its object would surely have end he adventure then and there find himself in such danger master harry snatch up a heavy chair and fling it at he enemy who be prepare for another attack he fairly run for it out of the door expect every instant to feel the thrust of the blade betwixt he rib a considerable crowd have gather outside and other hear the uproar be come run to join they with these we hero stand tremble like a leaf and with cold chill run up and down he back like water at the narrow escape from the danger that have threaten he nor shall you think he a coward for you must remember he be hardly sixteen year old at the time and that this be the first affair of the sort he have encounter afterwards as you shall learn he show that he could exhibit courage enough at a pinch while he stand there endeavor to recover he composure the while the tumult continue within suddenly two man come run almost together out of the door a crowd of the combatant at they heel the first of these man be captain sylvium the other who be pursue he be captain morgan as the crowd about the door part before the sudden appear of these the spanish captain perceive as he suppose a way of escape open to he dart across the street with incredible swiftness towards a alleyway upon the other side upon this see he prey like to get away from he captain morgan snatch a pistol out of he sling and rest it for a instant across he arm fire at the fly spaniard and that with so true a aim that though the street be now full of people the other go tumble over and over all of a heap in the kennel where he lay after a twitch or two as still as a log at the sound of the shot and the fall of the man the crowd scatter upon all side yell and scream and the street be thus pretty clear captain morgan run across the way to where he victim lay he smoking pistol still in he hand and we hero follow close at he heel we poor harry have never before behold a man kill thus in a instant who a moment before have be so full of life and activity for when captain morgan turn the body over upon its back he could perceive at a glance little as he know of such matter that the man be stone dead and indeed it be a dreadful sight for he who be hardly more than a child he stand root for he know not how long stare down at the dead face with twitch finger and shudder limb meantime a great crowd be gather about they again as for captain morgan he go about he work with the utmost coolness and deliberation imaginable unbutton the waistcoat and the shirt of the man he have murder with finger that neither twitch nor shake there be a gold cross and a bunch of silver medal hang by a whip-cord about the neck of the dead man this captain morgan break away with a snap reach the jingle bauble to harry who take they in he nerveless hand and finger that he could hardly close upon what they hold the papers captain morgan find in a wallet in a inner breast-pocket of the spaniard 's waistcoat these he examine one by one and find they to he satisfaction tie they up again and slip the wallet and its contents into he own pocket then for the first time he appear to observe master harry who indeed must have be stand the perfect picture of horror and dismay whereupon burst out a-laughing and slip the pistol he have use back into its sling again he fetch poor harry a great slap upon the back bidding he be a man for that he would see many such sight as this but indeed it be no laughing matter for poor master harry for it be many a day before he imagination could rid itself of the image of the dead spaniard 's face and as he walk away down the street with he companion leave the crowd behind they and the dead body where it lay for its friend to look after he ear hum and ring from the deafening noise of the pistol-shot fire in the close room and the sweat trickle down he face in drop he know not whether all that have pass have be real or whether it be a dream from which he might presently awaken iv the papers captain morgan have thus seize upon as the fruit of the murder he have commit must have be as perfectly satisfactory to he as could be for have pay a second visit that evening to governor modiford the pirate lift anchor the next morning and make sail towards the gulf of darien there after cruise about in those water for about a fortnight without fall in with a vessel of any sort at the end of that time they overhaul a caravel bind from puerto bello to cartagena which vessel they take and find she load with nothing better than raw hide scuttle and sink she be then about twenty league from the main of cartagena from the captain of this vessel they learn that the plate fleet be then lie in the harbor of puerto bello not yet have set sail thence but wait for the change of the wind before embark for spain besides this which be a good deal more to they purpose the spaniard tell the pirate that the sieur simon he wife and daughter be confine aboard the vice-admiral of that fleet and that the name of the vice-admiral be the _ santa marium y valladolid _ so soon as captain morgan have obtain the information he desire he direct he course straight for the bay of santo blaso where he might lie safely within the cape of that name without any danger of discovery -lrb- that part of the main-land be entirely uninhabited -rrb- and yet be within twenty or twenty-five league of puerto bello have come safely to this anchorage he at once declare he intention to he companion which be as follow : that it be entirely impossible for they to hope to sail they vessel into the harbor of puerto bello and to attack the spanish vice-admiral where he lay in the midst of the armed flota wherefore if anything be to be accomplish it must be undertake by some subtle design rather than by open-handed boldness have so prefaced what he have to say he now declare that it be he purpose to take one of the ship 's boat and to go in that to puerto bello trust for some opportunity to occur to aid he either in the accomplishment of he aim or in the gain of some further information have thus deliver himself he invite any who dare to do so to volunteer for the expedition tell they plainly that he would constrain no man to go against he will for that at best it be a desperate enterprise possess only the recommendation that in its achievement the few who undertake it would gain great renown and perhaps a very considerable booty and such be the incredible influence of this bold man over he companion and such be they confidence in he skill and cunning that not above a dozen of all those aboard hung back from the undertaking but nearly every man desire to be take of these volunteer captain morgan choose twenty -- among other we master harry -- and have arrange with he lieutenant that if nothing be hear from the expedition at the end of three day he should sail for jamaica to await news he embark upon that enterprise which though never heretofore publish be perhaps the boldest and the most desperate of all those that have since make he name so famous for what could be a more unparalleled undertaking than for a little open boat contain but twenty man to enter the harbor of the third strongest fortress of the spanish mainland with the intention of cut out the spanish vice-admiral from the midst of a whole fleet of powerfully arm vessel and how many man in all the world do you suppose would venture such a thing but there be this to be say of that great buccaneer : that if he undertake enterprise so desperate as this he yet lay he plan so well that they never go altogether amiss moreover the very desperation of he success be of such a nature that no man could suspect that he would dare to undertake such thing and accordingly he enemy be never prepare to guard against he attack aye have he but wear the king 's color and serve under the rule of honest war he might have become as great and as renowned as admiral blake himself but all that be neither here nor there what i have to tell you now be that captain morgan in this open boat with he twenty mate reach the cape of salmedina towards the fall of day arrive within view of the harbor they discover the plate fleet at anchor with two men-of-war and a armed galley ride as a guard at the mouth of the harbor scarce half a league distant from the other ship have spy the fleet in this posture the pirate presently pull down they sail and row along the coast feign to be a spanish vessel from nombre de dios so hug the shore they come boldly within the harbor upon the opposite side of which you might see the fortress a considerable distance away be now come so near to the consummation of they adventure captain morgan require every man to make a oath to stand by he to the last whereunto we hero swear as heartily as any man aboard although he heart i must need confess be beat at a great rate at the approach of what be to happen have thus receive the oath of all he follower captain morgan command the surgeon of the expedition that when the order be give he the medico be to bear six hole in the boat so that it sink under they they might all be compel to push forward with no chance of retreat and such be the ascendency of this man over he follower and such be they awe of he that not one of they utter even so much as a murmur though what he have command the surgeon to do pledge they either to victory or to death with no chance to choose between nor do the surgeon question the order he have receive much less do he dream of disobey they by now it have fall pretty dusk whereupon spy two fisherman in a canoe at a little distance captain morgan demand of they in spanish which vessel of those at anchor in the harbor be the vice-admiral for that he have despatch for the captain thereof whereupon the fisherman suspect nothing point to they a galleon of great size ride at anchor not half a league distant towards this vessel accordingly the pirate direct they course and when they have come pretty nigh captain morgan call upon the surgeon that now it be time for he to perform the duty that have be lay upon he whereupon the other do as he be order and that so thoroughly that the water presently come gush into the boat in great stream whereat all hand pull for the galleon as though every next moment be to be they last and what do you suppose be we hero 's emotion at this time like all in the boat he awe of captain morgan be so great that i do believe he would rather have go to the bottom than have question he command even when it be to scuttle the boat nevertheless when he feel the cold water gush about he foot -lrb- for he have take off he shoe and stocking -rrb- he become possess with such a fear of be drown that even the spanish galleon have no terror for he if he could only feel the solid plank thereof beneath he foot indeed all the crew appear to be possess of a like dismay for they pull at the oar with such a incredible force that they be under the quarter of the galleon before the boat be half fill with water here as they approach it then be pretty dark and the moon not yet have rise the watch upon the deck hail they whereupon captain morgan call out in spanish that he be captain alvarez mendazo and that he bring despatch for the vice-admiral but at that moment the boat be now so full of water as to be log it suddenly tilted upon one side as though to sink beneath they whereupon all hand without further order go scramble up the side as nimble as so many monkey each arm with a pistol in one hand and a cutlass in the other and so be upon deck before the watch could collect he wit to utter any outcry or to give any other alarm than to cry out jesu bless we who be these at which word somebody knock he down with the butt of a pistol though who it be we hero could not tell in the darkness and the hurry before any of those upon deck could recover from they alarm or those from below come up upon deck a part of the pirate under the carpenter and the surgeon have run to the gunroom and have take possession of the arm while captain morgan with master harry and a portuguese call murillo braziliano have fly with the speed of the wind into the great cabin here they find the captain of the vice-admiral playing at card with the sieur simon and a friend madam simon and she daughter be present captain morgan instantly set he pistol at the breast of the spanish captain swearing with a most horrible fierce countenance that if he speak a word or make any outcry he be a dead man as for we hero have now get he hand into the game he perform the same service for the spaniard 's friend declare he would shoot he dead if he open he lip or lift so much as a single finger all this while the lady not comprehend what have occur have sit as mute as stone but now have so far recover themselves as to find a voice the younger of the two fall to scream at which the sieur simon call out to she to be still for these be friend who have come to help they and not enemy who have come to harm they all this you be to understand occupy only a little while for in less than a minute three or four of the pirate have come into the cabin who together with the portuguese proceed at once to bind the two spaniard hand and foot and to gag they this be do to we buccaneer 's satisfaction and the spanish captain be stretch out in the corner of the cabin he instantly clear he countenance of its terror and burst forth into a great loud laugh clap he hand to the sieur simon 's which he wring with the best will in the world have do this and be in a fine humor after this he first success he turn to the two lady and this lady say he take we hero by the hand and present he be a young gentleman who have embark with I to learn the trade of piracy i recommend he to you politeness think what a confusion this throw we master harry into to be sure who at he best be never easy in the company of strange lady you may suppose what must have be he emotion to find himself thus introduce to the attention of madam simon and she daughter be at the time in he bare foot clothe only in he shirt and breeches and with no hat upon he head a pistol in one hand and a cutlass in the other however he be not leave for long to he embarrassment for almost immediately after he have thus far relax captain morgan fall of a sudden serious again and bid the sieur simon to get he lady away into some place of safety for the most hazardous part of this adventure be yet to occur he quit the cabin with master harry and the other pirate -lrb- for you may call he a pirate now -rrb- at he heel have come upon deck we hero behold that a part of the spanish crew be huddle forward in a flock like so many sheep -lrb- the other be crowd below with the hatch fasten upon they -rrb- and such be the terror of the pirate and so dreadful the name of henry morgan that not one of those poor wretch dare to lift up he voice to give any alarm nor even to attempt a escape by jump overboard at captain morgan 's order these man together with certain of he own company run nimbly aloft and begin set the sail which the night now have fall pretty thick be not for a good while observe by any of the vessel ride at anchor about they indeed the pirate might have make good they escape with at most only a shot or two from the man-of-war have it not then be about the full of the moon which have arise presently discover to those of the fleet that lay closest about they what be be do aboard the vice-admiral at this one of the vessel hail they and then after a while have no reply hail they again even then the spaniard might not immediately have suspect anything be amiss but only that the vice-admiral for some reason best know to himself be shift he anchorage have not one of the spaniard aloft -- but who it be captain morgan be never able to discover -- answer the hail by cry out that the vice-admiral have be seize by the pirate at this the alarm be instantly give and the mischief do for presently there be a tremendous bustle through that part of the fleet lie nighest the vice-admiral -- a deal of shouting of order a beating of drum and the run hither and thither of the crew but by this time the sail of the vice-admiral have fill with a strong land breeze that be blow up the harbor whereupon the carpenter at captain morgan 's order have cut away both anchor the galleon presently bear away up the harbor gathering headway every moment with the wind nearly dead astern the nearest vessel be the only one that for the moment be able to offer any hinderance this ship have by this time clear away one of its gun be able to fire a parting shoot against the vice-admiral striking she somewhere forward as we hero could see by a great shower of splinter that fly up in the moonlight at the sound of the shot all the vessel of the flota not yet disturb by the alarm be arouse at once so that the pirate have the satisfaction of know that they would have to run the gantlet of all the ship between they and the open sea before they could reckon themselves escape and indeed to we hero 's mind it seem that the battle which follow must have be the most terrific cannonade that be ever hear in the world it be not so ill at first for it be some while before the spaniard could get they gun clear for action they be not the least in the world prepare for such a occasion as this but by-and-by first one and then another ship open fire upon the galleon until it seem to we hero that all the thunder of heaven let loose upon they could not have create a more prodigious uproar and that it be not possible that they could any of they escape destruction by now the moon have rise full and round so that the cloud of smoke that rise in the air appear as white as snow the air seem full of the hiss and scream of shot each one of which when it strike the galleon be magnify by we hero 's imagination into ten time its magnitude from the crash which it deliver and from the cloud of splinter it would cast up into the moonlight at last he suddenly behold one poor man knock sprawl across the deck who as he raise he arm from behind the mast disclose that the hand be go from it and that the shirt-sleeve be red with blood in the moonlight at this sight all the strength fall away from poor harry and he feel sure that a like fate or even a worse must be in store for he but after all this be nothing to what it might have be in broad daylight for what with the darkness of night and the little preparation the spaniard could make for such a business and the extreme haste with which they discharge they gun -lrb- many not understand what be the occasion of all this uproar -rrb- nearly all the shot fly so wide of the mark that not above one in twenty strike that at which it be aim meantime captain morgan with the sieur simon who have follow he upon deck stand just above where we hero lay behind the shelter of the bulwark the captain have light a pipe of tobacco and he stand now in the bright moonlight close to the rail with he hand behind he look out ahead with the utmost coolness imaginable and pay no more attention to the din of battle than though it be twenty league away now and then he would take he pipe from he lip to utter a order to the man at the wheel except this he stand there hardly move at all the wind blow he long red hair over he shoulder have it not be for the armed galley the pirate might have get the galleon away with no great harm do in spite of all this cannonade for the man-of-war which ride at anchor nighest to they at the mouth of the harbor be still so far away that they might have pass it by hug pretty close to the shore and that without any great harm be do to they in the darkness but just at this moment when the open water lay in sight come this galley pull out from behind the point of the shore in such a manner as either to head we pirate off entirely or else to compel they to approach so near to the man-of-war that that latter vessel could bring its gun to bear with more effect this galley i must tell you be like other of its kind such as you may find in these water the hull be long and cut low to the water so as to allow the oar to dip freely the bow be sharp and project far out ahead mount a swivel upon it while at the stern a number of gallery build one above another into a castle give shelter to several company of musketeer as well as the officer command they we hero could behold the approach of this galley from above the starboard bulwark and it appear to he impossible for they to hope to escape either it or the man-of-war but still captain morgan maintain the same composure that he have exhibit all the while only now and then deliver a order to the man at the wheel who put the helm over throw the bow of the galleon around more to the larboard as though to escape the bow of the galley and get into the open water beyond this course bring the pirate ever closer and closer to the man-of-war which now begin to add its thunder to the din of the battle and with so much more effect that at every discharge you might hear the crash and crackle of splintered wood and now and then the outcry or groaning of some man who be hurt indeed have it be daylight they must at this juncture all have perish though as be say what with the night and the confusion and the hurry they escape entire destruction though more by a miracle than through any policy upon they own part meantime the galley steering as though to come aboard of they have now come so near that it too presently begin to open its musketry fire upon they so that the hum and rattle of bullet be presently add to the din of cannonading in two minute more it would have be aboard of they when in a moment captain morgan roar out of a sudden to the man at the helm to put it hard a starboard in response the man run the wheel over with the utmost quickness and the galleon obey she helm very readily come around upon a course which if continue would certainly bring they into collision with they enemy it be possible at first the spaniard imagine the pirate intend to escape past they stern for they instantly begin back oar to keep they from get past so that the water be all of a foam about they at the same time they do this they pour in such a fire of musketry that it be a miracle that no more execution be accomplish than happen as for we hero methink for the moment he forget all about everything else than as to whether or no he captain 's maneuver would succeed for in the very first moment he divine as by some instinct what captain morgan purpose do at this moment so particular in the execution of this nice design a bullet suddenly strike down the man at the wheel hear the sharp outcry we harry turn to see he fall forward and then to he hand and knee upon the deck the blood running in a black pool beneath he while the wheel escape from he hand spin over until the spoke be all of a mist in a moment the ship would have fall off before the wind have not we hero leap to the wheel -lrb- even as captain morgan shout a order for some one to do so -rrb- seize the fly spoke whirling they back again and so bring the bow of the galleon up to its former course -lrb- illustration : we hero leap to the wheel seize the fly spoke -rrb- in the first moment of this effort he have reckon of nothing but of carry out he captain 's design he neither thought of cannon-ball nor of bullet but now that he task be accomplish he come suddenly back to himself to find the gallery of the galleon aflame with musket-shot and to become aware with a most horrible sinking of the spirit that all the shot therefrom be intend for he he cast he eye about he with despair but no one come to ease he of he task which have undertake he have too much spirit to resign from carry through to the end though he be well aware that the very next instant might mean he sudden and violent death he ear hum and ring and he brain swim as light as a feather i know not whether he breathe but he shut he eye tight as though that might save he from the bullet that be rain about he at this moment the spaniard must have discover for the first time the pirate ' design for of a sudden they cease firing and begin to shout out a multitude of order while the oar lash the water all about with a foam but it be too late then for they to escape for within a couple of seconds the galleon strike she enemy a blow so violent upon the larboard quarter as nearly to hurl we harry upon the deck and then with a dreadful horrible crackling of wood commingle with a yell of man 's voice the galley be swing around upon she side and the galleon sailing into the open sea leave nothing of she immediate enemy but a sink wreck and the water dot all over with bob head and wave hand in the moonlight and now indeed that all danger be past and go there be plenty to come run to help we hero at the wheel as for captain morgan have come down upon the main-deck he fetch the young helmsman a clap upon the back well master harry say he and do i not tell you i would make a man of you whereat we poor harry fall a-laughing but with a sad catch in he voice for he hand tremble as with a ague and be as cold as ice as for he emotion god know he be nearer cry than laugh if captain morgan have but know it nevertheless though undertake under the spur of the moment i protest it be indeed a brave deed and i can not but wonder how many young gentleman of sixteen there be to-day who upon a like occasion would act as well as we harry v the balance of we hero 's adventure be of a lighter sort than those already recount for the next morning the spanish captain -lrb- a very polite and well-bred gentleman -rrb- have fit he out with a suit of he own clothes master harry be present in a proper form to the lady for captain morgan if he have feel a liking for the young man before could not now show sufficient regard for he he eat in the great cabin and be pet by all madam simon who be a fat and red-faced lady be forever praise he and the young miss who be extremely well-looking be as continually make eye at he she and master harry i must tell you would spend hour together she make pretence of teach he french although he be so possess with a passion of love that he be nigh suffocate with it she upon she part perceive he emotion respond with extreme good-nature and complacency so that have we hero be older and the voyage prove longer he might have become entirely enmesh in the toil of he fair siren for all this while you be to understand the pirate be make sail straight for jamaica which they reach upon the third day in perfect safety -lrb- illustration : she and master harry would spend hour together -rrb- in that time however the pirate have well-nigh go crazy for joy for when they come to examine they purchase they discover she cargo to consist of plate to the prodigious sum of # 130000 in value 'twa a wonder they do not all make themselves drunk for joy no doubt they would have do so have not captain morgan know they be still in the exact track of the spanish fleet threaten they that the first man among they who touch a drop of rum without he permission he would shoot he dead upon the deck this threat have such effect that they all remain entirely sober until they have reach port royal harbor which they do about nine o'clock in the morning and now it be that we hero 's romance come all tumble down about he ear with a run for they have hardly come to anchor in the harbor when a boat come from a man-of-war and who should come step aboard but lieutenant grantley -lrb- a particular friend of we hero 's father -rrb- and he own eldest brother thoma who put on a very stern face informed master harry that he be a desperate and hardened villain who be sure to end at the gallows and that he be to go immediately back to he home again he tell we embryo pirate that he family have nigh go distract because of he wicked and ungrateful conduct nor could we hero move he from he inflexible purpose what say we harry and will you not then let I wait until we prize be divide and i get my share prize indeed say he brother and do you then really think that you father would consent to you have a share in this terrible bloody and murthering business and so after a good deal of argument we hero be constrain to go nor do he even have a opportunity to bid adieu to he inamorata nor do he see she any more except from a distance she stand on the poop-deck as he be row away from she she face all stain with cry for himself he feel that there be no more joy in life nevertheless stand up in the stern of the boat he make shift though with a ache heart to deliver she a fine bow with the hat he have borrow from the spanish captain before he brother bid he sit down again and so to the ending of this story with only this to relate that we master harry so far from go to the gallows become in good time a respectable and wealthy sugar merchant with a english wife and a fine family of child whereunto when the mood be upon he he have sometimes tell these adventure -lrb- and sundry other not here recount -rrb- as i have tell they unto you ii tom chist and the treasure-box _ a old-time story of the day of captain kidd _ to tell about tom chist and how he get he name and how he come to be live at the little settlement of henlopen just inside the mouth of the delaware bay the story must begin as far back as 1686 when a great storm sweep the atlantic coast from end to end during the heaviest part of the hurricane a bark go ashore on the hen-and-chicken shoal just below cape henlopen and at the mouth of the delaware bay and tom chist be the only soul of all those on board the ill-fated vessel who escape alive this story must first be tell because it be on account of the strange and miraculous escape that happen to he at that time that he gain the name that be give to he even as late as that time of the american colony the little scattered settlement at henlopen make up of english with a few dutch and swedish people be still only a spot upon the face of the great american wilderness that spread away with swamp and forest no man know how far to the westward that wilderness be not only full of wild beast but of indian savage who every fall would come in wander tribe to spend the winter along the shore of the fresh-water lake below henlopen there for four or five month they would live upon fish and clam and wild duck and goose chip they arrow-head and make they earthenware pot and pan under the lee of the sand-hill and pine wood below the cape sometimes on sunday when the rev hillary jone would be preach in the little log church back in the wood these half-clad red savage would come in from the cold and sit squat in the back part of the church listen stolidly to the word that have no meaning for they but about the wreck of the bark in 1686 such a wreck as that which then go ashore on the hen-and-chicken shoal be a godsend to the poor and needy settler in the wilderness where so few good thing ever come for the vessel go to piece during the night and the next morning the beach be strew with wreckage -- box and barrel chest and spar timber and plank a plentiful and bountiful harvest to be gather up by the settler as they choose with no one to forbid or prevent they the name of the bark as find paint on some of the water-barrel and sea-chest be the _ bristol merchant _ and she no doubt hail from england as be say the only soul who escape alive off the wreck be tom chist a settler a fisherman name matt abrahamson and he daughter molly find tom he be wash up on the beach among the wreckage in a great wooden box which have be securely tie around with a rope and lash between two spar -- apparently for better protection in beat through the surf matt abrahamson think he have find something of more than usual value when he come upon this chest but when he cut the cord and break open the box with he broadaxe he could not have be more astonished have he behold a salamander instead of a baby of nine or ten month old lie half smother in the blanket that cover the bottom of the chest matt abrahamson 's daughter molly have have a baby who have die a month or so before so when she see the little one lie there in the bottom of the chest she cry out in a great loud voice that the good man have send she another baby in place of she own the rain be drive before the hurricane-storm in dim slant sheet and so she wrap up the baby in the man 's coat she wear and run off home without wait to gather up any more of the wreckage it be parson jone who give the foundle he name when the news come to he ear of what matt abrahamson have find he go over to the fisherman 's cabin to see the child he examine the clothes in which the baby be dress they be of fine linen and handsomely stitch and the reverend gentleman opine that the foundling 's parent must have be of quality a kerchief have be wrap around the baby 's neck and under its arm and tie behind and in the corner mark with very fine needlework be the initial tc what d'ye call he molly say parson jone he be stand as he speak with he back to the fire warm he palm before the blaze the pocket of the great-coat he wear bulge out with a big case-bottle of spirit which he have gather up out of the wreck that afternoon what d'ye call he molly i 'll call he tom after my own baby that go very well with the initial on the kerchief say parson jone but what other name d'ye give he let it be something to go with the c i do not know say molly why not call he ` chist ' since he be bear in a chist out of the sea ` tom chist ' -- the name go off like a flash in the pan and so tom chist he be call and tom chist he be christen so much for the beginning of the history of tom chist the story of captain kidd 's treasure-box do not begin until the late spring of 1699 that be the year that the famous pirate captain come up from the west indy sail he sloop into the delaware bay where he lay for over a month wait for news from he friend in new york for he have send word to that town ask if the coast be clear for he to return home with the rich prize he have bring from the indian sea and the coast of africa and meantime he lay there in the delaware bay wait for a reply before he leave he turn the whole of tom chist 's life topsy-turvy with something that he bring ashore by that time tom chist have grow into a strong-limbed thick-jointed boy of fourteen or fifteen year of age it be a miserable dog 's life he live with old matt abrahamson for the old fisherman be in he cup more than half the time and when he be so there be hardly a day pass that he do not give tom a curse or a buffet or as like as not a actual beat one would have think that such treatment would have break the spirit of the poor little foundling but it have just the opposite effect upon tom chist who be one of you stubborn sturdy stiff-willed fellow who only grow harder and more tough the more they be ill-treated it have be a long time now since he have make any outcry or complaint at the hard usage he suffer from old matt at such time he would shut he tooth and bear whatever come to he until sometimes the half-drunken old man would be drive almost mad by he stubborn silence maybe he would stop in the midst of the beating he be administer and grind he tooth would cry out : will not ye say naught will not ye say naught well then i 'll see if i can not make ye say naught when thing have reach such a pass as this molly would generally interfere to protect she foster-son and then she and tom would together fight the old man until they have wrench the stick or the strap out of he hand then old matt would chase they out-of-door and around and around the house for maybe half a hour until he anger be cool when he would go back again and for a time the storm would be over besides he foster-mother tom chist have a very good friend in parson jone who use to come over every now and then to abrahamson 's hut upon the chance of get a half-dozen fish for breakfast he always have a kind word or two for tom who during the winter evening would go over to the good man 's house to learn he letter and to read and write and cipher a little so that by now he be able to spell the word out of the bible and the almanac and know enough to change tuppence into four ha ` penny this be the sort of boy tom chist be and this be the sort of life he lead in the late spring or early summer of 1699 captain kidd 's sloop sail into the mouth of the delaware bay and change the whole fortune of he life and this be how you come to the story of captain kidd 's treasure-box ii old matt abrahamson keep the flat-bottomed boat in which he go fishing some distance down the shore and in the neighborhood of the old wreck that have be sink on the shoal this be the usual fishing-ground of the settler and here old matt 's boat generally lay draw up on the sand there have be a thunder-storm that afternoon and tom have go down the beach to bale out the boat in readiness for the morning 's fishing it be full moonlight now as he be return and the night sky be full of float cloud now and then there be a dull flash to the westward and once a mutter growl of thunder promising another storm to come all that day the pirate sloop have be lie just off the shore back of the cape and now tom chist could see the sail glimmer pallidly in the moonlight spread for dry after the storm he be walk up the shore homeward when he become aware that at some distance ahead of he there be a ship 's boat draw up on the little narrow beach and a group of man cluster about it he hurry forward with a good deal of curiosity to see who have land but it be not until he have come close to they that he could distinguish who and what they be then he know that it must be a party who have come off the pirate sloop they have evidently just land and two man be lift out a chest from the boat one of they be a negro naked to the waist and the other be a white man in he shirt-sleeve wear petticoat breeches a monterey cap upon he head a red bandanna handkerchief around he neck and gold ear-ring in he ear he have a long plaited queue hang down he back and a great sheath-knife dangling from he side another man evidently the captain of the party stand at a little distance as they lift the chest out of the boat he have a cane in one hand and a light lantern in the other although the moon be shine as bright as day he wear jack-boot and a handsome lace coat and he have a long droop mustache that curl down below he chin he wear a fine feathered hat and he long black hair hang down upon he shoulder all this tom chist could see in the moonlight that glint and twinkle upon the gilt button of he coat they be so busy lift the chest from the boat that at first they do not observe that tom chist have come up and be stand there it be the white man with the long plaited queue and the gold ear-ring that speak to he boy what do you want here boy he say in a rough hoarse voice where d'ye come from and then drop he end of the chest and without give tom time to answer he point off down the beach and say you would better be go about you own business if you know what be good for you and do not you come back or you 'll find what you do not want wait for you tom saw in a glance that the pirate be all look at he and then without say a word he turn and walk away the man who have speak to he follow he threateningly for some little distance as though to see that he have go away as he be bid to do but presently he stop and tom hurry on alone until the boat and the crew and all be drop away behind and lose in the moonlight night then he himself stop also turn and look back whence he have come there have be something very strange in the appearance of the man he have just see something very mysterious in they action and he wonder what it all mean and what they be go to do he stand for a little while thus look and listen he could see nothing and could hear only the sound of distant talk what be they do on the lonely shore thus at night then follow a sudden impulse he turn and cut off across the sand-hummocks skirt around inland but keep pretty close to the shore he object be to spy upon they and to watch what they be about from the back of the low sand-hill that front the beach he have go along some distance in he circuitous return when he become aware of the sound of voice that seem to be draw closer to he as he come towards the speaker he stop and stand listen and instantly as he stop the voice stop also he crouch there silently in the bright glimmer moonlight surround by the silent stretch of sand and the stillness seem to press upon he like a heavy hand then suddenly the sound of a man 's voice begin again and as tom listen he could hear some one slowly count ninety-one the voice begin ninety-two ninety-three ninety-four ninety-five ninety-six ninety-seven ninety-eight ninety-nine one hundred one hundred and one -- the slow monotonous count come nearer and nearer to he -- one hundred and two one hundred and three one hundred and four and so on in its monotonous reckoning suddenly he see three head appear above the sand-hill so close to he that he crouch down quickly with a keen thrill close beside the hummock near which he stand he first fear be that they might have see he in the moonlight but they have not and he heart rise again as the counting voice go steadily on one hundred and twenty it be say -- and twenty-one and twenty-two and twenty-three and twenty-four and then he who be count come out from behind the little sandy rise into the white and open level of shimmering brightness -lrb- illustration : ' and twenty-one and twenty-two ' -rrb- it be the man with the cane whom tom have see some time before -- the captain of the party who have land he carry he cane under he arm now and be hold he lantern close to something that he hold in he hand and upon which he look narrowly as he walk with a slow and measure tread in a perfectly straight line across the sand count each step as he take it and twenty-five and twenty-six and twenty-seven and twenty-eight and twenty-nine and thirty behind he walk two other figure one be the half-naked negro the other the man with the plaited queue and the ear-ring whom tom have see lift the chest out of the boat now they be carry the heavy box between they labor through the sand with shuffling tread as they bear it onward as he who be count pronounce the word thirty the two man set the chest down on the sand with a grunt the white man panting and blowing and wipe he sleeve across he forehead and immediately he who count take out a slip of paper and marked something down upon it they stand there for a long time during which tom lay behind the sand-hummock watch they and for a while the silence be uninterrupted in the perfect stillness tom could hear the wash of the little wave beat upon the distant beach and once the far-away sound of a laugh from one of those who stand by the ship 's boat one two three minute pass and then the man pick up the chest and start on again and then again the other man begin he counting thirty and one and thirty and two and thirty and three and thirty and four -- he walk straight across the level open still look intently at that which he hold in he hand -- and thirty and five and thirty and six and thirty and seven and so on until the three figure disappear in the little hollow between the two sand-hill on the opposite side of the open and still tom could hear the sound of the counting voice in the distance just as they disappear behind the hill there be a sudden faint flash of light and by-and-by as tom lay still listen to the counting he hear after a long interval a far-away muffle rumble of distant thunder he wait for a while and then arise and step to the top of the sand-hummock behind which he have be lie he look all about he but there be no one else to be see then he step down from the hummock and follow in the direction which the pirate captain and the two man carry the chest have go he creep along cautiously stop now and then to make sure that he still hear the counting voice and when it cease he lay down upon the sand and wait until it begin again presently so follow the pirate he see the three figure again in the distance and skirt around back of a hill of sand cover with coarse sedge-grass he come to where he overlook a little open level space gleam white in the moonlight the three have be cross the level of sand and be now not more than twenty-five pace from he they have again set down the chest upon which the white man with the long queue and the gold ear-ring have seat to rest himself the negro standing close beside he the moon shine as bright as day and full upon he face it be look directly at tom chist every line as keen cut with white light and black shadow as though it have be carve in ivory and jet he sit perfectly motionless and tom draw back with a start almost think he have be discover he lay silent he heart beat heavily in he throat but there be no alarm and presently he hear the counting begin again and when he look once more he see they be go away straight across the little open a soft slide hillock of sand lay directly in front of they they do not turn aside but go straight over it the leader help himself up the sandy slope with he cane still count and still keep he eye fix upon that which he hold in he hand then they disappear again behind the white crest on the other side so tom follow they cautiously until they have go almost half a mile inland when next he see they clearly it be from a little sandy rise which look down like the crest of a bowl upon the floor of sand below upon this smooth white floor the moon beat with almost dazzling brightness the white man who have help to carry the chest be now kneel busy at some work though what it be tom at first could not see he be whittle the point of a stick into a long wooden peg and when by-and-by he have finish what he be about he arise and step to where he who seem to be the captain have stick he cane upright into the ground as though to mark some particular spot he draw the cane out of the sand thrust the stick down in its stead then he drive the long peg down with a wooden mallet which the negro hand to he the sharp rapping of the mallet upon the top of the peg sound loud in the perfect stillness and tom lay watch and wonder what it all mean the man with quick-repeated blow drive the peg farther and farther down into the sand until it show only two or three inch above the surface as he finish he work there be another faint flash of light and by-and-by another smother rumble of thunder and tom as he look out towards the westward see the silver rim of the round and sharply outline thundercloud rise slowly up into the sky and push the other and broken drift cloud before it the two white man be now stoop over the peg the negro man watch they then presently the man with the cane start straight away from the peg carry the end of a measuring-line with he the other end of which the man with the plaited queue hold against the top of the peg when the pirate captain have reach the end of the measuring-line he mark a cross upon the sand and then again they measure out another stretch of space so they measure a distance five time over and then from where tom lay he could see the man with the queue drive another peg just at the foot of a sloping rise of sand that sweep up beyond into a tall white dune marked sharp and clear against the night sky behind as soon as the man with the plaited queue have drive the second peg into the ground they begin measure again and so still measure disappear in another direction which take they in behind the sand-dune where tom no longer could see what they be do the negro still sit by the chest where the two have leave he and so bright be the moonlight that from where he lay tom could see the glint of it twinkle in the whites of he eyeball presently from behind the hill there come for the third time the sharp rap sound of the mallet drive still another peg and then after a while the two pirate emerge from behind the sloping whiteness into the space of moonlight again they come direct to where the chest lay and the white man and the black man lift it once more they walk away across the level of open sand and so on behind the edge of the hill and out of tom 's sight iii tom chist could no longer see what the pirate be do neither do he dare to cross over the open space of sand that now lay between they and he he lay there speculate as to what they be about and meantime the storm cloud be rise higher and higher above the horizon with louder and louder muttering of thunder follow each dull flash from out the cloudy cavernous depths in the silence he could hear a occasional click as of some iron implement and he opine that the pirate be bury the chest though just where they be at work he could neither see nor tell still he lay there watch and listen and by-and-by a puff of warm air blow across the sand and a thump tumble of louder thunder leap from out the belly of the storm cloud which every minute be come nearer and nearer still tom chist lay watch suddenly almost unexpectedly the three figure reappear from behind the sand-hill the pirate captain lead the way and the negro and white man follow close behind he they have go about half-way across the white sandy level between the hill and the hummock behind which tom chist lay when the white man stop and bent over as though to tie he shoe this bring the negro a few step in front of he companion that which then follow happen so suddenly so unexpectedly so swiftly that tom chist have hardly time to realize what it all mean before it be over as the negro pass he the white man arise suddenly and silently erect and tom chist see the white moonlight glint upon the blade of a great dirk-knife which he now hold in he hand he take one two silent catlike step behind the unsuspecting negro then there be a sweeping flash of the blade in the pallid light and a blow the thump of which tom could distinctly hear even from where he lay stretch out upon the sand there be a instant echo yell from the black man who run stumble forward who stop who regain he footing and then stand for a instant as though root to the spot tom have distinctly see the knife enter he back and even think that he have see the glint of the point as it come out from the breast meantime the pirate captain have stop and now stand with he hand rest upon he cane look impassively on then the black man start to run the white man stand for a while glaring after he then he too start after he victim upon the run the black man be not very far from tom when he stagger and fall he try to rise then fall forward again and lay at length at that instant the first edge of the cloud cut across the moon and there be a sudden darkness but in the silence tom hear the sound of another blow and a groan and then presently a voice call to the pirate captain that it be all over he see the dim form of the captain cross the level sand and then as the moon sail out from behind the cloud he see the white man standing over a black figure that lay motionless upon the sand then tom chist scramble up and run away plunge down into the hollow of sand that lay in the shadow below over the next rise he run and down again into the next black hollow and so on over the slide shift ground panting and gasp it seem to he that he could hear footstep follow and in the terror that possess he he almost expect every instant to feel the cold knife-blade slide between he own rib in such a thrust from behind as he have see give to the poor black man so he run on like one in a nightmare he foot grow heavy like lead he pant and gasp he breath come hot and dry in he throat but still he run and run until at last he find himself in front of old matt abrahamson 's cabin gasping panting and sob for breath he knee relax and he thigh tremble with weakness as he open the door and dash into the darkened cabin -lrb- for both matt and molly be long ago asleep in bed -rrb- there be a flash of light and even as he slam to the door behind he there be a instant peal of thunder heavy as though a great weight have be drop upon the roof of the sky so that the door and window of the cabin rattle iv then tom chist creep to bed tremble shudder bath in sweat he heart beat like a trip-hammer and he brain dizzy from that long terror-inspired race through the soft sand in which he have strive to outstrip he know not what pursue horror for a long long time he lay awake tremble and chatter with nervous chill and when he do fall asleep it be only to drop into monstrous dream in which he once again see ever enact with various grotesque variation the tragic drama which he wake eye have behold the night before then come the dawn of the broad wet daylight and before the rising of the sun tom be up and out-of-door to find the young day drip with the rain of overnight he first act be to climb the nearest sandhill and to gaze out towards the offing where the pirate ship have be the day before it be no longer there soon afterwards matt abrahamson come out of the cabin and he call to tom to go get a bite to eat for it be time for they to be away fish all that morning the recollection of the night before hang over tom chist like a great cloud of bode trouble it fill the confine area of the little boat and spread over the entire wide space of sky and sea that surround they not for a moment be it lift even when he be haul in he wet and drip line with a struggle fish at the end of it a recurrent memory of what he have see would suddenly come upon he and he would groan in spirit at the recollection he look at matt abrahamson 's leathery face at he lantern jaw cavernously and stolidly chew at a tobacco leaf and it seem monstrous to he that the old man should be so unconscious of the black cloud that wrap they all about when the boat reach the shore again he leap scramble to the beach and as soon as he dinner be eat he hurry away to find the dominie jone he run all the way from abrahamson 's hut to the parson 's house hardly stop once and when he knock at the door he be pant and sob for breath the good man be sit on the back-kitchen door-step smoking he long pipe of tobacco out into the sunlight while he wife within be rattle about among the pan and dish in preparation of they supper of which a strong porky smell already fill the air then tom chist tell he story pant hurry tumble one word over another in he haste and parson jone listen break every now and then into a ejaculation of wonder the light in he pipe go out and the bowl turn cold and i do not see why they should have kill the poor black man say tom as he finish he narrative why that be very easy enough to understand say the good reverend man 'twa a treasure-box they bury in he agitation mr jone have rise from he seat and be now stump up and down puff at he empty tobacco-pipe as though it be still alight a treasure-box cry out tom aye a treasure-box and that be why they kill the poor black man he be the only one d'ye see besides they two who know the place where 'twa hide and now that they have kill he out of the way there be nobody but themselves know the villain -- tut tut look at that now in he excitement the dominie have snap the stem of he tobacco-pipe in two why then say tom if that be so ` tis indeed a wicked bloody treasure and fit to bring a curse upon anybody who find it ` tis more like to bring a curse upon the soul who bury it say parson jone and it may be a blessing to he who find it but tell I tom do you think you could find the place again where 'twa hide i can not tell that say tom 'twa all in among the sand-humps d'ye see and it be at night into the bargain maybe we could find the mark of they foot in the sand he add ` tis not likely say the reverend gentleman for the storm last night would have wash all that away i could find the place say tom where the boat be draw up on the beach why then that be something to start from tom say he friend if we can find that then maybe we can find whither they go from there if i be certain it be a treasure-box cry out tom chist i would rake over every foot of sand betwixt here and henlopen to find it ` twould be like hunting for a pin in a haystack say the rev hilary jone as tom walk away home it seem as though a ton 's weight of gloom have be roll away from he soul the next day he and parson jone be to go treasure-hunting together it seem to tom as though he could hardly wait for the time to come v the next afternoon parson jone and tom chist start off together upon the expedition that make tom 's fortune forever tom carry a spade over he shoulder and the reverend gentleman walk along beside he with he cane as they jog along up the beach they talk together about the only thing they could talk about -- the treasure-box and how big do you say 'twa quoth the good gentleman about so long say tom chist measure off upon the spade and about so wide and this deep and what if it should be full of money tom say the reverend gentleman swing he cane around and around in wide circle in the excitement of the think as he stride along briskly suppose it should be full of money what then by mose say tom chist hurry to keep up with he friend i would buy a ship for myself i would and i would trade to injy and to chiny to my own boot i would suppose the chist be all full of money sir and suppose we should find it would there be enough in it d'ye suppose to buy a ship to be sure there would be enough tom enough and to spare and a good big lump over and if i find it ` tis mine to keep be it and no mistake why to be sure it would be yours cry out the parson in a loud voice to be sure it would be yours he know nothing of the law but the doubt of the question begin at once to ferment in he brain and he stride along in silence for a while whose else would it be but yours if you find it he burst out can you tell I that if ever i have a ship of my own say tom chist and if ever i sail to injy in she i 'll fetch ye back the best chist of tea sir that ever be fetch from cochin chiny parson jone burst out laugh thankee tom he say and i 'll thankee again when i get my chist of tea but tell I tom didst thou ever hear of the farmer girl who count she chicken before they be hatch it be thus they talk as they hurry along up the beach together and so come to a place at last where tom stop short and stand look about he 'twa just here he say i see the boat last night i know 'twa here for i mind I of that bit of wreck yonder and that there be a tall stake drive in the sand just where yon stake stand parson jone put on he barnacle and go over to the stake towards which tom point as soon as he have look at it carefully he call out : why tom this have be just drive down into the sand ` tis a brand-new stake of wood and the pirate must have set it here themselves as a mark just as they drive the peg you speak about down into the sand tom come over and look at the stake it be a stout piece of oak nearly two inch thick it have be shape with some care and the top of it have be paint red he shake the stake and try to move it but it have be drive or plant so deeply into the sand that he could not stir it aye sir he say it must have be set here for a mark for i be sure 'twa not here yesterday or the day before he stand look about he to see if there be other sign of the pirate ' presence at some little distance there be the corner of something white stick up out of the sand he could see that it be a scrap of paper and he point to it call out : yonder be a piece of paper sir i wonder if they leave that behind they it be a miraculous chance that place that paper there there be only a inch of it show and if it have not be for tom 's sharp eye it would certainly have be overlook and pass by the next wind-storm would have cover it up and all that afterwards happen never would have occur look sir he say as he strike the sand from it it have write on it let I see it say parson jone he adjust the spectacles a little more firmly astride of he nose as he take the paper in he hand and begin con it what be all this he say a whole lot of figure and nothing else and then he read aloud ` mark -- ssw by s ' what d'ye suppose

we have read this aright thy fortune be make tom chist stand stare straight at the old gentleman 's excited face and see nothing but it in all the bright infinity of sunshine be they indeed about to find the treasure-chest he feel the sun very hot upon he shoulder and he hear the harsh insistent jarring of a tern that hover and circle with fork tail and sharp white wing in the sunlight just above they head but all the time he stand stare into the good old gentleman 's face it be parson jone who first speak but what do all these figure mean and tom observe how the paper shake and rustle in the tremor of excitement that shake he hand he raise the paper to the focus of he spectacles and begin to read again ` mark 40 72 91 -- ' mark cry out tom almost scream why that must mean the stake yonder that must be the mark and he point to the oaken stick with its red tip blaze against the white shimmer of sand behind it and the 40 and 72 and 91 cry the old gentleman in a voice equally shrill -- why

suggest tom chist like enough like enough say parson jone like enough after the wretch have bury the chest and kill the poor black man they be so buffet and bowse about by the storm that it be shake

measuring-rod he use to lay out he new byre while you be go i 'll pace off the distance mark on the paper with my pocket-compass here vi tom chist be go for almost a hour though he run nearly all the way and back upborne as on the wing of the wind when he return pant parson jone be nowhere to be see but tom see he footstep lead away inland and he follow the scuffle mark in the smooth surface across the sand-hump and down into the hollow and by-and-by find the good gentleman in a spot he at once know as soon as he lay he eye upon it it be the open space where the pirate have drive they first peg and where tom chist have afterwards see they kill the poor black man tom chist gaze around as though expect to see some sign of the tragedy but the space be as smooth and as undisturbed as a floor except where midway across it parson jone who be now stoop over something on the ground have trample it all around about when tom chist see he he be still bend over scrape the sand away from something he have find it be the first peg inside of half a hour they have find the second and third peg and tom chist strip off he coat and begin digging like mad down into the sand parson jone standing over he watch he the sun be slope well towards the west when the blade of tom chist 's spade strike upon something hard if it have be he own heart that he have hit in the sand he breast could hardly have thrill more sharply it be the treasure-box parson jone himself leap down into the hole and begin scrape away the sand with he hand as though he have go crazy at last with some difficulty they tug and haul the chest up out of the sand to the surface where it lay cover all over with the grit that cling to it it be securely lock and fasten with a padlock and it take a good many blow with the blade of the spade to burst the bolt parson jone himself lift the lid tom chist lean forward and gaze down into the open box he would not have be surprise to have see it fill full of yellow gold and bright jewel it be fill half full of book and papers and half full of canvas bag tie safely and securely around and around with cord of string parson jone lift out one of the bag and it jingle as he do so it be full of money he cut the string and with tremble shake hand hand the bag to tom who in a ecstasy of wonder and dizzy with delight pour out with swimming sight upon the coat spread on the ground a cataract of shine silver money that ring and twinkle and jingle as it fall in a shine heap upon the coarse cloth parson jone hold up both hand into the air and tom stare at what he see wonder whether it be all so and whether he be really awake it seem to he as though he be in a dream there be two-and-twenty bag in all in the chest : ten of they full of silver money eight of they full of gold money three of they full of gold-dust and one small bag with jewel wrap up in wad cotton and paper -lrb- illustration : ` tis enough ' cry out parson jone ` to make we both rich man ' -rrb- ` tis enough cry out parson jone to make we both rich man as long as we live the burning summer sun though sloping in the sky beat down upon they as hot as fire but neither of they notice it neither do they notice hunger nor thirst nor fatigue but sit there as though in a trance with the bag of money scatter on the sand around they a great pile of money heap upon the coat and the open chest beside they it be a hour of sundown before parson jone have begin fairly to examine the book and papers in the chest of the three book two be evidently log-book of the pirate who have be lie off the mouth of the delaware bay all this time the other book be write in spanish and be evidently the log-book of some capture prize it be then sit there upon the sand the good old gentleman reading in he high crack voice that they first learn from the bloody record in those two book who it be who have be lie inside the cape all this time and that it be the famous captain kidd every now and then the reverend gentleman would stop to exclaim oh the bloody wretch or oh the desperate cruel villain and then would go on reading again a scrap here and a scrap there and all the while tom chist sit and listen every now and then reach out furtively and touch the heap of money still lie upon the coat one might be incline to wonder why captain kidd have keep those bloody record he have probably lay they away because they so incriminate many of the great people of the colony of new york that with the book in evidence it would have be impossible to bring the pirate to justice without drag a dozen or more fine gentleman into the dock along with he if he could have keep they in he own possession they would doubtless have be a great weapon of defense to protect he from the gallows indeed when captain kidd be finally bring to conviction and hang he be not accuse of he piracy but of strike a mutinous seaman upon the head with a bucket and accidentally kill he the authority do not dare try he for piracy he be really hung because he be a pirate and we know that it be the log-book that tom chist bring to new york that do the business for he he be accuse and convict of manslaughter for killing of he own ship-carpenter with a bucket so parson jone sit there in the slanting light read through these terrible record of piracy and tom with the pile of gold and silver money beside he sit and listen to he what a spectacle if any one have come upon they but they be alone with the vast arch of sky empty above they and the wide white stretch of sand a desert around they the sun sink lower and lower until there be only time to glance through the other papers in the chest they be nearly all goldsmith ' bill of exchange draw in favor of certain of the most prominent merchant of new york parson jone as he read over the name know of nearly all the gentleman by hearsay aye here be this gentleman he think that name would be among 'em what here be mr so-and-so well if all they say be true the villain have rob one of he own best friend i wonder he say why the wretch should have hide these papers so carefully away with the other treasure for they could do he no good then answer he own question : like enough because these will give he a hold over the gentleman to whom they be draw so that he can make a good bargain for he own neck before he give the bill back to they owner i tell you what it be tom he continue it be you yourself shall go to new york and bargain for the return of these papers ` twill be as good as another fortune to you the majority of the bill be draw in favor of one richard chillingsworth esquire and he be say parson jone one of the richest man in the province of new york you shall go to he with the news of what we have find when shall i go say tom chist you shall go upon the very first boat we can catch say the parson he have turn still hold the bill in he hand and be now finger over the pile of money that yet lay tumble out upon the coat i wonder tom say he if you could spare I a score or so of these doubloon you shall have fifty score if you choose say tom burst with gratitude and with generosity in he newly find treasure you be as fine a lad as ever i see tom say the parson and i 'll thank you to the last day of my life tom scoop up a double handful of silver money take it sir he say and you may have as much more as you want of it he pour it into the dish that the good man make of he hand and the parson make a motion as though to empty it into he pocket then he stop as though a sudden doubt have occur to he i do not know that ` tis fit for I to take this pirate money after all he say but you be welcome to it say tom still the parson hesitate nay he burst out i 'll not take it ` tis blood-money and as he speak he chuck the whole double handful into the now empty chest then arise and dust the sand from he breeches then with a great deal of bustling energy he help to tie the bag again and put they all back into the chest they rebury the chest in the place whence they have take it and then the parson fold the precious paper of direction place it carefully in he wallet and he wallet in he pocket tom he say for the twentieth time you fortune have be make this day and tom chist as he rattle in he breeches pocket the half-dozen doubloon he have keep out of he treasure feel that what he friend have say be true \* \* \* \* \* as the two go back homeward across the level space of sand tom chist suddenly stop stock still and stand look about he 'twa just here he say digging he heel down into the sand that they kill the poor black man and here he lie bury for all time say parson jone and as he speak he dig he cane down into the sand tom chist shudder he would not have be surprise if the ferrule of the cane have strike something soft beneath that level surface but it do not nor be any sign of that tragedy ever see again for whether the pirate have carry away what they have do and bury it elsewhere or whether the storm in blow the sand have completely level off and hide all sign of that tragedy where it be enact certain it be that it never come to sight again -- at least so far as tom chist and the reverend hillary jone ever know vii this be the story of the treasure-box all that remain now be to conclude the story of tom chist and to tell of what come of he in the end he do not go back again to live with old matt abrahamson parson jone have now take charge of he and he fortune and tom do not have to go back to the fisherman 's hut old abrahamson talk a great deal about it and would come in he cup and harangue good parson jone make a vast protestation of what he would do to tom -- if he ever catch he -- for run away but tom on all these occasion keep carefully out of he way and nothing come of the old man 's threatening tom use to go over to see he foster-mother now and then but always when the old man be from home and molly abrahamson use to warn he to keep out of she father 's way he be in as vile a humor as ever i see tom she say he sit sulk all day long and ` tis my belief he would kill ye if he catch ye of course tom say nothing even to she about the treasure and he and the reverend gentleman keep the knowledge thereof to themselves about three week later parson jone manage to get he ship aboard of a vessel bind for new york town and a few day later tom chist land at that place he have never be in such a town before and he could not sufficiently wonder and marvel at the number of brick house at the multitude of people come and go along the fine hard earthen sidewalk at the shop and the store where goods hang in the window and most of all the fortification and the battery at the point at the row of threaten cannon and at the scarlet-coated sentry pacing up and down the rampart all this be very wonderful and so be the cluster boat ride at anchor in the harbor it be like a new world so different be it from the sand-hill and the sedgy level of henlopen tom chist take up he lodgings at a coffeehouse near to the town-hall and thence he send by the post-boy a letter write by parson jone to master chillingsworth in a little while the boy return with a message ask tom to come up to mr chillingsworth 's house that afternoon at two o'clock tom go thither with a great deal of trepidation and he heart fall away altogether when he find it a fine grand brick house three story high and with wrought-iron letter across the front the counting-house be in the same building but tom because of mr jone 's letter be conduct directly into the parlor where the great rich man be await he come he be sit in a leather-covered arm-chair smoking a pipe of tobacco and with a bottle of fine old madeira close to he elbow tom have not have a chance to buy a new suit of clothes yet and so he cut no very fine figure in the rough dress he have bring with he from henlopen nor do mr chillingsworth seem to think very highly of he appearance for he sit look sideways at tom as he smoke well my lad he say and what be this great thing you have to tell I that be so mightily wonderful i get what be - his-name -- mr jone 's -- letter and now i be ready to hear what you have to say but if he think but little of he visitor 's appearance at first he soon change he sentiment towards he for tom have not speak twenty word when mr chillingsworth 's whole aspect change he straighten himself up in he seat lay aside he pipe push away he glass of madeira and bid tom take a chair he listen without a word as tom chist tell of the bury treasure of how he have see the poor negro murder and of how he and parson jone have recover the chest again only once do mr chillingsworth interrupt the narrative and to think he cry that the villain this very day walk about new york town as though he be a honest man ruffle it with the best of we but if we can only get hold of these log-book you speak of go on tell I more of this when tom chist 's narrative be end mr chillingsworth 's bearing be as different as daylight be from dark he ask a thousand question all in the most polite and gracious tone imaginable and not only urge a glass of he fine old madeira upon tom but ask he to stay to supper there be nobody to be there he say but he wife and daughter tom all in a panic at the very think of the two lady sturdily refuse to stay even for the dish of tea mr chillingsworth offer he he do not know that he be destine to stay there as long as he should live and now say mr chillingsworth tell I about yourself i have nothing to tell you honor say tom except that i be wash up out of the sea wash up out of the sea exclaim mr chillingsworth why how be that come begin at the beginning and tell I all thereupon tom chist do as he be bid begin at the very begin and tell everything just as molly abrahamson have often tell it to he as he continue mr chillingsworth 's interest change into a appearance of stronger and stronger excitement suddenly he jump up out of he chair and begin to walk up and down the room stop stop he cry out at last in the midst of something tom be say stop stop tell I do you know the name of the vessel that be wreck and from which you be wash ashore i have hear it say say tom chist 'twa the _ bristol merchant _ i know it i know it exclaim the great man in a loud voice fling he hand up into the air i feel it be so the moment you begin the story but tell I this be there nothing find with you with a mark or a name upon it there be a kerchief say tom marked with a t and a c theodosium chillingsworth cry out the merchant i know it i know it heaven to think of anything so wonderful happen as this boy boy dost thou know who thou art thou art my own brother 's son he name be oliver chillingsworth and he be my partner in business and thou art he son then he run out into the entryway shout and call for he wife and daughter to come so tom chist -- or thoma chillingsworth as he now be to be call -- do stay to supper after all this be the story and i hope you may like it for tom chist become rich and great as be to be suppose and he marry he pretty cousin theodosium -lrb- who have be name for he own mother drown in the _ bristol merchant _ -rrb- he do not forget he friend but have parson jone bring to new york to live as to molly and matt abrahamson they both enjoy a pension of ten pound a year for as long as they live for now that all be well with he tom bear no grudge against the old fisherman for all the drubbing he have suffer the treasure-box be bring on to new york and if tom chist do not get all the money there be in it -lrb- as parson jone have opine he would -rrb- he get at least a good big lump of it and it be my belief that those log-book do more to get captain kidd arrest in boston town and hang in london than anything else that be bring up against he iii the ghost of captain brand _ be a narrative of certain extraordinary adventure that befall barnaby true esquire of the town of new york in the year 1753 _ i it be not so easy to tell why discredit should be cast upon a man because of something he grandfather may have do amiss but the world which be never over-nice in its discrimination as to where to lay the blame be often pleased to make the innocent suffer instead of the guilty barnaby true be a good honest boy as boy go but yet be he not ever allow altogether to forget that he grandfather have be that very famous pirate captain william brand who after so many marvellous adventure -lrb- if one may believe the catchpenny story and ballad that be writ about he -rrb- be murder in jamaica by captain john malyoe the commander of he own consort the _ adventure _ galley it have never be deny that ever i hear that up to the time of captain brand 's be commission against the south sea pirate he have always be esteem as honest reputable a sea-captain as could be when he start out upon that adventure it be with a ship the _ royal sovereign _ fit out by some of the most decent merchant of new york governor van dam himself have subscribe to the adventure and himself have sign captain brand 's commission so if the unfortunate man go astray he must have have great temptation to do so many other behave no better when the opportunity offer in these far-away sea when so many rich purchase might very easily be take and no one the wiser to be sure those story and ballad make we captain to be a most wicked profane wretch and if he be why god know he suffer and pay for it for he lay he bone in jamaica and never see he home or he wife or he daughter after he have sail away on the _ royal sovereign _ on that long misfortunate voyage leave he family behind he in new york to the care of stranger at the time when captain brand so meet he fate in port royal harbor he have increase he flotilla to two vessel -- the _ royal sovereign _ -lrb- which be the vessel that have be fit out for he in new york a fine brigantine and a good sailer -rrb- and the _ adventure _ galley which he have capture somewhere in the south sea this latter vessel he place in command of a certain john malyoe whom he have pick up no one know where -- a young man of very good family in england who have turn red-handed pirate this man who take no more think of a human life than he would of a broom straw be he who afterwards murder captain brand as you shall presently hear with these two vessel the _ royal sovereign _ and the _ adventure _ captain brand and captain malyoe sweep the mozambique channel as clear as a boatswain 's whistle and after three year of piracy have gain a great booty of gold and silver and pearl sail straight for the america make first the island of jamaica and the harbor of port royal where they drop anchor to wait for news from home but by this time the authority have be so stir up against we pirate that it become necessary for they to hide they booty until such time as they might make they peace with the admiralty court at home so one night captain brand and captain malyoe with two other of the pirate go ashore with two great chest of treasure which they bury somewhere on the bank of the cobra river near the place where the old spanish fort have stand what happen after the treasure be thus bury no one may tell 'twa say that captain brand and captain malyoe fall a-quarrelling and that the upshot of the matter be that captain malyoe shot captain brand through the head and that the pirate who be with he serve captain brand 's companion after the same fashion with a pistol bullet through the body after that the two murderer return to they vessel the _ adventure _ galley and sail away carry the bloody secret of the bury treasure with they -lrb- illustration : captain malyoe shot captain brand through the head -rrb- but this double murder of captain brand and he companion happen you be to understand some twenty year before the time of this story and while we hero be but one year old so now to we present history it be a great pity that any one should have a grandfather who end he day in such a sort as this but it be no fault of barnaby true 's nor could he have do anything to prevent it see he be not even bear into the world at the time that he grandfather turn pirate and that he be only one year old when captain brand so meet he death on the cobra river nevertheless the boy with whom he go to school never tire of call he pirate and would sometimes sing for he benefit that famous catchpenny ballad begin thus : oh my name be captain brand a-sailing and a-sailing oh my name be captain brand a-sailing free oh my name be captain brand and i sin by sea and land for i break god 's just command a-sailing free 'twa a vile thing to sing at the grandson of so unfortunate a man and oftentimes barnaby true would double up he little fist and would fight he tormentor at great odds and would sometimes go back home with a bloody nose or a bruised eye to have he poor mother cry over he and grieve for he not that he day be all of teasing and torment either for if he comrade do sometimes treat he so why then there be other time when he and they be as great friend as could be and use to go a-swimming together in the most amicable fashion where there be a bit of sandy strand below the little bluff along the east river above fort george there be a clump of wide beech-tree at that place with a fine shade and a place to lay they clothes while they swim about splash with they naked white body in the water at these time master barnaby would bawl as lustily and laugh as loud as though he grandfather have be the most honest ship-chandler in the town instead of a bloody-handed pirate who have be murder in he sin ah it be a fine thing to look back to the day when one be a boy barnaby may remember how often when he and he companion be paddle so in the water the soldier off duty would come up from the fort and would maybe join they in the water other perhaps stand in they red coat on the shore look on and smoke they pipe of tobacco then there be other time when maybe the very next day after we hero have fight with great valor with he fellow he would go a-rambling with they up the bouwerie road with the utmost friendliness perhaps to help they steal cherry from some old dutch farmer forget in such a adventure what a thief he own grandfather have be but to resume we story when barnaby true be between sixteen and seventeen year old he be take into employment in the counting-house of he stepfather mr roger hartright the well-known west indian merchant a most respectable man and one of the kindest and best of friend that anybody could have in the world this good gentleman have court the favor of barnaby 's mother for a long time before he have marry she indeed he have so court she before she have ever think of marry jonathan true but he not venture to ask she in marriage and she be a brisk handsome woman she choose the man who speak out he mind and so leave the silent lover out in the cold but so soon as she be a widow and free again mr hartright resume he woo and so use to come down every Tuesday and Friday evening to sit and talk with she among barnaby true 's earliest memory be a recollection of the good kind gentleman sit in old captain brand 's double-nailed arm-chair the sunlight shine across he knee over which he have spread a great red silk handkerchief while he sip a dish of tea with a dash of rum in it he keep up this habit of visit the widow true for a long time before he could fetch himself to the point of ask anything more particular of she and so barnaby be nigh fourteen year old before mr hartright marry she and so become we hero 's dear and honor foster-father it be the kindness of this good man that not only find a place for barnaby in the counting-house but advance he so fast that against we hero be twenty-one year old he have make four voyage as supercargo to the west indy in mr hartright 's ship the _ belle helen _ and soon after he be twenty-one undertake a fifth nor be it in any such subordinate position as mere supercargo that he sail upon these adventure but rather as the confidential agent of mr hartright who have no likelihood of child of he own be jealous to advance we hero to a position of trust and responsibility in the counting-house and so would have he know all the particulars of the business and become more intimately acquaint with the correspondent and agent throughout those part of the west indy where the affair of the house be most active he would give to barnaby the best sort of letter of introduction so that the correspondent of mr hartright throughout those part see how that gentleman have adopt we hero 's interest as he own be always at considerable pain to be very polite and oblige in show every attention to he especially among these gentleman throughout the west indy may be mention mr ambrose greenfield a merchant of excellent standing who live at kingston jamaica this gentleman be very particular to do all that he could to make we hero 's stay in these part as agreeable and pleasant to he as might be mr greenfield be here speak of with a greater degree of particularity than other who might as well be remark upon because as the reader shall presently discover for himself it be through the office of this good friend that we hero first become acquaint not only with that lady who afterwards figure with such conspicuousness in he affair but also with a man who though grace with a title be perhaps the greatest villain who ever escape a just fate upon the gallows so much for the history of barnaby true up to the beginning of this story without which you shall hardly be able to understand the purport of those most extraordinary adventure that afterwards befall he nor the logic of they consequence after they have occur ii upon the occasion of we hero 's fifth voyage into the west indy he make a stay of some six or eight week at kingston in the island of jamaica and it be at that time that the first of those extraordinary adventure befall he concern which this narrative have to relate it be barnaby 's habit when stay at kingston to take lodge with a very decent respectable widow by name mr anne bolle who with three extremely agreeable and pleasant daughter keep a very clean and well-served house for the accommodation of stranger visit that island one morning as he sit sip he coffee clothe only in loose cotton drawer and a jacket of the same material and with slipper upon he foot -lrb- as be the custom in that country where every one endeavor to keep as cool as may be -rrb- miss eliza the youngest of the three daughter -- a brisk handsome miss of sixteen or seventeen -- come trip into the room and hand he a sealed letter which she declare a stranger have just leave at the door depart incontinently so soon as he have ease himself of that commission you may conceive of barnaby 's astonishment when he open the note and read the remarkable word that here follow : _ mr barnaby true _ sir -- though you do not know I i know you and i tell you this : if you will be at pratt 's ordinary on Friday next at eight o'clock in the evening and will accompany the man who shall say to you ' _ the royal sovereign be come in _ ' you shall learn of something the most to you advantage that ever befall you sir keep this note and give it to he who shall address those word to you so to certify that you be the man he seek sir this be the most important thing that can concern you so you will please say nothing to nobody about it such be the wording of the note which be writ in as cramped and villanous handwriting as we hero ever behold and which except he own name be without address and which possess no superscription whatever the first emotion that stir barnaby true be one of extreme and profound astonishment the second thought that come into he mind be that maybe some witty fellow -- of whom he know a good many in that place and wild mad rake they be as ever the world behold -- be attempt to play off a smart witty jest upon he indeed miss eliza bolle who be of a lively mischievous temper be not herself above play such a prank should the occasion offer with this think in he mind barnaby inquire of she with a good deal of particularity concern the appearance and condition of the man who have leave the note to all of which miss reply with so straight a face and so candid a air that he could no longer suspect she of be concern in any trick against he and so ease he mind of any such suspicion the bearer of the note she inform he be a tall lean man with a red neckerchief tie around he neck and with copper buckle to he shoe and he have the appearance of a sailor-man have a great queue of red hair hang down he back but lord what be such a description as that in a busy seaport town full of score of man to fit such a likeness accordingly we hero put the note away into he wallet determine to show it to he good friend mr greenfield that evening and to ask he advice upon it this he do and that gentleman 's opinion be the same as he : to wit that some wag be mind to play off a hoax upon he and that the matter of the letter be all nothing but smoke iii nevertheless though barnaby be thus confirm in he opinion as to the nature of the communication he have receive he yet determine in he own mind that he would see the business through to the end and so be at pratt 's ordinary as the note demand upon the day and at the time appoint therein pratt 's ordinary be at that time a very fine and famous place of its sort with good tobacco and the best rum in the west indy and have a garden behind it that slope down to the harbor front be plant pretty thick with palm and fern group into cluster with flower and plant here be a number of table some in little grotto like we vauxhall in new york with red and blue and white paper lantern hang among the foliage thither gentleman and lady use sometimes to go of a evening to sit and drink lime-juice and sugar and water -lrb- and sometimes a taste of something stronger -rrb- and to look out across the water at the shipping and so to enjoy the cool of the day thither accordingly we hero go a little before the time appoint in the note and pass directly through the ordinary and to the garden beyond choose a table at the lower end and close to the water 's edge where he could not readily be see by any one come into the place and yet where he could easily view whoever should approach then order some rum and water and a pipe of tobacco he compose himself to watch for the arrival of those witty fellow whom he suspect would presently come thither to see the end of they prank and to enjoy he confusion the spot be pleasant enough for the land breeze blow strong and cool set the leaf of the palm-tree above he head to rattle and clatter continually against the darkness of the sky where the moon then be half full they shine every now and then like blade of steel the wave also be splash up against the little landing-place at the foot of the garden sound mightily pleasant in the dusk of the evening and sparkling all over the harbor where the moon catch the edge of the water a great many vessel be lie at anchor in they riding with the dark prodigious form of a man-of-war loom up above they in the moonlight there we hero sit for the best part of a hour smoking he pipe of tobacco and sip he rum and water yet see nothing of those whom he suspect might presently come thither to laugh at he it be not far from half after the hour when a row-boat come suddenly out of the night and pull up to the landing-place at the foot of the garden and three or four man come ashore in the darkness they land very silently and walk up the garden pathway without say a word and sit down at a adjacent table order rum and water and begin drinking among themselves speak every now and then a word or two in a tongue that barnaby do not well understand but which from certain phrase they let fall he suspect to be portuguese we hero pay no great attention to they till by-and-by he become aware that they have fall to whisper together and be regard he very curiously he feel himself grow very uneasy under this observation which every moment grow more and more particular and he be just begin to suspect that this interest concern himself might have somewhat more to do with he than mere idle curiosity when one of the man who be plainly the captain of the party suddenly say to he how now messmate will not you come and have a drop of drink with we at this address barnaby instantly begin to be aware that the affair he have come upon be indeed no jest as he have suppose it to be but that he have walk into what promise to be a very pretty adventure nevertheless not wish to be too hasty in he conclusion he answer very civilly that he have drunk enough already and that more would only heat he blood well say the stranger i may be mistook but i believe you be mr barnaby true you be right sir and that be my name acknowledge barnaby but still i can not guess how that may concern you nor why it should be a reason for my drinking with you that i will presently tell you say the stranger very composedly you name concern I because i be send here to tell mr barnaby true that ' _ the royal sovereign be come in _ ' to be sure we hero 's heart jump into he throat at those word he pulse begin beat at a tremendous rate for here indeed be a adventure suddenly open to he such as a man may read about in a book but which he may hardly expect to befall he in the real happening of he life have he be a wiser and a older man he might have decline the whole business instead of walk blindly into that of which he could see neither the beginning nor the end but be barely one-and-twenty year of age and possess a sanguine temper and a adventurous disposition that would have carry he into almost anything that possess a smack of uncertainty or danger he contrived to say in a pretty easy tone -lrb- though god know how it be put on for the occasion -rrb- : well if that be so and if the _ royal sovereign _ be indeed come in why then i 'll join you since you be so kind as to ask I therewith he arise and go across to the other table carry he pipe with he and sit down and begin smoke with all the appearance of ease he could command upon the occasion at this the other burst out a-laughing indeed say he you be a cool blade and a chip of the old block but harkee young gentleman and here he fall serious again this be too weighty a business to chance any mistake in a name i believe that you be as you say mr barnaby true but nevertheless to make perfectly sure i must ask you first to show I a note that you have about you and which you be instruct to show to I very well say barnaby i have it here safe and sound and you shall see it and thereupon and without more ado he draw out he wallet open it and hand the other the mysterious note which he have keep carefully by he ever since he have receive it he interlocutor take the paper and draw to he the candle burning there for the convenience of those who would smoke tobacco begin immediately read it this give barnaby true a moment or two to look at he he be a tall lean man with a red handkerchief tie around he neck with a queue of red hair hang down he back and with copper buckle on he shoe so that barnaby true could not but suspect that he be the very same man who have give the note to miss eliza bolle at the door of he lodging-house ` tis all right and straight and as it should be the other say after he have so examine the note and now that the paper be read -lrb- suit he action to he word -rrb- i 'll just burn it for safety 's sake and so he do twist it up and set it to the flame of the candle and now he say continue he address i 'll tell you what i be here for i be send to ask if you be man enough to take you life in you hand and to go with I in that boat down yonder at the foot of the garden say ` yes ' and we 'll start away without waste more time for the devil be ashore here at jamaica -- though you do not know what that mean -- and if he get ahead of we why then we may whistle for what we be after for all the good ` twill do we say ` no ' and i go away and i promise you you shall never be trouble more in this sort of a way so now speak up plain young gentleman and tell we what be you wish in this business and whether you will adventure any further or no if we hero hesitate it be not for long and when he speak up it be with a voice as steady as could be to be sure i be man enough to go with you say he and if you mean I any harm i can look out for myself and if i can not then here be something can look out for I and therewith he lift up the flap of he pocket and show the butt of a pistol he have fetch with he when he have set out from he lodging-house that evening at this the other burst out a-laughing for a second time come say he you be indeed of right mettle and i like you spirit all the same no one in all the world mean you less ill than i and so if you have to use that barker ` twill not be upon we who be you friend but only upon one who be more wicked than the devil himself so now if you be prepared and have make up you mind and be determine to see this affair through to the end ` tis time for we to be away whereupon we hero indicate he acquiescence he interlocutor and the other -lrb- who have not speak a single word for all this time -rrb- rise together from the table and the stranger have pay the score of all they go down together to the boat that lay plainly await they come at the bottom of the garden thus come to it we hero could see that it be a large yawl-boat man by half a score of black man for rower and that there be two lantern in the stern-sheet and three or four shovel the man who have conduct the conversation with barnaby true for all this time and who be as have be say plainly the captain of the expedition step immediately down into the boat we hero follow and the other follow after he and instantly they be seat the boat shove off and the black man begin pull straight out into the harbor and so at some distance away around under the stern of the man-of-war not a word be speak after they have thus leave the shore and they might all have be so many spirit for the silence of the party barnaby true be too full of he own thought to talk -lrb- and serious enough thought they be by this time with crimp to trepan a man at every turn and press-gang to carry he off so that he might never be hear of again -rrb- as for the other they do not seem to choose to say anything now that they have be fairly embark upon they enterprise and so the crew pull away for the best part of a hour the leader of the expedition direct the course of the boat straight across the harbor as though towards the mouth of the cobra river indeed this be they destination as barnaby could after a while see for himself by the low point of land with a great long row of cocoanut-palm grow upon it -lrb- the appearance of which he know very well -rrb- which by-and-by begin to loom up from the dimness of the moonlight as they approach the river they find the tide be run very violently so that it gurgle and ripple alongside the boat as the crew of black man pull strongly against it thus rowing slowly against the stream they come around what appear to be either a point of land or a islet cover with a thick growth of mangrove-tree though still no one speak a single word as to they destination or what be the business they have in hand the night now that they have come close to the shore appear to be full of the noise of run tide-water and the air be heavy with the smell of mud and marsh and over all be the whiteness of the moonlight with a few star prick out here and there in the sky and everything be so strange and mysterious and so different from anything that he have experience before that barnaby could not divest himself of the feeling that it be all a dream from which at any moment he might awaken as for the town and the ordinary he have quit such a short time before so different be they from this present experience it be as though they might have concern another life than that which he be then enjoy meantime the rower bend to the oar the boat draw slowly around into the open water once more as it do so the leader of the expedition of a sudden call out in a loud commanding voice whereat the black man instantly cease rowing and lay on they oar the boat drift onward into the night at the same moment of time we hero become aware of another boat come down the river towards where they lay this other boat approach thus strangely through the darkness be full of man some of they arm for even in the distance barnaby could not but observe that the light of the moon glimmer now and then as upon the barrel of musket or pistol this throw he into a good deal of disquietude of mind for whether they or this boat be friend or enemy or as to what be to happen next he be altogether in the dark upon this point however he be not leave very long in doubt for the oarsman of the approach boat continue to row steadily onward till they have come pretty close to barnaby and he companion a man who sit in the stern suddenly stand up and as they pass by shake a cane at barnaby 's companion with a most threatening and angry gesture at the same moment the moonlight shine full upon he barnaby could see he as plain as daylight -- a large stout gentleman with a round red face and clothe in a fine lace coat of red cloth in the stern of the boat near by he be a box or chest about the bigness of a middle-sized travelling-trunk but cover all over with cake of sand and dirt in the act of pass the gentleman still stand pointed at this chest with he cane -- a elegant gold-headed staff -- and roar out in a loud voice : be you come after this abram dowling then come and take it and thereat as he sit down again burst out a-laughing as though what he have say be the wittiest jest conceivable either because he respect the armed man in the other boat or else for some reason best know to himself the captain of we hero 's expedition do not immediately reply but sit as still as any stone but at last the other boat have drift pretty far away he suddenly find word to shout out after it : very well jack malyoe very well jack malyoe you have get the better of we once more but next time be the third and then it 'll be we turn even if william brand must come back from the grave to settle with you himself but to this my fine gentleman in t ` other boat make no reply except to burst out once more into a great fit of laughter there be however still another man in the stern of the enemy 's boat -- a villanous lean man with lantern-jaw and the top of he head as bald as a apple he hold in he hand a great pistol which he flourish about he cry out to the gentleman beside he do but give I the word you honor and i 'll put another bullet through the son of a sea cook but the other forbid he and therewith the boat presently melt away into the darkness of the night and be go this happen all in a few seconds so that before we hero understand what be pass he find the boat in which he still sit drift silently in the moonlight -lrb- for no one speak for awhile -rrb- and the oar of the other boat sound farther and farther away into the distance by-and-by say one of those in barnaby 's boat in spanish where shall you go now at this the leader of the expedition appear suddenly to come back to himself and to find he tongue again go he roar out go to the devil go go where you choose go go back again -- that be where well go and therewith he fall a-cursing and swearing frothing at the lip as though he have go clean crazy while the black man bend once more to they oar row back again across the harbor as fast as ever they could lay oar to the water they put barnaby true ashore below the old custom-house but so bewildered and amaze by all that have happen and by what he have see and by the name he have hear speak that he be only half conscious of the familiar thing among which he suddenly find himself transport the moonlight and the night appear to have take upon they a new and singular aspect and he walk up the street towards he lodging like one drunk or in a dream for you must remember that john malyoe be the captain of the _ adventure _ galley -- he who have shoot barnaby 's own grandfather -- and abram dowling i must tell you have be the gunner of the _ royal sovereign _ -- he who have be shoot at the same time that captain brand meet he tragical end and yet these name he have hear speak -- the one from one boat and the other from the other so that he could not but wonder what sort of being they be among whom he have fall as to that box cover all over with mud he could only offer a conjecture as to what it contain and as to what the finding of it signify but of this we hero say nothing to any one nor do he tell any one what he suspect for though he be so young in year he possess a continent disposition inherit from he father -lrb- who have be one of ten child bear to a poor but worthy presbyterian minister of bluefield connecticut -rrb- so it be that not even to he good friend mr greenfield do barnaby say a word as to what have happen to he go about he business the next day as though nothing of moment have occur but he be not destine yet to be do with those being among whom he have fall that night for that which he suppose to be the ending of the whole affair be only the beginning of further adventure that be soon to befall he iv mr greenfield live in a fine brick house just outside of the town on the mona road he family consist of a wife and two daughter -- handsome lively young lady with very fine bright tooth that shine whenever they laugh and with a-plenty to say for themselves to this pleasant house barnaby true be often ask to a family dinner after which he and he good kind host would maybe sit upon the veranda look out towards the mountain smoking they cigarro while the young lady laugh and talk or play upon the guitar and sing a day or two before the _ belle helen _ sail from kingston upon she return voyage to new york mr greenfield stop barnaby true as he be pass through the office and beg he to come to dinner that night -lrb- for within the tropics you be to know they breakfast at eleven o'clock and take dinner in the cool of the evening because of the heat and not at mid-day as we do in more temperate latitudes -rrb- i would say mr greenfield have you meet sir john malyoe and miss marjorie who be to be you chief passenger for new york and for whom the state cabin and the two state-room be to be fit as here order -- show a letter -- for sir john have arrange say mr greenfield for the captain 's own state-room then not be aware of barnaby true 's history nor that captain brand be he grandfather the good gentleman -- call sir john jack malyoe -- go on to tell we hero what a famous pirate he have be and how it be he who have shoot captain brand over t ` other side of the harbor twenty year before yes say he ` tis the same jack malyoe though grow into repute and importance now as who would not who have have the good-fortune to fall heir to a baronetcy and a land estate and so it befall that same night that barnaby true once again behold the man who have murder he own grandfather meeting he this time face to face that time in the harbor he have see sir john malyoe at a distance and in the darkness now that he behold he closer it seem to he that he have never see a countenance more distasteful to he in all he life not that the man be altogether ugly for he have a good enough nose and a fine double chin but he eye stand out from he face and be red and watery and he wink they continually as though they be always a-smarting he lip be thick and purple-red and he cheek mottle here and there with little clot of vein when he speak he voice rattle in he throat to such a degree that it make one wish to clear one 's own throat to listen to he so what with a pair of fat white hand and that hoarse voice and he swollen face and he thick lip a-stick out it appear to barnaby true he have never behold a countenance that pleased he so little but if sir john malyoe suit we hero 's taste so ill the granddaughter be in the same degree please to he she have a thin fair skin red lip and yellow hair -- though it be then powdered pretty white for the occasion -- and the bluest eye that ever he behold in all of he life a sweet timid creature who appear not to dare so much as to speak a word for herself without look to that great beast she grandfather for leave to do so for she would shrink and shudder whenever he would speak of a sudden to she or direct a glance upon she when she do pluck up sufficient courage to say anything it be in so low a voice that barnaby be oblige to bend he head to hear she and when she smile she would as like as not catch herself short and look up as though to see if she do amiss to be cheerful as for sir john he sit at dinner and gobble and eat and drink smack he lip all the while but with hardly a word of civility either to mr greenfield or to mr greenfield or to barnaby true but wear all the while a dull sullen air as though he would say you damned victuals and drink be no better than they should be but such as they be i must eat 'em or eat nothing it be only after dinner be over and the young lady and the two miss off in a corner together that barnaby hear she talk with any degree of ease then to be sure she tongue become loose enough and she prattle away at a great rate though hardly above she breath then of a sudden she grand-father call out in he hoarse rattle voice that it be time to go upon which she stop short in what she be say and jump up from she chair look as frighten as though he be go to strike she with that gold-headed cane of he that he always carry with he barnaby true and mr greenfield both go out to see the two into they coach where sir john 's man stand hold the lantern and who should he be to be sure but that same lean villain with bald head who have offer to shoot the captain of barnaby 's expedition out on the harbor that night for one of the circle of light shine up into he face barnaby true know he the moment he clap eye upon he though he could not have recognize we hero he grin at he in the most impudent familiar fashion and never so much as touch he hat either to he or to mr greenfield but as soon as he master and he young mistress have enter the coach bang to the door and scramble up on the seat alongside the driver and so away without a word but with another impudent grin this time favor both barnaby and the old gentleman such be sir john malyoe and he man and the ill opinion we hero conceive of they be only confirm by further observation the next day sir john malyoe 's travelling-case begin to come aboard the _ belle helen _ and in the afternoon that same lean villanous man-servant come skip across the gangplank as nimble as a goat with two black man behind he lug a great sea-chest what he cry out and so you be the supercargo be you why to be sure i think you be more account when i see you last night a-sitting talk with he honor like he equal well no matter say he ` tis something to have a brisk genteel young fellow for a supercargo so come my hearty lend a hand and help I set he honor 's cabin to rights what a speech be this to endure from such a fellow what with we hero 's distaste for the villain and what with such odious familiarity you may guess into what temper so impudent a address must have cast he say he you 'll find the steward in yonder and he 'll show you the cabin sir john be to occupy therewith he turn and walk away with prodigious dignity leave the other standing where he be as he go below to he own state-room he could not but see out of the tail of he eye that the fellow be still stand where he have leave he regard he with a most evil malevolent countenance so that he have the satisfaction of know that he have a enemy aboard for that voyage who be not very likely to forgive or forget what he must regard as so mortify a slight as that which barnaby have put upon he the next day sir john malyoe himself come aboard accompany by he granddaughter and follow by he man and he follow again by four black man who carry among they two trunk not large in size but vastly heavy in weight towards these two trunk sir john and he follower devote the utmost solicitude and care to see that they be properly carry into the cabin he be to occupy barnaby true be stand in the saloon as they pass close by he but though sir john look hard at he and straight in the face he never so much as speak a single word to we hero or show by a look or a sign that he have ever meet he before at this the serving-man who see it all with eye as quick as a cat 's fall to grin and chuckle to see barnaby in he turn so slight the young lady who also see it blush as red as fire and thereupon deliver a courtesy to poor barnaby with a most sweet and gracious affability there be besides sir john and the young lady but two other passenger who upon this occasion take the voyage to new york : the reverend simon style master of a flourish academy at spanish town and he wife this be a good worthy couple of a extremely quiet disposition say little or nothing but contented to sit in the great cabin by the hour together read in some book or other so what with the retire humor of the worthy pair and what with sir john malyoe 's fancy for stay all the time shut up in he own cabin with those two trunk he hold so precious it fall upon barnaby true in great part to show that attention to the young lady that the circumstance demand this he do with a great deal of satisfaction to himself -- as any one may suppose who consider a spirited young man of one-and-twenty year of age and a sweet and beautiful young miss of seventeen or eighteen throw thus together day after day for above two week accordingly the weather be very fair and the ship drive freely along before a fine breeze and they have no other occupation than to sit talk together all day gaze at the blue sea and the bright sky overhead it be not difficult to conceive of what be to befall but oh those day when a man be young and whether wisely or no fall into such a transport of passion as poor barnaby true suffer at that time how often during that voyage do we hero lie awake in he berth at night toss this way and that without find any refreshment of sleep -- perhaps all because she hand have touch he or because she have speak some word to he that have possess he with a ravishing disquietude all this might not have befall he have sir john malyoe look after he granddaughter instead of lock himself up day and night in he own cabin scarce venture out except to devour he food or maybe to take two or three turn across the deck before return again to the care of those chest he appear to hold so much more precious than he own flesh and blood nor be it to be suppose that barnaby would take the pain to consider what be to become of it all for what young man so situate as he but would be perfectly content to live so agreeably in a fool 's paradise satisfy himself by assign the whole affair to the future to take care of itself accordingly we hero endeavor and with pretty good success to put away from he whatever doubt might arise in he own mind concern what he be about satisfy himself with make he conversation as agreeable to he companion as it lay in he power to do so the affair continue until the end of the whole business come with a suddenness that promise for a time to cast we hero into the utmost depths of humiliation and despair at that time the _ belle helen _ be accord to captain manly 's reckoning compute that day at noon bearing about five-and-fifty league northeast-by-east off the harbor of charleston in south carolina nor be we hero likely to forget for many year afterwards even the smallest circumstance of that occasion he may remember that it be a mightily sweet balmy evening the sun not have set above half a hour before and the sky still suffuse with a good deal of brightness the air be extremely soft and mild he may remember with the utmost nicety how they be lean over the rail of the vessel look out towards the westward she fall mightily quiet as though occupy with very serious thought of a sudden she begin without any preface whatever to speak to barnaby about herself and she affair in a most confidential manner such as she have never use to he before she tell he that she and she grandfather be go to new york that they might take passage thence to boston in massachusett where they be to meet she cousin captain malyoe who be station in garrison at that place continue she say that captain malyoe be the next heir to the devonshire estate and that she and he be to be marry in the fall you may conceive into what a confusion of distress such a confession as this deliver so suddenly must have cast poor barnaby he could answer she not a single word but stand stare in another direction than hers endeavor to compose himself into some equanimity of spirit for indeed it be a sudden terrible blow and he breath come as hot and dry as ash in he throat meanwhile the young lady go on to say though in a mightily constrain voice that she have like he from the very first moment she have see he and have be very happy for these day she have pass in he society and that she would always think of he as a dear friend who have be very kind to she who have so little pleasure in she life at last barnaby make shift to say though in a hoarse and croaking voice that captain malyoe must be a very happy man and that if he be in captain malyoe 's place he would be the happiest man in the world thereupon have so find he voice he go on to tell she though in a prodigious confusion and perturbation of spirit that he too love she and that what she have tell he strike he to the heart and make he the most miserable unhappy wretch in the whole world she exhibit no anger at what he say nor do she turn to look at he but only reply in a low voice that he should not talk so for that it could only be a pain to they both to speak of such thing and that whether she would or no she must do everything she grandfather bid she he be indeed a terrible man to this poor barnaby could only repeat that he love she with all he heart that he have hope for nothing in he love but that he be now the most miserable man in the world it be at this moment so momentous to we hero that some one who have be hide unseen nigh they for all the while suddenly move away and barnaby in spite of the gathering darkness could perceive that it be that villain man-servant of sir john malyoe 's nor could he but know that the wretch must have overhear all that have be say as he look he behold this fellow go straight to the great cabin where he disappear with a cunning leer upon he face so that we hero could not but be aware that the purpose of the eavesdropper must be to communicate all that he have overhear to he master at this think the last drop of bitterness be add to he trouble for what could be more distressing to any man of honor than to possess the consciousness that such a wretch should have overhear so sacred a conversation as that which he have enjoy with the young lady she upon she part could not have be aware that the man have listen to what she have be say for she still continue lean over the rail and barnaby remain standing by she side without move but so distract by a tumult of many passion that he know not how or where to look after a pretty long time of this silence the young lady look up to see why she companion have not speak for so great a while and at that very moment sir john malyoe come fling out of the cabin without he hat but carry he gold-headed cane he run straight across the deck towards where barnaby and the young lady stand swing he cane this way and that with a most furious and threatening countenance while the informer grin like a ape follow close at he heel as sir john approach they he cry out in so loud a voice that all on deck might have hear he you hussy -lrb- and all the time you be to remember he be swing he cane as though he would have strike the young lady who upon she part shrink back from he almost upon the deck as though to escape such a blow -rrb- you hussy what do you do here talk with a misbred yankee supercargo not fit for a gentlewoman to wipe she foot upon and you stand there and listen to he fool talk go to you room you hussy -- only 'twa something worse he call she this time -- before i lay this cane across you you may suppose into what fury such word as these speak in barnaby 's hearing not to mention that vile slur set upon himself must have cast we hero to be sure he scarcely know what he do but he put he hand against sir john malyoe 's breast and thrust he back most violently cry out upon he at the same time for daring so to threaten a young lady and that for a farthing he would wrench the stick out of he hand and throw it overboard a little farther and sir john would have fall flat upon the deck with the push barnaby give he but he contrived by catch hold of the rail to save he balance whereupon have recover himself he come run at we hero like a wild beast whirling he cane about and i do believe would have strike he -lrb- and god know then what might have happen -rrb- have not he man-servant catch he and hold he back keep back cry out we hero still mighty hoarse keep back if you strike I with that stick i 'll fling you overboard by this time what with the sound of loud voice and the stamp of foot some of the crew and other aboard be hurry up to the scene of action at the same time captain manly and the first mate mr freesden come run out of the cabin as for we hero have get set agoing he be not to be stop so easily and who be you anyhow he cry he voice mightily hoarse even in he own ear to threaten to strike I you may be a bloody pirate and you may shoot a man from behind as you shoot poor captain brand on the cobra river but you will not dare strike I face to face i know who you be and what you be as for sir john malyoe have he be strike of a sudden by palsy he could not have stop more dead short in he attack upon we hero there he stand he great bulge eye stare like those of a fish he face as purple as a cherry as for master informer barnaby have the satisfaction of see that he have stop he grinning by now and be hold he master 's arm as though to restrain he from any further act of violence by this time captain manly have come bustling up and demand to know what all the disturbance mean whereupon we hero cry out still in the extremity of passion : the villain insult I and insult the young lady he threaten to strike I with he cane but he sha 'n' t strike I i know who he be and what he be i know what he be get in he cabin in those two trunk and i know where he find it and whom it belong to at this captain manly clap he hand upon we hero 's shoulder and fall to shake he so that he could hardly stand cry out to he the while to be silent say he : how do you dare a officer of this ship to quarrel with a passenger of mine go straight to you cabin and stay there till i give you leave to come out again at this master barnaby come somewhat back to himself but he threaten to strike I with he cane he say and that i will not stand from any man no matter for that say captain manly very sternly go to you cabin as i bid you and stay there till i tell you to come out again and when we get to new york i 'll take pain to inform you step-father of how you have behave i 'll have no such rioting as this aboard my ship by this time as you may suppose the young lady be go as for sir john malyoe he stand in the light of a lantern he face that have be so red now go as white as ash and if a look could kill to be sure he would have destroy barnaby true where he stand it be thus that the event of that memorable day come to a conclusion how little do any of the actor of the scene suspect that a portentous fate be overhang they and be so soon to transform all they present circumstance into other that be to be perfectly different and how little do we hero suspect what be in store for he upon the morrow as with hang head he go to he cabin and shut the door upon himself and fling himself down upon he berth there yield himself over to the profoundest depths of humiliation and despair v from he melancholy meditation barnaby by-and-by and in spite of himself begin drop off into a loose slumber disturb by extravagant dream of all sort in which sir john malyoe play some important and malignant part from one of these dream he be arouse to meet a new and startling fate by hear the sudden and violent explosion of a pistol-shot ring out as though in he ear this be follow immediately by the sound of several other shot exchange in rapid succession as come from the deck above at the same instant a blow of such excessive violence shake the _ belle helen _ that the vessel heel over before it and barnaby be at once aware that another craft -- whether by accident or with intention he do not know -- must have run afoul of they upon this point and as to whether or not the collision be design he be however not leave a moment in doubt for even as the _ belle helen _ right to she true keel there be the sound of many footstep run across the deck and down into the great cabin then proceed a prodigious uproar of voice together with the struggle of man 's body be toss about striking violently against the partition and bulkhead at the same instant arise a scream of woman 's voice and one voice that of sir john malyoe cry out as in the greatest extremity : you villain you damned villain and with that the sudden detonation of a pistol fire into the close space of the great cabin long before this time barnaby be out in the middle of he own cabin take only sufficient time to snatch down one of the pistol that hang at the head of he berth he fling out into the great cabin to find it as black as night the lantern sling there have be either blow out or dash out into darkness all be as black as coal and the gloom be fill with a hubbub of uproar and confusion above which sound continually the shrieking of woman 's voice nor have we hero take above a couple of step before he pitch headlong over two or three man struggle together upon the deck fall with a great clatter and the loss of he pistol which however he regain almost immediately what all the uproar portend he could only guess but presently hear captain manly 's voice call out you bloody pirate would you choke I to death he become immediately aware of what have befall the _ belle helen _ and that they have be attack by some of those buccaneer who at that time infested the water of america in prodigious number it be with this think in he mind that look towards the companionway he behold outline against the darkness of the night without the form of a man 's figure standing still and motionless as a statue in the midst of all this tumult and thereupon as by some instinct know that that must be the master-maker of all this devil 's brew therewith still kneel upon the deck he cover the bosom of that figure point-blank as he suppose with he pistol and instantly pull the trigger in the light of the pistol fire barnaby have only sufficient opportunity to distinguish a flat face wear a large pair of mustachio a cocked hat trim with gold lace a red scarf and brass button then the darkness very thick and black again swallow everything but if we hero fail to clearly perceive the countenance towards which he have discharge he weapon there be one who appear to have recognize some likeness in it for sir john malyoe 's voice almost at barnaby 's elbow cry out thrice in loud and violent tone william brand william brand william brand and thereat come the sound of some heavy body fall down upon the deck this be the last that we hero may remember of that notable attack for the next moment whether by accident or design he never know he feel himself strike so terrible a blow upon the side of the head that he instantly swoon dead away and know no more vi when barnaby true come back to he sens again it be to become aware that he be be care for with great skill and nicety that he head have be bath with cold water and that a bandage be be bind about it as carefully as though a chirurgeon be attend to he he have be half conscious of people about he but could not immediately recall what have happen to he nor until he have open he eye to find himself in a perfectly strange cabin of narrow dimension but extremely well fitted and paint with white and gold by the light of a lantern shine in he eye together with the gray of the early day through the deadlight he could perceive that two man be bend over he -- one a negro in a striped shirt with a yellow handkerchief around he head and silver ear-ring in he ear the other a white man clothe in a strange outlandish dress of a foreign make with great mustachio hang down below he chin and with gold ear-ring in he ear it be this last who be attend to barnaby 's hurt with such extreme care and gentleness all this barnaby see with he first clear consciousness after he swoon then remember what have befall he and he head beat as though it would split asunder he shut he eye again contrive with great effort to keep himself from groan aloud and wonder as to what sort of pirate these could be who would first knock a man in the head so terrible a blow as that which he have suffer and then take such care to fetch he back to life again and to make he easy and comfortable nor do he open he eye again but lay there marvel thus until the bandage be properly tie about he head and sew together then once more he open he eye and look up to ask where he be upon hear he speak he attendant show excessive sign of joy nod they head and smile at he as though to reassure he but either because they do not choose to reply or else because they could not speak english they make no answer excepting by those sign and gesture the white man however make several motion that we hero be to arise and still grin and nod he head point as though towards a saloon beyond at the same time the negro hold up we hero 's coat and beckon for he to put it on accordingly barnaby see that it be require of he to quit the place in which he then lay arise though with a good deal of effort and permit the negro to help he on with he coat though feeling mightily dizzy and much put about to keep upon he leg -- he head beat fit to split asunder and the vessel rolling and pitch at a great rate as though upon a heavy cross-sea so still sick and dizzy he go out into what he find be indeed a fine saloon beyond paint in white and gilt like the cabin he have just quit this saloon be fit in the most excellent taste imaginable a table extend the length of the room and a quantity of bottle and glass clear as crystal be arrange in row in a hang rack above but what most attract we hero 's attention be a man sit with he back to he he figure clothe in a rough pea-jacket and with a red handkerchief tie around he throat he foot be stretch under the table out before he and he be smoke a pipe of tobacco with all the ease and comfort imaginable as barnaby come in he turn round and to the profound astonishment of we hero present to he in the light of the lantern the dawn shine pretty strong through the skylight the face of that very man who have conduct the mysterious expedition that night across kingston harbor to the cobra river vii this man look steadily at barnaby true for above half a minute and then burst out a-laughing and indeed barnaby standing there with the bandage about he head must have look a very droll picture of that astonishment he feel so profoundly at finding who be this pirate into whose hand he have fall well say the other and so you be up at last and no great harm do i 'll be bind and how do you head feel by now my young master to this barnaby make no reply but what with wonder and the dizziness of he head seat himself at the table over against he interlocutor who push a bottle of rum towards he together with a glass from the hang rack he watch barnaby fill he glass and so soon as he have do so begin immediately by say : i do suppose you think you be treat mightily ill to be so handle last night well so you be treat ill enough though who hit you that crack upon the head i know no more than a child unborn well i be sorry for the way you be handle but there be this much to say and of that you may feel well assure that nothing be mean to you but kindness and before you be through with we all you will believe that without my have to tell you so here he help himself to a taste of grog and sucking in he lip go on again with what he have to say do you remember say he that expedition of ours in kingston harbor and how we be all of we balk that night then without wait for barnaby 's reply : and do you remember what i say to that villain jack malyoe that night as he boat go by we i say to he ` jack malyoe ' say i ` you have get the better of we once again but next time it will be we turn even if william brand himself have to come back from the grave to settle with you ' i remember something of the sort say barnaby but i profess i be all in the dark as to what you be drive at at this the other burst out in a great fit of laugh very well then say he this night 's work be only the ending of what be so ill begin there look yonder -- point to a corner of the cabin -- and then maybe you will be in the dark no longer barnaby turn he head and there behold in the corner of the saloon those very two travelling-case that sir john malyoe have be so particular to keep in he cabin and under he own eye through all the voyage from jamaica i 'll show you what be in 'em say the other and thereupon arise and barnaby with he and so go over to where the two travelling-case stand we hero have a strong enough suspicion as to what the case contain but lord what be suspicion to what he two eye behold when that man lift the lid of one of they -- the lock thereof have already be force -- and fling it back display to barnaby 's astonished and bedazzled sight a great treasure of gold and silver some of it tie up in leathern bag to be sure but so many of the coin big and little yellow and white lie loose in the case as to make we hero think that a great part of the treasure of the indy lay there before he well and what do you think of that say the other be it not enough for a man to turn pirate for and thereupon burst out a-laughing and clap down the lid again then suddenly turn serious : come master barnaby say he i be to have some very sober talk with you so fill up you glass again and then we will heave at it nor even in after year nor in the light of that which afterwards occur could barnaby repeat all that be say to he upon that occasion for what with the pound and beat of he ache head and what with the wonder of what he have see he be altogether in the dark as to the greater part of what the other tell he that other begin by say that barnaby instead of be sorry that he be william brand 's grandson might thank god for it that he -lrb- barnaby -rrb- have be watch and care for for twenty year in more way than he would ever know that sir john malyoe have be watch also for all that while and that it be a vastly strange thing that sir john malyoe 's debt in england and barnaby 's come of age should have bring they so together in jamaica -- though after all it be all for the best as barnaby himself should presently see and thank god for that also for now all the debt against that villain jack malyoe be settle in full principal and interest to the last penny and barnaby be to enjoy it the most of all here the fellow take a very comfortable sip of he grog and then go on to say with a very cunning and know wink of the eye that barnaby be not the only passenger aboard but that there be another in whose company he would be glad enough no doubt to finish the balance of the voyage he be now upon so now if barnaby be sufficiently compose he should be introduce to that other passenger thereupon without wait for a reply he incontinently arise and put away the bottle of rum and the glass go across the saloon -- barnaby watch he all the while like a man in a dream -- and open the door of a cabin like that which barnaby have occupy a little while before he be go only for a moment for almost immediately he come out again usher a lady before he by now the daylight in the cabin be grow strong and clear so that the light shine full upon she face barnaby true know she the instant she appear it be miss marjorie malyoe very white but strangely compose show no terror either in she countenance or in she expression \* \* \* \* \* it would not be possible for the writer to give any clear idea of the circumstance of the day that immediately follow and which within a week bring barnaby true and the enchant object of he affection at once to the ending of they voyage and of all these marvellous adventure for when in after time we hero would endeavor to revive a memory of the several occurrence that then transpire they all appear as though in a dream or a bewitching phantasm all that he could recall be long day of delicious enjoyment follow by night of dream but how enchant those day how exquisite the distraction of those night upon occasion he and he charmer might sit together under the shade of the sail for a hour at a stretch he hold she hand in he and neither say a single word though at time the transport of poor barnaby 's emotion would go far to suffocate he with they rapture as for she face at such moment it appear sometimes to assume a transparency as though of a light shine from behind she countenance the vessel in which they find themselves be a brigantine of good size and build but man by a considerable crew the most strange and outlandish in they appearance that barnaby have ever behold for some be white some be yellow and some be black and all be trick out with gay color and gold ear-ring in they ear and some with long mustachio and other with handkerchief tie around they head and all these speak together a jargon of which barnaby true could not understand a single word but which might have be portuguese from one or two phrase he afterwards remember nor do this outlandish crew of god know what sort of man address any of they conversation either to barnaby or to the young lady they might now and then have look at he and she out of the corner of they yellow eye but that be all otherwise they be indeed like the creature of a dream only he who be commander of this strange craft when he would come down into the saloon to mix a glass of grog or to light a pipe of tobacco would maybe favor barnaby with a few word concern the weather or something of the sort and then to go on deck again about he business indeed it may be affirm with pretty easy security that no such adventure as this ever happen before for here be these two innocent young creature upon board of a craft that no one under such circumstance as those recount above could doubt be a pirate or buccaneer the crew whereof have see no one know what wicked deed yet they two as remote from all that and as profoundly occupy with the transport of they passion and as innocent in they satisfaction thereof as be corydon and phylli beside they purling stream and flowery mead with nymph and satyr caracole about they viii it be probable that the polite reader of this veracious narrative instead of consider it as the effort of the author to set before he a sober and well-digested history have be all this while amusing himself by regard it only as a fanciful tale design for he entertainment if this be so the writer may hardly hope to convince he that what be to follow be a serious narrative of that which though never so ingenuous in its recapitulation be a altogether inexplicable phenomenon accordingly it be with extraordinary hesitation that the scribe now invite the confidence of he reader in the succinct truth of that which he have to relate it be in brief as follow : that upon the last night of this part of he voyage barnaby true be awaken from slumber by flash of lightning shine into he cabin and by the loud peal of approach thunder at the same time observe the sound of footstep move back and forth as in great agitation overhead and the loud shouting of order he become aware that a violent squall of wind must be approach the vessel be convince of this he arise from he berth dress quickly and hurry upon deck where he find a great confusion of man run hither and thither and scramble up and down the rig like monkey while the captain and one whom he have come to know as the captain 's mate be shout out order in a strange foreign jargon a storm be indeed approach with great rapidity a prodigious circle of rain and cloud whirling overhead like smoke while the lightning every now and then flash with intense brightness follow by loud peal of thunder by these flash of lightning barnaby observe that they have make land during the night for in the sudden glare of bright light he behold a mountainous headland and a long strip of sandy beach stand out against the blackness of the night beyond so much he be able to distinguish though what coast it might be he could not tell for presently another flash fall from the sky he see that the shore be shut out by the approach downfall of rain this rain come presently streaming down upon they with a great gust of wind and a deal of white foam across the water this violent gale of wind suddenly strike the vessel careen it to one side so that for a moment it be with much ado that he be able to keep he foot at all indeed what with the noise of the tempest through the rigging and the flash of lightning and the peal of the thunder and the clapping of a unfurled sail in the darkness and the shouting of order in a strange language by the captain of the craft who be run up and down like a bedlamite it be like pandemonium with all the devil of the pit break loose into the night it be at this moment and barnaby true be hold to the back-stay when a sudden prolonged flash of lightning come after a continued space of darkness so sharp and heavy be this shaft that for a moment the night be as bright as day and in that instant occur that which be so remarkable that it have afford the title of this story itself for there stand plain upon the deck and not far from the companionway as though he have just come up from below we hero behold a figure the face of which he have see so imperfectly once before by the flash of he own pistol in the darkness upon this occasion however the whole figure be stamp out with intense sharpness against the darkness and barnaby behold as clear as day a great burly man clothe in a tawdry tinsel coat with a cocked hat with gold braid upon he head he leg with petticoat breeches and case in great leathern sea-boot pull up to he knee stand plant wide apart as though to brace against the slant of the deck the face we hero behold to be as white as dough with fishy eye and a bony forehead on the side of which be a great smear as of blood all this as be say stand out as sharp and clear as daylight in that one flash of lightning and then upon the instant be go again as though swallow up into the darkness while a terrible clap of thunder seem to split the very heaven overhead and a strong smell as of brimstone fill the air around about at the same moment some voice cry out from the darkness william brand by god then the rain clap down in a deluge barnaby leap into the saloon pursue by he know not what thought for if that be indeed the image of old william brand that he have see once before and now again then the grave must indeed have gape and vomit out its dead into the storm of wind and lightning for what he behold that moment he have ever aver he see as clear as ever he see he hand before he face this be the last account of which there be any record when the figure of captain william brand be behold by the eye of a living man it must have occur just off the highland below the sandy hook for the next morning when barnaby true come upon deck it be to find the sun shine brightly and the brigantine ride upon a even keel at anchor off staten island three or four cable-length distance from a small village on the shore and the town of new york in plain sight across the water 'twa the last place in the world he have expect to see ix and indeed it do seem vastly strange to lie there alongside staten island all that day with new york town in plain sight across the water and yet so impossible to reach for whether he desire to escape or no barnaby true could not but observe that both he and the young lady be so closely watch that they might as well have be prisoner tie hand and foot and lay in the hold so far as any hope of get away be concern throughout that day there be a vast deal of mysterious come and go aboard the brigantine and in the afternoon a sail-boat go up to the town carry the captain of the brigantine and a great load in the stern cover over with a tarpaulin what be so take up to the town barnaby do not then guess nor do he for a moment suspect of what vast importance it be to be for he about sundown the small boat return fetch the pirate captain of the brigantine back again come aboard and find barnaby on deck the other request he to come down into the saloon for he have a few serious word to say to he in the saloon they find the young lady sit the broad light of the evening shine in through the skylight and make it all pretty bright within the captain command barnaby to be seat whereupon he choose a place alongside the young lady so soon as he have compose himself the captain begin very seriously with a preface somewhat thus : though you may think I the captain of this brigantine master barnaby true i be not really so but be under order of a superior whom i have obey in all these thing that i have do have say so much as this he continue he address to say that there be one thing yet remain for he to do and that the greatest thing of all he say that this be something that both barnaby and the young lady be to be call upon to perform and he hope that they would do they part willingly but that whether they do it willingly or no do it they must for those also be the order he have receive you may guess how we hero be disturb by this prologue he have find the young lady 's hand beneath the table and he now hold it very closely in he own but whatever might have be he expectation as to the final purport of the communication the other be about to favor he with he most extreme expectation could not have equal that which be demand of he my order be these say he interlocutor continue : i be to take you and the young lady ashore and to see that you be marry before i quit you and to that end a very good decent honest minister who live ashore yonder in the village be choose and have be speak to and be now no doubt wait for you to come that be the last thing i be set to do so now i will leave you and she young ladyship alone together for five minute to talk it over but be quick about it for whether willing or not this thing must be do thereupon he incontinently go away as he have promise leave those two alone together we hero like one turn into stone and the young lady she face turn away as red as fire as barnaby could easily distinguish by the fading light nor can i tell what barnaby say to she nor what word or argument he use for so great be the distraction of he mind and the tumult of he emotion that he presently discover that he be repeat to she over and over again that god know he love she and that with all he heart and soul and that there be nothing in all the world for he but she after which contain himself sufficiently to continue he address he tell she that if she would not have it as the man have say and if she be not willing to marry he as she be bid to do he would rather die a thousand aye ten thousand death than lend himself to force she to do such a thing as this nevertheless he tell she she must speak up and tell he yes or no and that god know he would give all the world if she would say yes all this and much more he say in such a tumult that he be hardly aware of what he be speak and she sit there as though she breath stifle she nor do he know what she reply to he only that she would marry he therewith he take she into he arm and for the first time set he lip to hers in such a transport of ecstasy that everything seem to he sight as though he be about to swoon so when the captain return to the saloon he find barnaby sit there hold she hand she with she face turn away and he so full of joy that the promise of heaven could not have make he happier the yawl-boat belong to the brigantine be ready and wait alongside when they come upon deck and immediately they descend to it and take they seat reach the shore they land and walk up the village street in the twilight she cling to we hero 's arm as though she would faint away the captain of the brigantine and two other man aboard accompany they to the minister 's house where they find the good man wait for they smoke he pipe in the warm evening and walk up and down in front of he own door he immediately conduct they into the house where he wife have fetch a candle and two other from the village be present the good pious man have ask several question as to they name and they age and where they be from and have add he blessing the ceremony be perform and the certificate duly sign by those present from the village -- the man who have come ashore from the brigantine alone refuse to set they hand to any paper the same sail-boat that have take the captain up to the town be wait for barnaby and the young lady as they come down to the landing-place there the captain of the brigantine have wish they godspeed and have shake barnaby very heartily by the hand he help to push off the boat which with the slant of the wind presently sail swiftly away drop the shore and those strange being and the brigantine in which they sail alike behind they into the night they could hear through the darkness the creaking of the sail be hoist aboard of the pirate vessel nor do barnaby true ever set eye upon it or the crew again nor so far as the writer be inform do anybody else x it be nigh midnight when they make mr hartright 's wharf at the foot of beaver street there barnaby and the boatman assist the young lady ashore and we hero and she walk up through the now silent and desert street to mr hartright 's house you may conceive of the wonder and amazement of we hero 's dear step-father when arouse by barnaby 's continued knock at the street door and clothe in a dressing-gown and carry a light candle in he hand he unlock and unbar the door and so see who it be have arouse he at such a hour of the night and behold the young and beautiful lady whom barnaby have bring home with he the first thought of the good man be that the _ belle helen _ have come into port nor do barnaby undeceive he as he lead the way into the house but wait until they be all safe and sound together before he should unfold he strange and wonderful story this be leave for you by two foreign sailor this afternoon barnaby the good man say as he lead the way through the hall hold up the candle at the same time so that barnaby might see a object that stand against the wainscoting by the door of the dining-room it be with difficulty that we hero could believe he eye when he behold one of the treasure-chest that sir john malyoe have fetch with such particularity from jamaica he bid he step-father hold the light nigher and then he mother have come down-stair by this time he fling back the lid and display to the dazzle sight of all the great treasure therein contain you be to suppose that there be no sleep for any of they that night for what with barnaby 's narrative of he adventure and what with the thousand question ask of he it be broad daylight before he have finish the half of all that he have to relate the next day but one bring the _ belle helen _ herself into port with the terrible news not only of have be attack at night by pirate but also that sir john malyoe be dead for whether it be the sudden fright that overset he or whether it be the strain of passion that burst some blood-vessel upon he brain it be certain that when the pirate quit the _ belle helen _ carry with they the young lady and barnaby and the travelling-trunk they leave sir john malyoe lie in a fit upon the floor frothing at the mouth and black in the face as though he have be choke it be in this condition that he be raise and take to he berth where the next morning about two o'clock he die without once have open he eye or speak a single word as for the villain man-servant no one ever see he afterwards though whether he jump overboard or whether the pirate who so attack the ship have carry he away bodily who shall say mr hartright have be extremely perplexed as to the ownership of the chest of treasure that have be leave by those man for barnaby but the news of the death of sir john malyoe make the matter very easy for he to decide for surely if that treasure do not belong to barnaby there could be no doubt but that it belong to he wife -- she be sir john malyoe 's legal heir thus it be that he satisfy himself and thus that great fortune -lrb- in actual computation amount to upward of sixty-three thousand pound -rrb- fall to barnaby true the grandson of that famous pirate william brand as for the other case of treasure it be never hear of again nor could barnaby decide whether it be divide as booty among the pirate or whether they have carry it away with they to some strange and foreign land there to share it among themselves it be thus we reach the conclusion of we history with only this to observe that whether that strange appearance of captain brand be indeed a ghostly and spiritual visitation or whether he be present on those two occasion in flesh and blood he be as have be say never hear of again iv a true history of the devil at new hope _ at the time of the beginning of the event about to be narrate -- which the reader be to be inform occur between the year 1740 and 1742 -- there stand upon the high and rugged crest of pick-a-neck-a-sock point -lrb- or pig and sow point as it have come to be call -rrb- the wooden ruin of a disused church know throughout those part as the old free grace meeting-house _ _ this humble edifice have be erect by a peculiar religious sect call themselves the free grace believer the radical tenet of whose creed be a denial of the existence of such a place as hell and a affirmation of the universal mercy of god to the intent that all soul should enjoy eternal happiness in the life to come _ _ for this dangerous heresy the free grace believer be expel from the massachusett colony and after sundry peregrination settle at last in the providence plantation upon pick-a-neck-a-sock point coadjacent to the town of new hope there they build themselves a small cluster of hut and a church wherein to worship and there for a while they dwell earn a precarious livelihood from the ungenerous soil upon which they have establish themselves _ _ as may be suppose the presence of so strange a people be entertain with no great degree of complaisance by the vicinage and at last a old deed grant pick-a-neck-a-sock to captain isaiah applebody be revive by the heir of that renowned indian-fighter whereupon the free grace believer be warn to leave they bleak and rocky refuge for some other abiding-place accordingly drive forth into the world again they embark in the snow -lrb- 1 -rrb- good companion of bristol for the province of pennsylvanium and be afterwards hear of no more in those part they vacate house crumble away into ruin and they church totter to decay _ -lrb- footnote 1 : a two-masted square-rigged vessel -rrb- _ so at the beginning of these event upon the narrative of which the author now invite the reader to embark together with himself _ i how the devil haunt the meeting-house at the period of this narrative the settlement of new hope have grow into a very considerable seaport town do a extremely handsome trade with the west indy in cornmeal and dry codfish for sugar molasses and rum among the more important citizen of this now wealthy and elegant community the most notable be colonel william belford -- a magnate at once distinguish and honor in the civil and military affair of the colony this gentleman be a illegitimate son of the earl of clandennie by the daughter of a surgeon of the sixty-seventh regiment of scot and he have inherit a very considerable fortune upon the death of he father from which he now enjoy a comfortable competency we colonel make no little virtue of the circumstance of he exalted birth he be wont to address he father 's memory with a sobriety that lend to the fact of he illegitimacy a portentous air of seriousness and he make no secret of the fact that he be the friend and the confidential correspondent of the present earl of clandennie in he intercourse with the several colonial governor he assume a attitude of authority that only he lineage could have support he in maintain and possess a large and commanding presence he bear himself with a continent reserve that never fail to inspire with awe those whom he see fit to favor with he conversation this noble and distinguished gentleman possess in a brother a exact and perfect opposite to himself captain obadiah belford be a west indian a inhabitant of kingston in the island of jamaica he be a cursing swearing hard-drinking renegado from virtue a acknowledged dealer in negro slave and repute to have be a buccaneer if not a out-and-out pirate such as then infested those tropical latitudes in prodigious number he be not unknown in new hope which he have visit upon several occasion for a week or so at a time during each period he lodge with he brother whose household he scandalize by such freak as smoke he pipe of tobacco in the parlor offering questionable pleasantry to the female servant and cursing and swearing in the hallway with a fecundity and a ingenuity that would have put the most godless sailor about the dock to the blush accordingly it may then be suppose into what a dismay it throw colonel belford when one fine day he receive a letter from captain obadiah in which we west indian desperado inform he brother that he propose quit those torrid latitudes in which he have live for so long a time and that he intend thenceforth to make he home in new hope address colonel belford as my dear billy he call upon that gentleman to rejoice at this determination and inform he that he propose in future to live as decent a limb of grace as ever break loose from hell and add that he be go to fetch as a present for he niece belinda a dam pirty little black girl to carry she prayer-book to church for she accordingly one fine morning in pursuance of this promise we west indian suddenly appear at new hope with a prodigious quantity of chest and travelling-case and with so vociferous a acclamation that all the town know of he arrival within a half-hour of that event when however he present himself before colonel belford it be to meet with a welcome so frigid and a address so reserve that a douche of cold water could not have quench he verbosity more entirely for we great man have no notion to submit to the continue infliction of the west indian 's presence accordingly after the first word of greet have pass he address captain obadiah in a strain somewhat after this fashion : indeed i protest my dear brother obadiah it be with the heartiest regret in the world that i find myself oblige to confess that i can not offer you a home with myself and my family it be not alone that you manners displease I -- though as a elder to a younger i may say to you that we of these more northern latitudes do not entertain the same taste in such particulars as doubtless obtain in the west indy -- but the habit of my household be of such a nature that i could not hope to form they to you liking i can however offer as my advice that you may find lodgings at the blue lion tavern which doubtless will be of a sort exactly to fit you inclination i have make inquiry and i be sure you will find the very best apartment to be obtain at that excellent hostelry place at you disposal to this astounding address we west indian could for a moment make no other immediate reply than to open he eye and to glare upon colonel belford so that what with he tall lean person he long neck he stoop shoulder and he yellow face stain upon one side a indigo blue by some premature explosion of gunpowder -- what with all this and a prodigious hooked beak of a nose he exactly resemble some hungry predatory bird of prey meditate a pounce upon a unsuspecting victim at last find he voice and rap the ferrule of he ivory-headed cane upon the floor to emphasize he declamation he cry out : what what what be this the way to offer a welcome to a brother new return to you house why -- -- who be you be not i you brother who could buy you out twice over and have enough leave to live in velvet why why -- very well then have it you own way but if i do not grind you face into the mud and roll you into the dirt my name be not obadiah belford thereupon strive to say more but find no fit word for the occasion he swing upon he heel and incontinently depart bang the door behind he like a clap of thunder and cursing and swearing so prodigiously as he stride away down the street that a infernal from the pit could scarcely have exceed the fury of he malediction however he so far follow colonel belford 's advice that he take up he lodgings at the blue lion tavern where in a little while he have gather about he a court of all such as choose to take advantage of he extravagant bounty indeed he pour out he money with incredible profusion declare with many ingenious and self-consuming oath that he could match fortune with the best two man in new hope and then have enough leave to buy up he brother from he hair to he boot-leather he make no secret of the rebuff he have sustain from colonel belford for he grievance cling to he like hot pitch -- itch the more he meddle with it sometimes he fury be such that he could scarcely contain himself upon such occasion cursing and swearing like a infernal he would call heaven to witness that he would live in new hope if for no other reason than to bring shame to he brother and he would declare again and again with incredible variety of expletive that he would grind he brother 's face into the dirt for he -lrb- illustration : he would shout opprobrious word after the other in the street -rrb- accordingly he set himself assiduously at work to tease and torment the good man with every petty and malicious trick he malevolence could invent he would shout opprobrious word after the other in the street to the entertainment of all who hear he he would parade up and down before colonel belford 's house singing obstreperous and unseemly song at the top of he voice he would even rattle the ferrule of he cane against the paling of the fence or throw a stone at madam belford 's cat in the wantonness of he malice meantime he have purchase a considerable tract of land embrace pig and sow point and include the old free grace meeting-house here he declare it be he intention to erect a house for himself that should put he brother 's wooden shed to shame accordingly he presently begin the erection of that edifice so considerable in size and occupy so command a situation that it be the admiration of all those part and be know to fame as belford 's palace this magnificent residence be build entirely of brick and captain obadiah make it a boast that the material therefor be bring all the way around from new york in flat in the erection of this elegant structure all the carpenter and mason in the vicinage be employ so that it grow up with a amazing rapidity meantime upon the site of the building rum and holland be keep upon draught for all comer so that the place be make the common resort and the scene for the orgy of all such of the common people as possess a taste for strong water many come from so far away as newport to enjoy we captain 's prodigality meantime he himself strut about the street in he red coat trim with gilt braid he hat cock upon one side of he bony head please himself with the belief that he be the object of universal admiration and swell with a vast and consummate self-satisfaction as he boast with strident voice and extravagant enunciation of the magnificence of the palace he be build at the same time have as he say shingle to spare he patch and repair the old free grace meeting-house so that its gray and hoary exterior while rejuvenate as to the roof and wall present in a little while a appearance as of a sudden eruption of bright yellow shingle upon its aged hide nor would we captain offer any other explanation for so odd a freak of fancy than to say that it please he to do as he choose with he own at last the great house have be complete and he himself have enter into it and furnish it to he satisfaction we captain presently begin entertain he friend therein with a profuseness of expenditure and a excess of extravagance that be the continue admiration of the whole colony in more part the guest whom captain obadiah thus receive with so lavish a indulgence be officer or government official from the garrison of newport or of boston with whom by some means or other he have scrape a acquaintance at time these gay gentleman would fairly take possession of the town parade up and down the street under conduct of they host stare lady out of countenance with the utmost coolness and effrontery and offering loud and critical remark concern all that they behold about they express they opinion with the greatest freedom and jocularity nor be the orgy at belford 's palace limit to such extravagance as gaming and dicing and drinking for sometimes the community would be scandalize by the presence of gayly dress and high-colored lady who come no one know whence to enjoy the conviviality at the great house on the hill and concern whom it please the respectable folk of new hope to entertain the gravest suspicion at first these thing raise such a smoke that nothing else be to be see but by-and-by other strange and singular circumstance begin to be speak of -- at first among the common people and then by other it begin to be whisper and then to be say that the old free grace meeting-house out on the point be haunt by the devil the first information concern this dreadful obsession arise from a fisherman who come into the harbor of a nightfall after a stormy day

remarkable manifestation this time as the itinerant most solemnly declare the meeting-house be not only see all alight but a bell be ring as a signal somewhere off across the darkness of the water where as he protest there suddenly appear a red star that blaze like a meteor with a surpassing brightness for a few seconds be presently swallow up into inky darkness again upon another occasion a fiddler return home after midnight from sprowle 's neck see the church alight have with a temerity inflamed by rum approach to a nearer distance whence lie in the grass he have he say at the stroke of midnight behold a multitude of figure emerge from the building cry most dolorously and then have hear a voice as of a lose spirit call aloud six-and-twenty all tell whereat the light in the church be instantly extinguish into a impenetrable darkness it be say that when captain obadiah himself be first apprise of the suspicion entertain of the demoniacal possession of the old meeting-house he have fix upon he venturesome informant so threatening and ominous a gaze that the other could move neither hand nor foot under the malignant fury of he observation then at last clear he countenance of its terror he have burst into a great loud laugh cry out : well what then why not you must know that the devil and i have be very good friend in time past i see a deal of he in the west indy and i must

put that in you pipe and smoke it these terrible word however extravagant be to be sure in the nature of a direct confirmation of the very worst suspicion that could have be entertain concern this dolorous affair but if any further doubt linger as to the significance of such malevolent rumor captain obadiah himself soon put a end to the same the reverend josiah pettibone be use of a Saturday to take supper at colonel belford 's elegant residence it be upon such a occasion and the reverend gentleman and he honor host be smoke a pipe of tobacco together in the library when there fall a loud

there in colonel belford 's library and then he would conclude : yes yes ` tis incredible and past all belief but if it be true in ever so little a part why then there be justice in this -- that the devil should take possession of the sanctuary of that very heresy that would not only have deny he the power that every other christian belief assign to he but would have destroy that infernal habitation that have be he dwelling-place for all eternity as for captain belford if he desire privacy for himself upon pig and sow point he have take the very best mean to prevent the curious from spy upon he there after nightfall ii how the devil steal the collector 's snuffbox lieutenant thoma goodhouse be the collector of custom in the town of new hope he be a character of no little notoriety in those part enjoy the reputation of be able to consume more pineapple rum with less effect upon he balance than any other man in the community he possess the voice of a stentor a short thick-set broad-shouldered person a face congest to a violent carnation and red hair of such a color as to add infinitely to the consuming fire of he countenance the custom office be a little white frame building with green shutter and overhang the water as though to topple into the tide here at any time of the day betwixt the hour of ten in the morning and of five in the afternoon the collector be to be find at he desk smoking he pipe of tobacco the while a thin phthisical clerk bent with unrelaxing assiduity over a multitude of account-book and papers accumulate before he for he post of collectorship of the royal custom lieutenant goodhouse be especially indebted to the patronage of colonel belford the worthy collector have some year before come to that gentleman with a write recommendation from the earl of clandennie of a very unusual sort it be the lieutenant 's good-fortune to save the life of the honorable frederick dunburne second son of the earl -- a wild rakish undisciplined youth much give to such mischievous enterprise as the twist off of door-knocker the beating of the watch and the carry away of tavern sign have be a very famous swimmer at eton the honorable frederick undertake while at the cowe to swim a certain considerable distance for a wager in the midst of this enterprise he be suddenly seize with a cramp and would inevitably have drown have not the lieutenant who happen in a boat close at hand leap overboard and rescue the young gentleman from the watery grave in which he be about to be engulf thus restore he once more to the arm of he grateful family for this fortunate act of rescue the earl of clandennie present to he son 's preserver a gold snuffbox fill with guinea and inscribe with the follow legend : to lieutenant thoma goodhouse who under the ruling of beneficent providence be the happy preserver of a beautiful and precious life of virtuous precocity this box be present by the father of he whom he save as a grateful acknowledgment of he service thoma monkhouse dunburne viscount of dunburne and earl of clandennie _ August 17 1752 _ have thus satisfy the immediate demand of he gratitude it be very possible that the earl of clandennie do not choose to assume so great a responsibility as the future of he son 's preserver entail nevertheless feel that something should be do for he he obtain for lieutenant goodhouse a passage to the america and write he a strong letter of recommendation to colonel belford that gentleman desire to please the legitimate head of he family use he influence so successfully that the lieutenant be presently grant the position of collector of custom in the place of captain maull who have lately decease the lieutenant somewhat to the surprise of he patron fill he new official position as collector not only with vigor but with a not unbecoming dignity he possess a infinite appreciation of the responsibility of he office and he be more jealous to collect every farthing of the royal duty than he would have be have those money be gather for he own emolument under the old collectorship of captain maull it be no unusual thing for a barraco of superfine holland a bolt of silk cloth or a keg of brandy to find its way into the house of some influential merchant or colonial dignitary but in no such manner be lieutenant goodhouse derelict in he duty he would have sacrifice he dearest friendship or he most precious attachment rather than fail in he duty to the crown in the intermission of he duty it might please he to relax into the softer humor of conviviality but at ten o'clock in the morning whatever he condition of sobriety he assume at once all the sterner panoply of a collector of the royal custom thus he set he virtue against he vice and strike a even balance between they when most unsteady upon he leg he most assert he integrity declare that not a gill or a thread come into he port without pay its duty and call heaven to witness that it have be he hand that have save the life of a noble young gentleman thereupon perhaps draw forth the gleam token of he prowess -- the gold snuffbox -- from he breeches-pocket and hold it tight in he brown and hairy fist he would first offer he interlocutor a pinch of rappee and would then call upon he to read the inscription engrave upon the lid of the case demand to know whether it matter a fig if a man do drink a drop too much now and then provide he collect every farthing of the royal revenue and have be the means of save the son of the earl of clandennie never for a instant upon such a occasion would he permit he precious box to quit he possession it be to he a emblem of those virtue that no one know but himself wherefore the more he misdoubt he own virtuousness the more valuable do the token of that rectitude become in he eye yes you may look at it he would say but damme if you shall handle it i would not he would cry let the devil himself take it out of my hand the talk concern the impious possession of the old free grace meeting-house be at its height when the official consciousness of the collector who be just then labor under he constitutional infirmity become suddenly seize with a irrepressible alarm he declare that he smoke something worse than the devil upon pig and sow point and protest that it be he opinion that captain obadiah be do a bit of free-trade upon he own account and that dutiable goods be be smuggle in at night under cover of these incredible story he register a vow seal it with the most solemn protestation and with a multiplicity of ingenious oath that only a mind stimulate by the heat of intoxication could have invent that he would make it he business upon the first occasion that offer to go down to pig and sow point and to discover for himself whether it be the devil or smuggler that have take possession of the old free grace meeting-house thereupon haul out he precious snuffbox and rap upon the lid he offer a pinch around then call attention to the inscription he demand to know whether a man who have behave so well upon that occasion have need to be afraid of a whole churchful of devil i would he cry offer the devil a pinch as i have offer it to you then i would bid he read this and tell I whether he dare to say that black be the white of my eye nor be those word a vain boast upon the collector 's part for before a week have pass it be report that there have be a renewal of manifestation at the old church the collector finding nobody with sufficient courage to accompany he himself enter into a small boat and row down alone to pig and sow point to investigate for he own satisfaction those appearance that so agitate the community it be dusk when the collector depart upon that memorable and solitary expedition and it be entirely dark before he have reach its conclusion he have take with he a bottle of extra reserve rum to drive as he declare the chill out of he bone accordingly it seem to he to be a surprisingly brief interval before he find himself float in he boat under the impenetrable shadow of the rocky promontory the profound and infinite gloom of night overhang he with a portentous darkness melting only into a liquid obscurity as it touch and dissolve into the stretch of water across the bay but above on the high and rugged shoulder of the point the collector with dull and swim vision behold a row of dim and lurid light whereupon collect he faculty he opine that the radiance he behold be emit from the window of the old free grace meeting-house have make fast he boat with a drunken gravity the collector walk directly though with uncertain step up the steep and rugged path towards that mysterious illumination now and then he stumble over the stone and cobble that lay in he way but he never quite lose he balance neither do he for a moment remit he drunken gravity so with a befuddle and obstinate perseverance he reach at last to the conclusion of he adventure and of he fate the old meeting-house be two story in height the lower story have be formerly use by the free grace believer as a place wherein to celebrate certain obscure mystery appertain to they belief the upper story devote to the more ordinary worship of they Sunday meeting be reach by a tall steep flight of step that lead from the ground to a covered porch which sheltered the doorway the collector pause only long enough to observe that the shutter of the lower story be tight shut and bar and that the dull and lurid light shone from the window above then he directly mount the step with a courage and a perfect assurance that can only be entirely enjoy by one in he peculiar condition of inebriety he pause to knock at the door and it appear to he that he knuckle have hardly fall upon the panel before the valve be fling suddenly open a indescribable and heavy odor fall upon he and for the moment overpower he sens and he find himself stand face to face with a figure prodigiously and portentously tall even at this unexpected apparition the collector lose possession of no part of he courage rather he stiffen himself to a more stubborn and obstinate resolution steadying himself for he address i know very well quoth he who you be you be the divil i dare say but damme if you shall do business here without pay you duty to king george i may drink a drop too much he cry but i collect my duty -- every farthing of 'em then draw forth he snuffbox he thrust it under the nose of the be to whom he speak take a pinch and read that he roar but do not handle it for i would not take all hell to let it out of my hand the be whom he address have stand for all this while as though bereft of speech and of movement but at these last word he appear to find he voice for he give forth a strident bellow of so dreadful and terrible a sort that the collector brave as he find himself step back a pace or two before it the next instant he be strike upon the wrist as though by a bolt of lightning and the snuffbox describe a yellow circle against the light of the door disappear into the darkness of the night beyond ere he could recover himself another blow smite he upon the breast and he fall headlong from the platform as through infinite space \* \* \* \* \* the next day the collector do not present himself at the office at he accustomed hour and the morning wear along without he appear at he desk by noon serious alarm begin to take possession of the community and about two o'clock the tide be then set out pretty strong mr tompkin the consumptive clerk and two sailor from the _ sarah goodrich _ then lie at mr hoppin 's wharf go down in a yawl-boat to learn if possible what have befall he they coast along the point for above a half-hour before they discover any vestige of the miss collector then at last they see he lie at a little distance upon a cobble strip of beach where judge from he position and from the way he have compose himself to rest he appear to have be overcome by liquor at this place mr tompkin put ashore and make the best of he way over the slippery stone expose at low water come at last to where he chief be lie the collector be repose with one arm over he eye as though to shelter they from the sun but as soon as mr tompkin have approach close enough to see he countenance he utter a great cry that be like a scream for by the blue and livid lip part at the corner to show the yellow tooth from the waxy whiteness of the fat and hairy hand -- in short from the appearance of the whole figure he be aware in a instant that the collector be dead he cry bring the two sailor run they with the utmost coolness imaginable turn the collector over but discover no mark of violence upon he till of a sudden one of they call attention to the fact that he neck be break upon this the other opine that he have fall among the rock and twist he neck the two mariner then make a investigation of he pocket the clerk standing by the while paralyze with horror he face the color of dough he scalp creep and he hand and finger twitch as though with the palsy for there be something indescribably dreadful in the spectacle of those live hand search into the dead 's pocket and he would freely have give a week 's pay if he have never embark upon the expedition for the recovery of he chief in the collector 's pocket they find a twist of tobacco a red bandanna handkerchief of violent color a purse meagrely fill with copper coin and silver piece a silver watch still tick with a loud and insistent iteration a piece of tar string and a clasp-knife the snuffbox which the lieutenant have regard with such prodigious pride as the one emblem of he otherwise dubious virtue be go iii the strange adventure of a young gentleman of quality the honorable frederick dunburne second son of the earl of clandennie have win some six hundred pound at cart at a single sit at pintzennellus 's embark with he two friend captain blessington and lord george fitzhope to conclude the night with a round of final dissipation in the more remote part of london accordingly they embark at york stair for the three crane ripe for any mischief upon the water the three young gentleman amuse themselves by shout and sing pause only now and then to discharge a broadside of raillery at the occupant of some other and pass boat all go very well for a while some of those in the pass boat laugh and railing in return other shout out angry reply at last they fall in with a broad-beamed flat-nosed dutch-appearing yawl-boat pull heavily up against the stream and load with a crew of half-drunken sailor just come into port in reply to the challenge of we young gentleman a man in the stern of the other boat who appear to be the captain of the crew -- a fellow as dunburne could indefinitely perceive by the dim light of the lanthorn and the faint illumination of the misty half-moon possess a great coarse red face and a bullet head surmount by a mildewed and mangy fur cap -- bawl out in reply that if they would only put they boat near enough for a minute or two he would give they a bellyful of something that would make they quiet for the rest of the night he add that he would ask for nothing better than to have the opportunity of beat dunburne 's head to a pudding and that he would give a crown to have the three of they within arm 's - reach for a minute upon this captain blessington swear that he should be immediately accommodate and therewith deliver a order to that effect to the waterman these obey so promptly that almost before dunburne be aware of what have happen the two boat be side by side with hardly a foot of space between the gunwale dunburne behold one of the waterman of he own boat knock down one of the crew of the other with the blade of a oar and then he himself be clutch by the collar in the grasp of the man with the fur cap he dunburne strike twice in the face and in the moonlight he see that he have start the blood to run down from he assailant 's nose but he blow produce no other effect than to call forth a volley of the most horrible oath that ever greet he ear thereupon the boat drift so far apart that we young gentleman be hale over the gunwale and soused in the cold water of the river the next moment some one strike he upon the head with a belaying-pin or a billet of wood a blow so crush that the darkness seem to split asunder with a prodigious flaming of light and a myriad of circle star which presently disappear into the profound and utter darkness of insensibility how long this swoon continue we young gentleman could never tell but when he regain so much of he consciousness as to be aware of the thing about he he behold himself to be confine in a room the wall whereof be yellow and greasy with dirt he himself have be lay upon a bed so foul and so displease to he taste that he could not but regret the swoon from which he have emerge into consciousness look down at he person he behold that he clothes have all be take away from he and that he be now clothe in a shirt with only one sleeve and a pair of breeches so tattered that they barely cover he nakedness while he lay thus dismally depress by so sad a pickle as that into which he find himself plunge he be strongly and painfully aware of a uproarious babble of loud and drunken voice and a continual clinking of glass which appear to sound as from a tap-room beneath these commingle now and then with oath and scrap of discordant song bellow out above the hubbub he wounded head beat with tremendous and strain painfulness as though it would burst asunder and he be possess by a burning thirst that seem to consume he very vitals he call aloud and in reply a fat one-eyed woman come fetch he something to drink in a cup this he swallow with avidity and thereupon -lrb- the liquor perhaps have be drug -rrb- he drop off into unconsciousness once more when at last he emerge for a second time into the light of reason it be to find himself aboard a brig -- the _ prophet daniel _ he discover she name to be -- bind for baltimore in the america and then pitch and plunge upon a westerly run stern-sea and before a strong wind that drive the vessel with enormous velocity upon its course for those remote and unknown country for which it be bind the land be still in sight both astern and abeam but before he lay the boundless and tremendously infinite stretch of the ocean dunburne find himself still to be clothe in the one-armed shirt and tattered breeches that have adorn he in the house of the crimp in which he have first awaken now however a old tattered hat with only a part of the crown have be add to he costume as though to complete the sad disorder of he appearance he discover upon pass he hand over he countenance that he beard and hair have start a bristle growth and that the lump on he crown -- which be even yet as big as a walnut -- be still patch with piece of dirty sticking-plaster indeed have he but know it he present as miserable a appearance as the most miserable of those wretch who be daily ravish from the slum and street of the great city to be ship to the america nor be he a long time in discover that he be now one of the several such indentured servant who upon the conclusion of they voyage be to be sell for they passage in the plantation of maryland have learn so much of he miserable fate and be now able to make shift to walk -lrb- though with weak and stumbling step -rrb- we young gentleman lose no time in seek the captain to whom he endeavor to explain the several accident that have befall he acknowledge that he be the second son of the earl of clandennie and declare that if he the captain would put the _ prophet daniel _ back into some english port again he lordship would make it well worth he while to lose so much time for the sake of one so dear as a second son to this address the captain suppose he either to be drunk or disorder in he mind make no other reply than to knock he incontinently down upon the deck bidding he return forward where he belong thereafter poor dunburne find himself enjoy the reputation of a harmless madman the name of the earl of rag be bestow upon he and the miserable companion of he wretched plight be never tire of tempting he to recount he adventure for the sake of entertaining themselves by tease that which they suppose to be he hapless mania nor be it easy to conceive of all the torment that those miserable obscene wretch be able to inflict upon he under the tease sting of he companion ' malevolent pleasantry there be time when dunburne might as he confess to himself have commit a murder with the greatest satisfaction in the world however he be endowed with no small command of self-restraint so that he be still able to curb he passion within the bound of reason and of policy he be fortunately a complete master of the french and italian language so that when the fury of he irritation would become too excessive for he to control he would ease he spirit by castigate he tormentor with a consuming verbosity in those foreign tongue which have he companion understand a single word of that which he utter would have earn for he a beating that would have land he within a inch of he life however they attribute all that he say to the irrational gibbering of a maniac about midway of they voyage the _ prophet daniel _ encounter a tremendous storm which drive she so far out of the captain 's reckoning that when land be sight in the afternoon of a tempestuous day in the latter part of August the first mate who have be for some year in the new england trade opine that it be the coast of rhode island and that if the captain choose to do so he might run into new hope harbor and lie there until the southeaster have blow itself out this advice the captain immediately put into execution so that by nightfall they have drop anchor in the comparative quiet of that excellent harbor dunburne be a most excellent and practiced swimmer that evening when the dusk have pretty well fall he jump overboard dive under the brig and come up on the other side thus leave all hand aboard look for he or for he dead body at the starboard side of the _ prophet daniel _ he himself swim slowly away to the larboard now partly under water now float on he back he direct he course towards a point of land about a mile away whereon as he have observe before the dark have settle down there stand a old wooden building resemble a church and a great brick house with tall lean chimney at a little farther distance inland the intemperate cold of the water of those part of america be so much more excessive than dunburne have be use to swim in that when he drag himself out upon the rocky bowlder-strewn beach he lay for a considerable time more dead than alive he limb appear to possess hardly any vitality so benumbed be they by the icy chill that have enter into the very marrow of he bone nor do he for a long while recover from this excessive rigor he limb still continue at interval to twitch and shudder as with a convulsion nor could he at such time at all control they tremble at last however with a huge sigh he arouse himself to some perception of he surroundings which he acknowledge be of as dispirit a sort as he could well have conceive of he recover sens be distract by a ceaseless watery din for the break wave rush with a prodigious swiftness from the harbor to the shore before the drive wind fall with uproarious crash into white foam among the rock above this watery tumult spread the wet gloom of the night full of the blackness and pelt chill of a fine slanting rain through this shroud of mist and gloom dunburne at last distinguish a faint light blur by the sheet of rain and darkness and shine as though from a considerable distance cheer by this nearer presence of human life we young gentleman presently gather he benumbed power together arise and after a while begin slowly and feebly to climb a stony hill that lay between the rocky beach and that faint but encouraging illumination so sorely buffet by the tempest he at last reach the black square form of that structure from which the light shone the building he perceive to be a little wooden church of two story in height the shutter of the lower story be tight fasten as though bolt from within those above be open and from they issue the light that have guide he in he approach from the beach a tall flight of wooden step wet in the rain reach to a small enclosed porch or vestibule whence a door now tight shut give ingress into the second story of the church thence as dunburne stand without he could now distinguish the dull muttering of a man 's voice which he opine might be that of the preacher we young gentleman as may be suppose be in a wretched plight he be ragged and unshaven he only clothing be the miserable shirt and bepatched breeches that have serve he as shelter throughout the long voyage these abominable garment be now wet to the skin and so displease be he appearance that he be force to acknowledge to himself that he do not possess enough of humility to avow so great a misery to the light and to the eye of stranger accordingly find some shelter afford by the vestibule of the church he crouch there in a corner huddle he rag about he and find a certain poor warmth in thus hide away from the buffeting of the chill and penetrate wind as he so crouch he presently become aware of the sound of many voice dull and groan come from within the edifice and then -- now and again -- the clanking as of a multitude of chain then of a sudden and unexpectedly the door near he be fling wide open and a faint glow of reddish light fall across the passage instantly the figure of a man come forth and follow he come not a congregation as dunburne might have suppose but a most dolorous company of nearly or quite naked man and woman outline blackly as they emerge against the dull illumination from behind these wretched being sigh and groan most piteously with a monotonous wail of many voice be chained by the wrist two and two together and as they pass by close to dunburne he nostril be overpower by a heavy and fetid odor that come partly from within the building partly from the wretched creature that pass he by as the last of these miserable being come forth from the bowels of that dreadful place a loud voice so near to dunburne as to startle he ear with its sudden exclamation cry out six-and-twenty all tell and thereat instantly the dull light from within be quench into darkness in the gloom and the silence that follow dunburne could hear for a while nothing but the dash of the rain upon the roof and the ceaseless drip and trickle of the water run from the eaves into the puddle beneath the building then as he stand still marvel at what he have see there suddenly come a loud and startling crash as of a trap-door let fall into its place a faint circle of light shone within the darkness of the building as though from a lantern carry in a man 's hand there be a sound of jingle as of key of approach footstep and of voice talk together and presently there come out into the vestibule the dark figure of two man one of they carry a ship 's lantern one of these figure close and lock the door behind he and then both be about to turn away without have observe
